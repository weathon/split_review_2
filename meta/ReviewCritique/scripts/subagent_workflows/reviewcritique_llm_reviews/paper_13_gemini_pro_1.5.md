Summary of the Paper:

This paper investigates the feasibility of training a transformer-based language model from scratch on a single consumer GPU within one day, a challenge the authors call "Cramming."

The paper explores various modifications to the pre-training pipeline and analyzes their impact on downstream performance on the GLUE benchmark.

The authors find that while scaling down is inherently difficult due to the nature of scaling laws, certain adjustments to the architecture, training setup, and dataset can lead to models with performance approaching that of BERT.

Strengths and Weaknesses:

Strengths:

Novel and timely research question: This work challenges the dominant paradigm of scaling language models by exploring the potential of limited-compute training.

This opens up possibilities for researchers with restricted resources and facilitates investigations into aspects like interpretability and security.

Extensive experimentation: The authors systematically analyze various architectural, training, and data-related modifications, providing valuable insights into their effectiveness in the low-resource setting.

Promising results: The Crammed LM achieves surprisingly good performance on GLUE, often nearing or even surpassing BERT, despite the significant resource constraints.

Weaknesses:

Limited exploration of alternative objectives: While the paper focuses on MLM, other pre-training objectives like ELECTRA could potentially be more beneficial for cramming and warrant investigation.

Uncertainty regarding the impact of downstream corpora: The paper primarily focuses on the effect of data processing and filtering, leaving the question of whether using downstream corpora for pre-training significantly contributes to the results.

Lack of zero/few-shot evaluation: Given the paper's focus on knowledge transfer in low-resource settings, evaluating the Crammed LM on zero/few-shot tasks would provide valuable insights.

CoLA performance: The significant drop in performance on CoLA suggests potential limitations of the Crammed LM, either in terms of hyperparameter sensitivity or the ability to capture linguistic acceptability with limited training data.

Clarity, Quality, Novelty, and Reproducibility:

Clarity: The paper is generally well-written and clear, although the discussion of scaling laws could be made more accessible to a broader audience.

Quality: The research is well-motivated, and the experiments are designed and conducted rigorously.

Novelty: The research question and the specific approach are novel and contribute to the understanding of low-resource language model training.

Reproducibility: The authors provide code to reproduce the experiments, enhancing the transparency and reliability of the findings.

Summary of the Review:

This paper presents a valuable contribution to the field of NLP by exploring the potential of training language models with limited compute resources.

The Crammed LM shows promising results on GLUE, suggesting that achieving BERT-like performance with modest resources is possible.

However, further investigations are needed to address the weaknesses identified and explore the full potential of cramming language models.
