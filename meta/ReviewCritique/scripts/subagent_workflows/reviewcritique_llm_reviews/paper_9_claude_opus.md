Summary of the Paper:

This paper investigates the relationship between pre-training loss and downstream performance in language models.

The authors find that models with the same pre-training loss can exhibit different downstream performance, contrary to the common assumption that pre-training loss is well-correlated with downstream performance.

They identify three ways to produce models with the same optimal pre-training loss but different downstream performance: (1) continuing pre-training after loss convergence, (2) increasing model size, and (3) changing the training algorithm.

This suggests an implicit bias in the pre-training algorithms that selects more transferable models among those with the same minimal loss.

Theoretically, the authors prove that SGD with mini-batch noise implicitly prefers flatter minima in the pre-training loss landscape.

Empirically, they observe a strong correlation between flatness (measured by trace of Hessian) and downstream performance for models with the same minimal pre-training loss.

They also prove in a synthetic language setting that among models minimizing the pre-training loss, the flattest one transfers best to downstream tasks.

Strengths and Weaknesses:

Strengths:

- The paper challenges the common assumption about the correlation between pre-training loss and downstream performance, providing both empirical evidence and theoretical analysis.

- It identifies implicit bias as an important factor affecting the transferability of language models with the same architecture and pre-training loss.

- The authors provide theoretical results showing SGD's implicit bias towards flatter minima in language modeling, cleanly adapting tools from supervised learning.

- Empirical results on simplified datasets convincingly demonstrate the phenomenon of models with same loss but different downstream performance.

Weaknesses:

- The main limitation is that the empirical evaluation focuses on simplified datasets due to computational constraints.

It's unclear how well the results generalize to more complex real-world datasets and larger models.

- The theoretical result in the synthetic language setting has limited applicability and the assumptions may not hold in practice.

- The paper lacks experiments comparing flatness measures other than trace of Hessian.

Clarity, Quality, Novelty, and Reproducibility:

The paper is clearly written and easy to follow.

The authors provide sufficient details of the experimental setup and theoretical derivations.

The phenomenon of implicit bias affecting downstream performance is a novel finding and the theoretical analysis connecting flatness to downstream performance is original.

The empirical methodology and datasets are described in enough detail to enable reproducibility.

However, the code for the experiments is not provided which somewhat limits reproducibility.

Overall, this is a high-quality paper making novel contributions.

Summary of the Review:

This paper makes important contributions in highlighting the role of implicit bias in the transferability of language models, going beyond just the pre-training loss.

It provides convincing empirical evidence of the phenomenon and backs it up with novel theoretical analysis connecting flatness to downstream performance.

The main weakness is the focus on simplified datasets.

But overall, this is an impactful paper that advances our understanding of what makes language models adaptable to downstream tasks.
