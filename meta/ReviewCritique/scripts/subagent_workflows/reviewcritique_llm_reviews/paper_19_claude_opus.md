Summary of the Paper:

This paper proposes SaMoE, a new parameter-efficient Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture that improves MoE models by learning a soft combination of a global set of shared expert layers for each MoE layer.

The authors identify that poor gradient flow in MoE layers leads to insufficient training and parameter redundancy.

SaMoE overcomes this by introducing a fixed-size "expert pool" and expressing each MoE layer as a weighted combination of the experts in this pool.

This enables substantial parameter savings while achieving comparable or better accuracy than standard MoE training.

SaMoE is evaluated on billion-scale autoregressive language models and demonstrates significant improvements in parameter efficiency, reducing model size by up to 5.2x while obtaining superior pretraining and zero-shot generalization results.

Strengths and Weaknesses:

Strengths:

- Clearly identifies a key issue with standard MoE architectures (poor gradient flow) and provides an effective solution via the self-adaptive expert combination scheme.

- SaMoE significantly improves parameter efficiency of large MoE language models, enabling up to 5.2x parameter reduction with no loss or even gains in accuracy.

This is an important result.

- Extensive experiments on large-scale models and datasets provide convincing empirical support for the effectiveness of the method.

Ablations and comparisons to reasonable baselines are included.

- Well-written paper that clearly describes the limitations of prior MoE approaches and the key aspects of the SaMoE architecture.

Weaknesses:

- While the rationale for the self-adaptive combination is clear, it would be useful to provide some additional intuition or analysis on why this particular formulation is effective.

- Evaluation focuses on autoregressive language models. It would be interesting to see if the benefits extend to other architectures like encoder-only models as well.

Clarity, Quality, Novelty, and Reproducibility:

- The paper is clearly written and easy to follow. Key concepts are well-explained and placed in context of prior work.

- The work is high quality, with strong empirical results supporting the claimed contributions.

Ablations and comparisons provide additional evidence for the importance of the proposed components.

- The self-adaptive combination scheme is a novel contribution that hasn't been explored for MoE models before to my knowledge.

Decoupling expert parameters from model depth is a key insight.

- Sufficient implementation details (e.g.

appendix, code release) are provided to enable reproducibility.

Summary of the Review:

This paper makes an important contribution by identifying a key limitation in standard MoE architectures and proposing an effective solution via self-adaptive expert combinations in SaMoE.

The proposed approach leads to substantial improvements in parameter efficiency while maintaining or even improving model quality.

The claims are well-supported by extensive experiments and ablations.

Some additional analysis and generalization to other architectures could strengthen the work further, but overall this is a high-quality paper that represents a meaningful advance in the important problem of scaling MoE models efficiently.
