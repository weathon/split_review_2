Summary of the Paper:

This paper presents a comprehensive comparative study on continual learning (CL) performance using different combinations of pre-trained language models (PLMs) and CL methods.

The study evaluates 5 PLMs (ALBERT, BERT, GPT2, RoBERTa, XLNET) and 4 types of CL methods (experience replay, regularization-based, dynamic architecture, and hybrid) on 3 benchmarks (CLINC150, Maven, WebRED) under 2 incremental settings (task-incremental and class-incremental).

Through extensive experiments and probing analyses, the paper reveals interesting performance differences across PLMs and CL methods.

It dives into analyzing why certain PLMs (e.g. BERT) are more robust and why replay-based methods outperform regularization-based ones by examining the layer-wise characteristics of PLMs during CL.

The paper provides valuable insights and uncovers important open questions to guide future research on optimizing PLMs for CL and designing NLP-oriented CL methods.

Strengths and Weaknesses:

Strengths:

- The paper conducts a thorough empirical study covering an extensive combination of representative PLMs, CL methods, benchmark datasets and CL settings. This helps provide a comprehensive understanding of the problem.

- The layer-wise probing analyses offer an in-depth look into the idiosyncrasies of each PLM during CL, revealing useful insights on why certain PLMs and CL methods perform better.

- The observations and open questions discussed can serve as valuable guidance for future research on improving CL with PLMs and designing NLP-specific CL techniques.

Weaknesses:

- While the paper experiments with an extensive combination of models and methods, the justification for choosing those particular PLMs, CL methods and datasets could be elaborated more.

- The layer-wise probing reveals useful insights, but the underlying reasons why different layers in a PLM demonstrate different remembering/forgetting behavior remains unclear.

A more theoretical analysis here could strengthen the paper.

- More details can be provided on the practical costs (computation, memory) of applying different CL methods to the large PLMs to better inform real-world deployment.

Clarity, Quality, Novelty, and Reproducibility:

- The paper is overall well-motivated, clearly organized, and easy to follow.

- The work is of good quality, conducting extensive experiments and analyses that provide empirical and qualitative understandings.

- The focus on benchmarking CL with modern PLMs and the layer-wise analysis of PLMs during CL are novel explorations that contribute new insights to the community.

- The paper provides many details of the experimental setup. Releasing the code and datasets will further facilitate reproducibility.

Summary of the Review:

This paper tackles the important problem of understanding continual learning with pre-trained language models through comprehensive experiments and insightful analyses.

The extensive results reveal the performance differences across PLMs and CL methods, while the layer-wise probing provides a deep dive into a PLM's behavior during CL.

Despite some room for more theoretical grounding and cost analysis, the work is a valuable contribution that can guide future research on optimizing PLM-based CL.

I believe it will foster meaningful discussions and developments in the community.
