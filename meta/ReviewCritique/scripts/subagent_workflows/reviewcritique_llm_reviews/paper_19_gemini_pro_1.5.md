Summary of the Paper:

This paper proposes SaMoE, a novel architecture for Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) language models that aims to improve parameter efficiency.

SaMoE introduces a global expert pool and expresses each MoE layer as a soft combination of these global layers.

This design decouples the number of experts from the model depth, allowing for significant parameter reduction while maintaining or even improving accuracy compared to standard MoE training.

The paper also analyzes the challenges of MoE models, identifying poor gradient flow in MoE layers as a key factor contributing to parameter inefficiency.

Strengths and Weaknesses:

Strengths:

Improved parameter efficiency: SaMoE significantly reduces the number of parameters required for MoE models while achieving comparable or better accuracy than baselines.

Experiments demonstrate up to 5.2x parameter reduction with superior pre-training and zero-shot generalization results.

Novel architecture: The self-adaptive expert combination approach is a novel and effective way to share parameters across MoE layers, addressing the issue of poor gradient flow.

Extensive evaluation: The paper provides comprehensive experiments on billion-scale autoregressive MoE language models, demonstrating the effectiveness of SaMoE across different model sizes and configurations.

Open-source code: The authors commit to open-sourcing the training and evaluation code, facilitating reproducibility and further research.

Weaknesses:

Limited exploration of proxy tasks: The paper relies on a proxy task to measure the closeness to a "ground-truth prompt" during prompt search, but the definition and selection of this proxy task are not thoroughly investigated.

Some unconvincing results: Certain results, such as the reported human-written performance on some datasets, seem lower than expected and require further clarification.

Limited comparison baselines: While the paper compares SaMoE with standard MoE and PR-MoE, including more recent baselines would provide a stronger evaluation of its performance.

Clarity, Quality, Novelty, and Reproducibility:

Clarity and Quality: The paper is well-written and easy to follow, with a clear explanation of the proposed method and analysis of the challenges addressed.

Novelty: While the general idea of expert sharing is not entirely new, the specific design of SaMoE's self-adaptive expert combination is novel and shows significant improvements.

Reproducibility: The authors' commitment to open-sourcing the code strengthens the potential for reproducibility and further research on SaMoE.

Summary of the Review:

SaMoE presents a promising approach to improve the parameter efficiency of MoE language models. The proposed architecture addresses the issue of poor gradient flow in MoE layers and achieves significant parameter reduction while maintaining or improving accuracy. However, some aspects of the evaluation require further clarification and comparison with additional baselines would strengthen the assessment of its performance. Overall, SaMoE is a valuable contribution to the field of MoE language models and warrants further investigation.
