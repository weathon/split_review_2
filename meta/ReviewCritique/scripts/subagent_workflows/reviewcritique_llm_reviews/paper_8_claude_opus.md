Summary of the Paper:

This paper proposes P-Adapters, lightweight models that sit between the embedding layer and first attention layer of large language models (LLMs).

P-Adapters take the LLM embeddings of natural language prompts as input and output continuous prompts that are fed into the LLM to extract factual information.

The goal is to make the LLM's factual predictions more accurate and consistent across diverse phrasings of the input prompt.

The authors also investigate mixture of experts (MoE) models that map the prompt to a learned continuous prompt, but these require additional annotations.

Experiments on the LAMA dataset show that P-Adapters substantially improve the precision and consistency of factual extraction compared to using the natural language prompts directly.

Ablation studies demonstrate that preserving access to the LLM's original embeddings of the subject in the prompt is important for P-Adapter performance.

Strengths and Weaknesses:

Strengths:

- Addresses an important problem of extracting factual knowledge consistently from LLMs

- P-Adapters are lightweight and require no additional prompt annotations at inference time

- Substantial improvements in precision and consistency over the baseline

- Insightful ablation studies on what makes P-Adapters effective

Weaknesses:

- Overall precision is still modest, with the best models only correctly predicting 50% of facts

- Analysis of what embeddings to keep focuses on subject/object, overlooking other aspects of the prompt that could be important

- No human evaluation of the interpretability of the continuous prompts

- More complex tasks beyond factual extraction are not explored

Clarity, Quality, Novelty, and Reproducibility:

The paper is clearly written and the proposed P-Adapter approach is novel in aiming to adapt diverse natural language prompts into effective continuous prompts for factual extraction.

The experiments cover multiple out-of-distribution settings to test robustness.

Key implementation details, hyperparameters, and datasets are specified.

Code is provided to aid reproducibility.

Summary of the Review:

This paper presents P-Adapters, a novel lightweight approach to adapt natural language prompts into continuous prompts for more accurate and consistent factual extraction from LLMs.

P-Adapters demonstrate substantial improvements over baselines while requiring no additional annotations at inference time.

Insightful ablations reveal the importance of preserving access to the original subject embeddings.

While overall precision remains modest, this work is a promising step towards practical use of LLMs as knowledge bases.

The paper is clear and technically sound.
