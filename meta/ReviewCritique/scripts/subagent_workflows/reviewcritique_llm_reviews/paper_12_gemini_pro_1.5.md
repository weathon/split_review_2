Summary of the Paper:

This paper proposes THRUST, a novel metric for instance-level adaptive propulsion of external knowledge (IAPEK) in large language models (LLMs).

THRUST scores each instance based on its need for external knowledge, allowing the model to selectively utilize external knowledge only when necessary.

This approach aims to address the challenges of time-consuming knowledge retrieval and potential noise introduced by irrelevant knowledge.

The paper evaluates THRUST on a diverse benchmark of multiple-choice classification and open-domain question answering tasks, demonstrating improved cost-efficiency and performance compared to naive knowledge usage.

Strengths and Weaknesses:

Strengths:

Novelty: The concept of IAPEK and the THRUST metric are novel and address the important challenges of efficiently utilizing external knowledge in LLMs.

Motivation: The paper clearly motivates the need for IAPEK by highlighting the limitations of existing approaches that rely on indiscriminate knowledge usage.

Empirical Results: Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of THRUST in improving cost-efficiency and performance across various tasks and model sizes.

Benchmark: The paper introduces a comprehensive benchmark covering diverse tasks and knowledge sources, facilitating future research in this area.

Weaknesses:

Overclaiming: The paper's claim that the proposed model "internalizes" the task through distillation might be overstated, as it essentially boils down to improved fine-tuning.

Missing Baseline: The evaluation lacks a crucial baseline - a student model instruction-tuned without distillation.

This makes it difficult to isolate the gains specifically attributable to the distillation process.

Inconsistency in Evaluation: The selection of datasets for evaluation in some experiments appears inconsistent and lacks clear justification.

Limited Analysis of Failure Cases: While the paper acknowledges the failure case of ARC-C, a deeper analysis of why THRUST fails in such scenarios would be beneficial.

Including the missing baseline of an instruction-tuned student model without distillation is crucial to accurately assess the effectiveness of the proposed distillation method.

Providing a more detailed explanation for the selection of datasets in certain experiments would improve the clarity and consistency of the evaluation.

A deeper analysis of the failure case of ARC-C would be valuable in understanding the limitations of THRUST and potentially guiding future improvements.

Clarifying the details regarding model size, training/test data usage, and distillation on the test dataset would enhance the paper's clarity.

Overall, THRUST is a valuable contribution to the field of LLM research.

Addressing the outlined concerns and incorporating the suggested improvements would further strengthen the paper and increase its impact on the community.

Clarity, Quality, Novelty, and Reproducibility:

The paper is generally well-written and presents the core idea clearly.

However, some experimental details could be elaborated upon for better clarity.

The research quality is good, with a novel approach and extensive empirical evaluation.

The authors mention releasing code upon acceptance, which will enable reproducibility.

Summary of the Review:

THRUST presents a novel and promising approach for selectively utilizing external knowledge in LLMs.

The empirical results are encouraging, demonstrating improved cost-efficiency and performance.

However, certain aspects like overclaiming, missing baselines, and inconsistent evaluation require further attention.

Addressing these concerns and providing a deeper analysis of failure cases would strengthen the paper significantly.
