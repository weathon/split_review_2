Summary of the Paper:

This paper explores using large language models (LLMs) for HTML understanding tasks, without relying on specialized architectures or HTML-specific training.

The authors define three benchmark tasks to evaluate HTML understanding capabilities: 1) Semantic Classification of HTML elements into categories, 2) Description Generation to produce natural language descriptions of HTML snippets, and 3) Autonomous Web Navigation of HTML pages given instructions.

They fine-tune various pre-trained LLMs, including encoder-only, encoder-decoder, and decoder-only architectures, on these tasks.

Results show that LLMs, especially encoder-decoder models like T5, transfer remarkably well to HTML understanding.

Fine-tuned LLMs outperform models trained from scratch, achieving up to 192x better sample efficiency on the web navigation task.

The authors also release a large HTML dataset distilled from CommonCrawl for the description generation task.

Strengths and Weaknesses:

Strengths:

- Applying LLMs to HTML understanding is a novel and important problem with practical applications in web automation and retrieval.

This is one of the first works to systematically study this.

- The three proposed benchmark tasks capture key aspects of HTML understanding.

The tasks are well-motivated and the datasets used are suitable.

- Experimenting with a wide range of state-of-the-art LLM architectures provides useful insights into which models work best for these tasks.

- Demonstrating strong transfer from LLMs to HTML understanding tasks, without HTML-specific architectures or training, is an important finding that can spur more work in this direction.

- Open-sourcing a large automatically labeled HTML dataset from CommonCrawl is a valuable contribution to the community.

Weaknesses:

- More analysis could have been done to understand why encoder-decoder models like T5 perform best.

The bidirectional attention hypothesis is stated but not investigated in depth.

- The snippet extraction procedure for handling large HTML pages has some ad-hoc aspects.

A more principled approach to processing long HTML sequences would be good to explore.

- More discussion of the potential limitations of repurposing LLMs for HTML understanding and ideas for future improvements would have strengthened the paper.

Clarity, Quality, Novelty, and Reproducibility:

The paper is clearly written and easy to follow.

The task formulations, model architectures, datasets, and experimental methodology are all described in sufficient detail.

- The technical quality of the work is high.

The experiments are comprehensive and the results are significant.

- Applying LLMs to HTML understanding benchmarks is novel, and the strong results advance the state-of-the-art, especially on the web navigation task.

- The datasets and model details are provided, facilitating reproducibility.

Open-sourcing the CommonCrawl dataset is a big plus.

Summary of the Review:

This paper makes a valuable contribution by demonstrating the effectiveness of LLMs for HTML understanding tasks.

The strong transfer results, without requiring specialized architectures, can serve as a new baseline and open up avenues for future work.

While a few aspects could be improved, such as more analysis of architectures and snippet extraction, overall this is a high-quality paper with novel findings that advance an important research direction.

The new dataset is also a useful resource for the community.
