Summary of the Paper:

This paper introduces Proto-Trex and iProto-Trex, novel prototype-based approaches for generating explanations for Transformer language models (LMs).

Proto-Trex incorporates a prototype layer into the LM architecture, providing explanations in the form of prototypical examples similar to training samples with the corresponding label.

iProto-Trex extends this by allowing users to interactively refine the prototypes, incorporating human knowledge and improving explanation quality.

The paper evaluates these methods on sentiment classification tasks, demonstrating competitive performance with non-interpretable baselines and highlighting the benefits of interactive learning for explanation faithfulness and user trust.

Strengths and Weaknesses:

Strengths:

Novel approach: Proto-Trex offers a novel way to explain Transformer LMs by integrating prototype networks into the model architecture, moving beyond post-hoc explanations.

Interpretability: The use of prototypes provides human-understandable explanations, potentially increasing trust and reliability in LMs.

Interactive learning: iProto-Trex allows users to refine prototypes, incorporating human knowledge and potentially improving model performance and explanation quality.

Empirical evaluation: The paper provides a thorough evaluation on multiple datasets and compares Proto-Trex with various baseline models.

Weaknesses:

Trade-off with accuracy: While generally competitive, Proto-Trex sometimes shows a slight decrease in accuracy compared to non-interpretable baselines.

Limited scope: The evaluation focuses on sentiment classification tasks.

Further research is needed to assess thegeneralizability of the approach to other NLP tasks.

Word-level explanations: While the paper explores word-level prototypes, the explanations generated seem less coherent and interpretable than sentence-level ones.

Additional Comments:

It would be interesting to see how Proto-Trex performs on other NLP tasks beyond sentiment classification.

Further research could explore alternative methods for selecting and representing word-level prototypes to improve their interpretability.

Investigating the impact of different user types and expertise levels on iProto-Trex could be valuable.

Overall, this paper makes a valuable contribution to the field of interpretable NLP and offers a promising direction for future research.

Clarity, Quality, Novelty, and Reproducibility:

Clarity: The paper is generally well-written and easy to follow, although some technical details might require further clarification. Quality: The research is well-conducted, with a solid methodology and comprehensive experiments. Novelty: The use of prototype networks for explaining Transformer LMs is novel and offers a promising direction for interpretable NLP.

Reproducibility: The paper provides access to code and trained models, facilitating reproducibility and further research.

Summary of the Review:

This paper presents a novel and promising approach for generating explanations for Transformer LMs. Proto-Trex and iProto-Trex offer interpretable and potentially more trustworthy models, while remaining competitive with non-interpretable baselines. Further research is needed to explore thegeneralizability of the approach and improve word-level explanations.
