Summary of the Paper:

This paper introduces Recursion of Thought (RoT), a model-agnostic framework that enables language models to solve complex multi-step reasoning problems by recursively dividing them into smaller subproblems and solving each subproblem in a separate context.

RoT grants language models the ability to control the recursion process by introducing special tokens that trigger the creation and utilization of multiple contexts.

On arithmetic and algorithmic reasoning tasks, the authors demonstrate that RoT dramatically improves the reasoning capabilities of language models like GPT-3, allowing them to solve extremely complex problems requiring hundreds of thousands of tokens, which would exceed the maximum context size of a single context.

Moreover, RoT enables even tiny randomly initialized Transformers or LSTMs to perform complex reasoning.

Strengths and Weaknesses:

Strengths:

- RoT provides an effective and scalable approach to enable language models to perform multi-step reasoning on problems that would otherwise exceed the maximum context size.

- The idea of recursively dividing problems and solving subproblems in separate contexts is well-motivated and aligns with how humans approach complex problems through abstraction and recursion.

- The paper demonstrates the generality and effectiveness of RoT on a diverse set of arithmetic and algorithmic reasoning tasks.

- RoT leads to dramatic improvements in reasoning capabilities, not just for large pre-trained models like GPT-3, but also for small randomly initialized Transformers and LSTMs.

Weaknesses:

- RoT currently requires supervision in the form of ground truth intermediate reasoning steps for each task.

Reducing this expensive supervision could make RoT more widely applicable.

- The paper does not explore how RoT might facilitate length generalization, e.g. training on shorter problems and generalizing to longer ones.

- Some additional analysis on the limitations of RoT and failure cases could provide further insights.

Clarity, Quality, Novelty and Reproducibility:

- The paper is generally well-written and the key ideas of RoT are clearly explained.

- The extensive experiments on multiple reasoning tasks demonstrate the effectiveness and versatility of the proposed approach.

The results convincingly show that RoT leads to significant improvements in reasoning capabilities.

- Recursively combining language models with multiple contexts for reasoning is a novel paradigm that addresses a key limitation of existing approaches constrained by a single context length.

- The authors plan to release source code which would facilitate reproducibility.

Some of the experimental details could be elaborated further.

Summary of the Review:

This paper makes a significant contribution by introducing Recursion of Thought (RoT), a novel framework that enables language models to perform complex multi-step reasoning by recursively dividing problems and utilizing multiple contexts.

RoT dramatically improves the reasoning capabilities of language models and allows them to solve problems that are infeasible with a single context.

The experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of RoT on a range of arithmetic and algorithmic reasoning tasks.

Overall, this is a high-quality paper that proposes a novel and impactful approach to language model reasoning.

The key limitation is the need for expensive supervision which could be a useful direction for future work.
