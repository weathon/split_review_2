## Abstract
Normalising Flows are non-parametric statistical models characterised by their dual capabilities of density estimation and generation. This duality requires an inherently invertible architecture. However, the requirement of invertibility imposes constraints on their expressiveness, necessitating a large number of parameters and innovative architectural designs to achieve good results. Whilst flow-based models predominantly rely on neural-network-based transformations for expressive designs, alternative transformation methods have received limited attention. In this work, we present Ferumal flow, a novel kernelised normalising flow paradigm that integrates kernels into the framework. Our results demonstrate that a kernelised flow can yield competitive or superior results compared to neural network-based flows whilst maintaining parameter efficiency.
Kernelised flows excel especially in the low-data regime, enabling flexible non-parametric density estimation in applications with sparse data availability.

### Summary
The authors introduce their research, which aims to enhance traditional normalized flow generative models. These models typically employ neural-network-based transformations to map simple prior distributions to more complex, invertible distributions for density estimation and data generation. In their study, the authors concentrate on integrating various kernels into flow-based generative models. Their goal is to accommodate smaller datasets, reduce the number of parameters (improve parameter efficiency), and lower computational costs, all while maintaining model expressiveness. The authors propose a novel method called "Ferumal flows," which extends popular coupling layer architectures such as RealNVP (Real Non-Volume Preserving) and Glow (Generative Latent Optimization) by incorporating widely-used kernels, including the Squared Exponential and Matérn kernels.

### Strengths
I commend the authors for their dedicated focus on tackling the challenge of low-data scenarios in generative modeling. Furthermore, I value their efforts in quantifying the improvements brought about by their proposed architectures, particularly in terms of reducing computational demands for hyperparameter tuning and training convergence compared to other approaches.

### Weaknesses
It would have been beneficial if the authors had provided links to a repository containing their code and models for improved accessibility and reproducibility. Additionally, given the authors' initial reference to the potential application of their models in the medical field, it would have been valuable to include an evaluation of their models' performance on a medical dataset to demonstrate their practical applicability and potential benefits in that specific domain.

### Questions
In your introduction, you alluded to the potential application of your models in the medical field. Why did you choose not to evaluate your models on a medical dataset as part of your research?

Many researchers and practitioners might find value in accessing your code and models for further exploration and application. Could you please share your considerations regarding the possibility of providing links or access to your code and models in the future, and if so, where could interested parties expect to find them?

### Summary
In the paper, the authors introduce a kernelized normalizing flow paradigm that integrates kernels into the classical normalizing framework. The authors introduced theoretical fundamentals and presented results on relatively small datasets.

### Strengths
1. The paper introduce interesting concept in classical flow model
2. The paper has good theoretical fundaments.

### Weaknesses
1. In Fig 1, authors should add results from more methods, like FFJORD 
2. How does the model work on a spiral 2D dataset?

### Summary
This work focuses on developing normalizing flow-based approaches for cases where we have limited number of samples from the data distribution. Instead of neural network based transformations in coupling layers, the proposed method relies on kernel based transformations to reduce the number of samples required for convergence. The proposed approach slows promising results on 2D synthetic data and five real-world tabular benchmark datasets.

### Strengths
The proposed approach is novel and interesting. The paper correctly claims that normalizing flows which employ neural network based coupling layers are data and parameter hungry. The proposed kernel based approach in contrast is data and parameter efficient.

·         The results in Table 3 show that the proposed approach shines in the low data regime. It clearly outperforms FFJORD and obtains impressive results even when only 500 data samples are available.

·         The paper is well written and theoretically well founded. Proposition 3.1 is especially interesting as it states that the model  complexity of the proposed approach scales with naturally with the dataset size. This shows that the proposed approach is not over-parametrized like neural network based approaches and thus should be more suitable for the low-data regime.

### Weaknesses
·         Methods like FFJORD (\cf Figure 2 in FFJORD) report better results compared to the proposed approach (as shown in Table 1). The performance advantage of FFJORD is even more apparent in case of the challenging discontinuous checkerboard dataset in Figure 3 (supplementary). It is not clear if the proposed model has the modelling capacity to capture complex distributions. Specifically, the checkerboard dataset requires the model to capture sharp discontinuities, and the results suggest that the proposed kernel-based approach may struggle with such features compared to neural network-based approaches like FFJORD, which are designed to approximate arbitrary functions. The lack of clear performance on such a challenging dataset raises concerns about the general applicability of the method to complex, multimodal distributions.

·         The proposed method is outperformed significantly by FFJORD, although FFJORD uses more parameters as reported in Table 4. Can the performance of the proposed method be improved in Table 4 by increasing the number of parameters? It is unclear if the kernel-based approach can achieve comparable performance with increased model capacity, or if the performance gap is due to fundamental limitations of the kernel-based approach. The paper should explore whether simply adding more kernel basis functions or increasing the dimensionality of the kernel feature space can close the performance gap with FFJORD.

·         For the experiments on the 2D toy datasets in Table 1, it is not clear which NN based approach is employed. Furthermore, the number of data samples used for training for all models in Table 1 should also be reported. This lack of detail makes it difficult to assess the validity of the comparison. It is important to know the specific architecture of the neural network used as a baseline, as different architectures can have varying performance characteristics. The number of training samples is also crucial, as it directly impacts the performance of both neural network and kernel-based methods.

·         The method is motivated by alluding to medical settings in Section 1 and 5.4, where data availability is often limited. However, the method is never applied to any medical data. This limits the practical relevance of the method to the motivating application. The paper should include experiments on real-world medical datasets to demonstrate the applicability of the method to the intended use case.

·         Finally, it not clear if the proposed model can be applied to complex data distributions such as images. The qualitative examples of samples generated by the proposed model trained on the Kuzushiji-MNIST dataset as shown in Figure 4-6 are not promising. The visual quality of the generated samples is poor, suggesting that the proposed method may not be suitable for high-dimensional data with complex structures. The paper should provide a more thorough evaluation of the method on image datasets, including quantitative metrics and comparisons with state-of-the-art methods.

### Questions
The paper should include a more detailed comparison with FFJORD  especially in case of 2D synthetic datasets such as the discontinuous checkerboard dataset.

·         The paper should discuss in more detail if the performance of the proposed approach can be further boosted by scaling the number of parameters.

·         The paper should discuss in more detail if the proposed approach is applicable to complex datasets such as images.

### Summary
Update after rebuttal:
I thank the authors for their response. The clarifications around the representer theorem and tabular / non image data were helpful. I encourage the authors to include the promised changes in their updated manuscript. I read the other reviews and rebuttal and do not see the negative points raised as a significant reason to reject this paper. I have raised my score to an 8.


Normalising flows are probabilistic machine learning models that are capable of jointly solving the task of density estimation and generative modelling (sampling). Unfortunately, since they are parameterised in terms of a pushforward and their log-likelihood is determined using a change-of-variables formula involving a Jacobian, the mappings involved must be invertible, and are often even more constrained (e.g. through coupling layers). Invertibility imposes a big constraint on the model, meaning that the only lever one may pull to obtain expressiveness is often the depth and overparameterisation of the neural network. This results in data-hungriness, and makes them highly unsuitable for modelling tabular and low-dimensional data.

The authors introduce a kernelised version of normalising flows, which are suitable for modelling low-dimensional and tabular data. Efficacy is demonstrated on a set of benchmark datasets.

### Strengths
- The paper ideas presented in this paper are conceptually simple and do not require a strong leap-of-faith on the reader's end.
- The mathematical idea (a representer theorem) appears to be mostly sound. 
- The experiments on tabular / low dimensional data are convincing and demonstrate the appeal of the method. A suitable benchmark is considered.
- The paper is well-written. Text, equations, tables and figures are appropriately laid out and given the right amount of real-estate.

### Weaknesses
 - I believe the following statement, after the proof of Proposition 3.1, is misleading (or possibly even incorrect): "Note that, in contrast to the classical representer theorem, since the objective doesn’t contain a strictly convex regularisation term that penalises the model complexity, the solution is not necessarily unique". I believe the authors might be referring to Theorem 1 of Scholkopf et al. 2001. In this classical representer theorem, the objective need not be convex, nor does the regularisation term need to be complex, nor does the solution need to be unique, nor does a convex regularisation term even necessarily enforce that the solution is unique (or, more weakly, that the objective is convex). The theorem simply says that any minimiser (if it exists), must be a finite linear combination of the kernel evaluations. It is true that in many typical applications of the representer theorem (e.g. kernel ridge regression, L2 penalised kernel logistic regression), the loss is strictly convex and the regularisation is strongly convex so the overall objective is strongly convex. However more generally, the theorem applies to non-convex objectives.
- "This makes kernelised flows especially promising for learning in the low-data regime, as their model complexity naturally scales with dataset size and does not over-parametrise as much as neural networks", however there remains the previously mentioned caveat that the number of layers L is still a hyperparameter and increases model complexity. One can still over-parameterise with increasing L, or am I wrong?

### Questions
Could the authors please clarify the weaknesses mentioned above? Specifically:
- Is the discussion around the representer theorem accurate?
- Can the model be overparameterised by increasing L, and how does this fit into the discussion around suitability of non-overparameterised/data hungry models for tabular / low dimensional data regimes?

Additional questions (neither strengths nor weaknesses)
- I missed why the method is called "Ferumal". Can the authors quickly explain (apologies if this is mentioned somewhere already in the paper)?
- Is there any method of constraining the support of the distribution (e.g. to lie on the simplex or some other set)? Perhaps this is as simple as constraining the support of the base distribution p_Z?
- "Our study highlighted that Ferumal flows exhibit faster convergence rates, thanks to the inductive biases imparted by data-dependent initialisation and parameter efficiency." I missed where the authors talked about data-dependent initialisation. Is this because the kernel matrix is seen as a parameter, which is initialised directly from the data, and then the auxiliary points are learned?
- Future work. Is there a possibility to use deep kernel learning to learn the kernel as well? Would this be possible under MLE / MAP estimation, or is another objective required?
- Future work. Can these be trained in a Bayesian manner? If the ELBO is used as an objective, can the representer theorem still be applied?
- Open question: When is density estimation/sample generation of tabular data of practical concern in a machine learning context? I can see how sample generation is particularly interesting for high dimensional structured data (e.g. images). 


Related works:
The authors might like to mention the more recent related literature of kernel methods for nonnegative functions as a way of building kernel-based probability density functions, which are also applicable and demonstrated in low dimensional / tabular data regimes, as well as their related neural-network based models through the NNGP. These also do not require invertibility. For example:
