## Abstract
Diffusion models have recently received increasing research attention for their remarkable transfer abilities in semantic segmentation tasks. However, generating fine-grained segmentation masks with diffusion models often requires additional training on annotated datasets, leaving it unclear to what extent pre-trained diffusion models alone understand the semantic relations of their generated images. %
To address this question, we leverage the semantic knowledge extracted from Stable Diffusion (SD) and aim to develop an image segmentor capable of generating fine-grained segmentation maps without any additional training.
The primary difficulty stems from the fact that semantically meaningful feature maps typically exist only in the spatially lower-dimensional layers, which poses a challenge in directly extracting pixel-level semantic relations from these feature maps.  %
To overcome this issue, our framework identifies semantic correspondences between image pixels and spatial locations of low-dimensional feature maps by exploiting SD's generation process and utilizes them for constructing image-resolution segmentation maps.
In extensive experiments, the produced segmentation maps are demonstrated to be well delineated and capture detailed parts of the images, indicating the existence of highly accurate pixel-level semantic knowledge in diffusion models. \textit{Project page: }\url{https://kmcode1.io/Projects/EmerDiff/}

### Confidence
4: You are confident in your assessment, but not absolutely certain. It is unlikely, but not impossible, that you did not understand some parts of the submission or that you are unfamiliar with some pieces of related work.

### Summary
This paper leverages pre-trained stable diffusion to achieve unsupervised semantic segmentation and annotation-free open-vocabulary semantic segmentation. The core idea is based on the observation that changing the values of a sub-region of low-resolution feature maps triggers the notable value changes of values in semantically related regions of the generated images. The  overall idea is interesting and reasonable.

### Strengths
- The proposed idea of exploring semantic knowledge extracted from Stable Diffusion (SD) and building an image segmentor is novel and interesting.
- The finding about the changes in sub-region of low-resolution feature maps and significant changes of semantically related pixels in generated images of stable diffusion model is interesting. 
- The experimental results are convincing.

### Weaknesses
 - Since one needs to change the values of every sub-region of low-resolution feature maps and examine the changes in the corresponding generated images, the whole process may take much time.


### Questions
Is there a more elegant way to establish the correspondence between the semantically related pixels and the sub-region in low-resolution feature maps. The current way of changing the the values in every sub-region of low-resolution feature maps and examining the changes in generated images works, but requires much time (I think).

### Summary
The paper introduces a new method to extract semantic segmentation maps for images with the help of the pre-trained Stable Diffusion model. Given an image, the proposed approach embeds it into a time step $x_t$, passes to the respective UNet, collects features at an upward 16x16 layer, and performs k-means clustering. To obtain the final segmentation at resolution 512x512, the method studies how much the final pixel values depend on different masked 16x16 feature areas. In effect, the proposed approach can provide pixel-level k-class segmentation maps for each provided image, without requiring any training or text prompts. The experiments demonstrate that the proposed method achieves good performance on the tasks of unsupervised semantic segmentation and annotation-free open-vocabulary semantic segmentation.

### Strengths
- The paper finds good use of powerful T2I diffusion models for segmentation tasks. While there exist previous methods extracting segmentation masks via latent spaces of DMs, applying them to the class of latent diffusions was not obvious due to the mismatch in resolutions. The paper proposes an adequate solution.
- The paper demonstrates impressive results. The proposed method segments images into K classes, and the pixels belonging to the same objects tend to fall within same segments.
- The method does not require re-training the DM, test-time optimisation, or text prompts. It can be applied to images of diverse datasets rather straightforwardly. 
- The method shows impressive results when applied to downstream applications like unsupervised segmentation.

### Weaknesses
 - The proposed method is not too novel in terms of the main idea. Transforming internal UNet feature representations into segmentation maps via K-means was explored in prior work (e.g., Baranchuk et al, Fig 4), although perhaps not in the context of Stable Diffusion. The modification to make it work with SD (Sec. 3.3) makes sense and works, but is not particularly educating or insightful, to my opinion.
- Overall, the inventive step of the method is strongly tailored for the family of Stable Diffusion models. Although this makes sense as many state-of-the-art DMs belong to this family, the method still may become not so much applicable in case of other types of DMs.
- [Xu et al, CVPR23] noted that using pre-trained SD with zero text input is suboptimal for feature extraction. Did the authors observe any suboptimalities in using zero text line as inputs, or did they experiment with providing textual descriptions to the model?

### Summary
This paper presents an approach to leverage diffusion models to produce image segmentation maps without additional supervision. The authors first cluster low-resolution feature map which is believed to contain semantic information into a set of masks. To produce high-resolution segmentation, the authors find a region in the image space that is highly correlated to each mask of the set. The process is called modulated denoising process. The experimental results are comprehensive to demonstrate the ability of the proposed method to produce segmentation maps of given images.

### Strengths
1. The paper introduces an approach for generating segmentation maps by leveraging semantic knowledge extracted from diffusion models. This approach does not require additional annotations.
2. The proposed framework is extensively evaluated on multiple scene-centric datasets, including COCO-Stuff, PASCAL-Context, ADE20K, and Cityscapes. The qualitative and quantitative results demonstrate the method's effectiveness in producing segmentation maps.
3. The paper provides qualitative examples of failure cases.
4. The paper is well-written.

### Weaknesses
1. This approach using many sensitive hyper-parameters, which is need to be tuned very carefully for each dataset. It is not easy for large dataset and we don't have a validation set. The lack of a clear strategy for hyperparameter selection, especially regarding the number of clusters in k-means and the modulation timesteps, makes the method's reproducibility and generalizability questionable. The authors should provide a more detailed analysis of how these parameters affect performance across different datasets.
2. Although the paper shows the ablation study for choosing some hyper-parameters, it stills lacks some others such as the level of cross-attention layer for low-resolution feature map, modulating timestep (should have quantitative numbers). The choice of cross-attention layer is crucial, and the paper should include a more thorough analysis of how different layers impact the quality of the segmentation masks. Furthermore, the lack of quantitative data for the modulating timestep makes it difficult to assess the robustness of the method.
3. The resulting segmentation seems to be over-segmented (Fig. 1), sometimes just like superpixels, still need semantic segmentation labels to align and group these over-segmentation regions to have meaningful masks, it is different from SAM. The over-segmentation issue is significant, and the paper needs to address how these fragmented masks can be effectively grouped into meaningful semantic regions without relying on external labels. The current approach appears to produce superpixel-like outputs, which limits its practical applicability.
4. The modulated denoising process seems to be slow since it has to go through all steps of UNet and decoder of VAE to get the corresponding mask in high-resolution image for each mask. The computational cost of the modulated denoising process is a major drawback, as it requires multiple passes through the UNet and VAE decoder, making it impractical for real-time applications or large-scale datasets. A more efficient approach is needed to make the method viable.

### Questions
1. Can the authors provide comparisons of the runtime between different methods in Table 2?
2. Is it possible to use this method for synthesizing semantic segmentation datasets to train a semantic segmenter?

### Summary
Diffusion models are being studied for their ability to perform semantic segmentation tasks. However, previous works relied on additional supervision to produce fine-grained segmentation maps. The authors of this study utilized semantic knowledge extracted from Stable Diffusion (SD) to build an image segmentor that can generate fine-grained segmentation maps without additional training. The study overcomes the challenge of identifying semantic correspondences between image pixels and spatial locations of low-dimensional feature maps by analyzing SD's generation process. The produced segmentation maps were well delineated and captured detailed parts of the images, indicating highly accurate pixel-level semantic knowledge in diffusion models.

### Strengths
A well-written paper with interesting ideas! Actually, I am not very familiar with this topic. So, I can only make some moderate comments.

### Weaknesses
1. While we would love to unlock the perception of SD, I find this article's approach to be inelegant and not performing well.
2. Some of the existing solutions also have no comparison at all (such as INSTRUCTCV).
