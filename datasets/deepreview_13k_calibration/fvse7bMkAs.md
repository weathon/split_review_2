## Abstract
We propose a distributional framework for assessing socio-technical risks of foundation models with quantified statistical significance. Our approach hinges on a new statistical relative testing  based on first and second order stochastic dominance of real random variables. We show that the second order statistics in this test are linked to mean-risk models commonly used in econometrics and mathematical finance to balance risk and utility when choosing between alternatives. Using this framework, we formally develop a risk-aware approach for foundation model selection given guardrails quantified by specified metrics. Inspired by portfolio optimization and selection theory in mathematical finance, we define a metrics portfolio for each model as a means to aggregate a collection of metrics, and perform model selection based on the stochastic dominance of these portfolios. The statistical significance of our tests is backed theoretically by an  asymptotic analysis via central limit theorems instantiated in practice via  a bootstrap variance estimate. 
We use our framework to compare various large language models regarding risks related to drifting from instructions and outputting toxic content.

### Summary
In a context where the random variables X and Y stand for the performance of two different models A and B respectively on a given metric, second order stochastic dominance (SSD) of X on Y implies that model A would be preferred over B by a risk-averse agent; i.e. one that prefers the lower-variability outcome given same expected performance/utility. Observing the desirability of such a comparison for evaluating machine learning models (esp. those likely to have large exposure to end users, such as language models), the current paper improves upon previous results from the econometrics literature to develop a statistical significance test for almost second order stochastic dominance (SSD) between random variables, as well as a variant of this test for comparing multiple random variables. They combine this test with a simple rank aggregation scheme, and a weighted geometric mean of different metrics (called metrics portfolio) to produce a ranking among a number of models, tested on the said metrics. They compare their method to other methods for ranking language models.

### Strengths
- The paper's topic of choice is timely: expanding on the available toolbox for quantifying and/or comparing the risks of multiple machine learning models, evaluated on multiple metrics is important in a context where foundation models are deployed in an unprecedented speed in various domains.
- The paper aptly utilizes previous results from econometrics literature, and expands succinctly on the said results when necessary, to produce statistical significance tests for SSD, which allows taking the variability of the model's performance into account in addition to expected performance when comparing.
- The writing is usually clear and easy to follow, and the paper concisely communicates various decision theoretic notions that are central to the present framework.

### Weaknesses
 - How well the technical details of the paper's proposed methodology are communicated varies throughout the paper. Some central details are hard to decipher, in a way that hinders a complete understanding of the methodology. Please see the comments in the next section.
- There are long stretches where the text reads like it is from an econometrics paper, with the lack of emphasis on how the introduced concepts will be relevant for model comparison distracting from the main contributions of the paper. I recommend being more sensitive to the conference audiences' background, and frequently reminding the reader how a concept or result will help resolve an important sub/problem in the overall model comparison. See the first sentence of my summary of the paper for a simple example of an arguably more accessible framing.
- In the experiments, the paper's results with SSD almost perfectly line up with those obtained by using previously known mean-risk models: I believe that how exactly the current methodology improves upon these simple and useful models is not sufficiently discussed.

### Questions
- How the existing tests are applied pairwise and then combined to achieve multi-testing should be described and discussed in more detail (this applies to main paper and Appendix A.) I recommend:
  - Expanding the end of Section 3 to include further details of how the pairwise statistical tests are combined to produce the full ranking with a confidence of $1-\alpha$.
  - Expanding Appendix A to include a high-level description of Algorithm 1.
- What are the justifications for portfolio-based vs. per metric ranking of models?
- Why is $\lambda$ is not used (instead of uniform weighting) for rank aggregation between metrics in the latter method?
- What multi-way aggregation method is used after per metric ranking?
- How should $\epsilon$ be chosen? Why?
- Could the authors' methodology be extended to apply to metrics that are not continuous? (e.g. binary accuracy, human annotator ranking)

### Summary
The paper deals with an interesting and relevant problem of risk assessment in foundation models. In particular, an approach from econometrics and finance is borrowed and extended to the problem at hand. This approach is based on the idea of mean-risk models, which are consistent with the second-degree stochastic dominance relation. The general idea behind mean-risk models is that there should be a balance between the expected return (mean) and associated risk. In the paper this idea is applied in the context of risk to generate toxic/harmful content.

Update after revision: I have increased my score after the reply from the authors. I believe the paper has improved, but the clarity is not sufficient yet for publication. Considering that I am not closely familiar with the portfolio risk evaluation methods presented in the paper, I do not feel I can judge the contribution with enough confidence. Hence, I also lowered my confidence score.

### Strengths
The general idea behind applying financial mathematics methods is interesting in the context of the problem addressed in the paper. With the rising number of various foundation models, it becomes increasingly important to construct robust evaluation approaches related to the risk of toxic/harmful content.

### Weaknesses
The connection between mathematical theory and the applied problem at hand is not emphasised enough. The transition between theoretical sections and experiments is somewhat abrupt. Simulation experiments validating statistical significance do not reflect real data experiments. Overall, I believe the paper can benefit from more clarity on the connection between the theory and the applied problem, a more realistic validation study on the simulated data and a much more explicit discussion of the failure modes of the methods (which assumptions need to be satisfied for the method to be theoretically justified and whether one indeed can check if these assumptions are satisfied in practice).

In section 5.1 the approach – in particular, the validation of statistical significance – is validated on an example with two Gaussian random variables. I cannot quite connect this to the “more realistic” experiments later on. The fact that this works for two Gaussian random variables does not necessarily imply that it works in a similar way for more complex experiments.

The point above is also related to the underlying assumptions of the method. It is not uncommon to assume in some mean-risk models underlying Gaussian distribution. However, many attempts have been made to relax this assumption in finance since it is deemed to be unrealistic. How essential is it for the problem at hand?

What other assumptions need to hold for the method to have theoretical validity? How can one check if these assumptions indeed hold before applying the proposed method?

A lot of results are mixed and are presented in the appendix, even if described in the main text. I believe the paper could use restructuring to highlight the most relevant results and theory in the main text.

### Summary
This paper proposes a framework to evaluate and compare complex "foundation" models with quantified statistical significance. The proposed methodology has analogies with portfolio selection and optimization under risk aversion. First, an overview of the notion of stochastic dominance is performed, in terms of cumulative distribution and quantile functions. This involves covering relaxations of stochastic dominance and introducing the notion of relative dominance. Afterwards, asymptotically normal test statistics are derived to test for stochastic dominance and relative stochastic dominance. Finally, the presented methods are applied to assessing distributional risk in foundation models. The key idea here is to evaluate the model on multiple tasks that each output some sort of metric of interest, and then to pool together a "portfolio" of metrics, finally comparing the models by comparing their portfolios using the tests proposed in the paper. The method is then tested on some complex real-world models.

### Strengths
Nice and well-thought out application of formal statistical methodology to the context of complex generative models. I enjoyed reading the exposition on stochastic dominance, I found it clearly written and developed from scratch. The paper itself falls well into the general literature on using statistical testing to evaluate the output and/or performance of complex models. I also liked the idea of using a portfolio of metrics, this seems like a good way to aggregate the different metrics while being able to assign weights representing their importance to them.

### Weaknesses
For the novice, more intuition on the notion of *relative* stochastic dominance would be useful. Are there any conditions on defining the thresholds on the pairs of violations ratios, epsilon_ij?

I found the evaluation protocol and baselines section to be a bit too condensed. The way I am guessing the comparisons are done in the paper is to perform pairwise comparisons of all models, and then use the outcomes of the pairwise comparisons to produce a ranking?

Is there a way to account for the possible correlations between the different metrics? The way the portfolio is constructed now does not seem to account for this, as it just takes a geometric average of the individual CDF's?

### Questions
How does one choose the lambda_i's in (17)? 

Is there a way to account for the possible correlations between the different metrics? The way the portfolio is constructed now does not seem to account for this, as it just takes a geometric average of the individual CDF's?

### Summary
This paper proposed new evaluation metrics for comparing LLMs from two perspectives: (1) statistically robust risk assessment and (2) aggregation of multi-dimensional metrics. For the first part, the paper proposes R-SSD to estimate the difference of conditional value at risk (CVaR, Eq. (5)) confidently via relative pairwise testing. Then, for the second part, the paper proposes to use the weighted geometric mean as a "portfolio selection metric" inspired by portfolio optimization literature in finance. Finally, the paper conduct benchmark experiment of various LLMs using the proposed metric.

### Strengths
1. **The high-level motivation for doing a risk-aware evaluation of LLMs is well-described.** Evaluating the ability of LLMs is a very important topic nowadays, and having a risk-aware evaluation would indeed be useful.
2. **The paper benchmarks various SOTA LLMs.** The LLMs benchmarked by the proposed metrics includes various SOTA models, and doing a comprehensive benchmark experiment can be beneficial for the community.

### Weaknesses
1. **The main contribution of this paper is not very clear.** I have an impression that this paper discusses two independent topics in a paper. The first topic is the statistical robustness of risk assessment, and the second is how to balance tradeoffs among various metrics to compare LLMs. Though I admire that both of them have some motivation to work on, the issues of existing work in each topic are not clearly pointed out, and as discussed in the following Weakness 2, the paper fails to provide sufficient empirical analysis to compare the proposed method in both topics. Since the connection of two topics is also not very clear, I would suggest that splitting the paper into two might be useful.
2. **No quantitative or qualitative assessment criteria are given to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed evaluation method.** In my understanding, this paper proposes a new, statistically robust risk-assessment metric to compare two (multi-variate) probability distributions. However, the paper lacks an empirical demonstration of how the proposed method overcomes the issues of existing metrics. Given the focus of this paper, just applying the proposed metric to evaluate various LLMs is not enough. In addition, for the portfolio selection part, the paper should investigate if the proposed metric aligns with human preference more than other existing metrics to demonstrate the benefit of the proposed method.
3. **The manuscript is hard to follow.** The paper sometimes lacks explanations of theorems or motivations to introduce theorems. This makes understanding the main contribution of this paper quite challenging. In particular, the four points I mentioned in Questions were hard to understand from the manuscript.

### Questions
**Questions**
1. Isn't Eq. (4) the definition of conditional value at risk (CVaR)? (because it seems that (4) takes expectation of the quartile value under p% quartile). Then, deriving (4) seems straightforward, and I couldn't understand why the complex theory is needed for SSD. The manuscript should provide more explicit motivation for the theoretical analysis.

2. Are (1) and (2) always be equivalent? Similarly, are (3) and (5) always equivalent? In my understanding, (1) measures the cumulative probability of observing performance less than $\eta$, and (2) measures the $p$% quartile. It is not clear if (1) is always equivalent to (2) because they are measuring different quantities (though the statement may be true under some specific conditions about $\eta$ and $p$). Similarly, (3) measures the area under the CDF, while (5) measures CVaR. If the paper claims that (1) and (2) (or (3) and (5)) are equivalent, either citation or proofs should be included about this part.

3. What does the paper mean by "Note that FSD implies SSD, hence SSD is a finer notion of dominance"? Does it mean that FSD is a special case of SSD?

4. What is the intuitive understanding of $\epsilon$-FSD? Does it mean the probability that $X$ is preferred to $Y$ under the FSD criteria?

**Other minor things (typos)**
- page 4: period (.) is needed right before Eq. (7).
- page 8: 0,25 -> 0.25  (period (.) instead of comma (,))

### Summary
The paper introduces a novel framework for assessing the socio-technical risks associated with foundation models, particularly large language models (LLMs), while providing a quantified measure of statistical significance. The framework relies on statistical tests based on first and second-order stochastic dominance, which are commonly used in economics and finance to balance risk and utility when making decisions.

The central idea is to evaluate LLMs across various metrics to assess risks, such as drifting from instructions and generating toxic content. The authors emphasize that these evaluations should encompass a wide range of tasks and domains. They cite several benchmark datasets and metrics, both automatic and human-based, commonly used for evaluating LLMs in various areas, such as chatbot performance and knowledge assessment.

The paper introduces second-order stochastic dominance (SSD) into the evaluation of LLMs, which the authors claim provides a more nuanced assessment of risk compared to traditional metrics like standard deviation.

The paper outlines the statistical tests for assessing almost and relative stochastic dominance and their theoretical underpinnings. They highlight the importance of central limit theorems and bootstrapping in estimating the statistical significance of these tests.

### Strengths
- The paper introduces a potential method for comparing LLMs, a relatively new and unsolved problem.
- The authors introduce a new asymptotic statistical test for a notion of stochastic ordering called relative stochastic dominance.

### Weaknesses
 - The paper could be more clear on what it's main contribution is supposed to be. Is it "relative stochastic dominance" as a concept, the application of it to LLMs, the formulation of an asymptotic test statistic?

 - The paper does not adequately address the stability of relative stochastic dominance with respect to the inclusion of new stochastic variables. The reviewer's question about whether adding a new variable X_3 could flip the order of X_1 and X_2 is a critical one that requires a more thorough treatment. The paper should provide a more formal analysis of the conditions under which such order reversals can occur and what this implies for the practical use of the method.

 - Table 2 presents a significant challenge to the paper's core argument. If mean-risk models (MRM) yield virtually equivalent rankings to relative SSD, and are easier to understand, the justification for using relative SSD becomes weak. The paper needs to provide a more compelling reason for why relative SSD should be preferred over MRM, especially given the added complexity of the former. The argument that relative SSD is a global statistic is not sufficient, as many MRM can also be designed to be global. The claim that MRM requires a hyperparameter choice is also not a strong argument, as the choice of the confidence level in relative SSD is also a form of hyperparameter selection.

### Questions
- Is relative stochastic dominance stable with respect to the sets of stochastic variables involved? I.e. if I have two variables X_1 > X_2, and I add a new variable X_3, could I have X_3 > X_2 > X_1?
- Table 2 appears to suggest that mean-risk models give virtually equivalent rankings to relative SSD, yet are easier to understand. Why should one use relative SSD instead then?
- What aspect of your method is specific to LLMs as opposed to general model comparison along multiple dimensions?

### Summary
This paper studies the assumption-less assessment of multiple models. The measures for comparison 
are based on first and second-order stochastic dominance of real random variables. The authors further 
provide an estimation scheme for the measures of interest, and complement the method with CLT-type theories. 
The proposed method is used for comparing multiple large language models in several risk measures.

### Strengths
1. As promoted in the paper, with the rapid development of foundation models, there is a 
lack of statistical significance testing---in this regard, the paper indeed investigates an interesting and important problem, and 
provides a working solution.

2. I also find it valuable that the paper brings concepts from other fields, e.g., mathematical finance, to 
task of model comparison.

### Weaknesses
1. I think more discussion on the motivation/interpretability of the proposed measures is needed. For example, why is R-SSD a relevant and interpretable measure for comparing two language models and why would metrics portfolio be a reasonable way to combine different metrics? 

2. Although there are CLT results for the estimators, the validity of the statistical test is lacking --- in particular, 
the validity of the Bootstrap approximation. The CLT result is not sufficient for the validity of the 
test since the limiting distribution contains the unknown variance term; does Bootstrap approximation solve this problem? A theory is needed. 
(Please correct me if I missed anything.)
