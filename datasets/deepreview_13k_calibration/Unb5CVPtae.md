## Abstract
\vspace{-2mm}
Time series forecasting holds significant importance in many real-world dynamic systems and has been extensively studied. Unlike natural language process (NLP) and computer vision (CV), where a single large model can tackle multiple tasks, models for time series forecasting are often specialized, necessitating distinct designs for different tasks and applications. While pre-trained foundation models have made impressive strides in NLP and CV, their development in time series domains has been constrained by data sparsity. Recent studies have revealed that large language models (LLMs) possess robust pattern recognition and reasoning abilities over complex sequences of tokens. However, the challenge remains in effectively aligning the modalities of time series data and natural language to leverage these capabilities. In this work, we present \method, a reprogramming framework to repurpose LLMs for general time series forecasting with the backbone language models kept intact. We begin by reprogramming the input time series with text prototypes before feeding it into the frozen LLM to align the two modalities. To augment the LLM's ability to reason with time series data, we propose Prompt-as-Prefix (PaP), which enriches the input context and directs the transformation of reprogrammed input patches. The transformed time series patches from the LLM are finally projected to obtain the forecasts. Our comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that \method is a powerful time series learner that outperforms state-of-the-art, specialized forecasting models. Moreover, \method excels in both few-shot and zero-shot learning scenarios

### Summary
This paper proposes the use of pre-trained large language models for time series prediction. As claimed, the main contributions of the paper include introducing a novel concept of reprogramming large language models and augmenting the input context with declarative prompts, such as domain expert knowledge and task instructions, to guide LLM reasoning.

### Strengths
- This paper provides a summary of the metrics for pre-trained large-language models, including generalizability, data efficiency, reasoning, and multimodal knowledge.
- The details of the proposed method are presented clearly and are easy to follow.

### Weaknesses
My main concerns include: 
- While LLM is a hot topic in the deep learning community, it is still unconvincing to directly transfer the knowledge of natural language in LLMs to time series tasks. Note that i) text and time series are distinct data modalities, and ii) the pre-trained LLMs are not pre-trained with text-time-series pairs. 
- Furthermore, the first contribution *“introducing a novel concept of reprogramming large language models for time series forecasting without altering the pre-trained backbone model“* is not new, as previous works such as GPT4TS [1] have also explored this reprogramming approach, regardless of which parts of the LLMs are fine-tuned. Additionally, the proposed method requires training the input and output layers for adaptation, which means that it does involve some alteration of the pre-trained backbone model.
- While using text to aid in time series prediction can be beneficial, as seen in applications such as stock prediction using financial news text mining, it's unclear how the shared declarative for a whole time series dataset can help understand complex temporal behaviors in different windows. Although these prompts may provide domain expert knowledge and task instructions, they do not introduce text information at each time step. Therefore, it remains unclear how these text prompts can benefit the understanding of complex temporal behaviors in time series.
- Compared to related work such as [1], which has applied pre-trained LLMs to various time series tasks, the experiments in this paper are relatively limited. For instance, only prediction tasks are considered, and even for long-term prediction tasks, only the ETT datasets are included. This narrow scope of experiments limits the evaluation of the proposed approach to other time series tasks and datasets.
- The link for the source code provided in the paper is empty. I cannot check for more details regarding the experiments.

### Questions
More discussions:
- Can you discuss the connections and differences between LLMs and traditional/existing deep-learning time series models? 
- It would be helpful to define what is a good time series representation expected to be and to provide a more in-depth discussion of why pre-trained LLMs are capable of producing such representations.
- Regarding cross-domain adaptation in the zero-shot setup, I'm curious about what knowledge from the source domain in time series can be transferred to the target domain to achieve zero-shot prediction.

### Summary
The paper proposes an approach to reprogram pre-trained large language models such that they can effectively do forecasting in zero-shot, few-shot, and fully supervised settings. The authors propose two strategies two forecast time-series: (1) by reprogramming patches of time-series by grounding them in text prototypes via cross attention, and (2) by using descriptions of the data, instruction, statistics of time-series as  the prefix. The authors demonstrate promising performance on short and long horizon tasks.

### Strengths
1. The paper is very well written, clear, with sufficient details to ensure reproducibility. I really liked that desiderata that the authors identified to enable LLMs to produce forecast. 
2. The experiments were well designed with some limitations in rigour which I will discuss in the next section.

I really liked the paper, it was well written, well motivated and performant.

### Weaknesses
Following are some things to improve in the paper. I think in general the experiments can be made more rigorous.
1. **Baselines**:  I understand that the authors are following the experiment protocol followed by TimesNet, but there are several limitations: (1) Statistical methods such as AutoARIMA, AutoTHETA, AutoETS, Naive and Seasonal Naive, etc. were not compared with. These methods are important and very performant in practice, (2) N-BEATS and N-HITS were only compared during short-horizon forecasting, (3) Recent papers on using LLMs for time-series forecasting were not compared against, for e.g. LLM4TS [1] and PromptCast [2] (4) I am aware that the paper "LLMs are zero-shot forecasters" [3] only got recently published, but it would improve the experiments if the authors were able to compare with it. I should emphasize that this is completely optional. 
2. **Datasets:** Increasing the amount of datasets for experimentation will improve the results. The current set of datasets is pretty limited, even for long horizon forecasting datasets, where datasets such as Influenza-like Illnesses, Exchange Rate, Tourism, and Weather etc. (see PatchTST) were missing. For short-horizon datasets, M3 at the very least, and the Monash time-series forecasting archive can be added to improve results.

### Questions
I do not have any questions at that would change my opinions regarding the paper. I think that the rigour of the experiments must be improved.

### Summary
The paper presents Time-LLM, a framework designed to harness Large Language Models (LLMs) for time series forecasting. By converting time series data into text-like prototypes and introducing the Prompt-as-Prefix (PaP) method to supplement this data with additional context, the framework effectively aligns time series data with the modalities of natural language. The empirical results indicate Time-LLM's superiority in comparison to other leading models, particularly in few-shot and zero-shot contexts.

### Strengths
1. The paper is articulate and systematically structured, making the motivation and methodology behind the proposed solution evident.
2. The approach of modality alignment from time series to natural language is both innovative and promising, offering a new perspective for future research.
3. The empirical evaluation is thorough, encompassing an analysis of different LLM variations, an ablation study, computational efficiency considerations, and model interpretation.

### Weaknesses
**Major**
1. The choice of datasets for evaluation is restrictive, as the ETT datasets involve similar metrics monitored under different conditions. Their mutual similarities might overinflate the perceived performance of Time-LLM. Inclusion of diverse datasets such as Weather, Electricity, and Traffic, commonly featured in literature, would offer a more holistic assessment. Moreover, there's an emerging consensus that long-term forecasting benchmarks have a preference for univariate models, potentially bypassing the capability of handling cross-variate correlations  ([1], [2]). As Time-LLM also processes each channel separately, this limitation should be discussed. Specifically, the paper does not address how the model would perform on datasets where inter-channel dependencies are crucial for accurate forecasting, such as those found in complex systems with interacting components. This lack of evaluation on multivariate time series with significant cross-correlations is a major gap.
2. The mechanism used to produce the next H steps remains unclear, warranting a more detailed explanation. It is not clear if the model is operating in an auto-regressive manner, predicting one step at a time and feeding that back into the model, or if it is directly predicting all H steps simultaneously. The paper needs to clarify the exact process of how the model generates the forecast horizon.

**Minor**
1. Figure 3 Ambiguities:
    1. Fig 3(a): Initially, the patches seem to represent input patches $X_P$. To eliminate any confusion, clearly labeling associated variables like $E, Z$ would be helpful. The current labeling is insufficient to understand the transformation process.
    2. Fig 3(b): The figure raises questions about whether the model outputs only the subsequent step or the next $H$ steps. Additionally, the function of the intermediate layer remains undefined. The role of the projection head and how it maps the LLM's output to the forecast is not clearly explained.
2. Error in Fig 3(b): There seems to be a need for a one-step left shift in the output of Patch-as-Prefix to render it an auto-regressive model. Without this shift, the model would be predicting the current time step, not the future.

### Questions
1. Does the model operate in an autoregressive manner, predicting only the subsequent step, or does it directly forecast the next $H$ steps?
2. How is $E'$ derived from $E$?

### Summary
This work casts time series modeling as yet another "language" task by addressing the problem of casting continuous-valued data into a discrete representation and leveraging prompts to the language model. Here the authors draw from previous works, including PatchTST, to patch the continuous valued time series data and project them onto word embeddings via an attention mechanism. The new discretized embeddings and a word prompt are fed into a pretrained LLM which predicts future values. This work produces state-of-the-art results on both short-term and long-term predictions on the M4 and electricity transformer temperature (ETT) datasets, respectively. The work also produces the state-of-the-art results on zero and few-shot learning evaluated on ETT.

### Strengths
Instead of creating a new representation of the continous-valued time series data the authors discretized the data by projecting it onto existing word embeddings via an attention mechanism. This approach is exciting in it's use of the word embeddings as the discretization medium rather than using a linear layer in the final calculation of the embeddings. In doing so, this work shows how using not only trained LLMs but also the learned embeddings can transfer to time series problems.

By building the final embeddings from word embeddings, the authors cast the time-series problem into a "language" problem. This allows the authors to further utilize language model features by employing a prompt which is shown to improve time series predictions. One could imagine expanding further on this new property by trying different prompts and seeing if such prompts can illicit adversarial results. Ultimately, this approach may be utilized for new experiments to both probe LLMs and further exploit their capabilities.

### Weaknesses
The authors chose a limited set of time series data to benchmark this model on. Many of the models they compare against have been benchmarked against other data sets: weather, traffic, electricity consumption, and the spread of influenza. This confuses the objective of the paper. If the objective is to show this model gives the state-of-the-art results for the two data sets then that is clear. If the authors wish to claim this model outperforms others across many domains then more evidence is needed. If the authors wish to introduce this model and benchmark it on a single data set to demonstrate its potential capabilities then they provide many examples.

### Questions
My primary concern is that the evidence provided, the stated intentions, and the claims of this work do not fully line up. I would like to know the primary objective and claims of this work. Depending on that answer I feel there might be more evidence required. 

a) If this work is meant to show that the model is state-of-the-art across many potential time series tasks then comparisons across other datasets (mentioned above) would be much more convincing. This work only uses ETT and M4.

b) If this work is meant to benchmark this model's capabilities on a single data set then please make that clear. The state-of-the-art claims should only be made with regard to the data sets the model was benchmarked against.

### Summary
This paper introduces a pioneering approach, Time-LLM, which harnesses the reprogramming and Prompt-as-Prefix techniques to repurpose large language models for time series forecasting while keeping the backbone LLM intact. The method innovatively bridges input time series to optimized text prototypes, making the time series inputs more digestible for language models. This integration enables large language models to seamlessly tackle time series forecasting. Furthermore, Time-LLM incorporates the Prompt-as-Prefix mechanism to facilitate the LLM's reasoning capabilities over time series. By adding natural language prompts, the approach enriches time series input and presents task directives in a comprehensible language format. In my view, this holds substantial promise for controlled time series analysis across diverse applications. The authors have conducted extensive experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed reprogramming framework, showing considerable potential in leveraging LLMs for time series tasks.

### Strengths
1.	The paper is articulately composed and well-organized, with most concepts clearly presented. It offers an in-depth exploration of the proposed concepts related to LLM reprogramming and Prompt-as-Prefix.

2.	The proposed reprogramming framework is novel and has proven to be highly effective. Instead of directly feeding original time series into LLMs, the innovative approach of converting time series into text prototype representations for language model comprehension stands out. This strategy might set the foundation for a broader method of cross-modality adaptation in LLMs.

3.	The augmentation of input context with declarative prompts, such as domain expertise and task guidelines, to steer LLM reasoning is notably promising. It offers significant potential for controlled time series analysis in a variety of applications.

4.	The architectural design of Time-LLM is logical and underpinned by clear motivations. Dividing time series into patches and reprogramming each into text prototype representations is a wise choice, which aligns well with the use of natural language prompts to guide LLM in time series reasoning.

5.	Comprehensive experimental results are provided to evaluate the proposed reprogramming framework from various aspects. Indeed, Time-LLM demonstrates promising results, especially under the few-shot and zero-shot protocols, showing considerable sample efficiency and applicability in real-word applications. There are also abundant ablation and other side experiments to study the proposed method from various aspects.

### Weaknesses
1.	While this paper is generally well-written, there are areas that could benefit from further refinement. For instance, Fig. 5 lacks clarity and might benefit from being displayed at a larger scale to improve visibility. In patch reprogramming (Sec. 3.1), it would be beneficial to illustrate how the linear projection aligns the hidden dimensions in Fig. 2. Specifically, the transformation from the patch embedding $\mathbf{Z}^{(i)}$ to the output embedding $\mathbf{O}^{(i)}$ is not clearly depicted, and the role of the linear projection in aligning the dimensions is unclear. Within the Prompt-as-Prefix discussion, reference is made to the inclusion of statistics within the prompt. Elaborating on the specific content and the calculation methods employed would enhance clarity. For example, how are trend and lag calculated, and what specific statistical measures are included beyond basic descriptive statistics?

2.	The paper's foundational concept hinges on the idea of reprogramming. However, it omits references to several pivotal reprogramming studies from recent years (as listed below). Integrating these pertinent studies in the introductory or related works section could provide a more robust understanding of the concept.

3.	There are some writing issues. For instance, there should be uniformity in the references' formatting, with a preference for citing formally published works from conferences or journals over preprints.

### Questions
1.	Could you elucidate the mechanism behind "Output Projection" (Sec. 3.1), particularly the aspects related to flattening and the linear projection? A formulaic representation would greatly aid in understanding.

2.	In the "Prompt-as-Prefix" paragraph, there is a reference to computing the trend and lag in relation to time series, with several potential implementations hinted at. Could the authors detail the methodology used to determine the trend and lag information within the prompts?
