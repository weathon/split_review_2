## Abstract
Recent developments in offline reinforcement learning have uncovered the immense potential of diffusion modeling, which excels at representing heterogeneous behavior policies. 
However, sampling from diffusion policies is considerably slow because it necessitates tens to hundreds of iterative inference steps for one action. 
To address this issue, we propose to extract an efficient deterministic inference policy from critic models and pretrained diffusion behavior models, leveraging the latter to directly regularize the policy gradient with the behavior distribution's score function during optimization. 
Our method enjoys powerful generative capabilities of diffusion modeling while completely circumventing the computationally intensive and time-consuming diffusion sampling scheme, both during training and evaluation. 
Extensive results on D4RL tasks show that our method boosts action sampling speed by more than 25 times compared with various leading diffusion-based methods in locomotion tasks, while still maintaining state-of-the-art performance.

### Summary
This paper introduces a score regularized policy optimization algorithm (SRPO) based on behavior diffusion, aiming to address the problem of heterogeneous behavior distributions in offline reinforcement learning. The algorithm utilizes a pre-trained behavior diffusion model to score-normalize policy gradients and presents a practical method based on behavior diffusion and implicit Q-learning. The paper provides a detailed explanation of SRPO's principles, implementation, and optimization techniques, and it validates the effectiveness of the algorithm through experiments.

### Strengths
In the offline reinforcement learning setting, the paper introduces a novel approach that leverages the diffusion model. This method uses the powerful modeling capabilities of the diffusion model while avoiding the extensive time-consuming iterative inference stage.

### Weaknesses
The final policy used by the algorithm is still based on a Gaussian distribution. This Gaussian policy might not capture complex distributions as effectively as the diffusion model when dealing with complex offline datasets. The key concern here is whether the complex distribution information modeled by the pretrained diffusion behavior can be adequately captured by a policy based on a Gaussian distribution. Specifically, while the diffusion model is used to model the complex behavior distribution, the final policy optimization step essentially distills this complex distribution into a single Gaussian mode. This raises concerns about the potential loss of multi-modality and the ability to fully leverage the rich information captured by the diffusion model. The method might struggle in scenarios where the optimal policy is inherently multi-modal or requires exploration of diverse action spaces, as the Gaussian policy is inherently unimodal.

### Questions
1. DIQL should be IDQL in the first and second paragraph of section 6.1.
2. Why do different Gaussian-based policies have significantly varying inference times, as shown in Figure 1?

### Summary
This paper proposes the use of pre-trained diffusion model for the behavior regularized offline policy optimization objective. The work shows a careful derivation of how pre-trained diffusion models, using the score function, can be replaced in the existing behavior regularized objective. The trick is to use the behavior policy distribution’s score function, and the paper claims to show faster compute time compared to existing approaches. Experimental results are demonstrated using the D4RL benchmark.

### Strengths
Algorithmically, the paper provides an interesting insight showing that in behavior regularized policy optimization objective, the gradient of the diverse term is indeed related to the score function of the behavior policy distribution. This therefore allows the use of pre-trained diffusion models to be used in these objectives.

The challenge of measuring the divergence term in offline regularized objective is generally difficult, where typically a separate model is needed to approximate the behavior model. Equation (9) provides a simple trick following equation (8) to show exactly where pre-trained diffusion models can be used for the behavior distribution, where the diffusion model e(a|s, t) can approximate the grad log term of the behavior policy. This is an interesting and novel insight to derive the algorithm, making use of the widely available pre-trained diffusion models these days.

### Weaknesses
The paper is a bit hard to follow; while the claims are justified, the paper is not so well written and seems convoluted. I believe this is also because the key idea/trick of the paper is to use pre-trained diffusion models in existing offline rl objectives, so the paper tries to lay out the context for that. However, it makes the paper rather difficult to follow, to completely understand the full contribution of the work.


Since the key idea is to use existing pre-trained diffusion models, I expected that other than the algorithmic contribution, the paper can do a much thorough job at more experimental evaluations? It would be useful to see existing setups where behavior regularized policy optimization is used, including toy examples, and perhaps provide a comprehensive qualitative study of the use of different pre-trained diffusion models in this context?

Experimental results probably need to be more thorough; there are only marginal benefits from the SRPO objective and it is not clear whether the proposed approach leads to empirical benefits. It would be helpful to do more qualitative studies on the objective and the use of different pre-trained diffusion models.

### Questions
See questions in the weakness section. 

The key algorithmic pipeline is to integrate the SRPO technique with implicit Q learning. I wonder what happens if the SRPO objective is used in other behavior regularized offline rl objectives? Since the key algorithmic novelty comes through the derivation, it would be helpful if the authors can do more thorough experimental evaluation. Otherwise, the novel contributions of the paper are unclear.

### Summary
The paper addresses the slow inference issue of diffusion policies and proposes an offline RL algorithm to avoid iterative diffusion sampling process during policy evaluation by leveraging a critic model and a pretrained diffusion model. 
The proposed method, SRPO, consists of three components: a critic model realized by the IQL, a pretrained diffusion model to explicitly model the behavior policy, and a policy extraction module utilizing the pretrained behavior model to regularize the policy gradient.
Experimental results on D4RL benchmark suggest the proposed method can achieve higher computational efficiency especially during inference compared to other diffusion-based policies, while maintaining comparable performance by exploiting the modeling expressiveness of diffusion models.
The main contribution of this paper is to employ a pretrained diffusion behavior model, which can approximate the score function of the behavior distribution in offline datasets, to regularize the policy gradient during the optimization of the actor.

### Strengths
1. The paper clearly states its motivation and presents a clear illustration to demonstrate the derivation of the proposed method, SRPO.
2. The paper provides reproducible details for its experiments, and make a relatively comprehensive comparison with both conventional behavior regularization methods and recent diffusion-based policies in offline RL, in terms of task performance and computational efficiency.

### Weaknesses
1. The paper mainly aims to improve the computational efficiency of diffusion-based polices, which is highlighted in computation-sensitive contexts such as robotics as stated in the paper, yet there is no experiment concerning the robot scenarios especially with real data. If such experimental results are provided, the central claim made by the paper can be more convincing.
2. The novelty of the proposed method is limited as it seems to be a combination of previous work, and especially an incremental work based on IDQL (Hansen-Estruch et al., 2023), though it has been compared in the experiments. The main difference between the two work is the policy extraction process, which is the main contribution of this paper but does not provide adequate contribution to the community.

### Questions
1. In Table 1, where do the results of baselines come from? Are they reported from original papers or all have been re-implemented for comparison？
2. In section 6.2, the paper claims that SRPO "completely avoids diffusion sampling throughout both training and evaluation procedures". But it is considered that the pretrained diffusion model for behavior policy still requires iterative sampling during the pretraining phase, which is also visualized in Fig 5 when compared to IDQL. This claim needs further explanation.
3. In Fig 5, are the results averaged across all locomotion tasks?

### Summary
This paper aims to improve the inference efficiency of diffusion models in the context of offline reinforcement learning, by proposing a deterministic inference policy from critic models and pretrained diffusion behavior models. The pretrained diffusion behavior models are then utilized to regularize the policy gradient. Experiments are conducted on D4RL in locomotion tasks, the speed is improved without an evident performance drop.

### Strengths
- The research problem of improving inference efficiency for diffusion models in offline reinforcement learning is interesting and worth investigating.

- The paper is well organized and written in general, with motivations and methods well explained (but somewhat unclear to me).

- The experiments show evident improvement in time cost and demonstrate the effectiveness.

### Weaknesses
 - Some implementation details are unclear, while the Fig.1 shows the comparison of the inference efficiency, the actual time cost for training is not mentioned. (In Appendix C, it seems the actual time used for training is not specified?)

- I get a bit confused by some high-level assumptions in this work. Essentially, I believe there are two types of distributions that matter in the context of Diffusion models for offline RL, namely the actual data distribution and the learnable Gaussian kernel (noise) distribution (which is pre-scheduled on the mean values with fixed variance). If the actual learnable $\pi_\theta$ is used as the appropriation/predictor of the policy distribution (which I believe is the case according to Eq. 9?), then what is the difference between this proposed paradigm and the Gaussian case, while the latter is believed to be lacking in expressivity, as mentioned by the authors in the intro and Fig.2, however the $\pi_\theta$ that you are sampling from is also a Gaussian with known variance and learnable mean value.

- Following my previous point, which I think is also related to the choice of $t$ in Sec. 4.2 and also in Eq. 9. If I misunderstood the actual usage of distribution here, and the proposed SRPO method actually uses the actual distribution, which corresponds to $x_0$ (or somewhere close to $x_0$), as the optimal policy that you are trying to sample from, then the expressivity concern does not exist, but then in this case, the entropy term in Eq. 9 does not hold, because we don’t have any prior on the actual distribution of $x_0$ also on its variance?

### Questions
Please see the weaknesses for details. Overall, I think I get confused by the distributions from the DMs and the actual deployment in the context of RL in this work, as well as the rationale/motivation behind it.
