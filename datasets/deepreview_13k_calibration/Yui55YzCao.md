## Abstract
Spectral Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are gaining attention for their ability to surpass the limitations of message-passing GNNs. They rely on supervision from downstream tasks to learn spectral filters that capture the graph signal's useful frequency information. However, some works empirically show that the preferred graph frequency is related to the graph homophily level. This relationship between graph frequency and graphs with homophily/heterophily has not been systematically analyzed and considered in existing spectral GNNs. To mitigate this gap, we conduct theoretical and empirical analyses revealing a positive correlation between low-frequency importance and the homophily ratio, and a negative correlation between high-frequency importance and the homophily ratio. Motivated by this, we propose shape-aware regularization on a Newton Interpolation-based spectral filter that can (i) learn an arbitrary polynomial spectral filter and (ii) incorporate prior knowledge about the desired shape of the corresponding homophily level. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that NewtonNet can achieve graph spectral filters with desired shapes and superior performance on both homophilous and heterophilous datasets.

### Summary
This paper proposes a novel framework for learning graph filters. The novelty of the framework lies in incorporating the prior information about graph homophily/heterophily into the learning procedure. Theoretical results demonstrate that homophily and heterophily are indeed relevant aspects to consider in inference tasks performed by GNNs. Further, experiments demonstrate that the proposed framework outperforms other baselines or achieves performance close to the best baseline on the node classification task.

POST REBUTTAL

I thank the authors for their response. There are clear conceptual gaps that inhibit the complete understanding of how the homophily information dictates quality of learning (for instance, I find the authors' claim *if we do not provide guidance to the spectral filter, it will learn some undesired information on both small and large graphs* to be highly unconvincing as it has no theoretical or empirical support). Therefore, I have decreased the soundness score to 3 and contribution score to 2, while retaining my original recommendation.

### Strengths
The paper is well-written and provides the relevant message of the importance of homophily in learning of spectral graph filters coherently. Theoretical statements with elementary numerical analysis in Section 3 is well done.

### Weaknesses
In practice, incorporating homophily information might offer the most significant benefits when the datasets are of limited size. For sufficiently large datasets, the graph filters will be fine-tuned automatically according to the graph homophily level. The claim that the spectral filter will learn some undesired information if not guided is not substantiated by either theoretical or empirical evidence.  The paper lacks a clear explanation of how the proposed method's performance scales with increasing graph size and label availability, especially in comparison to methods that do not explicitly incorporate homophily. Furthermore, while the paper discusses the relative importance of high and low frequencies, it does not provide a clear threshold or condition under which certain frequencies can be completely ignored in the extremities of graph homophily level. The paper also does not investigate the sensitivity of the proposed method to the accuracy of the estimated homophily ratio.

### Questions
1. I recommend that the complexity analysis in Appendix B.1 be included in the main body of the paper.

2. Are the high frequencies completely irrelevant for graphs with homophily and vice-versa? Currently, the paper discusses relative importance of high and low frequencies for different homophily levels. However, it is not clear to me whether certain frequencies can be completely ignored in the extremities of graph homophily level.

### Summary
This paper proposes a novel GNN architecture called NewtonNet that uses Newton interpolation to better grasp the desired shape of learned polynomial filters via regularization. The prior knowledge of the desired shape comes from well-built theoretical analyses of the relationships between homophily ratio and low- or high-frequency importance. The proposed method achieves superior or comparable performances compared to other state-of-the-art methods.

### Strengths
S1. The theoretical part is contributive and justified with well-designed experiments.

S2. The idea of controlling the shape of a polynomial filter via Newton nodes is interesting.

S3. The paper is well-organized.

S4. The code is accessible.

### Weaknesses
 > W1. On the choice of K.

First, In the second line under Eq.7, the authors write that they set K=4 in this paper. According to Fig.2  and the description of experimental settings in Appendix D.4, you want to write K=5, right?

Then, in Appendix E.1, the authors conduct a sensitivity analysis on K, and find that NewtonNet's performances on the Cora and Chameleon datasets peak at K=5. Such an analysis is problematic because while K is presented as a hyperparameter, it appears to be fixed to 5 in the main experiments (Table 1) and the sensitivity analysis on K uses test set performance, which is inappropriate. A valid approach would be to treat K as a hyperparameter and tune it on the validation set for each dataset, rather than fixing it based on a sensitivity analysis using test data.

> W2. On the weak-supervised experiments.

According to Ref.1, the Chameleon and Squirrel datasets are problematic in that they use duplicated nodes. This would be problematic, especially in weak-supervised settings. I am curious how this experiment would perform on other datasets.   


### Questions
Q1. Can the regularization be used for other polynomial filtering functions?

Q2. The authors explain in Appendix E.1 that the reason for their choice of K to be 5 (typically set as 10 or tuned in a range in other polynomial filters) is that when K is larger, the polynomial becomes susceptible to the Runge phenomenon according to He et al., (2022).  Since the Runge phenomenon is caused by the selection of equal-paced interpolation points, why not use Chebyshev nodes for interpolation?

5. The susceptibility of the proposed approach to data noise and outliers may undermine its performance when confronted with real-world datasets.

6. A significant limitation arises from the substantial volume of labeled data that the proposed approach necessitates to attain satisfactory performance, which can be impractical in situations where acquiring labeled data is a challenging and expensive endeavor.

### Questions
> Please list up and carefully describe any questions and suggestions for the authors. Think of the things where a response from the author can change your opinion, clarify a confusion or address a limitation. This is important for a productive rebuttal and discussion phase with the authors.

1. Could the proposed approach be adapted to accommodate directed graphs? While the paper focuses on undirected graphs, considering the prevalence of directed graphs in real-world applications, it would be intriguing to explore the adaptability of this approach to handle directed graphs.
2. How does the performance of the proposed approach compare to other state-of-the-art methods on the same datasets? The paper presents comparisons with baseline methods, but a comprehensive evaluation against other contemporary approaches on the same datasets would offer valuable insights into its relative effectiveness.
3. Could the authors offer additional insights into the hyperparameter tuning process? While the paper briefly mentions hyperparameter tuning, more extensive details on the selection process and an assessment of the sensitivity of results to hyperparameter choices would enhance clarity.
4. What is the scalability of the proposed approach to larger graphs? The current evaluation primarily focuses on relatively small graphs. Understanding its performance and computational complexity as graph size scales would be beneficial, particularly for applications involving larger graphs.
5. Can the authors provide a deeper understanding of the interpretability challenges associated with the proposed approach? The paper notes potential interpretability issues, but additional insights into the specific challenges and potential pathways to improve interpretability would be valuable.
6. How does the proposed approach handle noisy or incomplete data? The paper does not explicitly address the approach's handling of noisy or incomplete data, which can be a limitation in real-world scenarios. It would be advantageous to gain insights into potential adaptations of the proposed approach to accommodate such data scenarios.

### Summary
This paper studies spectral GNN. Starting from the widely adopted empirical observations that the homophilic level of the interested graph determines which frequencies are preferred in response, the authors present a rigorous theorem to characterize the dependency between the homophilic level and the preferred graph filter. Then, a theoretically motivated novel GNN is proposed, named NewtonNet. To instantiate the idea of encouraging larger amplitude for specific frequencies than the others, NewtonNet is weaponed with interpolation technique rather than approximation, which allows directly regularizing each specific frequency’s response amplitude. The authors also conducted extensive experiments on various node classification tasks with different split ratios. NewtonNet seems to surpass existing methods in most cases. Moreover, a detailed analysis of the learned graph filter implies that NewtonNet’s advantage is rooted in how it aligns with the theorem introduced in this paper, namely, learning low-pass and high-pass filters on homophilic and heterophilic graphs, respectively.

### Strengths
1.	This paper is well-written. I can effortlessly pick the core idea(s) up.
2.	The theoretical results are important to this community and are general enough. The importance is due to that a lot of research works have regarded it as a fact, yet such a rigorous analysis is absent. Generality is in the sense that it is not restricted to a specific random graph model, has no unrealistic assumption, and has helpful implications.
3.	The proposed NewtonNet is novel to me. It is not another spectral GNN that just replaces the polynomial family to approximate the desired graph filter. Instead, NewtonNet considers an interpolation technique, which allows it to regularize specific frequencies explicitly. Moreover, no additional computation, especially spectral decomposition, is involved, which ensures NewtonNet is practical and scalable.
4.	The experimental results are convincing, including new heterophilic datasets, and compare different methods at various split ratios.

### Weaknesses
1.	In the presented theorem, the two compared graph filters have the same response norm, which is reasonable but not the case for many existing spectral GNNs. My concern is that, although the theorem is correct, some existing spectral GNNs can still fit the desired shape by further increasing the overall norms of their responses. This is not a technical flaw but needs to be further discussed. Specifically, the theorem compares filters with equal L2 norms, which constrains the analysis. While this simplification is mathematically convenient, it may not accurately reflect the behavior of spectral GNNs in practice. Many spectral GNNs do not explicitly constrain their filter norms, and can achieve desired frequency responses by scaling up the filter's magnitude. This scaling can effectively alter the filter shape, and the theorem's conclusions might not directly apply to these scenarios. The practical implications of this norm constraint should be further investigated, especially with respect to how it limits the generalizability of the theoretical results.
2.	In the experimental setup, GCN is regarded as a spatial GNN method, which is not that necessary, in my opinion. To my knowledge, GCN is often analyzed as a simplification of Chebyshev polynomial approximator. While GCN can be interpreted spatially, it is also commonly understood as a spectral method that approximates a low-pass filter using a first-order Chebyshev polynomial. The experimental section should acknowledge this dual interpretation and perhaps include a more nuanced discussion of GCN's role in the context of spectral methods. This is not a major flaw, but it could lead to a mischaracterization of GCN's relationship to the proposed method.

### Questions
I am wondering how you calculate the homophilic level ($h$) when there is just a tiny fraction of nodes are labeled. Actually, this is a crucial factor for the explicit shape-aware regularization to work well, according to my understanding of this work.


Update:

I tried your code. There are some questions that need to be answered so that I can reproduce your reported results:

1. How do you set `weight_decay`? It seems that there are typos in D.4, where `dropout` and `dprate` are taken from $ \{ 0, 0.0005 \} $. However, I guess they are chosen from $\{0, 0.5\}$, and `weight_decay` is chosen from $\{0, 0.0005\}$. Am I wrong?
2. I am curious about how you conduct HPO. The search space is supposed to be:

```Python
 lr = trial.suggest_categorical("lr", [0.005, 0.01, 0.05])
 temp_lr = trial.suggest_categorical("temp_lr", [0.005, 0.01, 0.05])
 dropout = trial.suggest_categorical("dropout", [0, 0.5])
 dprate = trial.suggest_categorical("dprate", [0, 0.5])
 wd = trial.suggest_categorical("wd", [0.0, 5e-4])
 gamma1 = trial.suggest_categorical("gamma1", [0, 1, 3, 5])
 gamma2 = trial.suggest_categorical("gamma2", [0, 1, 3, 5])
gamma3 = trial.suggest_categorical("gamma3", [0, 1, 3, 5])
```

It seems that it is intractable to enumerate all possible choices. Instead, I run your code with an HPO toolkit (optuna) with 400 trials, where each trial returns the mean best valid accuracy as the feedback. Other hyper-parameters are kept unchanged (i.e., using your default value `K=5`, `L=2`, and `hidden=64`. The best trial on Cora, CiteSeer, Crocodile, and Gamer are 90.610, 78.797, 76.002, and 61.861, respectively. Obviously, it is not that promising to achieve the reported test accuracy for such configurations, and, as expected, the test accuracy on them are 87.948, 77.293, 74.037, and 61.712, respectively.
