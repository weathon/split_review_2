## Abstract
Inverse problems arise in a multitude of applications, where the goal is to recover a clean signal from noisy and possibly (non)linear observations. The difficulty of a reconstruction problem  depends on multiple factors, such as the ground truth signal structure, the severity of the degradation and the complex interactions between the above. This results in natural sample-by-sample variation in the difficulty of a reconstruction problem. Our key observation is that most existing inverse problem solvers lack the ability to adapt their compute power to the difficulty of the reconstruction task, resulting in subpar performance and wasteful resource allocation. We propose a novel method, \textit{severity encoding},  to estimate the degradation severity of corrupted signals in the latent space of an autoencoder. We show that the estimated severity has strong correlation with the true corruption level and can provide useful hints on the difficulty of reconstruction problems on a sample-by-sample basis. Furthermore, we propose a reconstruction method based on latent diffusion models that leverages the predicted degradation severities to fine-tune the reverse diffusion sampling trajectory and thus achieve sample-adaptive inference times. Our framework, \methodname{}, acts as a wrapper that can be combined with any latent diffusion-based baseline solver, imbuing it with sample-adaptivity and acceleration.

### Summary
This paper proposes to adapt the amount of computation in image restoration based on posterior sampling with a latent diffusion model, by taking into account the sample-specific "severity" of degradation. This severity is estimated using the proposed "severity encoder". Experiments show that the proposed strategy outperforms comparable models in terms of speed while retaining (or improving) quality.

### Strengths
- The paper is very well written and easy to follow. The main idea of the paper is explained well and supported by experiments: samples with significant degradation require more steps for clean reconstruction, while less degraded samples need fewer diffusion steps. Handling this properly can prevent over-diffusion and save computational resources. 

- The idea of sample-adaptive computation is natural in seems to be new in this context. I think that this is implicit in more traditional solvers (e.g. compressed sensing) but certainly not for neural nets.

- As Figure 3 shows, the auto-encoder-based “severity” measure aligns well with objectiv and perceptual severity.

### Weaknesses
 - while diffusion models can serve as a prior for solving inverse problems in an unsupervised manner [1], the proposed method relies on supervised learning. It thus needs paired to train the severity encoder. One consequence, as shown in Appendix C, is that the reconstruction quality can substantially deteriorate for measurements not used during  training. The main text lacks a clear acknowledgment of this important drawback. It's important to incorporate (parts of) Appendix C in Section 4 and discuss this more explicitly in the main text.

- There is no discussion of alternative heuristics to measure severity of degradation

- It would be nice to evaluate the robustness of the proposed framework to variations in measurement noise levels in test time, as these changes are likely to happen in practice

- It would be nice to analyze the estimated degradation severity in both the above experiment and the ones conducted in Appendix C. This could ascertain the robustness of the proposed sample-by-sample computation adaptation.

### Questions
- since that the original formulation of diffusion generative models is not computationally efficient, a number of papers propose streamlined versions [2,3]. Their “diffusion” methods don’t require the standard iterations. Could you discuss the potential of your ideas in this alternative context?

### Summary
This paper introduces a method called severity encoding that estimates degradation severity of noisy and degraded signals in the latent space of an autoencoder. The proposed reconstruction method, based on latent diffusion models, leverages the predicted degradation severities to fine-tune the reverse diffusion sampling trajectory and achieve sample-adaptive inference times. The technique aims to address the limitations of existing reconstruction techniques by adapting compute power to the difficulty of the reconstruction task. The authors demonstrate through numerical experiments on linear and nonlinear inverse problems that their approach achieves comparable performance to state-of-the-art diffusion-based techniques while significantly reducing computational cost. The paper also provides background information on diffusion models, denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs), and latent diffusion models (LDMs), as well as their applications in solving inverse problems by running diffusion in the latent space of a pre-trained autoencoder. Moreover, the proposed method shows promise in improving reconstruction efficiency while maintaining performance.

### Strengths
Originality: The paper introduces severity encoding to estimate degradation severity in an autoencoder's latent space, providing a fresh perspective on reconstruction challenges. Combining severity encoding with latent diffusion models sets it apart.

Quality: Thorough experiments on linear and nonlinear inverse problems demonstrate effectiveness. Comparisons with state-of-the-art diffusion-based methods show similar performance with reduced computational costs. Well-designed experiments and comprehensive analysis ensure reliable findings.

Clarity: The paper effectively communicates the proposed method and its technical details. 

Significance: The contributions have implications for image restoration and inverse problems. Severity encoding allows sample-adaptive inference, addressing a major limitation of existing methods. This has the potential to improve efficiency and effectiveness in various domains by reducing computational costs while maintaining performance.

### Weaknesses
Limited discussion on potential limitations: The paper does not thoroughly address potential limitations and challenges associated with severity encoding. It is crucial to identify and explicitly discuss any limitations, such as the impact of inaccurate severity predictions on overall reconstruction performance and scenarios where severity encoding may struggle to provide accurate estimates. This would provide a nuanced understanding of the method's capabilities and constraints.

Lack of ablation studies: The paper lacks ablation studies to assess the individual impact of different components or design choices in the proposed method. Conducting ablation experiments to investigate the contributions of severity encoding, latent diffusion models, and other key components would help understand their relative importance and guide further improvements or adjustments to the approach.

### Questions
1. Regarding the limited discussion on potential limitations and challenges associated with severity encoding: 
   - Could the authors elaborate on potential scenarios or data conditions where severity encoding may lead to inaccurate severity predictions and the resulting impact on overall reconstruction performance?
   - Are there any strategies or techniques that can be employed to mitigate the limitations of severity encoding in scenarios where it may struggle to provide accurate estimates?

2. Concerning the lack of ablation studies to assess the individual impact of different components in the proposed method:
   - Could the authors provide insights into the relative importance of severity encoding, latent diffusion models, and other key components within the proposed approach based on their expertise and experimentation?
   - Are there specific aspects of the method that could benefit from further refinement or adjustments based on the results of potential ablation experiments?

### Summary
In this work, to address the problem that most existing solvers cannot adapt their computing power to the difficulty of the reconstruction
task, the authors propose the severity encoding method, which estimates the degradation severity of noisy and degraded signals in the latent space of an autoencoder. Based on latent diffusion models and the severity encoding method, the authors propose the Flash-Diffusion method, which is a sample-adaptive method that fine-tunes the diffusion sampling trajectory based on the severity of corrupted signals. The authors claim to experimentally demonstrate that the proposed method achieves performance on par with SOTA diffusion-based reconstruction approaches, but with greatly improved compute efficiency.

### Strengths
The proposed severity encoding method may be of interest.

### Weaknesses
1. The proposed Flash-Diffusion method appears to be a straightforward blend of the severity encoding method and certain existing techniques/tricks that have been previously proposed in prior works, such as the technique proposed by Chung et al. (2022c) that starts the reverse diffusion process from a good initial reconstruction instead of pure noise.

2. The severity encoding method seems to be a minor trick. It is based on a restrictive and impractical assumption that the prediction error in latent space can be modeled as zero-mean i.i.d. Gaussian, despite the authors making some efforts to mitigate this assumption through noise correction.. While the presented experimental results may provide some insight into the potential effectiveness of this technique, I believe that they are insufficient to prove the viability of it.

3. The authors highlight in the abstract that "our technique achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art diffusion-based techniques, with significant improvements in computational efficiency". But they only provide a very short paragraph before **Conclusions** to illustrate the efficiency of the method, and there is a clear lack of comprehensive comparisons or benchmarking against other techniques, particularly in terms of computational efficiency. Additionally, Figure 6, which is meant to illustrate the efficiency of the method, is confusingly labeled with an x-axis for "NFE" and a legend for "fixed steps", making it difficult to interpret. Furthermore, while the authors mainly try to achieve significant improvements in computational efficiency, they still stick to DDPM and use more than 100 NFEs. In terms of sampling efficiency, DDPM is rather weak and outdated. The authors should at least try to combine their method with DDIM and DPM-Solver, or other more advanced fast sampling methods for diffusion models (which only require less than 20 NFEs to obtain reasonable generation/reconstruction).

4. As far as I can tell, the authors only present experimental results for the deblurring task, but mention in the abstract that "We perform numerical experiments on both linear and nonlinear **inverse problems**". For "inverse problems", I would expect to see the results for various types of inverse problems, instead of only for deblurring. Please be more precise.

### Summary
This paper proposes a method to quantify the degradation severity of signal reconstruction in inverse problems using diffusion models. The key idea is to evaluate the severity in a latent space defined by variational autoencoder models. The severity is strongly correlated with the true corruption level and provides useful hints at the difficulty of signal reconstruction on a sample-by-sample basis. The usefulness of the severity measure is experimentally demonstrated.

### Strengths
The severity measure proposed in this article seems somewhat correlated with the difficulty of signal reconstruction. Computational experiments show that it leads to the improvement of reconstruction quality and the reduction of necessary computational cost.

### Weaknesses
There is little theoretical backing. Experimental results are not enough to support the validity of the proposed method. There are various hyper parameters to tune, which makes the method less attractive.

### Questions
How were hyper-parameters "\lambda_\sigma", "\lambda_im", "c", etc. tuned? Do we need to tune them for each data set? Or, they little vary depending on data sets?
