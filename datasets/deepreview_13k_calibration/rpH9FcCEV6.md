## Abstract
\setcounter{footnote}{0} 

Recently, diffusion models have achieved remarkable success in generating tasks, including image and audio generation. However, like other generative models, diffusion models are prone to privacy issues. In this paper, we propose an efficient query-based membership inference attack (MIA), namely Proximal Initialization Attack (PIA), which utilizes groundtruth trajectory obtained by $\epsilon$ initialized in $t=0$ and predicted point to infer memberships. Experimental results indicate that the proposed method can achieve competitive performance with only two queries on both discrete-time and continuous-time diffusion models. Moreover, previous works on the privacy of diffusion models have focused on vision tasks without considering audio tasks. Therefore, we also explore the robustness of diffusion models to MIA in the text-to-speech (TTS) task, which is an audio generation task. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first to study the robustness of diffusion models to MIA in the TTS task. Experimental results indicate that models with mel-spectrogram (image-like) output are vulnerable to MIA, while models with audio output are relatively robust to MIA.

### Confidence
4: You are confident in your assessment, but not absolutely certain. It is unlikely, but not impossible, that you did not understand some parts of the submission or that you are unfamiliar with some pieces of related work.

### Summary
This paper proposes a novel query-based membership inference attack (MIA), namely Proximal Initialization Attack (PIA), by using groundtruth trajectory obtained by ϵ initialized in t = 0 and predicted point to infer memberships. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method on vision and text-to-speech tasks.

3. Very good experimental results.

### Weaknesses
1. The motivation of some transformations in the method is not very clear.
2. The third contribution about the experiments is too long and redundant.
3. There exists some grammar errors or typos, like “MIA for generation tasks … has also been extensively researched” in the related work section.

### Questions
1. In Eq. (14), the motivation to ignore the high-order infinitesimal term and dt is not clear.
2. Why the proposed method can obtain better performance than the best competitors in Tables 1-3?

### Summary
This paper presents a novel approach to membership inference attacks on diffusion models named Proximal Initialization Attack (PIA), focusing on efficiency. The proposed method utilizes the distance between the true trajectory and the estimated trajectory, and the estimated trajectory is obtained by the output of models at $t=0$. With just 2 queries, this approach achieves superior AUC and TPR@1%FPR compared to previous methods.

### Strengths
* This paper is well-written and easy to read.
* The experiments are conducted extensively across multiple datasets and models in the domains of images and audio, confirming the effectiveness of the proposed method. A thorough ablation study is also conducted to investigate the patterns of various parameters.
* The results of the experiment are promising, and the experiment is convincing. The proposed method is much faster than the baseline, which is particularly useful for large-scale models.

### Weaknesses
 * The experimental results are promising. It would be more convincing if you could provide more details, such as the selection of all experimental parameters, including the comparative methods.
* Eq.9 is similar to the original loss function. Is there any connection between the proposed method and the loss function? Please provide further analysis.

### Questions
* Why is mel-spectrogram more robust than directly outputting audio? 
* Does the model that directly outputs audio have any other costs compared to outputting mel-spectrogram?

### Summary
This paper proposes a novel membership inference attack, Proximal Initialization Attack (PIA), for diffusion models. By using the output at time $t=0$ and calculating the difference between the model outputs at time $t$ and $t-1$, it is possible to determine whether a sample is present in the training dataset. The proposed method is validated for its effectiveness on both image and audio datasets. The results show that compared to the baseline, this method achieves better performance while achieving a 5-10 times speedup.

### Strengths
1. This paper aligns with the scope of the conference.
2. The paper is easy to understand, and its motivation is clear.
3. The experiments in the paper are extensive. The proposed method is validated on multiple datasets and multiple models in both image and audio domains, demonstrating its effectiveness. Additionally, the results on the audio dataset indicate that the model with audio output exhibits greater robustness.
4. They demonstrated the scenarios in which the proposed method can be applied (threat model in other word).

### Weaknesses
1. Some of the figures in the paper are difficult to read, due to the fact that too many datasets and models are included in the same figure.
2. The pipeline of the TTS tasks is not explained in the paper.
3. Some details of the experimental setup are not clearly described. Specifically, in the experiment on stable diffusion, the checkpoint of BLIP and the specific prompt used are not mentioned in this paper.

### Questions
1. How is the query number for the comparison methods determined? Is it possible that the comparison methods used in the article could yield better performance with a lower query number?
2. For the TTS task, this article explores models that generate output in the form of audio and mel-spectrogram. Are there any other types of outputs for the TTS task? It is interesting to investigate whether the other outputs is robust for the TTS task.

### Summary
This paper proposes a method for conducting a membership inference attack on a diffusion model. Compared to previous methods (SecMI), the proposed method achieves better results while accelerating the process by 5-10 times. The effectiveness of the method is validated on multiple datasets in the paper. Additionally, this paper also analyzed the MIA robustness of diffusion on speech-to-text task, and the authors suggests using models that directly output audio to enhance the MIA robustness of the model.

### Strengths
This paper proposed a method achieved a 5-10 times improvement compared to previous SOTA method (SecMI) and conducted extensive experiments to evaluate the proposed method. Strengths are listed below:

1.	This paper conducted extensive experiments, including three image datasets and three audio datasets. In particular, this paper also conducted experiments on stable diffusion, including scenarios where the ground truth text was unknown.
2.	Experiments demonstrated that the proposed method achieved a 5-10 times improvement compared to previous SOTA method (SecMI), while also achieving better results.
3.	This paper analyzed the threat model. When the diffusion model is used for some tasks such as inpainting and classification, it requires the use of intermediate results. In such cases, their method can be employed to attack the model. It’s reasonable.
4.	Experimental results showed that diffusion models directly outputting audio are more robust compared to models outputting mel-spectrograms. This paper recommended using models that directly output audio to enhance robustness.

### Weaknesses
The paper is overall clear and sound, but I still have some minor concerns:

1.	When attack audio, this paper also uses these methods proposed from image attacks (NA, SecMI). The methods for attacking audio should be included as well.
2.	In the loss function of the diffusion model, there is a noise term. The proposed method is based on the loss function, but the method to remove the influence of the random seed is not described clearly.
3.	Fig. 2 is too small to read.

### Questions
1. It is not clear how hyperparameters are selected for other methods.
2. Why audio data is more robust against the proposed method?
3. It is better to present the procedure of the proposed method in one table.
