## Abstract
Collider bias, which comes from non-random sample selection caused by both treatments and outcomes, is a significant and challenging problem of treatment effect estimation. Previous studies show that treatment effects are identifiable if some shadow variables are available in the observational data. Shadow variables are assumed to be fully observed covariates independent of the sample selection mechanism after conditioning on the outcome and other observed covariates. However, finding a well-defined shadow variable is often not an easier task than the task of dealing with collider bias itself in real-world scenarios. Therefore, we propose a novel ShadowCatcher that automatically generates representations serving the role of shadow variables from the observed covariates. Specifically, during the generation process, we impose conditional independence constraints on the learned representations to make them satisfy the assumptions of shadow variables. To further ensure that the generated representations are valid, we also use a tester to perform hypothesis testing and iteratively carry out the generation process until the generated representations pass the test. Using the generated representations, we propose a novel ShadowEstimator to estimate treatment effects under collider bias. Experimental results on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed ShadowCatcher and ShadowEstimator.

### Summary
This paper presents an approach for learning representations that can take the role of "shadow variables", which allow for CATE identification in the presence of selection bias. They describe the process of learning these variables and empirically show with synthetic and semi-synthetic data that they produce more accurate CATE estimates.

### Strengths
- clean and clear contribution, seems like an inventive and well motivated approach for applying ML tools to improve causal inference with good grounding in causal literature
- paper is mostly well presented
- experiments seem to support the main idea of the paper and contrast with other causal methods for slightly different tasks, showing improvement

### Weaknesses
 - I found myself getting just a little lost in the preliminaries of the shadow variable, particularly at the bottom of page 4. I found it confusing to say that f(Z | X, S) was identifiable from the observed data, and then to still say that we needed to find \tilde(OR) - I thought the f(Z|...) functions eliminated the need to calculate \tilde(OR) according to equation 4. I also don't quite see why Eq 5 is true and think this could use more explanation.
- I found some of the loss functions through 3.3 and 3.4 a little unintuitive. 1) I found it a little odd to try to look at -Z to maximize MSE - this means that the function will behave differently for Z close to 0 since Z and -Z are near each other. Would it be reasonable or more sensible to take random Z instead? or why is -Z the best idea? 2) I'm not sure why h_r, a function that aims to predict Z well, will also help to move the Z0 and Z1 distributions towards each other. 3) what is the notation \dot (x_i, z_i, t_i) in the loss function for Q? it's not clear if there's a typo here, since this just looks like a tuple. 4) I'm not sure why distilling h_z0 / h_z1 into a \tilde(or) function is necessary
- I'm confused by the comment right at the end of 3 around deconfounding methods: I thought there was an assumption around unconfoundedness. Is this still a fair comparison to other methods if deconfounding methods are used?
- In the synthetic data in Table 1, I was surprised that some of the wins were not that big. Given that this is fully synthetic data presented for this method, I'd expect the results to be outside the confidence bands, but in a few spots they're highly overlapping - it makes me wonder if some of the practical choices aren't as effective
- there's a lot of experimental info missing from section 4 around what learning algorithm and models are used

Smaller comments:
- end of Sec 3.3: it says "the final generated Z that passes the test" - should this be the first generated Z which passes the test? it seems like that test is a "stopping criteria" to me

### Questions
- What are the failure modes of this method - under what circumstances will learning a shadow variable be harder than others?

### Summary
In this paper, the authors focus on the collider bias problem, which is one of the important challenges of causal inference. They propose a novel method that can automatically generate shadow variable representations from observed covariates and propose an estimator to estimate CATE with the help of the generated representations. They conduct extensive experiments, including comparing different choices of the hyper-parameter $alpha$ and ablation studies. The main contribution is that they relax the strong assumptions of previous works on collider bias and make CATE estimation under collider bias feasible in most real-world observational studies.

### Strengths
1. Collider bias is an important and easily ignored problem of causal inference in observational studies. The main difficulty for previous works to be applied in real-world scenarios is the strong assumptions they made. Therefore, if the assumptions are relaxed, the proposed method will make significant contributions to the causality community and will have high application value in real-world scenarios.
2. This paper is mainly based on the shadow variables identification framework of collider bias, which strongly assumes that valid shadow variables are well-defined. Interestingly, the authors propose a novel idea that the shadow-variable representations can be learned from the observed covariates and propose a novel ShadowCatcher to "catch the shadow" from the covariates. The success of ShadowCatcher significantly relaxes the strong assumptions of previous works and makes CATE estimation possible under collider bias with the help of the proposed ShadowEstimator. This contributes a lot to causal inference research because, finally, collider bias can be addressed without any strong and even untestable assumptions as confounding bias in observational studies.
3. The proposed method is clearly stated and reasonable to me. For the testable conditional dependence assumption of shadow variables, they directly constrain it in the representation learning phase, and for the untestable conditional independence assumption, they constrain it and do additional hypothesis tests to guarantee it. The entire learning process of ShadowCatcher is theoretically feasible. ShadowEstimator is based on the shadow variables estimation framework, whose correctness is also theoretically guaranteed. There is still one concern about ShadowCatcher, as I will state in the weaknesses part.
4. The experiments are detailed and persuasive. The authors conduct experiments under different strengths of collider bias, proving the ability to reduce collider bias of their methods. They also conduct ablations to prove the effectiveness of the conditional dependence constraint in ShadowCatcher and compare the performance and efficiency under different choices of the hyper-parameter $alpha$. The results and analysis seem reasonable to me.

### Weaknesses
 1. Since the conditional independence assumption is not strictly constrained due to missing data, the authors use a hypothesis test phase to test whether this assumption is satisfied and only the generated representations pass the test can ShadowCatcher finish learning. As the authors also state in the paper, the choice of $alpha$ will significantly affect the efficiency of ShadowCatcher. As the results in Table 5 and Figure 4 show, the smaller $alpha$ is (which means the test is more strict), the better the performance is. But the number of iterations also gets bigger when the test is too strict. Therefore, the tradeoff between the efficiency and performance of the proposed method should be considered carefully in real-world applications.

2. A minor concern is that the figure size is somewhat small.

### Summary
POST-REBUTTAL UPDATE

Thanks for the clarifications, which addressed my concerns.

POST-REBUTTAL UPDATE END

The paper considers the problem of causal estimation with collider bias, that is, in situations where whether the individual is sampled or not (S=1/0) depends on the treatment T and the outcome Y. Previously, it has been shown that causal estimation can be done when there is collider bias if there exists a “shadow variable” (Z), which depends on the outcome variable (Y) among the sampled individuals (S=1), conditionally on the treatment (T) and covariates (X). Notably, Y can be missing for individuals that do not belong in the sample (S=0). Additionally, the shadow variable Z should be independent of the selection indicator S conditionally on all other variables. The main problem in using shadow variables is that they don’t always exist. The innovation of the paper is to learn suitable shadow variables from the observed covariates (X).

### Strengths
1) Most of the prior works addressing bias in causal estimation have focused on resolving the problem of hidden confounders and little work exists on collider bias. Therefore, the topic is fresh and important, and I found the approach based on shadow variables interesting.
2) The method seems technically solid and clearly presented. Rationale of the different steps of the method are justified properly.
3) The empirical validation seems appropriate, containing multiple reasonable baselines, two real-world datasets, and simulations.

### Weaknesses
I did not identify any major weaknesses. Some smaller ones:
1) The assumption that X and T are observed when the individual is not sampled seems quite strong and probably not true in many real-world use cases (see Question 1 below to address this).
2) Overall, the the method appears a bit hacky (a combination of multiple steps), but all the steps are well-motivated.
3) When printed out, fonts in Figures 2 and 3 are barely readable.

### Questions
1) I guess quite often if the individual is not sampled, it’s not only Y that is not observed but also X (and T), in which case the shadow variable approach would not be applicable. Could the authors discuss how this affects the usefulness in practice, and give representative real-world examples about situations in which they expect the method to be useful and where not?

2) I don’t understand the equation for the loss function in the “Hypothesis Test Phase” paragraph. Could there be a typo?

### Summary
This paper proposes a new method to address collider bias in causal effect estimation. The main idea is to use representation learning to generate a shadow variable, in order to alleviate the difficulty in finding a well-defined shadow variable in real-world applcations. The proposed algorithm has three steps which are inspired by exisitng theoretical results on identification using shadow variables, in the first step it generate shadow variable by imposing conditional independence constraints in the learned representation, in the second step it use hypothesis test to ensure the generation is valid, and in the last step it utilize existing CATE estimator for causal effect estimation. Experiments on conducted on IHDP and Twins datasets, and the proposed algorithm is compared with algorithms that are designed to address confounding bias.

After considering the authors' responses and discussions with AC, I have changed my score to 5. My concern is mainly regarding the usage of the Twins dataset, which was used in the original submission, but the authors later decided to remove this dataset from the manuscript.

### Strengths
1. Motivation. The motivation of this work is very good. As most work (especially in AI/ML community) on causal effect estimation focus on confounder bias, it is nice to see a work that attempt to address collider bias.
2. Writing. The structure and writing of this work is well-organized and clear.

### Weaknesses
1. Insufficient evaluation. The selected baseline methods/datasets are not designed for collider bias evaluation. Please see questions for more details.
2. Limited technical contribution. The proposed method mainly follows the theoretical results outlined by previous works, especially those by Miao and d’Haultfoeuille. Although this is not a critical problem by itself, it is amplified by the fact that the designed algorithm is fragmented into three components. The first and second components (which forms the "Shadow-Catcher"), mandates multiple testing which is subsequently proposed to be addressed by p-value correction. Then the third component comes in and uses existing CATE estimators to obtain the final estimation. There is little to none discussions on the guarantee of the algorithm procedure when putting these three components together.

### Questions
1. How is the CATE estimations evaluated on Twins dataset? The Twins dataset is usually used only for evaluating ATE estimations as there is no ground truth counterfactual outcomes.
2. Have the authors compared with more recently proposed CATE/ATE estimators? For example TEDVAE [1], DR-CFR [2]. As the currently compared methods are mainly not designed for collider and are a bit outdated, comparing with more recent methods can further demonstrate if the proposed approach is effective. As we are now at ICLR 2024, it seems insufficient to have most of the baselines proposed in 2016/2017.
3. Also is there any reason for selecting the datasets used in the manuscript? IHDP itself is a semi-synthetic dataset with only one data generation process, which only covers rather limited real-world scenarios. Twins is commonly used for ATE estimation instead of CATE estimation.
