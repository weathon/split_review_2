## Abstract
%
Self-supervised learning methods have shown promising results across a wide range of tasks in computer vision, natural language processing, and multimodal analysis. However, self-supervised approaches come with a notable limitation, dimensional collapse, where a model doesn't fully utilize its capacity to encode information optimally. Motivated by this, we propose ProSMin, a novel probabilistic self-supervised learning approach that leverages the power of probabilistic models to enhance representation quality and mitigate collapsing representations. Our proposed approach involves two neural networks, the online network and the target network, which collaborate and learn the diverse distribution of representations from each other through probabilistic knowledge distillation. The two networks are trained via our new loss function based on proper scoring rules. We provide a theoretical justification for ProSMin and demonstrate its modified scoring rule. This insight validates the method's optimization process and contributes to its robustness and effectiveness in improving representation quality. We evaluate our probabilistic model on various downstream tasks, such as in-distribution generalization, out-of-distribution detection, dataset corruption, low-shot learning, and transfer learning. Our method achieves superior accuracy and calibration, outperforming the self-supervised baseline in a variety of experiments on large datasets such as ImageNet-O and ImageNet-C. ProSMin thus demonstrates its scalability and real-world applicability. Our code is publicly available: https://github.com/amirvhd/SSL-sore-rule.

### Summary
The paper approaches the problem of learning self-supervised representation learning as a parametric probability density estimation problem in the representation space. The authors utilize an encoder to estimate the parameters of the distribution of the encoded sample similar to Kingma et al. They utilize self-distillation similar to BYOL and DINO where the distillation loss is a proper scoring rule for distributions.

### Strengths
The authors present a novel perspective toward solving the problem of learning self-supervised representations as a distribution over the representation space.
They achieve state-of-the-art performance on imagenet-1K for linear evaluation and K-nearest neighbour search.

### Weaknesses
See Questions

1. How do you ensure $q_\theta$ is not an identity network w.r.t $\mu$ with $\sigma = 0$ since the dimensionality of $z_\theta$ and $t_\theta$ 
2. Since your scoring function is a variation of $L_2$ loss between $z_i$ and $z_{\xi}$, can you show that the variational encoding actually makes a difference by perturbing $t_\theta$ by a Gaussian noise of $\sigma = \epsilon$
3. The authors claim that their method is superior in terms of preventing the collapse of representation, can you provide an experiment specific to this to highlight that the representations learned by ProSMin mitigate this problem? This is important because the authors claim that strong augmentations distort the underlying distribution, hence promoting the collapse of the representations learned. If learning the representations via a parametric distribution that utilizes the resampling trick of sampling from a Gaussian distribution, is it not effectively an augmentation in the representation space?

### Summary
The article focuses on the dimensional collapse problem in SSL. To address this issue, the authors propose a probabilistic approach via self-distillation to build robust representations. Detailed proofs confirm the convergence of the proposed method. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the method across various scenarios, including in-distribution, out-of-distribution, transfer learning, and more.

### Strengths
1. The paper proposes to learn robust feature representations through a probabilistic approach.
2. The theoretical proofs presented in the article, along with the explanations using scoring rules, demonstrate the convergence of the proposed algorithm. 
3. The authors conduct experiments in multiple settings, and the experimental results validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

### Weaknesses
1. There are some typos in the article, affecting the overall readability of the paper. 
- In Table 3, should "PN" be replaced with "PL"? The experimental setups in the first and last rows of Table 3 are exactly the same. Is this an error?
- In the last sentence of the third paragraph in Chapter 4, should "$\mu $" and "$\sigma $" have the superscript "i"? As per my understanding, "$\mu $" and "$\sigma $" vary for each data point.
- In the eighth line of the abstract, there is a semicolon. I believe using a comma would be more appropriate.

2. The article uses a self-distillation mechanism for learning, but the description of the learning mechanism is not clear. The third paragraph of Chapter 5 contains a sentence that says, "The target network has the same backbone and projection as the online network and it learns through self-distillation". The target network is updated through the strategy of EMA, and I think the online network could be regarded as learning through self-distillation. Is there a mistake here, or is my understanding off? In addition, there are some mistakes in the descriptions of the distillation mechanism of DINO in the second paragraph of Chapter 2. The parameters of the teacher model, rather than the student model, are obtained through EMA.

3. The association between the probabilistic method and the prevention of dimensional collapse still requires further elaboration and demonstration. In the second paragraph of Chapter 1, the authors give two possible causes for the dimensional collapse. Is the author's solution inspired by either of the two causes or did it address either of the two factors? I think this needs to be further explained. I suggest two additional experiments in the following areas:
- Ablation experiments with the removal of "$\sigma $" and the second term Equation 2. I think it is necessary to illustrate the effectiveness of the probabilistic approach.
- Performance comparison with various baseline methods for the same feature dimensions. 
- In Figure 3d, the dimension of the largest embedding vector is 16000, which I think is not large enough and should be further increased for experiments. As far as I know, many self-supervised methods, such as Barlow Twins, are capable of not collapsing completely in a dimension of 16000. I suggest that the authors can show that their proposed method does not collapse completely in larger dimensions. It would be better if the authors could somehow demonstrate that their method improves the effective dimensions of the learned features.

### Questions
1. The network structure of the proposed method is identical to BYOL. What do you think is the most important difference between these two approaches?
2. The term ${S^2}$ in Equation 4, Equation 5 and Equation 6 is only related to $\theta $. Why do you define the energy score as ${S^2}({P_\theta },{z_\xi })$?

### Summary
This paper propose ProSMin, a probabilistic self-supervised learning approach that can mitigate the problem of  collapsing representations in self-supervised learning. It follows the basic framework of training representations on augmented views of give images, like in contrastive learning. The core components are 1) an online network that predicts the representation as a distribution rather than a deterministic vector; 2) a target network that can be seen as an mean teacher.  Learning is accomplished based on proper scoring rules.

### Strengths
1.  Give a new probabilistic modeling for self-supervised representation learning. Compared with the deterministic modeling, the probabilistic modeling effectively mitigates collapsing representations.
2. The convergence of the proposed method is theoretically proved. The theooritical justification brings new insights on how representation quality is effectively improve
3. Solid experiments results on in-domain case and out-of-domain case show the proposed method achieves better represnetation, and the learned scores are well calibrated.

### Weaknesses
This paper reads smooth and everything looks good to me except for one concern: The authors are trying to sell that the proposed methods avoid the collapsing problem in self-supervised representation learning, but I didn't see explict justification or evaluation on this point. 
I have no idea that representations learned with previous method, such as contrastive learning, collapsed to what extend, and no idea on how good the proposed method improved on this. Maybe the performance on in-domain and out-of-domain expereiments show the representation is better, but I cannot justify if or not this were because the collapse problem is mitigated. 
I believe this work would be definitely more technically sound If authors provide more qualititive or quantatitive results that can directly reflect the level of collapse,
