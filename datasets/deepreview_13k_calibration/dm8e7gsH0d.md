## Abstract
Feature shaping refers to a family of methods that exhibit state-of-the-art performance for out-of-distribution (OOD) detection. These approaches manipulate the feature representation, typically from the penultimate layer of a pre-trained deep learning model, so as to better differentiate between in-distribution (ID) and OOD samples. However, existing feature-shaping methods usually employ rules manually designed for specific model architectures and OOD datasets, which consequently limit their generalization ability. To address this gap, we first formulate an abstract optimization framework for studying feature-shaping methods. We then propose a concrete reduction of the framework with a simple piecewise constant shaping function and show that existing feature-shaping methods approximate the optimal solution to the concrete optimization problem.
Further, assuming that OOD data is inaccessible, we propose a formulation that yields a closed-form solution for the piecewise constant shaping function, utilizing solely the ID data. Through extensive experiments, we show that the feature-shaping function optimized by our method improves the generalization ability of OOD detection across a large variety of datasets and model architectures.}

### Rating
6

### Rating Number
6

### Confidence
4: You are confident in your assessment, but not absolutely certain. It is unlikely, but not impossible, that you did not understand some parts of the submission or that you are unfamiliar with some pieces of related work.

### Summary
This paper proposes a feature-shaping method for general OOD detection without OOD data.
This paper uses maximum logit score and energy scores with the manipulated feature to find the OOD data.
This method yields a closed-form solution for the piecewise constant shaping function.
Extensive experiments support the superiority and generalization of this approach.

### Strengths
1. The proposed method is generalizable across different benchmarks does not require OOD data, and is somewhat original.
Multiple datasets and multiple backbones are evaluated.
2. This paper is supported by theory as well as experimental validation and is of high quality.
3. The overall description is relatively clear.
4. The OOD task is of great significance. It makes sense to research it.

### Weaknesses
1. The reviewer didn't see any discussion or analysis about the robustness of the proposed method to thresholding. 
Adding this analysis would make the paper more complete.
2. The reviewer believes that further explanation is needed as to why $E_{x^{OOD} \sim D^{OOD}_{\chi}} [I (Z^{OOD}) ]$ can be ignored.
The explanation in Fig. 3 is still not convincing enough.

### Questions
1. Is there a more intuitive explanation for this method that would make it more understandable?
2. Will the code and data be open source?

### Confidence
3: You are fairly confident in your assessment. It is possible that you did not understand some parts of the submission or that you are unfamiliar with some pieces of related work. Math/other details were not carefully checked.

### Summary
This work proposed the feature shaping method in OOD detection. By dividing K intervals, the vector of the K dimension is constructed, named the ISFI vector. Based on this vector, they optimize theta to increase the score of in-distribution and decrease the score of out-distribution. The authors showed the effectiveness of their approach on various architectures compared to existing feature shaping methods.

### Strengths
- Compared to previous feature shaping methods, the proposed method is effective on various architectures, especially on MLP architectures.

### Weaknesses
 - What is the motivation to introduce ISFI? For example, ReAct [A] observes the distribution of per-unit activation for In and out-distribution data.
- I am confused about the meaning of Figure 2. Suppose that z of M dimension is given. Then, theta of ReAct [A] is also M dimension because ReAct conducts the operation on each element of feature z. theta of the proposed method is K dimension determined by the number of intervals. I am not sure whether it is possible to put the plots together.
- theta is optimized over the proposed optimization problem that the closed form exists. However, other feature shaping methods [A, B] do not have the other parameters to be optimized.
- Other feature shaping methods [A, B] said that their methods have comparable performance in distribution distribution after applying their methods. Can authors discuss this point?

### Questions
Please refer to the weaknesses.

1. The paper is written well and is easy to understand.
2. The studied problem is very important.
3. The results seem to outperform state-of-the-art.

### Weaknesses
1. I am curious about the comparison of the proposed method with the methods that can train with the real outliers in different benchmarks.
2. In terms of the feature-shaping methods, I am curious how well the proposed method compared to the OOD detection using contrastive learning objectives to reshape the feature, such as CSI and SSD [1,2] on different benchmarks and mode architectures.
