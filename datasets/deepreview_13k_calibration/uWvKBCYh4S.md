## Abstract
LoRA has gained widespread acceptance in the fine-tuning of large pre-trained models to cater to a diverse array of downstream tasks, showcasing notable effectiveness and efficiency, thereby solidifying its position as one of the most prevalent fine-tuning techniques. Due to the modular nature of LoRA's plug-and-play plugins, researchers have delved into the amalgamation of multiple LoRAs to empower models to excel across various downstream tasks. Nonetheless, extant approaches for LoRA fusion grapple with inherent challenges. Direct arithmetic merging may result in the loss of the original pre-trained model's generative capabilities or the distinct identity of LoRAs, thereby yielding suboptimal outcomes. On the other hand, Reference tuning-based fusion exhibits limitations concerning the requisite flexibility for the effective combination of multiple LoRAs. In response to these challenges, this paper introduces the Mixture of LoRA Experts (MoLE) approach, which harnesses hierarchical control and unfettered branch selection. The MoLE approach not only achieves superior LoRA fusion performance in comparison to direct arithmetic merging but also retains the crucial flexibility for combining LoRAs effectively. Extensive experimental evaluations conducted in both the Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Vision \& Language (V\&L) domains substantiate the efficacy of MoLE.

### Summary
This paper proposes technique to combine various LoRA (corresponding to different characteristics) via Mixture Of LoRA Experts (MOLE). The technique overcomes the limitations of existing methods of combining LoRAs. The main idea is to combine different LoRAs via a learnable gating mechanism.

### Strengths
1. The idea of combining different LoRA via gating mechanism is intuitive and novel. 
2. Authors perform extensive set of experiments and show the effectiveness of the technique both in Vision and NLP domain. 
3. Authors perform a detailed ablation study to assess various losses and different components.

### Weaknesses
1. Authors motivate (section 3.1) the need for Mixture of LoRA for the vision domain but it is not clear if it is also required for the NLP domain as well or not (as also indicated by marginal improvement in results).
2. For the NLP domain the evaluation is done only for one classification task (NLI) and no generative task (e.g., summarization or translation) is evaluated. Analogous to vision domain, it would be great to see effect would MOLE bring in during generation.

### Questions
Did authors conduct experiments on the task of machine translation or summarization or any other text generation task?

### Summary
The author regards each low-rank adapters as an individual expert, and proposes mixture of expert to combine multiple LoRAs. The proposed MoLE method achieves better LoRA fusion performance compared to direct arithmetic merging. A gating balance loss is proposed to avoid training only few LoRA experts. Empirical results validate the proposed method.

### Strengths
+ The motivation of combining MOE with LoRA is sound. Different from the original LoRA, the LoRA weights from both the attention and mlp layers are regarded as one individual LoRA expert.
+ A penalty loss is proposed to tackle the gating imbalance issue, so that more LoRA experts are well-trained.
+ For text-to-image generation task in the V&L domain, the proposed MoLE achieves better average scores. In figure 9, the generated image follows text instructions better.

### Weaknesses
 + Overall, for NLI tasks in NLP domain, the proposed MoLE shows similar average performance compared with LoRAhub.
+ Combining MOE with LoRA seems straightforward.
+ No other LoRA merging variants are compared in experiments.

### Questions
+ For the gating imbalance, instead of introducing a new loss, can we just increase the temperature? What's the difference in empirical performance?
+ From the motivation of the proposed MoLE for hierarchical control, do you think it's better suited for the text-to-image generation task than the NLI task?

### Summary
This paper studies the question of how to combine multiple experts adapted from the same pretrained model to maximize generalization of the combination. Particularly, each expert corresponds to adapting the pretrained model using low-rank adaptation (LoRA) on a separate (subset of a) dataset. Unlike prior work that uses a simple addition of multiple LoRA modules or gradient-based methods for combining them, this work proposes a gating mechanism that computes weights for the modules based on the outputs from the pretrained model and each of the modules. Additionally, this work also proposes making the combination more fine-grained, with the mixture weights being layer or block specific in a transformer based model.

Experiments in text-to-image generation and natural language inference (text-only) with 3-4 experts show that the proposed approach outperforms simple combination, and other methods comparable to simple combinations (SVDiff and LoRAHub).

### Strengths
- Learning a gating function to combine LoRA modules is a sensible idea and is generally motivated well in the paper.
- The proposed approach does not add too many additional parameters.

### Weaknesses
Many details in the paper are unclear
- The related work in Section 2.2 can be more clearly explained. Particularly, it is claimed that the "arithmetic operation-based fusion" suffers from "identity confusion among multiple LoRAs". This issue needs to be clarified. How does the proposed approach fix this issue? Also, the details of the "reference tuning-based fusion" method are unclear. Is the approach from Gu et al., 2023 comparable to this work? If so, why is this approach not compared against them?
- Training method: Section 3.5 says that only the gating parameters were trained, and the others were frozen. Does this mean the LoRA parameters were first individually trained and then kept frozen while the gating parameters were being trained? The current text implies that the LoRA parameters were never trained.
- Experiments: How were the number of experts chosen for both the experiments?
- Results: The results in Table 1 are unclear. What is the difference between LoRA expert 1 vs. expert 2 in the image alignment experiments? Is it the number of experts used? Why are these settings not shown for text alignment?

The experiments, especially the NLI ones, are limited and are not well-motivated.
- Each of the experts is trained on one NLI dataset, and the mixture is evaluated on a mixture of NLI datasets. These are all essentially the same task. What are the experts expected to learn differently in these tasks? It would make more sense to build task specific experts and generalize to new tasks.
- Moreover, the base model used is Flan-T5 which was already trained on all the NLI datasets used in this paper. It would make more sense to adapt the model to other datasets, or use a different base model.

### Questions
- In Table 1, results vary across settings (e.g.: robot+dog+clock vs. table+can+teapot) and the baselines are better in some settings. Do you have any insights into why MoLE works better in some settings and not all?
- In Table 2, what is the point of showing results from using different datasets to train the gating parameters? It might be helpful to evaluate how much the performance varies based on the choice of the data used for training the gating function, and check whether the variance is lower for MoLE compared to baselines.
- In Table 2, the labels under the “Model” column in the “In-Domain” setting must be typos. Instead of MoLE^{r}, MoLE^{c} etc., these should be MoLE^{ar1}, MoLE^{ar2} etc. Can you please confirm?
- In both image-generation and NLI experiments, the number of experts trained is between 3 and 5. How do you think the approach would scale to a larger number of experts?

### Summary
This paper introduces the Mixture of LoRA Experts (MOLE), a learnable gating function for combining multiple LoRAs. MOLE provides fine-grained hierarchical control. Gating balancing loss is used to train the learnable gate parameter. It surpasses the performance of direct arithmetic merging and retains the necessary flexibility to combine LoRAs effectively.

### Strengths
* The proposed method is simple and the architecture is light-weighted. 

* The authors define the problems reasonably and test the MoLE in two significant domains, NLP and V&L, showcasing its versatility.

### Weaknesses
 * The generation of images still meets problems. For example, the generated images do not match the text condition effectively, as shown in the first row of Figure 9. Most importantly, in the second and third rows, the texture of the V1 dog generated by MoLE is not well-preserved compared to the texture generated by other baselines, especially to simple fusion.

* The samples are not enough to support the claims in VL tasks. Only one example demonstrates the ability to combine multiple experts in Figure 9, and only three examples are shown for a single-expert combination. Most importantly, only four examples are used for quantitative experiments, which is insufficient to get solid conclusions.

* The improvement is marginal for both VL and NLP tasks. From Table 1, we can find that MOLE cannot achieve the best text-alignment score for 2/4 cases and cannot achieve the best image-alignment score in the second row for 3/4 cases. For NLP tasks, the improvement is marginal in many cases of cross-domain and in-domain settings. Hence, more experiments are needed to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed MoLE.

### Questions
* Could you provide more examples for both quantitative and qualitative experiments of VL tasks? 

* Could you provide more results on different NLP datasets and tasks?
