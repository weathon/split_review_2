## Abstract
Table understanding capability of Large Language Models (LLMs) has been extensively studied through the task of question-answering (QA) over tables. Typically, only a small part of the whole table is relevant to derive the answer for a given question. The irrelevant parts act as noise and are \textit{distracting information}, resulting in sub-optimal performance due to the vulnerability of LLMs to noise. To mitigate this, we propose \textbf{\approachname}\ (\approachtext) -- a framework to enable LLMs to focus on relevant tabular data by suppressing extraneous information. \approachname\ comprises an Unsupervised Relevance Scorer (URS), trained differentially with the QA LLM, that weighs the table content based on its relevance to the input question before feeding it to the question-answering LLM (QA LLM). To further aid the relevance scorer, \approachname\ employs a weakly supervised module that generates a parsing statement describing the criteria of rows and columns relevant to the question and highlights the content of corresponding table cells. \approachname\ significantly outperforms various tabular LLM baselines, as well as GPT3-based in-context learning methods, is more robust to noise, maintains outperformance on tables of varying sizes, and establishes new SoTA performance on WikiTQ, FeTaQA, and WikiSQL datasets.

### Summary
To minimize the negative effects from the noisy and distracting information from irrelevant parts of the table, in this work, the authors propose CABINET framework that weighs different table parts based on their relevance to the question without explicitly removing any content. The main part of this framework is on the relevance score assignment, either with unsupervised learning or leveraging external weakly-supervised cell highlighter model, which provides the relevance measurement between table content and question. 
Specifically, variational inference is used to obtain the relevance score with unsupervised fashion. Furthermore, CABINET leverages a parsing statement generator that describes which rows and columns are relevant to the question to provide more matching information. Experimental results show that: (1) The relevance score with three designed loss functions can improve the model performance. (2) The relevance scores obtained from unsupervised setting and weakly-supervised setting should be balanced to obtain good performance.

### Strengths
The model achieves the state-of-the-art performance on the WikiTQ, FetaQA and WikiSQL using orders of magnitude fewer parameters when compared of LLMs such as Codex. 
Furthermore, the model is more robust on the perturbation than other counterparts. Also for large tables, the CABINET also shows better performance than OmniTab.  
The authors smartly use the ToTTo dataset to train a cell highlighter model for obtaining the relevance score from the parsing statement. 
The ~300 manually annotated example for parsing statement generation will be very useful for the community.

### Weaknesses
Even though there is a good ablation experiments on the three loss functions, my overall feeling is that there is no good rational how these loss function interact with each other. For example, we can see that combining all three loss functions performs best. However, the benefits of a single loss function is hard to be observed. I think this strategy can be further applied to reading comprehension task. If it works, this can make the paper more comprehensive, having broader impact. No other weaknesses in my mind but there are some technical questions in Question section.

### Questions
What’s the performance of cell highlighter on ToTTo validation set? Do we have evaluations on some sampled examples from FetaQA, WikiTQ, and WikiSQL showing the quality of parsing statement generator? If the quality of parsing statement is high but putting more weight on that makes the model perform worse, then it would be an interesting point to discuss.
From Table 4, there is a big improvement of using all three loss functions against the models without using all three loss functions. Do we have some case studies showing where the improvements come from?

### Summary
This paper introduces a novel architecture for table QA. It is with two components, which are the main contributions of this paper. Unsupervised Relevance Scorer provides a "soft" assignment score for each row of the table given the question. Relevant Cell Predictor through Table Parsing converts the question into a statement with highlighted column and row information that can be used to solve the QA tasks. This method achieves SOTA performances on WikiTable, FeTaQA, and WikiSQL. Overall, this is a great paper.

### Strengths
* This paper proposed a novel framework for table QA tasks
* The proposed method achieves SOTA performances on three table QA tasks
* The paper shows the robustness of the provided model

### Weaknesses
 * Unlike a "hard" table token retriever, the computation of the model proposed by this paper may be extensive when the number of table tokens is many. 
* More ablation studies are needed to support the needs of the components introduced in this paper.

### Questions
* What is the average model inference latency compared with the baseline model (OmniTAB) for the three tasks
* More ablation studies are needed to support the needs of the components introduced in this paper. 
  - The need for an Unsupervised Relevance Scorer: If we replace URS with BM25 or some out-of-the-box similarity metrics, will the model have a huge performance decline?
  - The need for a Parsing Statement Generator: If the original question is directly used for cell highlighter other than the parsed text, will the model have a huge performance decline?
  - The need for a Cell Highlighter: If the $\eta^{cell}$ is the indicator for a cell value in the parsed text, will the model have a huge performance decline?

### Summary
This paper tackles the task of table Question-Answering (QA). The authors state that the approaches considering all the tables have too much noise when generating the answer, while approaches selecting a part of the table before answering might remove the relevant parts. The authors thus propose to estimate the relevance of each token based on a clustering approach with latent variable (Srivastava and Sutton, 2017), coupled with two custom losses (sparsity of the relevance cluster and distance between the centroids). They combine this token relevance score with a predictor of a table "cell relevance" based on a sequence-to-sequence model that outputs the relevant cells from a full table. 

Results reported on the main table QA datasets (WikiTableQuestion, FeTaQa, and WikiSQL) show a noticeable improvement (e.g. gaining 3 points in accuracy compared to a LLM/Codex prompting approach that select subtables, DATER, on WikiTQ). Experiments consisting in perturbing the tables (adding rows, column/row permutation, cell replacement) show that the method is more robust than OmniTAB and ReasTAP. Finally,

### Strengths
- The approach has good results on the main table QA dataset
- The ablation study shows that each subcomponent of the model is important
- The model outperforms LLM-based approaches with a much lower number of parameters (175B vs 3.5B) and other state-of-the-art approaches (e.g. OmniTAB)

### Weaknesses
 - The overall model is quite complex, relying on various subcomponents of different natures: this paper provides a new baseline, but it is hard to build from that
- The cell relevance loss is not learned, making the model not end-to-end
- Using a latent variable for relevance, which is optimized as within a probabilistic model for relevance, but then used as a scalar, makes the model a bit inconsistent - a fully probabilistic model would have been much sounder
- there are missing experimental details

### Questions
- section 3.1, the whole paragraph discussing variational inference sounds strange: variational inference is a method to estimate laternt variable probabilities - stating that "we model ... as a latent variable ... **through VI**" is not correct

- the experimental details (how the model was trained, how hyperparameters were set) are not given; could the authors provide the information (at least in the appendix)?

- How is the model used during inference (i.e. how is the VI-related loss used to predict the relevance of each token)?

- is the clustering model that important? Would predicting directly a probability of relevance for each token work?

- p.9, please correct "its performance" to "TAPEX performance" for clarity

### Summary
The authors propose CABINET (Content RelevAnce-Based NoIse ReductioN for TablE QuesTion-Answering) – a framework to enable LLMs to focus on relevant tabular data by suppressing extraneous information. CABINET comprises an Unsupervised Relevance Scorer, trained differentially with the QA LLM, that weighs the table content based on its relevance to the input question before feeding it to the question-answering LLM (QA LLM). Further, it uses a weakly supervised module that generates a parsing statement describing the criteria of rows and columns relevant to the question and highlights the content of corresponding table cells. Authors release code and dataset to enable for reproducibility.

### Strengths
The paper is technically sound and in general well written. Figure 2 is also informative.

### Weaknesses
- The authors need to better motivate what the practical utility of Table QA is, as most of the questions are based in the format of natural language text sentences. Moreover, tabular dataset can be indexed and converted to their freeform text representations which general open-domain QA systems are already able to solve. It is not clear why a dedicated Table QA system is needed when existing open-domain QA systems could potentially address this problem by processing the linearized table data.

- In the Related Work Section, the authors should also discuss recent developments with LLM guided graph neural network (GNN) model for QA to capture tabular/graph structure:

[1] EACL 2023: Question-Answer Sentence Graph for Joint Modeling Answer Selection. In Proceedings of the 17th Conference of the European Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics, pages 968–979, Dubrovnik, Croatia. Association for Computational Linguistics.
[2] AAAI 2020: TANDA: Transfer and Adapt Pre-Trained Transformer Models for Answer Sentence Selection. AAAI 2020: 7780-7788

- It would be helpful if the authors could better summarize the statistics of their datasets in tabular as opposed to text format. Further, based on the text description, I have a concern that the datasets being used are relatively small-scale, e.g., in the order of thousands of nodes. The experiment results would be more conclusive if evaluated on large-scale datasets. To this end, the authors also should provide analysis on the runtime and memory complexities of their work, since M/B parameter LLMs may not be scalable for training time.
