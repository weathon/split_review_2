## Abstract
There is a growing interest in using Large Language Models (LLMs) as agents to tackle real-world tasks that may require assessing complex situations. Yet, we have a limited understanding of LLMs' reasoning and decision-making capabilities, partly stemming from a lack of dedicated evaluation benchmarks. As negotiating and compromising are key aspects of our everyday communication and collaboration, we propose using scorable negotiation games as a new evaluation framework for LLMs. We create a testbed of diverse text-based, multi-agent, multi-issue, semantically rich negotiation games, with easily tunable difficulty. To solve the challenge, agents need to have strong arithmetic, inference, exploration, and planning capabilities, while seamlessly integrating them. Via a systematic zero-shot Chain-of-Thought prompting (CoT), we show that agents can negotiate and consistently reach successful deals. We quantify the performance with multiple metrics and observe a large gap between GPT-4 and earlier models. Importantly, we test the generalization to new games and setups. Finally, we show that these games can help evaluate other critical aspects, such as the interaction dynamics between agents in the presence of greedy and adversarial players.

### Summary
This paper introduces negotiation games as an innovative evaluation benchmark for LLMs. These games assess LLMs' performance, limitations, and potential misuse in practical negotiation scenarios, such as customer service, contract agreements, and decision-making. The study demonstrates that GPT-4 significantly outperforms earlier models in negotiation tasks, showing strong zero-shot reasoning abilities. It explores agent interactions in unbalanced adversarial settings, revealing how agent behavior can be modulated to affect negotiation outcomes. The benchmark includes diverse negotiation games with multiple parties, different issues, and varying priorities, providing room for further enhancements. The paper plans to make its toolkit of negotiation games and code publicly available to facilitate future research in this area.

### Strengths
1. Practical Relevance: The choice of negotiation as an evaluation task is motivated by its practical importance in various real-life situations, such as customer service, contract agreements, and decision-making. LLMs are increasingly being used in such tasks, making their evaluation in negotiation crucial.

2. Interesting Adversarial Settings: The study explores agents' interactions in unbalanced adversarial settings, which are relevant for future autonomous systems with limited human oversight. It shows that agent behavior can be modulated to promote greediness or attack other agents, impacting negotiation outcomes.

3. Diverse Benchmark: The paper creates a diverse benchmark of negotiation games, including multiple parties, different issues, and varying priorities. This benchmark provides a quantifiable measure of LLM performance and room for further enhancements.

### Weaknesses
1. The negotiation games employed in this paper involve a simple setup with limited actions and a public communication channel. Real-world negotiations can be more complex, including private messages, alliances, and natural language conversations. The action space, while having a large number of combinations, is still constrained to supporting previous deals or making new proposals, which may not fully capture the richness of real-world negotiation strategies. For example, the model cannot make conditional offers or engage in more complex bargaining tactics.

2. The study primarily considers adversarial players restricted by valid negotiation actions. Other forms of attacks, such as adversarial suffixes, are not explored. This limits the scope of the adversarial analysis, as real-world scenarios might involve more sophisticated attacks that exploit vulnerabilities in the LLM's input processing or reasoning mechanisms. The current setup does not test the model's robustness against such attacks.

3. While the paper highlights LLMs' strong zero-shot reasoning in negotiation games, it acknowledges that fine-tuning on real-world negotiation scenarios may be necessary for practical applications. The paper does not provide a clear path for how this fine-tuning would be achieved, especially given the lack of readily available datasets for complex negotiation scenarios. Can this be improved?

4. Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting strategies are abductive in nature.  Employing that to improve reasoning is strange.

### Questions
The work of SocraSynth has received much attention, enjoying over 10k views.  Please articulate the differences between this work and the approach of SocraSynth, e.g., purposes, techniques, and applications.

For instance, as far as I can tell, SocraSynth focuses on knowledge synthesis and reasoning using LLMs, enabling the extraction of deep insights and information from these models. Negotiation games, on the other hand, assess LLMs' abilities in practical negotiation scenarios, emphasizing their interactive behavior and potential for manipulation.  Please comment on if this makes sense.

### Summary
This paper studies the capabilities of LLMs in negotiation tasks. To this end, the authors propose a novel test-bed, which contains multiple negotiation games, all based on the same template/base game. Additional games are obtained via an LLM-based generation process. Using this testbed, the paper aims to showcase the utility of LLMs + CoT promoting for negotiation tasks. The experiments suggest that LLM-based agents can successfully reach deals in negotiation tasks, but also that the performance depends on the sophistication level of the LLM considered.

### Strengths
Strengths:
- The empirical study conducted in this paper systematically evaluates the performance of large language models in negotiation tasks, which require a combination of skills important for strategic reasoning in partially observable multi-agent environments. To my knowledge, the results obtained are novel and they shed a light on the utility of LLMs in complex decision making settings. The paper also provides some insight on the robustness of LLM-based decision makers to adversarial behavior in multi-agent scenarios.  
- The paper introduces a new testbed, suitable for studying negotiation capabilities of large language models. The testbed is based on a multi-player text-based game, and the paper additionally provides a protocol for generating new instances of the game using LLMs.

### Weaknesses
Weaknesses: 
- My main concern is that the experimental study is somewhat restrictive given that its test-bed is based on one template/base game. Due to this property of the experimental setup, it is hard to say whether the conclusions made from the experimental results would generalize to negotiation tasks that deviate from this structure. Admittedly, the paper considers a couple of variants of the base negotiation game, but it's not clear whether they constitute a sufficient set of robustness checks. 
- From a conceptual/technical point of view, the novelty of this work is somewhat limited. Similar experimental protocol have already been considered by prior work, for example, in (Ghandi et al. 2023b), albeit analyzing different aspects, e.g. ((Ghandi et al. 2023b) focus on strategic reasoning). 
- Some results could be easily expanded to provide further insights about the claims made in the paper. Below I outline a couple of potential improvements. 
- The paper rightly recognizes that negotiation requires strong arithmetic, inference, exploration, and planning capabilities. However, the current set of results provide only high-level insights regarding these skills. It may be useful to examine combinations of skills, and identify which of them were "missing" in unsuccessful instances of the negotiation game. 
-  Additional game variants would help in understanding the generalization of the results in 5.5. For example, it would be useful to have "All in - two greedy" or "Two out" to support the claims in the section.  
- One could use mixed populations, where some agents are GPT-4 while others are GPT-3.5. Similarly, for other aspects studied in the ablation studies in Section 5.2, one could create mixed populations.

### Questions
Please see my comments above. Any clarifications would be welcome. A couple of additional questions:  

- For the instances considered in the paper, is it possible to calculate the outcomes when players acts as rational agents? If so, how would these outcome compare to those obtained by LLMs? 

- In the game "All in - one greedy"/"One out", are all the agents aware that there is one agent that is selfish/adversarial? 

- Could you explain the choices of parameters in the negotiation game (the number of agents, options, etc.)? Do we expect any qualitative differences if we vary these parameters?

### Summary
This paper presents a new text-based, multi-agent, multi-issue, negotiation game to test the reasoning and decision-making capabilities of large language models. The paper conducts extensive analyses of GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 in different game setups (e.g., varying incentives), concluding that GPT-4 has strong zero-shot reasoning to achieve an effective deal.

### Strengths
Overall, I enjoyed reading this paper that tests the planning capability of LLMs. Strengths include: 
1. This paper introduces a novel setup for LLMs to interact with each other. The paper also conducts interesting analyses (e.g., GPT-3.5 vs GPT-4, various prompting styles, ToM study) and game setups (e.g., varying game difficulties, greedy and saboteur agents). 
2. This paper presents an interesting testbed to evaluate how well LLMs can interact with each other.

### Weaknesses
I could not find the main concerns about this paper. A possible con could be a relatively simpler setup (i.e., only a public communication channel and a small action set) compared to the Diplomacy paper. There are also some open questions that I would like to ask after reading this paper (please refer to the Questions section).

### Questions
1. In Section 3, is a feasible deal guaranteed to exist for any combinations of BATNA?
2. if some parties are using LLMs with higher capabilities (e.g., GPT-4) over other parties (e.g., GPT-3), would this setup result in the higher capability group achieving a better negotiation deal than the other group?
3. Could agents converge to some game-theoretic solution (e.g., Nash equilibrium, correlated equilibrium) as a result of the negotiation?

Minor:

4: You are confident in your assessment, but not absolutely certain. It is unlikely, but not impossible, that you did not understand some parts of the submission or that you are unfamiliar with some pieces of related work.

### Summary
- This paper introduces a evaluation framework for Large Language Models using scorable negotiation games
- LLMs show capabilities in arithmetic, inference, exploration, and planning in the game
- By employing a systematic zero-shot Chain-of-Thought prompting, the paper shows that LLMs can effectively negotiate and achieve successful deals
- The study quantifies LLM performance across various game setups, highlighting differences between LLMs

### Strengths
- The paper is well-written, and the game is clearly defined.

### Weaknesses
 - The inherent values of large language model, cultivated during their training phase, predispose them towards universally accepted "good" objectives. This inclination becomes evident in scenarios like negotiations, where large language model might naturally champion causes like environmental conservation. However, even with a predefined game context and role, the large language model might not consistently align with the reward mechanism of its assigned role. For instance, when trained with contrary objectives, such as being "malevolent", an large language model might easily counter proposals it would have otherwise endorsed. Given this predisposition influenced by underlying values, I question the appropriateness of evaluating an large language model's capabilities in a game setting susceptible to such biases.

- The authors have conceptualized a text-based game to assess LLM agents' actions and subsequently compared different LLMs' performances within this framework. However, both the foundational premise of the paper and the employed research methodology lack novelty.

### Questions
Have the authors tried to fine-tune an LLM to make its action align to the reward of the roles in these kinds of game?
