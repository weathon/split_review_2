## Abstract
Visual reinforcement learning (RL) has shown promise in continuous control tasks.
Despite its progress, current algorithms are still unsatisfactory in virtually every aspect of the performance such as sample efficiency, asymptotic performance, and their robustness to the choice of random seeds.
In this paper, we identify a major shortcoming in existing visual RL methods that is the agents often exhibit sustained inactivity during early training, thereby limiting their ability to explore effectively. 
Expanding upon this crucial observation, we additionally unveil a significant correlation between the agents' inclination towards motorically inactive exploration and the absence of neuronal activity within their policy networks.
To quantify this inactivity, we adopt dormant ratio~\citep{dormant} as a metric to measure inactivity in the RL agent's network.
Empirically, we also recognize that the dormant ratio can act as a standalone indicator of an agent's activity level, regardless of the received reward signals.
Leveraging the aforementioned insights, we introduce \ours, a method that uses three core mechanisms to guide agents' exploration-exploitation trade-offs by actively minimizing the dormant ratio. 
Experiments demonstrate that  \ours achieves significant improvements in sample efficiency and asymptotic performance with no broken seeds (76 seeds in total) across three continuous control benchmark environments, including DeepMind Control Suite, MetaWorld, and Adroit.
Most importantly, \ours is the first model-free algorithm that consistently solves tasks in both the Dog and Manipulator domains from the DeepMind Control Suite as well as three dexterous hand manipulation tasks without demonstrations in Adroit, all based on pixel observations.

### Summary
This paper identifies a pervasive issue in pixel-based RL, where the agent's
policy has few activations and limited activity in the early phases of learning.
Related to this phenomenon is neuron dormancy, and the authors propose an
algorithm that uses this insight in three mechanisms: weight perturbation,
exploration and exploitation. The combination of these three improvements is
referred to as Dormant ratio Minimization (DrM), and the authors claim that this
algorithm is the first (documented and model-free) algorithm to solve dog and
manipulator, demonstration-free adroit, and is generally sample efficient in
various environments.

### Strengths
- The insight is derived from seemingly unrelated but recent work on Neuron
  Dormancy, which explains how the phenomenon can impact learning in neural
  networks through a potential plasticity mechanism. This paper seems to
  provides a novel lens for the phenomenon, showing that neural activity can be
  correlated with exploration, and that explicitly minimizing dormancy,
  reinforcement algorithms can be improved in their ability to both explore and
  'exploit'.
- The paper is overall well written. The empirical analysis is good and,
  although the statistical power is low due to a small sample size, the
  improvements seem statistically significant. I particularly like that the
  dormancy ratio is in-fact minimized, because the algorithm seems to be doing
  this implicitly. The algorithm does seem to achieve SOTA on a few challenging
  continuous control problems with relevant baselines. Overall, the
  contributions are convincing.

### Weaknesses
 - The foundational motivation for dormancy ratio minimization is not entirely
  convincing. It is not clear why high neuron dormancy should necessarily lead
  to a decrease in exploration, even if this was empirically observed. It is
  also not that clear why a lower neuron dormancy may lead to more exploration.
  I think the paper would benefit from a more careful treatment of this finding,
  either with further experiment, a toy model/study, theory or merely some text
  describing why this should be expected.
- There are a few aspects of the proposed algorithm that are mildly worrying.
  First is the exploitation mechanism. I do not understand how exploitation is
  determined by a hyperparameter controlling a value update towards a
  state-value or an action-value. 
- The second thing is that the algorithm
  proposes three mechansism, each with a hyperparmeter that governs a schedule.
  This provides several degrees of freedom to improve upon the base algorithm,
  and no hyperparameter study is conducted. This is not good empirical science,
  but the empirical demonstration of success on hard problems does at least hold
  promise for further work. 

Overall, I think the first and second weakness are both more pressing and addressable within a rebuttal period.

### Questions
- Section 3 (Language surrounding Dormant Ratio, specifically beginning of 3.2): While you demonstrate the empirial obervation that low neuron dormancy is correlated with meanginful high-level behavior, it is overclaiming to say that it is essential. I can imagine an approach to construct a neural network with an arbitrarily high dormancy ratio by encapsulating any policy within a much larger but inactive network. Thus, it is not necessarily the case that high dormancy ratio translates to less meaningful behavior, but that it can be correlated with it during training.
- Section 3 (Expectile Regression and Exploitation): This section seems to build off recent work, and I am not familiar with "blended exploitation and exploration". However, I do not see how the proposed method has anything to do with exploitation. Exploitation and exploration are fundamentally about control and action, but this section is primarily about the target of a temporal difference method. But even putting that aside, I do not see why placing higher weight on the state value function should empahsize exploitation, or why placing higher weight on the action value function should emphasize exploration.
- Section 3 (Hyperparameters): The method involves three components, each with at least one hyperparameter. This gives your proposed algorithm a number of additional degrees of freedom over the base algorithm and the other baselines. Looking at the experiments, there is an ablation study for each individual component but no results on the sensitivity to the various hyperparameters. It would have been good to explore this, at least in one of the simpler environments.
- Section 4 (Dormant ratio analysis): Validating the fact that the dormancy ratio is indeed minimized vs the base algorithm is interesting. One thing that would strengthen these results further is to show that the other baselines (A-LIX, TACO) are similar to DrQ-v2 in that they do not minimize the dormancy ratio on at least some problem. It would also be interesting to investigate why there is some periodicity in the dormancy ratio such as in humanoid run and manipulator.
- Section 4 (Ablation study): I appreciate the effort to ablate your algorithm in Adroit, a relatively complex environment. One thing that would help is to show whether each component of DrM is faithful to its motivation. For example, the exploration mechanism could be shown to have a large influence on performance in environments that require exploration and less influence on environments that do not require as much exploration. This would also serve as an opportunity to further elaborate on what the exploitation mechanism accomplishes.

# Minor
- Section 2 (visual RL): Is it necessarily the case that your setting is POMDP and that the observations provided to the agent lack some information? While this can be true in some settings, the environment is usually constructed so that the observatiosn do include all necessary information (e.g. concatenation of frames in Atari).
- Section 2 (Dormant Ratio): You use the term "Linear layer" in both definitions, but I am not sure whether this is required in the definition or what it is that you mean. Does it mean the last layer that usually maps the penultimate activations to the output?

### Summary
The paper provides insight that the dormant ratio of the network acts can indicate if the agent is effectively exploring or not. Based on this insight, several mechanisms are proposed to use the dormant ratio to handle the exploration-exploitation trade-off. The results show that the proposed mechanism significantly improves performance and sample efficiency over existing methods.

### Strengths
The central insight provided in the paper is very interesting. The main idea is that when the dormant ratio is very high, the agent is not getting diverse experience, so it would be good to increase exploration at this point. The insight is verified by looking at the dormant ratio and the agent's behaviour for some seeds.
This insight is then used to control the exploration-exploitation trade-off. Using an internal indicator like the dormant ratio is a promising direction to tackle the exploration-exploitation dilemma as it does not depend on any external signals like reward. 

The results show that the proposed method, DrM, is effective in many visual RM domains and significantly outperforms existing methods.

### Weaknesses
Although the paper has interesting ideas and promising results, some of the weaknesses stop me from recommending a full acceptance of the paper.
-**Weak empirical evaluation** All of the experiments are performed with just four random seeds, which raises questions about the statistical significance of the results. I refer the authors to Patterson et al. (2023) on how to perform good empirical experiments. I realize that it might not be feasible to do 30 runs for all environment-algorithm pairs, but there should be at least one experiment in the paper that will stand the test of time. I suggest that the authors perform at least ten runs for all algorithms in some environments, maybe on the four dense tasks in MetaWorld (from Figure 7). The lack of statistical rigor makes it difficult to ascertain the true performance gains of the proposed method, especially when the performance differences are not substantial. For example, in some cases, the performance curves of DrM and the baselines appear very close, and without proper statistical analysis, it's hard to conclude if the improvements are significant or just due to random fluctuations.
-**Too strong claims** For example, the last line of Section 3.1 says, " ... all the hyperparameters in this approach are robust to tasks and domains.". However, no evidence is provided for this claim. Their method introduces 4 or 5 new hyper-parameters, and different values are used for different environments. This means that the same hyperparameter is not optimal across domains. The claim of hyperparameter robustness is further weakened by the fact that the authors tune the maximum perturbation rate and the exploitation expectile value for different environments, suggesting that these parameters are not universally applicable. The paper should provide a more thorough analysis of the sensitivity of the method to its hyperparameters, perhaps by showing the performance variation with different hyperparameter settings on a few representative tasks.

### Questions
What value of $\hat{\beta}$ is used in Figures 3 and 4? This should be specified in the figure itself. 

What exactly is the linear schedule, $\sigma_{linear}$, of exploration? The paper says that it's the same as defined in DrQ-v2. However, I believe the paper should be as self-contained as possible, so details like this should be provided in the appendix.

---------------

I've increased my score as new results largely overcome my initial concerns.

### Summary
This paper presents an algorithm which leverages the fraction of dormant units in the network to guide exploratory behaviour. The resulting method demonstrates significant improvements over baseline algorithms that use naive exploration strategies on a variety of challenging robotic manipulation domains.

### Strengths
- The paper evaluates on more than one domain
- The proposed method significantly outperforms the baselines compared against.
- The paper performs an ablation on a single environment of the different components of the proposed method
- Nice contrast with other adaptive exploration methods which use e.g. bandit methods to select epsilon-greedy exploration parameter. 
- Pseudocode is provided for each component of the proposed method
- The proposed method depends on a single easy to measure property of the network state
- The correlation between the dormant ratio and the qualitative properties of the network's exploration is intriguing.
- The idea of strategically exploring based on properties of an agent's representation is a new and exciting approach which I think could be applied more broadly in RL and could be really useful to the community.

### Weaknesses
 - The design choices going into the main method proposed by the paper are not given sufficient motivation, and I am concerned that although the algorith does indeed improve performance, it does not do so for the reasons claimed. In particular:
        - Why is the method using shrink and perturb rather than directly resetting inactive units? Is it possible that S&P is introducing additional exploration due to the noisy updates to the parameters, similarly to the "noisy nets" strategy of Fortunato et al.?
        - The exploration strategy appears to actually introduce *more* noise after the network is "activated" than it used before activation due to the max operator. However, the motivation for this noise adaptation is to introduce more noise early in training when the network's behaviours are less interesting. I agree that this should have the effect of increasing exploratory behaviour throughout training compared to using a schedule, but not in the way claimed by the paper.
        - What motivates the modelling assumption that the network only becomes "activated" once in its training trajectory? Why is it assumed that the number of inactive units will not drop repeatedly?
        - The use of expectiles introduces a large benefit in training based on the ablation study, but the optimal expectile seems to depend on the environment. Is there additional justification for using expectiles beyond the empirical benefit and the additional knob to tune in the training algorithm?
- I have some concerns about the fairness of the comparisons employed in this work:
        - Each of the components of the method seem to increase exploratory behaviour. However, the baselines compared against do not incorporate any particularly sophisticated exploration strategies (DrQv2 uses a linear scheduler and it doesn't look like A-LIX or TACO improve upon this). 
        - The proposed algorithm has a number of hyperparameters which have different optimal values for different environments. As a result, I'm not sure how much of the performance gain observed in the paper is due to finetuning of these additional hyperparameters vs the fundamental benefits of the method.
        - Given the different optimal values of the expectile and perturbation scale for different environments, the robustness of the method to its hyperparameters is a major concern to me. How much worse is performance if the optimal hyperparameters for one domain are used in another?
- While I appreciate the pseudocode provided in the appendix, there are some issues with clarity. For example, algorithm 2 says that one creates a deep copy of the network and stores this in the variable new_net, but then the next line randomly initializes the weights of new_net. What did the copy step do? Algorithm 1 lines 6-7 are also extremely vague and should be clarified with an equation.
- Related to my concerns about design choices, there are many aspects of the algorithm that seem unnecessarily complicated -- for example, one could simply use an exploration noise value equal to the sigmoid of the dormant unit fraction discussed, or use a maximal exploration noise until the awakened threshold is met and then start the noise decay. I would appreciate ablations which illustrate the importance of these design choices.
- The use of the term "exploitation" seems inaccurate to me. Exploitation is usually used to refer to greedy behaviour with respect to the network's predictions. In this case, exploitation refers more to optimistic Q-target updates which bias towards higher expectiles, encouraging the network to visit states which have occasionally yielded high rewards in the past. This approach would presumably lead to overestimation of Q-values in noisy environments and potentially result in suboptimal policies where the agent is attracted to high-variance, low-expectation states. I think the paper would benefit from a clearer discussion of what precisely this component of the method is doing, and potentially also a rebrand to characterize it more as a "risk-seeking" parameter rather than an "exploitation" parameter.

### Questions
- There is a lack of clarity in the causality of the phenomenon studied by the paper: is the claim that interesting behaviour leads to greater data variety and thus less overfitting and inactive units, or is the idea that reduced representation capacity limits the range of behaviours that a network can express?
- How sensitive is the method to hyperparameters? 
- Could the authors provide additional justification for the expectile prediction component of their method, and illustrate what types of environments this might prove detrimental for?
- Can the authors comment on the design choices of their algorithm highlighted in the "weaknesses" section and provide justification for why the variant used in the paper is employed, rather than a simpler and more direct version of achieving the goal claimed for each component? For example, why the method perturbs all units rather than resetting dead ones, why exploration noise is potentially greater later in training than earlier due to the max operator, and why the expectile method which is described as *exploiting* past success should have the effect of prioritizing high-variance states and thus correspond to greater *exploratory* behaviour?
- How robust is the algorithm to the trajectory of dead units in networks trained on a particular environment? For example, if we considered a different architecture or set of tasks (perhaps ProcGen or Atari), would the strategies employed by the proposed method still provide the same benefit, or would they need to be re-tuned?

### Summary
This paper is inspired by recent work on the "dormant ratio", a measure of how many neurons are inactive in a deep RL agent's neural net. Previous work (Sokar et al., 2023) showed that a high dormant ratio is detrimental to learning, but this paper flips things around by considering the converse, interpreting a declining dormant ratio as a proxy for learning progress. The authors propose three adaptive hyperparameter scheduling mechanisms based on this idea. They evaluate the resultant algorithm, named DrM, in three visual continuous control domains, where it performs more stably and achieves better asymptotic performance than three other recent methods.

### Strengths
The greatest strength of the paper is the significance of the results. DrM is the clear winner on *all* of the tasks reported on in the paper, and in some domains (particularly Adroit) it achieves a step change improvement. I like that the authors have considered three separate domains (DeepMind Control Suite, MetaWorld and Adroit), with multiple tasks from each.

The main idea of treating the dormant ratio as a progress proxy, and hence using it as the basis for adaptive hyperparameter scheduling, makes intuitive sense. While I have some minor qualms about the writing (see below), the paper was clear and easy-to-read overall. Lastly, the coverage of the huge amount of related work from the last 2-3 years is about as thorough as possible.

### Weaknesses
My biggests concerns with the paper are its limited novelty a lack of proper ablations.

Novelty:

None of the three mechanisms introduced by DrM are novel in-and-of themselves.
- As noted in the paper, "dormant-ratio-guided perturbation" follows the previous work of (D'Oro et al., 2023; Ash & Adams, 2020).
- Similarly, "dormant-ratio-guided exploitation" is based on the work of Ji et al. (2023).
- The idea of scheduling the exploration rate goes back a very long way, pre-dating deep RL. Some recent approaches, e.g., Agent57 (Badia et al.), also use a form of adaptive exploration.

What *is* new is the idea of using the dormant ratio to schedule the hyperparameters of these methods. I don't disagree that this is novel; however, it's rather limited novelty in my opinion.

Ablations:

While Figure 10 contains some ablations, the three mechanisms are each ablated in their entirety. I'd prefer it if only the adaptive scheduling component were ablated for each method, since this is the novel part. In other words, for a fair comparison, DrM ought to be compared against DrQ + perturbation resets (with fixed $\alpha$) + "Blended Exploration and Exploitation operator" (with fixed $\lambda$).

Moreover, the ablations only consider one domain (Adroit) and the results are aggregated across all Adroit tasks. I'd prefer to see more ablations in greater granularity. For me, they're the most important part of the experiments, since without them it's very hard to understand *why* the improvements work. (The argument that DrM lowers the dormant ratio and hence improves performance seems very "chicken-egg" to me; it's unclear which is the cause and which is the effect. Only the dormant-ratio-guided perturbations seem to directly target the dormant ratio.)

Minor things:
- Section 3.1 is too unscientific, e.g., the claim "This suggests that the dormant ratio acts as an intrinsic metric, influenced more by the diversity and relevance of the agent's behaviors than by its received rewards". This is all based on one example, and the claim that RL agents learn relevant behaviours before their returns improve sounds dubious to me. Another too-bold claim is: "As the dormant ratio captures the intrinsic characteristics of an agent's policy network, all the hyperparameters in this approach are robust to tasks and domains." This is never established, and in fact Table 1 in the Appendix suggests that some parameters of DrM require domain-specific tuning.
- The claim in the abstract that DrM has "no broken seeds (76 seeds in total)" is a little vague (what constitutes "broken"?) and it's never really returned to in the main body of the paper.

### Questions
- In the "dormant-ratio-guided exploitation" section, it's mentioned that "value underestimation occurs as the agent starts to acquire skills, given that $\pi$ is sub-optimal". I don't quite follow this. As the agent starts to improve, wouldn't we expect $\pi$ to become less sub-optimal?
