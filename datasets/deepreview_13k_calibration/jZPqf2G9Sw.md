## Abstract
Current protein generative models are able to design novel backbones with desired shapes or functional motifs. However, despite the importance of a protein’s dynamical properties for its function, conditioning on dynamical properties remains elusive. We present a new approach to protein generative modeling by leveraging Normal Mode Analysis that enables us to capture dynamical properties too. We introduce a method for conditioning the diffusion probabilistic models on protein dynamics, specifically on the lowest non-trivial normal mode of oscillation. Our method, similar to the classifier guidance conditioning, formulates the sampling process as being driven by conditional and unconditional terms. However, unlike previous works, we approximate the conditional term with a simple analytical function rather than an external neural network, thus making the eigenvector calculations approachable. We present the corresponding SDE theory as a formal justification of our approach. We extend our framework to conditioning on structure and dynamics at the same time, enabling scaffolding of the dynamical motifs. We demonstrate the empirical effectiveness of our method by turning the open-source unconditional protein diffusion model Genie into the conditional model with no retraining. Generated proteins exhibit the desired dynamical and structural properties while still being biologically plausible. Our work represents a first step towards incorporating dynamical behaviour in protein design and may open the door to designing more flexible and functional proteins in the future.

### Summary
Tha manuscript presents a method for incorporating dynamics information in diffusion probabilistic models for protein generation. The central idea is to enforce the fluctuations in the samples to match the lowest mode of oscilation as predicted by a normal mode analysis. The authors demonstrate the general applicability of the method by combining it in a post-hoc fashion with the unconditioned Genie model to produce proteins compatible with provided dynamical properties.

### Strengths
To my knowledge, the presented method is novel. The manuscript is well written, and the paper appears technically sound. The conducted experiments are perhaps not as comprehensive as one might hope for, but they do demonstrate the basic premise of the approach. The problem addressed by this method is of fundamental importance, and any improvements in this area of research could therefore have significant impact.

### Weaknesses
While the paper reads well overall, there are parts where the clarity could be improved, in particular in the early description of the modelling task (what is being modelled), and in the technical description of the modeling approach (some variables undefined / details missing). The first point is in my view particularly important, because as it stands, it is difficult to read from the paper whether the method is generating: 1) protein sequence and structure, 2) protein backbone structure conditioned on sequence length, 3) protein structure conditioned on sequence, 4) protein backbone structure conditioned on nothing at all. It is to some extent possible to deduce these details from the conducted experiments, but I think this information should be stated more explicitly in the paper. Regarding technical details, these are more minor things that would make the paper easier to read. For details on both, see the questions below.

Related to the above, it would also benefit the paper if the authors briefly stated how they envision their approach to be useful in practice. If we have information about dynamics that we wish to impose on generated samples, we are presumably in a fairly constrained setting, where we wish to resample only parts of a protein. What are the advantages to conditioning a diffusion model on dynamics compared to for instance just using normal mode analysis (or coarse grained molecular dynamics) to generate a structural ensemble, and then use a model to predict amino acid identities conditioned on structure (i.e. some inverse folding model)?

Finally, the empirical evaluation of the method could have been stronger. Some of the results are primarily based on qualitative comparisons by-eye, or otherwise restricted to very specific motions. Clarification is also needed for some of the experimental setup (see details below).

Page 3, eq (4)
As far as I could see, z has not been introduced. Is this just a sample from a unit normal? Please clarify.

Page 3, eq (6)
Isn't there an "x" missing on the right hand side?

Page 3. "Related work on Diffusion Probabilistic Models in protein context."
At this stage in the paper, after the general background on diffusion models, I would have expected a section on the specific modelling tasks that you intend to solve in this paper. Instead, you jump directly to related work, mentioning e.g. amino acid point clouds, which have not been defined. One solution could be move the related work to appear later in the paper, and go direclty to "3 Methods", but even that section does not give a complete description of what you are modelling (it introduces y_D, but not what x is, and how the amino acid identities appear in the model). For intance, if x is purely backbone structure, does that include all backbone atoms, or only C_alphas?

Page 3. "K ∈ R 3N×3Nis interaction constants matrix"
What is an interaction constants matrix? Is it derived from a force field? (EDIT: I see you have some info on this later, but would be good to clarify this when first mentioning NMA).

Page 4. "generate a new protein"
What exactly do you mean by "generating" a protein. Are we talking about both sequence and structure, conditioned on sequence length?

Page 4. eq (8)
Why is there no weighting factor (aka temperature) on the loss term? In other words, why would you expect this to be 1?

Page 5, "x_C_M \in ... is the expected positions of conditioned residues at t=0 as sampling progresses"
This sentence was confusing to me. Doesn't "sampling progresses" imply a "t" different from "t=0" (and at t=0, don't you know the position?). And in this case, shouldn’t this expected position be subscripted with a time t?

Page 6. "mean chain distance"
This is not clearly defined. From the reference value of 3.8, I assume this is the average CA-CA distance. Does this imply that you model the protein only at C_alpha resolution? If so, I would have expected this to be stated as part of the original model specification.

Page 7. "sample novel proteins using"
Again, are you sampling both structure and sequence here?

Page 7. "For each sample, we obtain 8 ProteinMPNN generated sequences with ESMFold (Lin et al., 2022) design for each"
This seems to suggest that "generating proteins" means only backbone coordinates, such that you need to fill in sequences using ProteinMPNN. But this sentence should probably be rewritten, since it is unclear what "with ESMFold (Lin et al., 2022) design for each" means. As far as I know ESMFold predicts structures, which is also consistent with the following sentences - but what does "design" then mean here? This should be clarified.

Page 7. "Occasionally the conditional sampling will ‘blow up’, which has been generally observed in many conditional diffusion models (Lou & Ermon, 2023)"
Does the rate of blowing up depend on the "guidance scale" used during sampling?

Page 7. "Figure 3 shows a pair of conditional and unconditional samples for one of the strain targets (additional sampled pairs are in Appendix E)"
Couldn’t this be quantified rather than verified through visual inspection on just a few targets?


### Minor comments:

Page 2, "as well as we perform the visual inspection."
Something is wrong in this sentence. Rephrase.

Figure 1, caption. "Bottom row: corresponding proteins synthesised with Genie"
What does the word “corresponding” imply? Are they conditioned on something similar?

Figure 1, caption. "Arrows are not to scale with respect to the entire protein"
Perhaps make this statement more precise by saying that arrows have been scaled up for increased visual clarity.

Page 3, "by the equivalence ∇x..."
This identify was not immediately apparent. I realize that it just requires a few steps , but for completeness it would be helpful if you could include the derivation of this in an appendix, or otherwise include a reference where this is done.

Page 5. "and expected displacements matrix v(x)"
I assume this means expected according to the NMA analysis, but perhaps state explicitly.

4: You are confident in your assessment, but not absolutely certain. It is unlikely, but not impossible, that you did not understand some parts of the submission or that you are unfamiliar with some pieces of related work.

### Summary
The authors introduce a new problem for protein generative models of conditioning on the desired flexibility of parts of the protein. They develop a way to parameterize and model this flexibility and show that their conditioning can be applied on existing pre-trained models.

### Strengths
The authors introduce a previously unaddressed problem in protein generation of modeling structure flexibility and generating proteins with desired flexibility. Which biologically is a very important feature to model.

The introduced NMA loss is sensible and the results show that the proposed conditioning pipeline indeed works well.

### Weaknesses
While in general I liked the paper, one could say its a bit light on the content. The problem itself is novel and very interesting, but the solution is more or less the standard guidance framework with a new loss. Authors say that their approach could potentially be applied to other diffusion models, it would be nice to test at least a couple for this. Most validation is done by the same NMA loss that is used for guidance. So its unsurprising that guiding using a loss decreases it. So it would be nice to have more diverse validation metrics for the flexibility. Although admittedly I don't know what would be such better metrics. Maybe molecular dynamics literature has some suggestions?

### Questions
I don't have any further questions, but it would be nice if the authors could comment on the weaknesses outlined above.

A small note that in Section 3.1 you state that existing neural network approaches for fining matrix eigenvectors need re-training for each new matrix. In [1] there is a proposed architecture to generate sets of eigenvectors for graph Laplacians from a given distribution. While its a slightly different problem to what you were talking about, that architecture could potentially be used to generate eigenvectors for symmetric matrices without re-training as long as the training distribution matches the test matrices you feed.

[1] Martinkus, Karolis, et al. "Spectre: Spectral conditioning helps to overcome the expressivity limits of one-shot graph generators."

### After Rebuttal
I read all the reviews and author answers. While I find the overall problem interesting, I do tend to agree with the other reviewers that both the methodological novelty and rigorous evaluation is lacking. I will keep my score.

3: You are fairly confident in your assessment. It is possible that you did not understand some parts of the submission or that you are unfamiliar with some pieces of related work. Math/other details were not carefully checked.

### Summary
The authors adapt a protein diffusion model to capture protein movement with an adaptation of normal model analysis.

### Strengths
I think it is good there is a clear biological system to focus on: movement, especially hinges.

The background on diffusion-based models was thorough and helpful.

I also think transferring the normal mode analysis to a tractable invariant loss is interesting and a good extension of current methods. For now, I’ve seen many invariant losses based on internal coordinates, but this is good.

### Weaknesses
Generally, I think this paper has very weak evidence to support the method works. Much of the analysis is based of heuristics or "by eye", which is not sufficient. If this ambiguity is expected, I anticipate the authors should generate methods, statistics, experiments, or simulations that can further support or reject the proposed hypotheses in this paper.

In detail:

Figure 1 is difficult to follow.
- What are the proteins in the lower row? They don’t seem to be the same proteins as those in the respective column as the top row. Is it the same set of motifs?
- If the arrows aren’t to scale to the entire protein, what are they to scale to?

Figure 2 - What should I be looking for? What is the range of good or bad numbers? I would strongly prefer if the dynamics of some other calibrated system could be shown in these plots, as the units and density are quite difficult to interpret.

Figure 3 - I’m not sure what I’m supposed to be looking for. What does a “bad” sample look like?

The filtering in section 5.1 is very ambiguous: “At the start, we filter out the ‘low quality’ samples whose mean chain distance is outside [3.75, 3.85]” What fraction were filtered out? “Occasionally the conditional sampling will ‘blow up’, which has been generally observed in many conditional diffusion models.” What does ‘blow up’ mean? Mathematically, can you define it, or is it all by eye?

### Questions
“We present the corresponding SDE theory as a formal justification of our approach.” In the abstract, what is SDE? Stochastic Differential Equations? If so, say that and then put SDE in ().

“Remarkably, Genie outperformed other models such as ProtDiff (Trippe et al., 2023), FoldingDiff (Wu et al., 2022) or FrameDiff (Yim et al., 2023), and remains comparable to RFDiffusion (Watson et al., 2022).” Why is this remarkable? Is it to the reader to determine if this is true? Should this evidence, however remarkable, be in an Appendix figure? Is RFDiffusion statistically significantly better?

“ the mean chain distance that should be close to 3.8 A ;” Where does 3.8 come from?

Do the values of NMA loss differ for strain or random targets? Do you expect them to? If so, this seems like a straightforward statistical quantity to calculate.

“In the analysis of the remaining samples, we considered the distributions of NMA-loss and scTM-score (Figure 5).” Isn’t the second figure RMSD? If they are the same, please define this.

### Summary
The paper introduces a method for sampling protein structures with desired dynamic properties. This method builds on prior work in protein structure diffusions and computational analysis of protein dynamics. The primary contribution is a novel loss function for dynamics guidance. This loss function using normal mode analysis (NMA) to extract target displacement vectors per residue and then uses a differentiable NMA implementation to guide sampling towards the structures with displacements close to the targets. The authors present 27 conditional samples, which display loss values considerably lower than unconditional samples and self-consistency numbers to suggest that the sampled structures are designable.

### Strengths
The method is clearly presented If given the details of how NMA is performed, for example in a public codebase, I feel like I could straightforwardly reproduce the described method and results. The initial results also seem promising. The objective is clearly being optimized and the validity checks suggest that the sampled structures are reasonable.

### Weaknesses
The methodological and experimental contributions are both relatively minor.

Methodology:

The method combines classifier guidance on a Gaussian diffusion (Ho et al. 2020) with a NMA-derived loss function. Section 3.1 could be included in Section 2, as it is established and common to use a delta function centered at the denoiser's mean to perform guidance, and it is not unique to the paper. There also doesn't appear to be anything novel about the approach to NMA besides porting numpy code to pytorch. The contribution is the synthesis of NMA with classifier guidance, and the addition of a structure guidance term.

Experimental:

Novel methodology is not necessary for a significant contribution when a simple method can be convincingly shown to work well. This paper could be in this category, but I think the current results are fairly limited. Showing that guidance leads to lower loss values is more of a sanity check than a full result. Ideally the authors would demonstrate that the samples have the desired dynamics with a compelling independent evaluation. In this case, such an evaluation is obviously a challenging task, as it would require something like expensive molecular dynamics simulations or actual lab work, but establishing a compelling evaluation framework could be a very impactful contribution in itself. Likewise, it's a bit hard to know what scTM > 0.5 actually signifies, even though it has been used in prior work. Ultimately these structures would have to expressed as sequences. Are there compelling samples for those sequences such that these protein hinges could actually be created? It might be helpful to show that (1) the guidance method generalizes to the outcomes we really care about, not simply the proxy objective (2) there are high likelihood sequences that can (a) be expressed (b) have the desired dynamics.

### Questions
- How were the guidance scale values selected? Were they tuned for the protein structures you evaluated on (in which case they might be overfit to the tasks)? An independent evaluation model could also be useful here.

- Why is guidance only turned on in the middle of sampling? This is not standard practice to my knowledge.
