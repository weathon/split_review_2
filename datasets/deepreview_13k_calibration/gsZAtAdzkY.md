- Decision: Reject

## Abstract
Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance on various quantitative reasoning and knowledge benchmarks. 
However, many of these benchmarks are losing utility as LLMs get increasingly high scores, despite not yet reaching expert performance in these domains.
We introduce \name{}, a novel benchmark composed of advanced reasoning problems in multiple fields.
\name{} presents a more challenging test than prior benchmarks, featuring problems in mathematics, physics, biology, chemistry, and law. 
As a subset of \name{}, we introduce a challenging set of math and physics problems which require advanced symbolic reasoning and domain knowledge.
We evaluate recent models such as GPT-4 and Claude on \name{} and demonstrate that 
current models score well below 50\% on more demanding tasks. 
In order to improve both automatic and assisted evaluation capabilities, we introduce a rubric-based evaluation approach, allowing GPT-4 to score its own intermediate reasoning steps.
Further, we conduct a human evaluation of the symbolic subset of \name{}, finding promising agreement between annotators and GPT-4 rubric evaluation scores.

### Summary
The paper focuses on a novel benchmark composed of advanced reasoning problems across multiple fields like mathematics, physics, biology, chemistry, and law. Its aim is to test large language models (LLMs) like GPT-4 and Claude, noting that these models score below 50% on the proposed benchmark consisting of demanding tasks.

### Strengths
- The paper is well written and easy to follow
- The benchmark covers a diverse set of domains and problems.
- Results show that the benchmark is sufficiently challenging for current state-of-the-art LLMs.
- The authors present a method to ease the process of human evaluation on harder problems.

### Weaknesses
 - I somewhat disagree with the motivation behind this work, which suggests that other benchmarks are not challenging enough. For instance, [1] and [2] have shown that even the best models either cannot generate plans or solve JEE problems, respectively, with an accuracy below 50%. While I concur that there are easier benchmarks, there are also more challenging ones available. I view this work as an additional benchmark to the existing ones that involves a broader set of domains.
- The paper appears to lack a dataset quality verification process. Moreover, it’s not entirely clear how solving the benchmark (especially  MCAT or Law questions) would correlate with reasoning ability. The MCAT and Law questions, while complex, might primarily test recall and pattern matching rather than deeper reasoning skills. This raises concerns about whether the benchmark truly measures the intended cognitive abilities.
- There are mixed approaches for evaluation.  Multiple-choice, numerical, and the simpler symbolic questions have automated evaluation, whereas the more complex symbolic and proof-based questions require human evaluation. The model-based evaluation is potentially beneficial, but on average, it incorrectly assigns or deducts points for 37% of the questions. This dependency on expert human evaluators limits the practicality of using this benchmark. The reliance on human evaluation for a significant portion of the benchmark introduces subjectivity and potential inconsistencies, making it difficult to reproduce results reliably.

### Questions
- Is a non-parsable answer deemed as an incorrect answer? Or is that question not even considered in the final evaluation?
- Given the rapid iterations of LLMs with new and more extensive training data, a diagonalization procedure could be worth investigating, as most of the benchmarks can become fodder for the LLM in the next iteration.

### Summary
This paper proposed a new benchmark, Advanced reasoning Benchmark (ARB), for evaluating advanced reasoning capabilities in large language models. The dataset is composed of various problems from the sciences and law, sourced from graduate-level exams and professional resources, and the performance of current LLMs are relatively low on this dataset comparing to other benchmarks. The paper also introduced a rubric-based self-evaluation method, enabling LLMs to grade their own reasoning, and the authors have conducted human evaluations showing some alignment between the rubric-based self-evaluation method and human preference.

### Strengths
[+] ARB is a novel and challenging benchmark that extends the frontier of what LLMs are currently being tested against, covering advanced topics.

[+] The mistakes analysis in Table 3 has novelty and may provide some insights into why LLMs make an mistake.

### Weaknesses
[-] The evaluation steps for this dataset seems quite complicated (e.g., lots of regex), and it is unclear how to conduct easy evaluation on the open-response questions.

[-] It is also unclear how the current low performance on the ARB benchmark is not due to under-claiming.

[-] The solutions to these problems sets from textbooks may already in the training data. How to deal with this situation?

### Questions
- How to conduct easy evaluation on the open-response questions in the ARB dataset?

- How the current low performance on the ARB benchmark is not due to under-claiming?

- How do you grade the types of mistakes GPT-4 make in Table 3? Is it human evaluation or are there some hard-coded rules.

===After rebuttal===
Thanks for the authors' response. It still seems to me that the analysis of the current dataset depends a bit heavily on human evaluation, and it is still unclear to me the the difficulty actually came from reasoning rather than problem format or previous knowledge.

### Summary
This paper proposes ARB, a new dataset for evaluating LLM reasoning in expert domains such as mathematics, physics, chemistry, biology and law. Though there is technical contribution, this is still an important contribution to the community due to the lack of good benchmarks.

### Strengths
This paper proposes a new dataset ARB covering a wide range of domains for reasoning.
This paper evaluates 3 common models (ChatGPT, GPT-4 and Claude) on ARB. The authors also provide a breakdown of the error cases in GPT-4, which provide insights for future directions.
This paper proposes model-based rubric evaluation. The authors rigorously verify this approach by comparing the grading of GPT-4 and humans, which shows a moderately high correlation between them. This may be used as an evaluation tool for this dataset in the future.

### Weaknesses
It’s not intuitive what questions are covered by ARB. Can you put a few examples in the paper?
It’s not clear what the position of ARB is compared to existing benchmarks. The authors claim ARB is more difficult. However, there is no strong supporing evidence except for the weak performance of models on the physics and math portions of ARB

### Questions
Section 3.1 “aspirational” -> Is it semantically correct here?
Figure 1. Can you use a higher resolution or pdf instead? The y-axis has a wrong unit.

### Summary
The authors have developed a challenging benchmark that consists of questions in mathematics, physics, biology, chemistry, and law. 
Comparing to the existing benchmarks, this benchmark requires expert level domain specific knowledge and reasoning. 
Further, instead of the traditional multiple-choice questions form, all the problems are short-answer or open-domain questions. 
For the ease of grading the test based questions, the authors uses a rubric based method, where a language models first raise rubrics according to the answer, then it grades the generated answer according to the rubric. This yields a automated grading method which is reasonably performant though not as reliable as human.

### Strengths
Originality: 4/5 
Although there are existing benchmarks that focuses on exploiting the incapability of the existing language models, such as big-bench, this paper provides a new aspect on how to automatically grade the short answer and open-domain question answering tasks with GPT-4.

Quality: 4/5
The claims of this paper are well bolstered by experiments and data. One aspect is how well does existing language model perform on this benchmark, and another aspect is that how well does the automatic grading system perform compared to the human expert on these questions. 

Clarity: 4/5
The paper is nicely written and pretty clear. 

Significance: 4/5
This paper could be impactful both due to its challenging natural and its evaluation paradigm.

### Weaknesses
As the limitation states, this benchmark could have potentially be seen through the training dataset and lead to the contamination problem. For example, an answer only have the correct final step but not the correct intermediate step. 

Further, the dataset is comparatively small comparing to the existing datasets.

### Questions
Among the problems, how many of the symbolic problems can be convert into concrete calculation based problems?
