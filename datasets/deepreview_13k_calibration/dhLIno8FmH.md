## Abstract
Electroencephalography (EEG) signals, known for convenient non-invasive acquisition but low signal-to-noise ratio, have recently gained substantial attention due to the potential to decode natural images. 
This paper presents a self-supervised framework to demonstrate the feasibility of learning image representations from EEG signals, particularly for object recognition. 
The framework utilizes image and EEG encoders to extract features from paired image stimuli and EEG responses. 
Contrastive learning aligns these two modalities by constraining their similarity.
Our approach achieves state-of-the-art results on a comprehensive EEG-image dataset, with a top-1 accuracy of 15.6\% and a top-5 accuracy of 42.8\% in 200-way zero-shot tasks.
Moreover, we perform extensive experiments to explore the biological plausibility by resolving the temporal, spatial, spectral, and semantic aspects of EEG signals. 
Besides, we introduce attention modules to capture spatial correlations, providing implicit evidence of the brain activity perceived from EEG data.
These findings yield valuable insights for neural decoding and brain-computer interfaces in real-world scenarios.

### Summary
The manuscript aims to match images to the EEG signals they evoke using a contrastive loss on the encodings of an EEG model and a vision model. The models are evaluated on zero-shot-discriminating 200 images, that were shown 80 times each, and the corresponding 80 EEG signals are averaged for each image.  The manuscript introduces an EEG model specific for this task and results show it to reach improved decoding performance over existing commonly used EEG models. Further, the manuscript finds that semantically similar images of the same category (like animal, food) have more similar learned EEG representations compared to images of different categories. Temporal analysis shows 100 to 600ms to yield the highest decoding accuracy. Frequency analysis show delta theta and beta bands contain information for reasonable decoding accuracies. The manuscript also performs a variety of spatial analyses.

### Strengths
* The manuscript is well-written 
* method is straightforward to understand
* a lot of detailed analysis of the results on different levels
* helpful figures

### Weaknesses
Some details I found not easy to understand, see below

I am not sure I understood the graph attention method details, I found the notation a bit confusing, does aT mean the result fo applying the feedforward layer is transposed? Also it would be nice to mention if this is a unique way of doing graph attention or a well-established way, then would be good to provide references for it. 

For the GradCam Analysis, I am not sure I understood exactly which gradients of which layer do you use and with regard to what? These details may be helpful to write more clearly.

A very recent work tackling similar problems is https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.19812. Due to its recency, I do not expect any comparison, but a brief mention of this work as concurrent work would be great.

### Summary
The authors present a deep learning pipeline to retrieve the images seen by participants whose brain activity was collected using EEG. The pipeline combines a pretrained frozen image encoder (CLIP, ViT or ResNet) and an EEG encoder (a parameter efficient ConvNet optionally prepended with a spatial attention layer) trained with a contrastive loss and evaluated in a retrieval scenario. Results favorably compare to an existing baseline and to existing neural network architectures. An analysis of the decoding performance and of the biological plausibility of the results highlights spatial, temporal and spectral patterns underlying the image decoding task.

### Strengths
Originality: The proposed approach combining a frozen image encoder and a trained brain encoder has previously been used on fMRI, however it appears its application to EEG data is novel.

Quality: The manuscript is overall of good quality. The experiments adequately answer the core research question of the paper and provide supporting evidence for the physiological plausibility of the decoded patterns (i.e. through the complementary analyses of the decoding performance, spatial/temporal/spectral patterns and impact of number of stimulus repetitions).

Clarity: The manuscript is clearly written, and most figures and results are presented clearly.

Significance: This study goes beyond the existing image decoding results from EEG in which a limited number of classes were considered. It also is an important building block toward better image decoding from EEG, following in the footsteps of previous studies in fMRI.

### Weaknesses
- Some of the secondary claims do not appear to be adequately supported by the presented results. For instance, the claims on gamma-based decoding (see Q3 below) and on the use of occipital information in the graph attention layer (Q4).

- Based on previous image decoding work in fMRI and EEG, a logical continuation of the proposed contrastive learning pipeline is to then pass predicted latents to a generative image model (see Q5). I believe the presented image decoding performance results (along with the analyses of Sections 4.5-4.8) are interesting in themselves, however as a result the scope of the paper is narrower than existing studies on the topic. I believe the authors should discuss this in their manuscript.

- The description of the analysis of Section A2 is a bit confusing. The comparison appears to be made between (1) using pretrained frozen image encoders and (2) using randomly initialized image encoders which are trained along the EEG encoders. The description doesn’t make it clear that the difference in computational resources between both approaches comes from the frozen/unfrozen dimension, not from the pretrained/non-pretrained dimension.

### Questions
Q1. In Section 3.1, the authors write “These images are processed and averaged to obtain one template for each concept.” It is not clear to me how these averaged images are used in the experiments - was this in the semantic similarity analysis? Moreover, were the images averaged in pixel space or in latent space?

Q2. In Figure 2A: What is plotted on the topomaps? I assume it is the average EEG amplitude of each channel across the 100 ms window. If so, how was the data normalized (since the colorbar is from -1 to 1)? Also, in Figure 2B: What do the shaded areas represent? Is it variability across subjects?

Q3. In Section 4.5: “High-frequency responses could be observed from electrodes on the temporal cortex.” How is that measured? I find it hard to conclude from visual analysis of Figure 2D. Along with the chance-level performance of the gamma band (Figure 2E) I don’t see compelling evidence for the following claim: “These results align with established principles, coarsely indicating that the bottom-up feedforward is carried by the synchronization of theta and gamma bands.” 

Q4. In Figure 4C and in Suppl. Figure 1: If I understand the topomaps correctly it looks like graph attention actually mostly ignored occipital electrodes for most subjects (as opposed to self-attention for which the occipitally-located pattern is very clear). It would be interesting to look at the average attention weights predicted by both attention modules instead of using GradCAM for this kind of analysis. More generally, given the two formulations (self-attention and graph attention) end up predicting C weights, directly comparing their respective attention weights might give more insight into what drives their different performance. Finally, a central difference between the two approaches appears to be the use of a residual connection after the attention module - it would be interesting to evaluate whether that explains (part of) their differences.

Q5. Existing image decoding studies, e.g. in fMRI (Ozcelik & VanRullen, 2023) but also in EEG (Palazzo et al., 2020), have extended a similar approach up to image generation by feeding predicted image latents to a generative image model. Have the authors attempted this step?

Q6. The description of the analysis of Section A2 is a bit confusing. The comparison appears to be made between (1) using pretrained frozen image encoders and (2) using randomly initialized image encoders which are trained along the EEG encoders. The description doesn’t make it clear that the difference in computational resources between both approaches comes from the frozen/unfrozen dimension, not from the pretrained/non-pretrained dimension.

Q7. Algorithm 1 describes the CLIP loss (Radford et al., 2021). I think this should be introduced and cited as such, rather than through the lens of InfoNCE.

### Summary
The work presents a method for the task of EEG-based object recognition, using a recent dataset collected with the Rapid Serial Visual Presentation (RSVP) paradigm. The authors propose a self-supervised framework where an image and an EEG encoder network are used to extract visual and EEG features. During training, the method maximizes the similarity between positive pairs of samples (i.e. when the signals of the EEG sample of a pair are obtained from the image sample of the pair), and minimizes the similarity for negative pairs. After training, the authors perform zero-shot EEG decoding, by matching EEG features to visual features from image categories that were not present during training. Experiments are performed in one dataset, using various network architectures for EEG and image feature extraction, presenting results that are superior to the previous state-of-the-art and demonstrating the importance of EEG electrode areas, EEG frequency bands, and the temporal window timings of the input EEG signals.

The contributions are:
1) an architecture for EEG feature extraction, named "TSConv", along with two plug-and-play attention modules that can be incorporated in the architecture
2) the training methodology of the proposed method, called "NICE" (Natural Image Contrast EEG)
3) the investigation of natural image information from EEG signals

### Strengths
There is some originality behind the work presented in the manuscript. The authors work on a recent RSVP dataset of EEG & visual data (Gifford et al., 2022), being among the first works that conduct experiments on the task of EEG-based object recognition using this dataset and presenting superior results compared to the previous state-of-the-art (Du et al., 2023). The contrastive loss employed during training, is different from contrastive losses that have been used in other works for EEG-based object recognition (e.g. in (Palazzo et al., 2021)).

The authors are aware of the challenges on the studied task, presenting a clear summary of previous works relevant to EEG-based object recognition. The presentation of the results provides clear insights for several factors that are involved (e.g. intra-subject versus cross-subject testing in Table 2, network architectures in Table 3, ablation studies on the attention modules in Table 2, electrode areas, EEG timings and EEG frequency bands in Figure 2).

### Weaknesses
The proposed architecture for EEG feature extraction, TSConv (described in Table 1 of the manuscript), is highly similar to that of the ShallowNet (as described in (Schirrmeister et al., 2017) [1]) architecture, which the authors include as a baseline method. Specifically, the ShallowNet architecture originally consists of a temporal and a spatial convolutional layer, followed by average pooling and a fully-connected classification layer. Leaving aside the differences on the employed activation functions between TSConv and ShallowNet, one could say that the difference lies only on the order of placement for the average pooling layer. Given that the results reported in Table 3 are quite different for these two architectures (i.e. ShallowNet is the worst performing architecture and TSConv is the best performing architecture), what could be the interpretation? It is not clear if the differences in performance are solely due to the architectural change, or if other factors such as the specific hyperparameters used during training or the optimization process itself played a significant role. A more detailed analysis of the impact of each architectural component and training parameter is needed to justify the performance differences between these two models.

Regarding the two plug-and-play spatial modules, the authors state that they are "instrumental in preserving the spatial characteristics of EEG channels" (page 3, Section 3.1). Considering the self-attention (SA) module and looking at Equation (1), one can notice the spatial filtering nature of the proposed self-attention. However the authors do not provide any insight on the spatial characteristics of the signals obtained through Equation (1), i.e. are the signals more or less correlated after this operation? The authors also mention that, following this transformation of the SA module, "Residual connection is employed by integrating the input and output of the SA module", but it is not clear how much does this integrating procedure affect the spatial correlations between the EEG channels. The lack of quantitative analysis on how these modules affect the spatial relationships between EEG channels makes it hard to validate the claim that they are "preserving the spatial characteristics".

The graph attention mechanism proposed by the authors (page 5, Section 3.3.2) is similar to that of (Li et al., 2023) [2]. It would be interesting if the authors could explain the differences, specifically highlighting any novel aspects of their implementation compared to the existing method. The authors should also address whether the graph structure used in their implementation is based on a priori knowledge of electrode positions or learned from the data, as this could significantly impact the interpretation of the results. Furthermore, a comparison of the computational complexity of their graph attention mechanism with the method described in [2] would be beneficial.

Regarding the intuition behind the proposed training methodology, the authors state that "The self-supervised strategy allows us to learn inherent patterns from EEG signals without labels, rather than directly separate different classes with supervised learning." (page 4, Section 3.2.3). This argument is not well-supported, as image embeddings extracted from pretrained models like ResNet, CLIP and ViT may in fact contain class-related information (Van Gansbeke et al., 2020). The use of these pre-trained models, which are trained on large datasets with class labels, introduces a potential bias that is not properly addressed. The authors should discuss how the potential leakage of class-related information from the image embeddings might influence the interpretation of the results, and whether the learned EEG representations are truly free from class bias.

Other comments:

There are some typos, grammar and syntax issues throughout the manuscript, e.g.:
- "We device" (page 2)
- "has remained a challenging." (page 2)
- "as the widely use way" (page 3
- "representation similarity anaylasis" (page 8)
- "categoring" (page 8)
- In Table 1, while s_1 is not presented in any layer's description, it is then used in the descriptions of output dimensions. I think that this is a mistake and that s_2 should be used instead.

This particular phrase is a bit vague and informal, the process could be stated more clearly: "we look for a few images that belong to the image concepts" (page 3)

### Questions
Important information about the experiments is missing from the manuscript. The number of trainable parameters for each EEG encoding architecture is not reported. Moreover, the dimensionality of the EEG features extracted from each EEG encoding architecture, exactly before being mapped to the dimensionality of the image features, should also be reported. This would allow the reader to obtain a better understanding on the details behind each architecture's performance. For example, it could be the case (among other reasons) that some EEG encoding architectures have better performance because of a larger EEG feature dimensionality (hence an EEG-to-image feature mapping layer of larger learning capacity).

The results presented in Figure 3 are not sufficiently explained. It is unclear to what do rows and columns correspond, i.e. which dimension corresponds to EEG features and which corresponds to image features. It would also be helpful to get an idea of the similarities between the visual features from (some of the) concepts of the training set and the visual features from concepts of the test set.

In Figure 2, sub-figure (D) is not sufficiently explained, i.e. the exact method that was used for obtaining the time-frequency map is not mentioned, the quantity that is depicted is not stated and it is unclear to what does the range [-1, 0] correspond.

### Summary
The authors propose a self-supervised framework: Natural Image Contrast EEG (NICE) to decode image from EEG

### Strengths
Clarity: 
Describes the proposed NICE model with very clear logic and diagrams

### Weaknesses
Motivation:
W1: Indeed most of the existing EEG tasks (emotion recognition, motor imagery) are supervised learning, but Decoding tasks (such as EEG2speech, EEG2Image) are different from traditional EEG tasks. The essence of the task is cross-modal conversion rather than Classification, self-supervised learning is a very common method in decoding tasks. Comparisons with supervised learning for traditional tasks are therefore unreasonable.
W2: Many existing EEG feature extraction methods focus on the spatial-temporal relationship of EEG, such as methods based on spatial-temporal graph, or spatial-temporal attention, or spatial-temporal convolution that is very similar to TSconv in NICE (Such as TSception). However, these very common methods are not mentioned in this paper, so this motivation is unreasonable.

Experiment：
W1: The main experiment only included one baseline, but there has been a lot of work on EEG vision decoding, such as Mind-Vis in CVPR. It is difficult to demonstrate the superiority of NICE by only comparing it with one baseline on a not commonly used dataset.
W2: There is no analysis of why NICE achieves better results than BraVL.
W3: In the Encoder comparison experiment, the baseline compared with TSConv did not include methods used for EEG feature extraction in the past five years.

### Questions
Q1: In the second paragraph of the Introduction, the author mentioned four problems with existing work. Are these problems the motivation of this paper? If so, why are some issues not mentioned or solved in the follow-up; if not, why are the issues that have not been addressed and paid attention to mentioned in the paper?
Q2: If so, for P3: “overlooking the inferior temporal cortex plays a necessary role in object recognition (fifth line)”, the inferior temporal cortex is located at the bottom of the frontal lobe, and EEG mainly records signals from the surface layer, so how does NICE pay attention to it from EEG and how the signals from the inferior temporal cortex can help NICE perform Vision Decoding?
Q3: For P4: "focuses on the peak of pairwise decoding about 110 ms after stimulus onset. (fourth line from the bottom)", the paper does not mention whether NICE's focus on the temporal dimension of the EEG signal is biologically interpretable, but P4 points out that the problem with the current model is that the focus of specific EEG time intervals is unreasonable
