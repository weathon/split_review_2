## Abstract
Tsetlin Machines (TMs) have garnered increasing interest for their ability to learn concepts via propositional formulas and their proven efficiency across various application domains. Despite this, the convergence proof for the TMs, particularly for the AND operator (\emph{conjunction} of literals), in the generalized case (inputs greater than two bits) remains an open problem. This paper aims to fill this gap by presenting a comprehensive convergence analysis of Tsetlin automaton-based Machine Learning algorithms. We introduce a novel framework, referred to as Probabilistic Concept Learning (PCL), which simplifies the TM structure while incorporating dedicated feedback mechanisms and dedicated inclusion/exclusion probabilities for literals. Given $n$ features, PCL aims to learn a set of conjunction clauses $C_i$ each associated with a distinct inclusion probability $p_i$. Most importantly, we establish a theoretical proof confirming that, for any clause $C_k$, PCL converges to a conjunction of literals when $0.5<p_k<1$.
This result serves as a stepping stone for future research on the convergence properties of Tsetlin automaton-based learning algorithms. Our findings not only contribute to the theoretical understanding of Tsetlin Machines but also have implications for their practical application, potentially leading to more robust and interpretable machine learning models.

### Confidence
2: You are willing to defend your assessment, but it is quite likely that you did not understand the central parts of the submission or that you are unfamiliar with some pieces of related work. Math/other details were not carefully checked.

### Summary
This paper describes an adaptation of the Tsetlin automata that simplify the structure  but allows different parameters for literals and ensures convergence.

### Strengths
Converges

### Weaknesses
but is the price ok?

I found the paper to be mostly well written.

Introduction: a few details were discussed before they were introduced.

You mention that your results require a conjunction of literals. This seems quite restrictive to me?

Sec 2: this is a nice short intro to the Tsetln machines. I would have liked more state-of-the-art, and namely examples justifying the need for convergence (some algs such as loopy message passing often work well without providing guarantees they converge)

Sec 3: you introduce your alg piecemeal, as a  discussion, I would also like to see a more self contained even formal description.

Fig 2 might benefit from more description,

I could not verify sec 4

sec5: why not compare with std Tsetln?

### Summary
This is a theoretical study of a simple machine learning model. The setting is to learn a conjunction of boolean signals. The model is simple and clean enough for theoretical analysis and the result is non-trivial: In their model, any conjunction can be learned eventually, given minimal assumptions about the input distribution. The main result is not surprising to me, but it may help to further understand their learning approach.

### Strengths
Clean theory and presentation. A small experimental section emphasize the main result.

### Weaknesses
There is no clear impact on applications.

I am also missing a discussion how this model compares to other learning representations. The authors also missed to run some experiments to analyze whether this approach could work for more advanced cases (like learning two or more clauses, perhaps even real data).

### Questions
How does this model compare to other popular learning representations? To me, this model looks almost like learning a matrix of quantized values, but with some additional constrains.

What exactly is an epoch in your setting?

### Summary
This paper proposes a novel ML model, dubbed Probabilistic inclusion of literals for Concept Learning (PCL).
PCL modifies Tsetlin Machines (TMs) in order to provide theoretical convergence guarantees in ideal settings.
This property is further verified experimentally on synthetic data.

### Strengths
- In contrast with the original TMs, PCL comes with theoretical guarantees of convergence

### Weaknesses
 - For non-experts in TMs, the paper is hardly accessible. I am having an hard time understanding the background (see detailed feedback)
- The theoretical guarantee hold in idealized cases and relies on the novel PCL formulation, it is not clear whether it extends to TMs in general as the title would suggest.
- Very weak evaluation: experiments only corroborate the theoretical proofs. PCL is not compared with any existing method for learning a logical formulas, not even standard TMs. The significance of this theoretical results depends on whether PCL is a practical ML algorithm or not.
- The authors mention practical implications of this work in the abstract. I couldn't find these implications in the text.


Detailed feedback:
----

The background assumes that the reader knows what a Tsetlin Automata is.


  "Clause updating probability depends on vote sum, v, and the voting error, ε, uses a margin T to produce an ensemble effect"

This is the first time a sentence implies that feedback might be disregarded. Vote sum, vote error and the margin are mentioned for the first and only time.

  "Upon sampling from P(Feedback), TA state adjustments are computed "

How does the sampling work? Input pairs (x,y) are sampled according to P(Feedback), which in turn depends on the prediction of the current TM state? This should be clarified.

I didn't get the need for differentiating Type Ia and Ib feedback. This is never used later in the text.

### Questions
- Is PCL a strict generalization of TM? Do the theoretical guarantees hold for TMs in general?
- Is PCL accurate in practical settings? How do they compare with standard TMs and other concept learning algorithms?
- What are the practical implications of this work?

### Summary
Tsetlin Machines are an automata theoretic formalism for the generation of Boolean expressions as conjunctive clauses. Proofs of convergence for Tsetlin machines have been provided in the cases of 1 and 2 input bits. Such a proof of convergence remains elusive in the general case. In particular, for any number of bits greater than 2. 

In this work the authors provide a probabilistic variant of Tsetlin machines. They call their novel framework PCL (Probabilistic Concept Learning). The main result of the paper is a proof that for any clause C_k, PCL converges almost surely to a conjunction of minerals whenever the inclusion probability p_k lies strictly between 0.5 and 1.

### Strengths
The main strength of the paper is the fact that in the new introduced model, the authors can provide convergence guarantees in the general case, provided the inclusion probability of the clause in question lies between 0.5 and 1.0.

### Weaknesses
 The main weakness of the paper is in the wording of some claims. For example already in the abstract, the authors write: 

"Despite this, the convergence proof for the TMs, ... remains an open problem. This paper aims to fill this gap by presenting a comprehensive convergence analysis of Tseitin automaton-based Machine learning algorithms". 

This is an extremely unclear way of formulating your contributions. First, it gives the impression that you are solving the open problem that remained open about the convergence of Tsetlin machines in the general case. On the other hand, the convergence claims that you explicit mention are with respect to another model (PCL). This lack of clarity significantly undermines the perceived impact of the work. The reader is initially led to believe that the long-standing convergence issue of Tsetlin Machines is being resolved, only to discover that a different, albeit related, model is being analyzed. This distinction is not made sufficiently clear, leading to a potential misinterpretation of the paper's core contribution. The authors should explicitly state that while their work provides a convergence proof for PCL, it does not directly address the open problem of convergence for the original Tsetlin Machine. The current framing of the contribution is misleading and needs to be rectified to accurately reflect the scope of the results.

### Questions
Does the proof of convergence for your model PCL imply a proof of convergence for the original TA model in the general case? 

1) If yes, please state this very explicitly in the abstract, and introduction. Something like: "We note that our proof of convergence implies a proof of convergence for TA's". Therefore, our proof of convergence settles the long-standing open problem about convergence of TAs for number of bits greater thant 2.  
2) If no, please state this very explicitly in the abstract and introduction. Something like: "We note that the original problem about the convergence of TA's remains widely open for the case of number of bits greater than 2."
