## Abstract
As is well known, both sampling from the posterior and computing the mean of the posterior in Gaussian process regression reduces to solving a large linear system of equations. We study the use of stochastic gradient descent for solving this linear system, and show that when \emph{done right}---by which we mean using specific insights from the optimisation and kernel communities---stochastic gradient descent is highly effective. To that end, we introduce a particularly simple \emph{stochastic dual descent} algorithm, explain its design in an intuitive manner and illustrate the design choices through a series of ablation studies. Further experiments demonstrate that our new method is highly competitive. In particular, our evaluations on the UCI regression tasks and on Bayesian optimisation set our approach apart from preconditioned conjugate gradients and variational Gaussian process approximations. Moreover, our method places Gaussian process regression on par with state-of-the-art graph neural networks for molecular binding affinity prediction.

### Summary
This paper proposes a stochastic gradient descent method for solving the kernel ridge regression problem. In particular, three aspects are covered: (1) a dual objective that allows a larger learning rate; (2) a stochastic approximation that brings in effective utilization of stochastic gradients; (3) momentum and geometric iterate averaging. By combining these aspects, the algorithm is demonstrated be faster compared to baselines in experiments.

### Strengths
* This paper proposes a new method for the kernel ridge regression problem.
* Experimental results show that the proposed algorithms can achieve better performance than baselines. When combined with the Gaussian process, the method can also achieve comparable performance to that of graph neural networks.

### Weaknesses
 * This paper only provides numerical experiments to evaluate the performance of different algorithms. However, it would be good if rigorous theoretical guarantees could be proved, at least for some special cases. Besides, I think the authors stress too much on the algorithm details, which can be deferred to the appendix for a major part of them while trying to leave some room for theoretical analysis.
* There are many different optimizers for the kernel ridge regression, such as AdaGrad, Adam, etc. The authors should also try these methods in the experiments.
* The algorithm design is a bit incremental to me, as it looks like a combination of standard existing approaches, which is tuned for the specific tasks. Then, the idea of the algorithm design may be difficult to extend to other tasks.
* Besides, it is not clear to me whether the variance of stochastic gradient is really a big issue from Figure 2, as the authors do not add the full-gradient version for comparison. If controlling the variance is important, the authors may also need to consider variance-reduce techniques (e.g., SVRG) and add them to the experiments.

### Summary
This paper introduces a stochastic dual gradient descent method for optimizing the Gaussian process posterior computation.

### Strengths
The authors present a novel "dual" formulation for the Gaussian process regression problem. After studying the condition number of new and old formulations, the authors observe that the "dual" formulation allows for the use of larger learning rates, indicating its potential to converge faster. They then propose the stochastic dual gradient descent method, leveraging various optimization techniques based on the "dual" formulation, including feature and coordinate sampling (or minibatch) [1], Nesterov's acceleration [2], and Polyak averaging. Notably, the authors introduce a new averaging scheme called geometric averaging.

The paper is overall well-structured, clear, logically presented, and readable. It contains minimal typos and lacks theoretical flaws. Moreover, the authors conduct sufficient numerical experiments to validate the effectiveness of their proposed optimizer.

### Weaknesses
The authors do not provide a theoretical justification to verify the convergence of the proposed method. Nevertheless, it is likely that convergence can be ensured under mild conditions, as the optimization techniques employed are standard and well-established in the community and literature.

From my perspective, the primary contribution of this paper lies in the introduction of the "dual" formulation, as presented on page 4 after Equation (2). This formulation allows for the use of larger step sizes, which suggests the potential for faster convergence. While the remaining studies and techniques are also important, they are somewhat incremental and standard. Consequently, I am uncertain about whether the paper's contribution alone justifies its publication in ICLR. As a result, I have assigned a boundary score and defer to the area chair's judgment for the final decision on acceptance.

### Summary
This paper uses insights drawn from the application of gradient descent in the kernel and optimisation communities to develop a stochastic gradient descent approach for Gaussian processes. In particular this method is useful in regresssion to approximate the posterior mean and to draw samples from the GP posterior. This method, stochastic dual descent, is compared to conjugate gradient, stochastic gradient descent and stochastic variational Gaussian processes on regression benchmarks and molecular binding affinity
prediction.

### Strengths
This is a well written paper that considers an interesting problem. The use of several benchmarks in the experimental section and comparison with recent work is a plus.

The justification for use of the dual objective as well as the illustrative example is clear.

The reason behind the choice of random coordinate estimates is well done.

### Weaknesses
It would be useful to emphasise that this work is useful when the Kernel is already known. Comments on whether these methods would be useful in hyperparameter estimation would be useful.

The claim that the method can be implemented in a few lines of code should be demonstrated. The repo given does not clearly illustrate this using a simple example.

The paper would benefit from a visualisation comparing samples from a GP using SDD to an exact GP fit to show that the samples lie within the confidence interval.

It is unclear what the implications of limiting the kernel to the form $\sum_{j=1}^mz_jz_j^T$ are. This seems like a strong assumption that would limit the applicability of the method. 

How does ill conditioning affect the performance of the method?

### Summary
This paper introduced a stochastic dual gradient descent algorithm for kernel ridge regression and sampling. The stochastic dual descent algorithm admits better-conditioned gradients and a faster convergence rate compared to the SGD proposed by Lin et al. (2023). With the selected kernels, experimental results showed competitive performance with a number of SOTA methods on UCI regression/Bayesian optimization/ molecular binding affinity prediction tasks. Overall, the paper is easy to follow and well-written, while technical contributions seem to be below the bar of ICLR.

### Strengths
The strengths are: 
(1) Some fresh insights from the optimization and kernel communities were explored. 
(2) Uniform approximation bound and duality of objectives were both analyzed. 
(3) Different randomized gradients and convergence performance were compared.

### Weaknesses
 Some suggestions on improving the weakness points are: 
(1) More figures/tables to explicitly show the weakness/instability of the baseline methods are expected. 
(2) Sharing more insights into the algorithm settings, such as the choice of geometric averaging, the effect/influence on the sparsity of the unbiased estimator \hat(g)(\alpha), etc, are expected.  
(3) A theoretical convergence analysis is expected (not only some figures).



### Questions
1. In Figure 1, we can not see the primal gradient descent becomes unstable and diverges for $\beta n$>0.1. Please show the unstable or compare the evaluated conditional numbers. Under higher step sizes, why does the gradient descent of the primal return $NaN$ (any possible reasons)?
2. Figure 2 shows the random coordinate estimate with a step size equal to 50. what is the performance on varied step sizes? Can any explanation of the rising part (the blue dashed line) in the middle figure in Figure 2 be given?
3. What is the step size used to generate the Figure 3? It seems less than 50 and has a competitive rate compared to the random feature estimate shown in Figure 2. Extra clarification and comparison would be better.
4. How do different batch sizes affect the overall convergence?
5. It is better to add a test where samples are generated by a non-stationary kernel, to show the ability of the random coordinate estimate. (to distinguish with the random Fourier features)
6. what is the difference between the $\beta n$ in the main texts and the $\beta$ in Algorithm 1?
7. The green dashed line is missing in Figure 3.

### Summary
The authors consider the problem of computing a Gaussian process posterior, specifically its mean and random draws from it. While the naive computation scales cubically in the number of observations, the authors propose a iterative solver with linear cost per iteration. The idea behind this solver is that the expensive quantity in the GP posterior (kernel matrix inverse) can be thought of as a minimiser of a particular regression problem, which can be solved iteratively with gradient-based methods. The authors consider two formulations of such a regression problem (primal and dual), study their convergence properties, as well as discuss randomised gradients computations to achieve linear computational cost. The proposed algorithm is shown to perform competitively on a number of benchmarks.

### Strengths
+ The paper is clearly written and is easy to follow
+ The differences to the closely related work of Liu et al. (2023) are clearly discussed
+ I think the results are quite significant for the community. I was especially interested to see that the proposed algorithm performs competitively in comparison to a neural network in Table 2.

### Weaknesses
I didn't notice any significant weaknesses.

### Questions
- In Fig. 1 you note that the primal gradient makes more progress in K^2-norm while the dual one in K-norm (with the same step size). However, in the left panel of Fig. 1 it seems that for a few iterations in the beginning of optimisation, the primal gradient was also making more progress than dual in the K-norm. Why do you think it is the case?

- The GP hyper-parameters (e.g. observational noise variance, kernel parameters, etc.) are typically estimated by maximising the marginal log-likelihood using gradient-based methods. Do you think it could be possible run the gradient-based hyper-parameters inference jointly with the posterior inference that you discussed in this paper?
