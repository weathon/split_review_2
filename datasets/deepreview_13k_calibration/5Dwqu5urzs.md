## Abstract
This paper proposes the Phy-DRL: a physics-regulated deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework for safety-critical autonomous systems. The Phy-DRL has three distinguished invariant-embedding designs: i) residual action policy (i.e., integrating data-driven-DRL action policy and physics-model-based action policy), ii) automatically constructed safety-embedded reward, and iii) physics-model-guided neural network (NN) editing, including link editing and activation editing. Theoretically, the Phy-DRL exhibits 1) a mathematically provable safety guarantee and 2) strict compliance of critic and actor networks with physics knowledge about the action-value function and action policy. Finally, we evaluate the Phy-DRL on a cart-pole system and a quadruped robot. The experiments validate our theoretical results and demonstrate that Phy-DRL features guaranteed safety compared to purely data-driven DRL and solely model-based design while offering remarkably fewer learning parameters and fast training towards safety guarantee.

### Confidence
3: You are fairly confident in your assessment. It is possible that you did not understand some parts of the submission or that you are unfamiliar with some pieces of related work. Math/other details were not carefully checked.

### Summary
Purely data driven learning has a pitfall of tending to violate known conditions of the environment. To address this, prior work has looked at modeling the known transition dynamics of the problem setting and using this to regularize the behavior of the data-driven model. This paper introduces a new technique (Phy-DRL) to improve safety assurance in Reinforcement Learning (RL) systems by means of invariant embeddings tackling three separate issues : using physics knowledge in learning, using safety violation information, and action policies violating known physics laws. Experimental results show the effectiveness of the approach in utilizing existing knowledge in both Cart-Pole and a complex quadrupedal robot.

### Strengths
- Considers safety information and known system dynamics in the final policy.
- Introduces novel scheme for neural network policy and action-value function editing using the known dynamics of the environment.

### Weaknesses
 - The paper addresses the case of RL with partially known environment dynamics but does not adequately consider comparative approaches such as  model-based RL  [1, 2]  or ODE-regularized RL [3]  in all the experiments.
- The effect of each of the invariant embeddings is not shown empirically. An included ablation analysis would be useful to determine this.
- Presentation could be improved slightly, perhaps by including some pseudo code in the Appendix.

### Questions
1. Fig. 4 does not have comparisons with any modern methods for MBRL or physics based RL. Is there a reason why this was omitted?
2. Is ODE-based regularization [3] significantly more restrictive than the proposed approach? Why is a direct comparison not considered?

### Summary
In this paper, the authors introduce the "Phy-DRL" framework which integrates physics knowledge into deep reinforcement learning (DRL) for safety-critical autonomous systems. Key features of Phy-DRL include:

An action policy that combines both data-driven learning and physics-based modeling.
A reward system embedded with safety considerations.
A neural network (NN) which is guided by physics modeling.
Theoretical benefits of Phy-DRL are that it offers mathematically provable safety guarantees and aligns well with physics knowledge for computing action values. The authors tested their framework on a cart-pole system and a quadruped robot, finding that Phy-DRL offers safety benefits over purely data-driven DRL while requiring fewer learning parameters and enabling stable training.

### Strengths
Addressing Safety in DRL: The paper introduces a DRL framework specifically designed for safety-critical autonomous systems, highlighting the significance of adhering to physical laws in AI applications.

Mathematically-Provable Safety Guarantee: One of the notable features of the Phy-DRL is its mathematically provable safety guarantee, which is crucial for real-world applications where safety is paramount. (although I am taking the claim of authors at face value and couldn't do a thorough analysis of the mathematical proofs and theorems given in the paper)

### Weaknesses
The thing I feel which is missing is where is the definition of invariant embeddings. 
What are they invariant to? How is adding a residual to a model-based making it invariant (and again invariant to what? state space?) Where is the invariant embedding principles coming from? (please cite any papers)

The lack of real-world results is also concerning, given the efforts by the community to test robots in the real world. 

The presentation also needs to be improved. Specifically, Important terms and at least some experiment related information should be added in introduction to make the paper and its application easier to understand.

### Questions
Please clarify what is meant by invariant embeddings here.

How does Phy-DRL differ from existing DRL frameworks in terms of its integration with physics knowledge? Is this a completely new framework, or an extension of existing ones?

Could you provide more insight into the "residual action policy"? How does it ensure invariance with respect to training?

### Confidence
3: You are fairly confident in your assessment. It is possible that you did not understand some parts of the submission or that you are unfamiliar with some pieces of related work. Math/other details were not carefully checked.

### Summary
This paper proposes a physics-regulated DRL framework for safety-critical tasks. The framework contains 1) residual action policy fusing model-based and model-free policies 2) safety-embedded reward by incorporating the knowledge from the approximated linear model dynamics 3) physics-enforced actor-critic algorithm including editing and activation editing, and achieves mathematically-provable safety guarantee.

### Strengths
1. The paper is well-motivated and well-organized. It is in general easy to follow. 
2. The approach, as the reviewer can tell, is sound and solid with remarkable provable safety guarantees. 
3. This framework is novel, specifically for the part of RL plus linearised model with a systematical reward construction approach to achieve provable safety guarantees. 
4. The experiments are significant compared to pure DRL and pure model-based approach.

### Weaknesses
1. In general, the paper is easy to follow. However,  Section 6 can be a bit confusing to the reviewer and needs back-and-forth checking while reading. This section can be improved by adding more overview, intuition, and connecting intro between and among subsections. It is somewhat difficult to accept a bunch of symbols such as in Equation (13), (14), (15), (16). 
2. It is somewhat hard to understand Algorithms (1) and (2). There is a lot of white space in Algorithm (1) and (2), why don't use it to add an overview, explanations, and comments for better understanding? 
3. In the experiments, the authors compared their approach to model-free RL, model-based control. For the reviewer, It is a bit unfair as the authors did not compare their approach to model-based RL such as RL + linearised model.

### Questions
The reviewer is a bit confused about the Section 6, 
Question 1: How does NN input augmentation help embed what physics knowledge into AC?
2: how does NN editing help embed what knowledge into AC? 
3. How do algorithms (1)(2) achieve NN input aug and NN editing?

### Summary
This work proposes three invariant-embedding principles to achieve a physics-regulated deep RL framework for safety-critical systems. The three principles include residual action policy, safety-embedded reward, and physics-model-guided neural network editing & augmentation. The main claim on safety-embedded reward and the editing are supported by theoratical proofs. Experimental results show that the proposed Phy-DRL achieve better performance in simulated cartpole and quadruped robot environments

### Strengths
- This work combines the safety requirement with neural network editing, which is novel to my understanding

- This work provides proofs to support the designed safety-embedded reward.

- The experimental results show that the proposed method achieves some good policies that follow safety requirements.

### Weaknesses
1. It's unclear how critical the residual physics policy is needed.

2. The proposed method is only compared to methods without consideration on safety requirements.

3. The method relies on known state definitions. If the state can not be obtained from the environment or definition, how this framework will be affected?
