## Abstract
Rule learning is critical to improving knowledge graph (KG) reasoning due to their ability to provide logical and interpretable explanations.
Recently, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) with tail entity scoring achieve the state-of-the-art performance on KG reasoning.
However, 
the theoretical understandings for
these GNNs are either lacking or focusing on single-relational graphs,
leaving what the kind of rules these GNNs can learn an open problem.
We propose to fill the above gap in this paper.
Specifically, GNNs with tail entity scoring are unified into a common framework. Then, we analyze their expressivity by formally describing the rule structures they can learn and theoretically demonstrating their superiority.
These results further inspire us to propose a novel labeling strategy 
to learn more rules in KG reasoning.
Experimental results are consistent with our theoretical findings and verify the effectiveness of our proposed method.

### Confidence
3: You are fairly confident in your assessment. It is possible that you did not understand some parts of the submission or that you are unfamiliar with some pieces of related work. Math/other details were not carefully checked.

### Summary
This paper which studies theoretical properties of GNN models includes:
* Analysis of the expressiveness of GNN models in terms of a rule-learning formalism. 
* Presentation a simple yet effective labeling strategy based on their analysis that yields improvements. 
* Empirical analysis that supplements the theoretical contribution. The proposed approach instantiated with RED-GNN and NBFNet yields positive improvements across real and synthetic datasets.

### Strengths
This paper leads a technical and thoughtful analysis to what kinds of relationships GNN-based models can effectively represent and effectively predict. Strengths of the paper include:
* **Formalism** for link prediction in knowledge graphs using CML. This allows the authors to describe which kinds of rule structures each class of model is able to represent. It allows for the generalization of existing methods to represent broader classes of rules.
* **Empirical Successes** are demonstrated across a wide variety of datasets. These seem to indicate different kinds of graph and entity / relation structures. 
* **Theoretical Analysis** appears to be rigorous and formally describe the different classes of rules and what models are effective for each.

### Weaknesses
My main concern with this paper is the presentation / structure and the way in which that presentation and structure limits the reader from connecting both the clear theoretical advantages of the proposed class of GNN to both the limitations of other classes and the empirical successes. Please correct me if you think I have misinterpreted or misunderstood things or put emphasis points inappropriately. I am mentioning these presentation points because I think the paper has a number of very nice properties that I would like readers to be able to more easily grasp and benefit from.

W1. **Defining Expressivity** I think that the definition of expressivity used in the paper should be defined much earlier in the manuscript. I say this not only for the sake of readers unfamiliar with definitions of expressivity for GNNs but also for the sake of familiar readers understanding differences between the choice of expressivity definition and the choices of past work. The related work section, which appears before definitions of expressivity so far as I understand, provides too high level a comparison between past work to be meaningful (in my opinion) for all but the most familiar readers of these methods (as an aside, I think that the related work section as it is now would be better suited later in the paper, say before experiments). In my opinion, readers would benefit from explicitly talking about the relationship between generalization and representation of graphs immediately.

W2. **Connecting Formalism and Data** While the formalism used is based on past work and as I understand motivated and accepted in those works as a meaningful formalism, I think that paper would be greatly improved with many more motivating examples from real data that express why the rule based formalism is meaningful. For instance, the example in Figure 1 is great. I see how it connects to Figure 3 and Corollary 5.2. However, how often do such patterns appear in the real world empirical datasets? How much of the gains from the given methods correlate with the existence of the kinds of subgraphs described?

W3. **Understanding Generalization** I think my main point of confusion, which I was not able to resolve in my reading of the paper is how to think about generalization vs representation. As I understand it depends on which rules the model can learn. But I am having a hard time understanding how this relates to things like number of parameters, number of training examples, choice of aggregation functions, graph size, number of entities, number of relationships, etc. I am missing something fundamental here? E.g. How do number of examples / graph size / parameters relate to the base theorem C.2? Or do those things not matter in the analysis? It seems it depends only on $L$ is that correct?

W4. **Presentation of some of the theoretical results** As a more minor point, I think readers would take away more from the theoretical results if the authors provided more remarks about the limitations/take aways from the theorem statements. For instance, I was confused about Theorem 4.4. For instance, I think I would have appreciated more handholding as to the result: "The structural rules in Figure 2 cannot be learned by CompGCN due to Theorem 4.4."

My concern is that I think we need:
 (1) how the proposed formalism allows us to better analyze the generalization capabilities of models to understand why we would expect empirical successes
 (2) how the proposed formalism is reflected in real world datasets (e.g., the kinds of rule patterns indeed show up)
 (3) an understanding of why the proposed formalism and analysis is better than other forms of analysis that one could do.
These are certainly addressed by the paper, but I think that they could made significantly more crisp in the way the paper and results are presented.

Minor:
* I think the first sentence is missing an "A", "A knowledge graph (KG) ..."

### Questions
* Can you say more about how to think about generalization and expressivity in regards to the above comments?
* Can you say more about Theorem 4.4 and "The structural rules in Figure 2 cannot be learned by CompGCN due to Theorem 4.4."?

### Summary
This paper proposes a novel perspective to understand the expressivity of recent GNNs for KG reasoning based on rule structure learning. It identifies the types of rule structures that different GNNs can learn and analyzes their advantages and limitations. It also introduces a unified framework, QL-GNN, that encompasses two SOTA GNNs, RED-GNN and NBFNet. Moreover, it presents a new labeling strategy based on QL-GNN, called EL-GNN, that can learn more rule structures. The paper validates the theoretical analysis and the effectiveness of QL-GNN and EL-GNN through experiments on synthetic and real datasets.

### Strengths
- The paper presents a novel approach to understanding RED-GNN and NBFNet from a rule-learning perspective.

- The theoretical analysis reveals the advantages and limitations of existing popular GNNs in KG reasoning. The paper also provides experimental results to support the theoretical conclusion. 

- Furthermore, the paper proposes two GNNs for KG reasoning, which outperform state-of-the-art models on several datasets.

### Weaknesses
 - In my opinion, the datasets used in Section 6.2 appear to be well-suited for rule-based methods. However, the most popular link prediction dataset, FB15K-237, was not included in this experiment. Therefore, I believe that the experimental results of Section 6.2 are insufficient to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

### Questions
- What about the performance of the proposed GNNs on FB15K-237?

### Summary
The paper delves into the domain of Knowledge Graph (KG) reasoning, which involves deducing new facts from existing ones in a KG. While Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) with tail entity scoring have recently achieved state-of-the-art performance in KG reasoning, there's a gap in the theoretical understanding of these GNNs. This work aims to bridge this gap by unifying GNNs with tail entity scoring into a common framework and analyzing their expressivity in terms of the rule structures they can learn. The insights from this analysis lead to the proposal of a novel labeling strategy to further enhance rule structure learning in KG reasoning. Experimental results support the theoretical findings and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

### Strengths
S1 The paper provides a thorough analysis of the expressivity of state-of-the-art GNNs used for KG reasoning. By unifying these GNNs into a common framework (QL-GNN), the authors offer a structured approach to understanding their capabilities and limitations in terms of rule structure learning.
S2 The introduction of the QL-GNN framework and the subsequent EL-GNN model showcases the authors' innovative approach to addressing the gaps in the current understanding of GNNs for KG reasoning. The EL-GNN, in particular, is designed to learn rule structures beyond the capacity of existing methods, marking a significant advancement in the field.
S3 The authors don't just rely on theoretical findings; they validate their claims with experiments on synthetic datasets. The consistency between the experimental results and theoretical insights adds credibility to their claims and demonstrates the practical applicability of their proposed methods.

### Weaknesses
W1  While the EL-GNN model is introduced as an improvement over QL-GNN, there's limited discussion on its scalability. How does EL-GNN perform when applied to very large-scale KGs? Are there any computational constraints or challenges that users should be aware of? Specifically, the paper lacks a detailed analysis of the time and space complexity of the EL-GNN model compared to QL-GNN, particularly concerning the additional entity-level computations introduced by the enhanced labeling strategy. Furthermore, the experiments in the paper employ relatively small datasets. It would greatly benefit the research to include larger datasets, such as those with millions of edges, to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods on a more substantial scale and to provide a more realistic assessment of their practical applicability. The absence of such experiments leaves a gap in understanding how the proposed methods would perform in real-world scenarios.

W2 The paper introduces a novel labeling strategy to enhance rule structure learning. Are there specific scenarios in which this labeling strategy may not yield effective results or encounter limitations? For instance, are there specific types of KG structures or relation patterns where the proposed labeling strategy might introduce biases or fail to capture the underlying rule structures effectively? A more detailed discussion on the potential limitations of the labeling strategy, including edge cases and scenarios where it might underperform, would be beneficial.

### Questions
Q1 Can the models trained on one KG be adapted or fine-tuned for another KG? If so, are there any specific considerations or challenges in doing so?

Q2 How robust are QL-GNN and EL-GNN to noisy or incomplete data in KGs? Have any tests been conducted to assess their performance under such conditions?

### Summary
In this paper, the authors investigate the expressivity of GNN-based KG reasoning methods. The paper provides terminology for rule structure in the KG reasoning task and proves the limitation of current methods in structure rules T(h,x) and U(h,x) in theory. For the method, In algo 1, the initial representation is assigned to the entities whose out-degree is larger than a threshold d. The proposition 5.1 and the empirical results in Table 1 show that the proposed method can help discover structure rules T(h,x) and U(h,x).

### Strengths
- The novelty is great, this paper provides a systematic way for rule structures finding in GNN based KG reasoning task.
- The theoretical part is sound, and the experimental study supports the theoretical result as well.
- The method is simple that assigning the initial representation to the entities but effective based on experimental results.

### Weaknesses
n/a

### Questions
In page 7, it mentioned " the additional time complexity introduced by entity labeling is linear with respect to the number of entities in the graph,  which is marginal in comparison to QL-GNN". I am not sure about why is marginal considering the KG is usually large. Could you provide the numeric value about time cost for the experiments or adding more discussion?
