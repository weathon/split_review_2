## Abstract
In this paper, we present a novel defense against backdoor attacks on deep neural networks (DNNs), wherein adversaries covertly implant malicious behaviors (backdoors) into DNNs. Our defense falls within the category of post-development defenses that operate independently of how the model was generated. Our proposed defense is built upon an intriguing concept: given a backdoored model, we reverse engineer it to %approach that can 
directly extract its \textbf{backdoor functionality}
to a \textit{backdoor expert} model. To accomplish this, we finetune the backdoored model over a small set of intentionally mislabeled clean samples, such that it unlearns the normal functionality while still preserving the backdoor functionality, and thus resulting in a model~(dubbed a backdoor expert model) that can only recognize backdoor inputs. Based on the extracted backdoor expert model, we show the feasibility of devising robust backdoor input detectors that filter out the backdoor inputs during model inference. Further augmented by an ensemble strategy with a finetuned auxiliary model, our defense, \textbf{BaDExpert} (\underline{Ba}ckdoor Input \underline{D}etection with Backdoor \underline{Expert}), effectively mitigates 17 SOTA backdoor attacks while minimally impacting clean utility. The effectiveness of BaDExpert has been verified on multiple datasets (CIFAR10, GTSRB, and ImageNet) across multiple model architectures (ResNet, VGG, MobileNetV2, and Vision Transformer).

### Summary
This paper introduces BaDExpert, an innovative defense mechanism against backdoor attacks targeting deep neural networks (DNNs). The defense is built upon the concept of extracting the backdoor functionality from a backdoored model to create a backdoor expert model. The backdoor expert model is then used to detect backdoor inputs during model inference. BaDExpert's efficacy is showcased across various datasets and model architectures, highlighting its impressive performance in terms of AUROC, a significant reduction in Attack Success Rate (ASR), and a minimal decline in clean accuracy (CA).

### Strengths
- The paper introduces a novel approach for defending against backdoor attacks by extracting the backdoor functionality from a backdoored model.
- The paper provides a well-structured explanation of the methodology.
- The paper presents extensive experimental results on multiple datasets and model architectures, demonstrating the effectiveness of BaDExpert.

### Weaknesses
 - The paper lacks in-depth theoretical analysis to support the proposed method.

- The technique may not perform optimally when applied to models that haven't been backdoored.

- The experimental section seems to omit comparisons with certain recent relevant works.

### Questions
(1) A core tenet of the proposed method is that fine-tuning on a small set of mislabeled clean data can isolate the backdoor functionality. While this paper attempts to validate the idea through experimentation, providing a rigorous theoretical analysis would bolster the method's credibility.

(2)  In real-world scenarios, after acquiring a model online, it's often uncertain whether it has been backdoored. If the model is a benign one, there would be a disagreement between the outputs of model \mathcal{M} and \mathcal{B} (on the left side of Figure 2). This divergence could potentially hinder BaDExpert's performance.

(3) Could this paper elucidate the time complexity of the proposed method and compare it with methods like I-BAU? Given that this technique necessitates model fine-tuning, there are concerns about its efficiency.

(4) It seems that some recent published related works are missing to be compared in the paper. For example,  [1] presents defense results that are on par with those in this paper, reporting an ASR of 5.03 and a CA of 92.18 for the CIFAR10 dataset.

(5) Publicly releasing the code would facilitate better reproducibility and peer verification, enhancing the paper's value.

If the authors could solve some concerns mentioned above, the reviewer would reconsider the rating.

### Summary
This paper proposes a novel backoor detection approach: It firstly finetune the backdoor model over a small subset of mislabeled samples to remove the benign functionality while preserving the backdoor-related functionality. Then, badexpert detects the backdoor examples based on the agreement between the backdoor expert and backdoored model. The effectiveness of the propsed method is tested on both small  (CIFAR-10 and GTSRB) and large dataset (ImageNet), CNN and ViT.

### Strengths
1 This paper is easy to follow.

2 This paper is well written.

3 Appreciate the solid experiments shown in the experimental section.  The authors demonstrate the novel performance of Badexpert in multiple datasets and architectures.

### Weaknesses
1 Admitting the effectiveness of the proposed method, I think the practicality of Badexpert is limited. As shown in Appendix A, the optimal learning rate could vary across datasets: ($\eta=10^{-4}$ for CIFAR-10 and $\eta=2.5\cdot10^{-5}$ for GTSRB). Even for the same dataset,  the optimal $\eta$ could be different across different architectures:   $\eta=10^{-4}$ for ResNet18 and  $\eta=10^{-6}$ for pretrained vit_b_16. Considering the tremendous hyperparameter required for Badexpert, I think the overall guidlines for how to choose hyperparameter are needed to help Badexpert better defend against  potential risks.

2 BadExpert depends on the stong mapping from the trigger to the pre-defined behaviour. I firmly believe, as long as the backdoor attack is weak enough (decreasing the poison rate/ the size of trigger/ the blend rate), will potentially leads to the Badexpert unsuccessful.  Sincerely, I hope to further discuss with the authors when encountering the above situations. Table 10 shows parts of the results, but not enough from my view. In addition, I think ASR and CA is a more appropriate metric to indicate the performance of BaDExpert instead of AUROC: Combing Table 1 and Table 2, BaDExpert obtains 11.4% ASR against blend attack. However, the AUROC is 99.2% which is quite close to 100%.

3 The chosen of hyperparemter $\eta'$ could also be unpractical in real world. In reality, only the small subset of clean images is available for defenders. Therefore, they have little knowledge about which $\eta'$will meets the requirement of Badexpert: the CA of the finetuned model's CA first drops to ~ $0\%$ and recovers to a significant value in the following epochs. The defender dooesn't exactly know what the CA of current model is. Therefore, the requirement of Badexpert may be too ideal.

4 Some of the baselines are missing. For example, AWM [1] and ABL [2].

### Questions
1 Table 1 shows that BadExpert is relatively weak to defend against Blend or Dynamic attack. Can you explain the reason behind this phenomenon?

5: You are absolutely certain about your assessment. You are very familiar with the related work and checked the math/other details carefully.

### Summary
A novel backdoor defense BaDExpert is proposed in this paper. BaDExpert is designed to distinguish test instances with the backdoor trigger from benign test instances. The key idea is to fine-tune a "backdoor-expert" model with only the backdoor functionality so that benign test instances will be poorly recognized. Thus, test instances that are differently classified by the backdoored model and the backdoor-expert model are deemed benign; otherwise, a test instance is deemed to contain the trigger.

### Strengths
1) The method is well-motivated and the idea is novel.

2) The experiments are thorough, involving many attack settings and covering many SOTA baselines.

3) The presentation is excellent.

### Weaknesses
More comparisons with existing works regarding the methodology can be included.

### Questions
1. Is the design philosophy of BaDExpert related to [1]? In [1], adversarial examples are detected by encouraging the model to carry malicious behaviors such as a backdoor.

2. Can BaDExpert outperform [2] which also detects malicious inputs?

### Summary
This paper proposed a backdoor defence method called BaDExpert. The main motivation is that normal data can be quickly forgotten with finetuning on inconsistent labels, while backdoor data does not. Based on this characteristic, the proposed method can extract a backdoor functionality of the model, which can only correctly classify backdoor data. Experiments show that the proposed method can effectively detect and defend against backdoor attacks.

### Strengths
- The proposed method is simple, straightforward and effective. Extracting the backdoor functionality is a new idea in backdoor attack research. 
- The empirical evaluations are very comprehensive, including different attacks, datasets, model architectures, and adaptive attacks. Results show it is effective against existing attacks and also demonstrated its limits under adaptive cases.

### Weaknesses
 - The proposed method relies on several procedures, each with different hyperparameters. However, the authors provide an ablation study in each component, with no overall insights/guides for applying such a method in real-world applications. In real applications, the defender does not know for sure that backdoor attacks exist in their data, so it might not be easy to find these suitable hyperparameters. Specifically, the method requires careful tuning of the fine-tuning rate and unlearning rate, which are sensitive to the specific model and dataset. Without clear guidance on how to select these hyperparameters, the method's practical applicability is limited. The ablation studies, while helpful, do not provide a clear strategy for a practitioner to choose appropriate values in a real-world setting where the presence of a backdoor is unknown. 
- The comprehensive experimental results are appreciated. It could be more comprehensive to compare with recent defence methods such as ABL [1], and detection methods [2,3]. It is important to benchmark against state-of-the-art defenses to understand the relative performance of the proposed method. The current comparisons are not sufficient to establish its superiority or even parity with existing techniques. Specifically, the lack of comparison with ABL [1], which focuses on training clean models on poisoned data, and the detection methods such as ASSET [2] and the cognitive backdoor pattern distillation method [3], leaves a gap in the evaluation.
- The method mainly focuses on the detection of backdoor samples (end of section 3). It could help to further clarify what happens after. Results in Table 1 focus on the CA/ASR. It is not clear what happens to the detected samples in order to obtain these results. The paper should clearly specify how detected backdoor samples are handled and how this impacts the reported clean accuracy (CA) and attack success rate (ASR). It is unclear whether detected samples are simply discarded, or if some attempt is made to correct their labels. This lack of clarity makes it difficult to fully understand the implications of the results.
