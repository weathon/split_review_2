## Abstract
Representations learned via self-supervised learning (SSL) can be susceptible to dimensional collapse, where the learned representation subspace is of extremely low dimensionality and thus fails to represent the full data distribution and modalities.
Dimensional collapse ––– also known as the ``underfilling" phenomenon ––– is one of the major causes of degraded performance on downstream tasks.
Previous work has investigated the dimensional collapse problem of SSL at a global level. In this paper, we demonstrate that representations can span over high dimensional space globally, but collapse locally. To address this, we propose a method called {\em local dimensionality regularization (LDReg)}. Our formulation is based on the derivation of the Fisher-Rao metric to compare and optimize local distance distributions at an asymptotically small radius for each data point. By increasing the local intrinsic dimensionality, we demonstrate through a range of experiments that LDReg improves the representation quality of SSL. The results also show that LDReg can regularize dimensionality at both local and global levels.

4: You are confident in your assessment, but not absolutely certain. It is unlikely, but not impossible, that you did not understand some parts of the submission or that you are unfamiliar with some pieces of related work.

### Summary
The authors propose to increase the accuracy of deep models by regularizing the local intrinsic dimensionality (LID) of features. They observe that without the proposed regularization, the dimensionality collapses locally, even if the global dimension remains constant.

### Strengths
(1) The paper is well presented and well supported by theory. 
(2) The method seems intuitive.

### Weaknesses
 (1) It's hard to reference an equation without equation numbers. In your overall optimization objective, it is unclear how $LID^*_F$ is calculated. I see in section 3 that this quantity is the result of a limit of some other quantity $LID_F$, which then depends on differentiating a function. It would be hard for me to implement this loss function just from reading this paper. How are all of these values calculated?

(2) Follow up from (1): It is unclear how you estimate a "local" dimensionality from a mini-batch of samples. The mini-batch is sampled over the entire dataset, so none of them lie in the local neighborhood of other samples within the batch. I don't think this is addressed.

(3) How does the proposed LIDs regularizer compare to regularizing global dimensionality by decorrelating features. The authors site a few works at the end of the first paragraph of the intro, but do not compare against them. For instance [Barlow twins] and [VICE-Reg] are popular ways of doing this.

(4) Follow up from (3): Regularizing global dimensionality makes sense to me, but regularizing local dimensionality does not. e.g. looking at Figure 1(c), the authors show a few examples of local dimensionality collapse compared with one example of high local dimensionality. To me, it looks like the examples with low local dimensionality (i.e. low LID, but constant GID) exhibit more structure and therefore could be better features. How do you expect to learn good features when you regularize the distribution to be a random gaussian both globally and locally?

(5) I don't see any results showing a correlation between test accuracy and LID. I would expect to see a plot showing that when LID increases, so does accuracy. Perhaps I missed it, if so please point me there. Furthermore, I would expect GID and LID to be correlated; so I would expect some result that shows improving LID with constant GID improves accuracy. Perhaps the LID and GID scores could be added to Table 1?

### Summary
[I made a mistake in the form.] I found out that I have accidentally checked the "First Time Reviewer" question, but in fact, I'm not. It seems that I cannot undo it now, so I'm instead writing it here.

This paper proposes a new regularization technique for self-supervised learning. There are many recent works on preserving the internal diversity of self-supervised representation, and one approach is to preserve the effective dimensionality of the representation. Unlike existing work that tries to preserve global dimensionality, this paper argues that local dimensionality might still collapse. To resolve this issue, the paper proposes the local intrinsic dimensionality (LID). Using the Fisher-Rao metric on LID, the proposed method adds a regularization term that makes the distribution of the representation far from the most simplistic distribution (with dimensionality one). Experiments show that the proposed method indeed improves the performance.

### Strengths
- The motivation behind the proposed method (local dimensionality collapse) makes sense, and it is demonstrated empirically.

- The proposed regularization is elaborately designed based on well-founded theories (LID representation, Fisher-Rao metric).

- Experiments show that the local dimensionality indeed improves. The performance improvement itself is somewhat incremental except for a few cases. However, considering the recent self-supervised learning works, this is understandable.

### Weaknesses
 - There is no comparison to other similar methods for improving self-supervised learning. In particular, there is no comparison to ones with global dimensionality regularization (which has close relationships with the proposed method), even though they were mentioned in the paper.

- The proposed method requires the calculation of distance distributions during training. This can be somewhat heavy, depending on the actual settings. Ideally, self-supervised learning is meant to be performed on large-scale data, so this point can be even more burdensome. How big is the actual computational burden? I said that the incremental performance improvement is understandable, but it might not be really beneficial if the computational burden is quite high, considering there are also other recent alternatives.

### Summary
This paper presents a novel variant of the Fisher-Rao metric, and then proposes a local dimensionality regularization (LDReg) to alleviate the dimension collapse in self-supervised learning (SSL). Moreover, it is verified that geometric mean is suitable to manipulate the intrinsic dimension, and therein LDReg maximizes the logarithm of the geometric mean of the sample-wise LID to have nonuniform local nearest neighbor distance distributions. Empirical evaluations are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in some degree.

### Strengths
+ It is interesting to take the perspective of the local intrinsic dimension to remedy the dimensionality collapse. 
+ Applying the geometric mean of the local intrinsic dimensionality (LID) as a regularizer for SSL is novel.

### Weaknesses
 - The empirical evaluations look insignificant. In Table 1 and 3, the performance improvements are relatively weak. The reviewer is curious that these improvements are significant or not?  

- The reviewer is curious about the sensitivity to the locality parameter. What about the performance of the LID based regularizer with respect to the locality parameter $k$? Is it sensitive to the parameter $k$? There is another parameter $N$. Is it the number of samples of the dataset, or is it the batch size? If the later case, what about the sensitivity of the performance with respect to the batch size (or the density of the samples)? 


- $F$ is assumed to be differentialble at $r$. However, if $F(r)$ is defined as the prob of the sample distance lying within a threshold $r$, how can we define the differential at $r$ for $F(r)$? Moreover, $LID_F*$ defined as the limit of $LID_F(r)$ when $r\rightarrow 0$, is refered as LID. How about the approximation quality of such a local intrisic dimension estimator? In another words, is it a good estimator of the local intrisinc dimension? Is any theoretical or empirical evidence to show the quality of the so-defined LID to estimate the local intrinsic dimension of the data?

### Questions
- Since that the results in Table 1 and 3, the improvements are relatively weak. Are these improvements significant? Or it is from other minor modification or some random fluctuation?  

- What about the performance of the LID based regularizer with respect to the parameter $k$? Is the parameter $k$ affected by the batch size (or the density of the samples)? 

- Since that $LID_F*$ defined as the limit of $LID_F(r)$ when $r\rightarrow 0$. How about the approximation quality of such a local intrisic dimension estimator? In another words, is it a good estimator of the local intrisinc dimension? Is any theoretical or empirical evidence to show the quality of the so-defined LID to estimate the local intrinsic dimension of the data?

### Summary
This work introduces a novel approach called LDReg for addressing SSL problems. LDReg incorporates the concept of local intrinsic dimensionality (LID), as measured in (Houle, 2017a), and utilizes it as a penalty term in various SSL models.
The experimental results presented in this paper demonstrate the effectiveness of LDReg in improving SSL performance. The conducted experiments on benchmark datasets highlight the positive impact of incorporating LID as a regularization term.

### Strengths
1. The dimensional collapse problem in SSL has received significant attention in recent years, with several works addressing this issue. This work offers a fresh perspective on the problem and introduces a generalized regularization approach that can be applied to existing SSL models.

2. An advantage of this work is its convenient implementation, allowing for improved performance in downstream tasks without the need to modify the underlying architecture. By providing an additional viewpoint on the dimension collapse problem, this work contributes to the ongoing efforts in tackling this challenge.

### Weaknesses
1.While the performance of SSL models with LDReg is impressive, the novelty of this work appears to be limited as the proposed LID is inspired by or defined similarly to IntrDim proposed in (Houle, 2017a). Without proper attribution to (Houle, 2017a), the novelty of this work becomes questionable.

2.It is recommended that the authors verify whether Houle et al. have indeed proposed Theorem 1, which defines LID. If not, it would not be reasonable to cite (Houle, 2017a) in Theorem 1 and define LID based on it. On the other hand, if Houle et al. did define LID in (Houle, 2017a), the novelty of this work would be further discounted.

3.Since the only contribution of this work seems to be the definition of LID, which is directly borrowed from (Houle, 2017a), it is suggested to provide a more detailed explanation in Section 3 to clarify the relationship between the proposed LID and the work of (Houle, 2017a).

4.The experimental results lack in-depth analysis. Several significant observations, as mentioned in the Q4, have been overlooked. It is recommended to address these observations and provide a thorough analysis of the experimental results.

### Questions
1.This paper appears to have been organized in a hurry, as evidenced by the missing parenthesis in Definition 1. On page 19, there are two versions of $w_k$ ($w^k$).

2.On page 4, it is unclear what ‘Pr’ denotes. Please provide an explanation or definition for this term.

3.In addition to the $\bf{LID}$ defined using $\bf{IntrDim}$ in (Houle, 2017a) and the theoretical analysis using Fisher-Rao metric to provide justification, please clearly highlight the additional contributions of this work.

4.While the experimental results presented on different datasets show improvements compared to other SSL models without LDReg, the authors did not analyze the reasons behind the under-performance results. Additionally, it is unclear how dimensional collapse was observed in the experiment, as the results alone cannot directly reflect this improvement.

5.Technically, the regularization used is $\mu_k / (\mu_k - w_k)$, which prefers that nearest neighbors are not in the same surface of the sphere ball of the sample. Other works that aim to improve dimensional collapse are referred to as compared methods in the experiments.
