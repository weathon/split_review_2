## Abstract
Triggered by limitations of graph-based deep learning methods in terms of computational expressivity and model flexibility, recent years have seen a surge of interest in computational models that operate on higher-order topological domains such as hypergraphs and simplicial complexes.
    While the increased expressivity of these models can indeed lead to a better classification performance and a more faithful representation of the underlying system, the computational cost of these higher-order models can increase dramatically.
    To this end, we here explore a simplicial complex neural network learning architecture based on random walks and fast 1D convolutions (SCRaWl), in which we can adjust the increase in computational cost by varying the length and number of random walks considered while accounting for higher-order relationships.
    Importantly, due to the random walk-based design, the expressivity of the proposed architecture is provably incomparable to that of existing message-passing simplicial neural networks.
	We empirically evaluate SCRaWl on real-world datasets and show that it outperforms other simplicial neural networks.

### Summary
This paper proposes a new learning method on simplicial complexes based on random walks and 1-D convolution encodings.

### Strengths
1. The idea of using random walks to tackle the high complexity of learning on simplicial complexes is a natural idea. The overall design also looks reasonable to me.
2. Experiments show that the proposed method outperforms some of the most recent methods.

### Weaknesses
1. Compared to this work, a recent work [1] seems to provide more principled insights into exactly the same topic. Can the authors discuss more of its edge over this work?

2. The experiments are conducted on a relatively limited number of datasets. I would hope to see more datasets from diverse domains being used.

### Summary
The paper proposes a method called SCRAWL which explores simplicial complexes-based learning representations for graph datasets using random walks and 1D convolution on simplices. This work is built on top of the recent work CRAWL which uses random walks and 1D conv directly on graphs. The authors performed two tasks vertex classification and missing citation counts on two benchmark datasets.

### Strengths
1. The paper is well presented and motivated. 
2. Additional information from simplices seems to improve embeddings. The results are interesting. 
3. An ablation study is provided to show the robustness and compare it against existing works. 
4. The expressivity is equivalent to CRAWL. So, the theorem by CRAWL holds for this too.

### Weaknesses
1. The major concern I could see is memory and computation as it contains the matrices for k levels of simplices. And, each walk consists of six matrices. Specifically, the memory footprint for storing the feature matrices across multiple simplicial levels, especially for larger graphs, could become prohibitive. The need to maintain six matrices per random walk further exacerbates this issue, potentially limiting the applicability of the method to very large datasets.
2. It is not clear how long the walk is and how many walks are computed for each of the k-simplices. Assuming m is for the collection of all walks from all k-simplices. The paper should explicitly state the number of walks per simplex and the length of each walk, as these are crucial parameters that significantly impact both the computational cost and the quality of the learned embeddings. The lack of clarity on this aspect makes it difficult to assess the practical feasibility of the approach.
3. Why are walks passed in every layer? Is it not enough to use it only at the input? The rationale for passing the random walks through every layer of the network is not well-explained. It is unclear if this is necessary for the model to learn effectively, or if it introduces redundant computations. A detailed justification for this design choice is needed to understand its impact on the model's performance and efficiency.
4. How are the output from k-simplices combined for the final output? I could see three different outputs in Fig. 3. The method for aggregating the outputs from different simplicial levels is not clearly described. The paper should provide a precise explanation of how the outputs y0, y1, ..., yk are combined to produce the final prediction, especially given that Fig. 3 suggests multiple outputs.
5. Fig 6. results are on par with MPSN. Justification of why it works differently on two different kinds of datasets would be much appreciated. Results are improved significantly for social networks although it.

### Questions
Why are walks computed on the fly or they are just sampled on the fly? Can’t we precompute the walks which is just one time processing before training?

### Summary
The paper presents SCRaWI, a neural network model to encode simplicial complexes based on higher-order random walks on simplices. SCRaWI samples several higher-order random walks followed by fast 1D convolutions to learn the structural properties of the Simplicial Data.

### Strengths
The paper is well-written and easy to follow. Also, it is well-organized with enough illustrative figures. The proposed method is simple, yet potentially powerful, which makes it feasible for large and real-world cases. More, specifically, the model design allows choosing the number of sampled random walks as a hyperparameter, which provides a trade-off between computational cost and the expressivity of the model. Also, using fast Fourier transforms to perform convolutions on sampled walks is an interesting idea, which potentially can improve efficiency and training time.

### Weaknesses
The paper has missed some important related studies or detailed discussions about them. As an example, there are several random walk-based methods [1, 2] in a simple graph, which uses a similar idea. While they have been briefly mentioned, there are some important questions about them that are not discussed in the paper. Is there any connection between SCRaWl and these methods? Or is SCRaWl the extended version of these studies to higher-order data? A very similar study on higher-order graphs is CATWALK [3], which is a hypergraph learning method that similarly uses higher-order random walks to learn higher-order patterns. I think, given the fact that hypergraphs can be seen as a general case of simplicial complexes, their walk sampling is exactly the same as this work, which limits the novelty of this paper's idea and its model design.

The proposed method is simple, which is a desirable property **if** the effectiveness of the method is theoretically or experimentally shown. That is, the novelty of the model architecture is limited, so it is expected that extensive experimental or theoretical results will support the method's performance. However, in the paper, the experimental study is very limited, e.g.:

1. There are only three datasets from two different domains. Please note that co-authorship networks and social networks usually have similar properties so it would be much better if the authors could provide more datasets with different domains, specifically in drug-drug or chemical networks (NDC, and/or NDC Substances), and communication networks (Email Enron). 
 
2. There is a lack of ablation study on the method architecture. Accordingly, it is not clear what is the contribution of each component of SCRaWl. How using a simple random walk instead of a higher-order random walk can affect the performance? How does each of the six features contribute to the performance of SCRaWl?

3. The main motivations and claims in the paper are not supported by experiments. For example, when the main motivation is to address the inefficiency of the existing methods, I think it is needed to see how SCRaWl performs compared to existing methods in terms of time and how proposed components are improving the efficiency. 

4. Hypergraphs are another paradigm to represent higher-order interactions. There is a lack of comparison with state-of-the-art hypergraph learning methods [3, 4, 5]. 



In addition to the above points, as discussed in the "Introduction" section, there is a trade-off between computational cost and the power of SCRaWl. It would be great if you could show this trade-off in the experiments as well.

### Questions
Please see the Weaknesses. In summary, my suggestions are here: Please add 

1. more discussions about existing methods [1, 2]. Also please discuss [3] and its differences with your method.
2. more datasets, different experimental settings, and hypergraph learning-based baselines. 
3. ablation studies to show the contribution of each component. 
4. scalability and efficiency evaluation.

### Summary
This paper presents a novel algorithm for learning on simplicial
complexes, i.e. generalisations of graphs. As opposed to relying on the
message passing paradigm, the paper uses random walks (or rather,
*sampled* random walks) to featurise the input data, subsequently
employing 1D convolutions as a type of local update mechanism.
Experiments on several data sets demonstrate the efficacy of the method.

### Strengths
The paper is exceptionally well written and describes highly-original
research. Given the recent interest in extending graph learning to
higher-order structures, the work is also timely and highly-relevant.

Moreover, I appreciate that this paper presents alternatives to the
prevailing message passing paradigm. As amply demonstrated in the
manuscript, this leads to a different class of expressivity, thus
opening the door to further explorations.

The current write-up is sufficiently detailed to be reproducible, and
all concepts are explained sufficiently well. This paper was truly
a pleasure to read and review.

### Weaknesses
Only minor weaknesses cropped up, which can be easily addressed in
a revision (please also see my questions below).

- The impact of parameter choices could be studied more carefully.

- A discussion on the utility of a simplicial perspective might enrich
  the paper. As it stands now, the experiments deal with simplicial
  data. The scope of the paper could be improved substantially if the
  simplicial perspective was shown to be *crucial* for good performance.
  I want to stress that I consider this to be a minor weakness since the
  paper as such already makes a strong contribution under the assumption
  that simplicial complexes are the 'right' thing to model the data.
  Showing this empirically would just be a cherry on top of this cake.

  (the experiment on social contact networks is a good start for this,
  but I would appreciate a more in-depth discussion **if possible**)

- Unless I am mistaken, the proper verb form should be 'convolved' as
  a opposed to 'convoluted' (in Figure 2).

- As a minor style issue: please use `\citep` and `\citet` (when using
  `natbib`) consistently. The former is meant for parenthetical
  citations, the latter for in-text citations.

- There are some inconsistencies (mostly capitalisation / venues) in the
  references.

- When it comes to explaining expressivity in the context of WL,
  a [recent survey](https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.09992) might be useful as
  an additional reference. (The related work covered at the moment is
  sufficient; this is just a suggestion. The review form unfortunately
  lacks a field for 'additional comments')

### Questions
1. How are the random walk parameters (length / number of walks)
   affecting performance? Could you show predictive performance as
   a function of these parameters (or, even better, provide theoretical
   guarantees)?

2. Would the proposed method also extend to *hypergraphs* or other
   combinatorial complexes? This seems to be the case, given that merely
   a notion of a random walk is required.

3. Given the performance considerations, are there any practical
   limitations in terms of data set size that could be given? This might
   be useful to assess the suitability for certain data sets in advance.
