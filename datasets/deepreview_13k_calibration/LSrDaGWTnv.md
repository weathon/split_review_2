## Abstract
Probabilistic inference over time series data is challenging when observations are high-dimensional. In this paper, we show how inference questions relating to prediction and planning can have compact, closed form solutions in terms of learned representations. The key idea is to apply a variant of contrastive learning to time series data. Prior work already shows that the representations learned by contrastive learning encode a probability ratio. By first extending this analysis to show that the marginal distribution over representations is Gaussian, we can then prove that conditional distribution of future representations is also Gaussian. Taken together, these results show that a variant of temporal contrastive learning results in representations distributed according to a Gaussian Markov chain, a graphical model where inference (e.g., filtering, smoothing) has closed form solutions. For example, in one special case the problem of trajectory inference simply corresponds to linear interpolation of the initial and final state representations. We provide brief empirical results validating our theory.

### Summary
The authors analyze time-constravie learning methods (Info NCE with L2 regularization). 
*  1) They showed learned representations take isotropic Gaussian distributions. 
*  2) Under Assumption 1, they show that the conditional distribution for representation takes a closed-form solution, Gaussian distribution (Lemma 4.1.) 
*  3) They showed that inference over representations can be similarly done in Sections 4.3 and 4.4.

### Strengths
## Presetation  

* The question they address is essential. 
* The writing way is overall clear.  
* The analysis looks correct. 

## Contribution 

* The author asserts that the current body of literature on time-contrastive learning fails to elucidate the utility of acquired representations for the purpose of planning. If this assertion holds, I believe this paper's contribution carries substantial significance.

* The author contends that their approach is computationally more straightforward than sequential reconstruction-based methods. I agree with this assertion.

### Weaknesses
Note I clarify that this area is outside of my expertise. And, I am willing to change my score.  


* There is a lack of comprehensive experimentation in Section 5.  I acknowledge the author's emphasis on the theoretical aspect of their work and  I highly value theoretical contributions. From what I gather, the author asserts that their work simplifies the planning process by deriving the analytical Gaussian form. I agree with this statement. However, at present, it remains challenging to envision how this method can offer practical utility in moderately complex environments and tasks. It raises questions about its direct applicability and the potential necessity of heuristics. The inclusion of empirical evidence would significantly strengthen the case for acceptance. Currently, I find myself in a somewhat undecided position.

* The relationship between Section 4 (inference over representations) and its applicability to specific tasks remains somewhat unclear. In RL, particularly in control tasks, our primary objective is to acquire the optimal policy, and any guarantees should pertain to the performance of this learned policy. It appears that this paper intends to convey the idea that learned representations can be useful for "inference over representations." However, it raises questions about whether "inference over representations" serves as the ultimate goal when analyzing data or if there are additional, more concrete objectives we should aim to address. Is there an opportunity to provide a more theoretically rigorous framework that aligns with the typical goals we seek to achieve?

### Questions
* Section 3: The paragraph titled "Our analysis will also look..." could benefit from substantial improvement. Currently, critical information resides in the Appendix, making it challenging to grasp the content of this section without consulting the Appendix. Ideally, drafts should be made to ensure that readers can comprehend the core content without the need for constant reference to the Appendix.
	
* Section 3: As a related suggestion, it would be advantageous to formalize the statements in this section within theorem/lemma/proposition frameworks, similar to the structure used in Lemma 4.1.
	
* In (4), there is no $c/(c+1)$? 

* When l encounter with the term "planning," I initially inferred that it referred to the process of deriving an optimal policy in a control task. Is the current use of the term "planning" widely accepted within the community? In my perspective, the term "inference" appears to be a more precise descriptor.

* Is the primary assertion in Section 3, which states "learned representations follow isotropic Gaussian distributions," a novel contribution? The current phrasing does not distinctly convey what aspects are original. For instance, the reference to "supported by analysis based on Wang and Isola" is somewhat ambiguous. Does this imply that such analysis has been previously conducted in their work?

### Summary
The paper aims at leveraging contrastive representation for planning. It assumes representations in a sequential decision problems, say RL setting, are learned by contrastive learning, and under certain assumptions, the authors derive the conditional probability distribution of future state representation given initial state, and that of intermediate states’ representation given an initial and an ending representations. Simple empirical results are provided to validate the proposed method.

### Strengths
1. The topic of planning in representation space looks interesting; 

2. I am not aware of works studying contrastive learning for representation learning and planning, it appears to be novel in this regard

### Weaknesses
My primary concern is in the significance of this work.

The presented result, lemma 4.1, 4.2 seem to follow a commonly seen algebraic computation when deriving multivariate conditional gaussian distributions, there is no new contribution in terms of proof techniques.

Though planning is important in control, this paper focuses on the calculation of the conditional probability given certain states’ representations, I do not see why this is a difficult task. It is often more critical to show how effective the sampled states can be used in planning, which is not studied in this paper.

The main theoretical results lemma 4.1, 4.2 alone seem not enough for a top conference. The authors should discuss the connection to several related work: PILCO work by Marc et al., and Gaussian processes for data-efficient learning in robotics and control. Although the proposed methods are not the same, the involved computation bears similarities and all works involves planning. The authors might agree that the two works contain more contributions both theoretically and empirically.

### Summary
This blue sky research paper presents a contrastive learning method for time series. Its key selling point is that temporal dynamics have closed form solutions. Once the heavy assumptions on everything being Gaussian are digested, well known properties of Gaussians (like marginal distributions again being Gaussian) can be exploited.

### Strengths
The ability to inter- and extrapolate trajectories in closed form is surely a great and extremely powerful property.

Full code is included, even if the experiment is minimal at best.

### Weaknesses
The by far weakest point of the paper is that the authors miss to demonstrate that their method works on a real problem. After all, this is still machine learning. No matter how beautiful the derivation is, a method that does not work in the real world has no value. I have severe doubts that it will every work, say, for modeling an industrial process or a robot turning a knob to open a door. For my taste, the assumptions in section 3 are far too strong to be left unchecked on real data. The assumption of Gaussianity, especially, is a major limitation, as real-world time series data often exhibits non-Gaussian characteristics such as multi-modality, heavy tails, or skewness. The method's reliance on closed-form solutions, while mathematically elegant, might not be robust to deviations from these strong assumptions. It's unclear how the method would handle noisy or corrupted data, which is common in practical applications. Furthermore, the paper lacks a discussion on the sensitivity of the method to the choice of hyperparameters, which could significantly impact its performance on real-world datasets.

The paper has multiple presentation and language issues:
1. Use of terms: The term "planning" has a technical meaning in artificial intelligence. That meaning is very different from temporal inter- or extrapolation, which is what it is refers to in the paper. Therefore, even the paper title is completely misleading. A similar consideration applies to the central term "representation", which is used as a map from observations to a latent space, and also for an element of that space, sometimes with different meaning within the same sentence.
2. Abbreviations: The abbreviations "CV" and "NLP" are of course generally understood in the community. It is nevertheless good style to state the complete terms at least once before using abbreviations. Other abbreviations are less commonly known, like NCE.
3. Figure 1 is pretty meaningless.
4. The first paragraph of section 2 ends in the middle of a sentence.
5. I am surprised to see that the title of section 4 coincides with the paper title.
6. At the point figure 2 is presented (section 1), the symbols in the figure are not introduced yet.
7. Why on earth should one gray out a proof?

### Questions
I don't have any questions that need clarification in the rebuttal phase.
