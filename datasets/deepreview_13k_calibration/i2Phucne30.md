## Abstract
Classical wisdom in machine learning holds that the generalization error can be decomposed into bias and variance, and these two terms exhibit a \emph{trade-off}. However, in this paper, we show that for an ensemble of deep learning based classification models, bias and variance are \emph{aligned} at a sample level, where squared bias is approximately \emph{equal} to variance for correctly classified sample points. We present empirical evidence confirming this phenomenon in a variety of deep learning models and datasets. Moreover, we study this phenomenon from two theoretical perspectives: calibration and neural collapse. We first show theoretically that under the assumption that the models are well calibrated, we can observe the bias-variance alignment. Second, starting from the picture provided by the neural collapse theory, we show an approximate correlation between bias and variance.

### Summary
The paper discusses the *bias-variance alignment* phenomenon with respect to an ensemble of deep models in classification tasks. Essentially, the phenomenon states that the logarithms of bias and variance (within the ensemble and at a given sample) of predicted probabilities are well described by a linear relation with coefficient $1$, i.e. $\log \mathrm{Vari} \approx \log \mathrm{Bias}^2 + C$. The authors first empirically demonstrate the phenomenon on image classification tasks. Then, they proceed to a theoretical justification of the phenomenon from two independent perspectives: calibration and neural collapse. For the calibration perspective, the authors propose a definition of calibration that unifies other definitions previously used in the literature and then utilize it to show that bias-variance gap can be bounded by the calibration error. For the neural collapse perspective, the authors propose a simple model of ensemble predictions based on Gumbel noise added to the perfect neural collapse prediction (i.e. ETF complex vertices) and explicitly derive bias and variance given the scale $s$ of last layer features, subsequently showing that for all values of $s$ bias-variance alignment approximately holds.

### Strengths
Overall, the paper is well-written and organized, which allowed to compactly describe a number of various contributions. 

The contributions of the paper present are very balanced and include 
- Formulation and explanation of a new phenomenon. It is done via a nice illustration (Figure 1, both a. and b.), intuitive explanation of the phenomenon, clear definitions and the setting (sec. 2.1), and a focused related work section.
- Very convincing empirical evidence supporting it. In my experience, it is quite difficult to find simple relations that accurately describe modern neural networks on realistic-data (i.e. not toy models). Yet, the quality of the linear relation on figure 1.b (and other plots of the same type) is surprisingly high. 
- The authors found two quite simple theoretical scenarios that can replicate the bias-variance alignment. Moreover, these scenarios are quite distinct: the calibration part requires no specific assumptions and provides rigorous upper bounds, while the neural collapse part uses very specific model which admits an exact and explicit solution (i.e. not just an upper/lower bound).

### Weaknesses
Overall, I have not found significant drawbacks.

There are a few moments which could be corrected to improve clarity and reading experience: 
- Formally, eq. (52) is correct only up to the addition of a vector parallel to $\mathbf{1}_K$. Indeed, such vectors, when passed to softmax, can be ignored and therefore does not affect the subsequent calculations performed in the paper. However, it would be better to mention this to avoid confusion. 
- The colors for negative and positive classes in figures 12,13 are swapped compared to the rest of the plots in the papers. Though completely stylistic, it would be nice to have a consistent color scheme to make paper reading more comfortable.
- It took me some time to verify that variable $F$ appearing in eq. (59) indeed has $F(2(K-1),2)$ distribution. Since this fact is central for the following computation and, to my understanding, motivates the choice of Gumbel distribution for $v$ in assumption 5.1, it would be better to discuss and explain this explicitly in appendix.  

Also, a couple of minor typos:
- Histograms for negative classes have disappeared in the middle row of Figure 12. 
- A typo "$K$ as the number of samples" at the end of sec. G.2.

### Questions
I have a few questions mostly related to the Neural Collapse part. 
- Does figure 13 contain only correctly classified samples or all of them? In the latter case, it would be interesting to know why the approximately vertical shape of wrongly classified points (e.g. a "blue tail" on figure 1.b) is not present in the synthetic data. 
- *Choice of Gumbel distribution*. Overall, the validation of assumption 5.1 presented in sec. G.2 seems to support the hypothesis that we may write $\psi_\tau(X)=R(sw^{\mathrm{ETF}_Y+v})$ with random vector $v$ whose entries are i.i.d., zero mean, and have unimodal shape. For example, Gaussian distribution satisfies these criteria. So is there some additional evidence for choosing Gumbel distribution, besides it enabling an analytical solution? 
- After eq. (10) it is mentioned that the paper considers (except sec. E.2) MSE loss on top of classifier probabilities. However, I did not find any mention that this is also applied to the training of neural networks used for empirical results - that would be quite non-standard from a practical point of view (CE loss is usually used in practice). Could you please provide details on how the networks were trained?
- If, in the previous question, CE loss was used, I would expect that scale parameter $s$ of ETF complex grows with training time in the terminal phase of training (it is required for reduction of train loss to extremely small values). Then, by training the network for a very long time, one can hope to cover a wide range of $c$ values from Corollary 5.3, and thus experimentally check whether theoretical prediction that $\log \mathrm{Bias}^2 / \log \mathrm{Var}$ changes from $0.557$ to $2$. It would be interesting to see whether the theory can work on such a fine level of detail. However, this also contradicts \textit{bias-variance alignment} statement (1) since it requires $\log \mathrm{Bias}^2 / \log \mathrm{Var} \to 1$ as $\log \mathrm{Var}\to-\infty$.

### Summary
The paper studies the trends in the bias and variance of an ensemble of classification models (including their pointwise trends). It empirically establishes two phenomena: the bias variance alignment and upper bounding variance with bias. On a theoretical front, the paper shows that the bias variance gap in expectation can be bounded by a variant of calibration error and therefore when the models are calibrated the exhibit the above phenomenon. Furthermore, assuming that for test data the model prediction is perturbed from the model obtained during training after neural collapse and the upper bounding variance phenomenon for binary classification is proved.

### Strengths
a) Through experiments, the paper establishes the alignment of the bias and variance. The role of overparameterization in the bias variance phenomenon is well demonstrated. This provides an avenue to understand generalization for over-parameterized models. 

b) The Assumption 5.1 on model prediction under neural collapse is very interesting. Using this to show the bound the ratio of variance and bias is novel. 

c) A general definition of calibration under a sub-$\sigma$-algebras is a nice contribution.

### Weaknesses
 a) The main weakness of the paper is the comparison with related work. For example, theorem 4.3 seems equivalent to the theorem 4.2 in [1].  In the appendix it is claimed that the theorem 4.3 implies the result of [1].  However, it seems more of an equivalence than implication.  The authors should comment on this aspect in the main paper to be more transparent.

b) Assuming that the model predictions are well calibrated seems is a very strong assumption, thus using this to bound the bias variance gap makes the result less interesting.

### Summary
This paper investigates the bias-variance decomposition of deep ensembles. The paper claims that, in the deep learning regime, the relationship between (squared) bias and variance is (a) approximately linear for correctly classified test examples and (b) bounded for all examples ($B^2 \geq k \cdot V$). These claims are evaluated on standard deep learning image benchmarks. The role of over-parameterization is also investigated. Two theoretical discussions are included: one showing that certain relationships between bias and variance can be made explicit under calibration assumptions and the other providing some results from the perspective of neural collapse theory.

### Strengths
* This paper addresses an interesting problem which is the bias-variance trade-off in the regime of deep ensembles which has some distinct characteristics compared to the regime from which it emerged (decision trees, random forests, etc). 
* It makes an interesting and (to the best of my knowledge) novel claim that bias and variance are _aligned_ (i.e. have some consistent behaviors in their relationship) in the deep ensemble setting. 
* Experiments are performed on standard image benchmarks of CIFAR and ImageNet making them relevant to many previous deep ensemble works. 
* Aspects of the connection to calibration were useful and provided concrete results that seem to reinforce the authors claims.
* I found that the introduction did a good job of setting up the structure of the paper and it's main claims.

### Weaknesses
I am quite borderline on this paper. I found the topic and claims of the paper interesting and worthwhile and I certainly think there is value to the community in this type of analysis. However, the exposition of many of the ideas could have been better. I think there were too many ideas (often quite disjoint) that were densely squeezed into the 9 pages requiring a terse, notation-heavy delivery that was challenging to follow at times. I thought some ideas were under-explored (e.g. the role of overparameterization) while others were over-explored (e.g. I felt the section on neural collapse added little to the paper). Overall, I think the paper would greatly benefit from prioritizing its more impactful claims and resolving them more comprehensively. I list my more specific issues below. 
* **Title** - I'm not sure about the use of the word alignment. You wish to make a statement about the relationship between two variables (i.e. they are linear or proportional). I don't think aligned quite means this. Additionally, this is an overloaded word with connotations in e.g. AI safety. 
* **Related work** - I found the related work to be _highly_ incomplete without any inclusion of previous works in the ensemble or deep ensemble literature. For example, many previous works (some recent [1,2], others older [3]) have explored various overlapping aspects of decomposing ensembles into bias and variance. Recent works have empirically noticed and explored the role of overparameterization on variance [4]. Other work has noticed that optimizing to increase ensemble variance causes a simultaneous increase in the predictive bias [5]. I would recommend that the authors perform an extensive literature review to appropriately position themselves relative to this and other works from the ensemble literature. 
* **Evidence for empirical claims** - Ultimately the two main hypothesized relationships proposed in this paper are empirical in nature (despite being possibly motivated by theory). Therefore I would have expected a more extensive empirical evaluation of their claims. Only CIFAR and ImageNet datasets are included, which seems insufficient for the claim that this is a general relationship. I would be more convinced if either (a) the claims were reduced to just standard benchmarks on image data or (b) more comprehensive experiments were performed (i.e. more datasets and more architectures). Additionally, I found it challenging at times to tell if the results included had sufficient detail to evaluate the claims. For example, should Fig 3 not include colors so that we can ensure the outliers are also misclassified? Should the actual bound not be included so that we can verify eqn (3)? I think the presented results could be more clearly linked to the claims they are investigating. 
* **Overparameterization** - I think the role of overparameterization in deep ensembles and how it seems to invalidate the theory developed in the original ensembling literature (e.g. random forests) is fascinating. Therefore I was disappointed that this analysis didn't go into more depth and consisted of simply evaluating ResNets of various widths on CIFAR. Given that the authors decided to include this in the paper I would have liked to have learned more than what was already established in works such as [4].
* **Calibration** - The relationship between calibration and bias-variance was interesting to explore. However, given that the main claims of the paper are empirical I thought this section could have been less detailed to provide more time to actually verify and evaluate the empirical claims in depth. I thought much of this section could have been presented in a more clear way that more succinctly linked to its purpose (i.e. its relationship to bias-variance alignment and upper-bounded variance).  I think it would be possible to restructure this section such that important points are clear with some more of the technical detail (when less relevant to the main point) placed in the appendix. 
* **Neural collapse** - In contrast, I thought the section on Neural collapse added very little to the paper. The assumptions are restrictive and the results don't seem to be particularly useful. Also, it seems that the section is too short to have space the provide sufficient detail and background on the topic. I would suggest moving most or all of this section to the appendix and using the additional space to expand on the empirical evaluation. 

Other points
* The two claims on page 2 are empirical claims but are presented in a way that suggests they are theoretical truths (I misunderstood this on my first read). I would suggest making this more clear in the text. 
* Eqn (10) should either contain a proof (in the appendix) or cite a source (since the authors claim it is well-known). 
* Many of the plots are very small (especially the text) making them hard to read. 
* Tables 1 & 4 formatting is unusual. Why the double line at the top? I would try to avoid vertical lines in the body of tables (see NeurIPS style guide). 
* Typo - p9, l5: "In above" -> "In the above"

### Questions
* Is the $C_{h_{\theta}}$ in eqn (2) the same as the one in eqn (3)? If so, this should be made more clear. 
* I would be interested in the authors' view on the consequences of the findings of this paper and how it should impact future work. For example, how do these results impact the intuitions we may have developed in the domain of ensembles of "simple" models (e.g. decision trees)?

### Confidence
4: You are confident in your assessment, but not absolutely certain. It is unlikely, but not impossible, that you did not understand some parts of the submission or that you are unfamiliar with some pieces of related work.

### Summary
The paper conducts extensive experiments across realistic datasets and architectures (mostly on vision tasks) to demonstrate that the bias of a classifier correlates strongly with its variance in the regime where the number of parameters is large. They go on to show that smaller networks deviate and have worse bias-variance correlation. They prove theoretically that such an alignment should happen under the assumption that the network is well-calibrated. Finally, they show that the theory of neural collapse also predicts such an alignment.

### Strengths
The paper provides extensive empirical evidence for the bias-variance alignment phenomenon across different model architectures and datasets. The figures are very compelling, esp Figures 2-4. The two theoretical motivations are solid in the opinion of the reviewer. The connection to calibration is certainly interesting. Overall, this paper provides new insights into the bias-variance relation in deep learning and I recommend acceptance.

### Weaknesses
I don't have many comments on this. The primary datasets that this paper focuses on are in image classification - it would be good to see results on other domains like NLP or even simple polynomial curve fitting.

It would also be good to be more explicit about what bias and variance you're talking about. Adlam and Pennington (as cited in our paper) show that double descent can be clearly understood in linear models by using a "fine-grained" bias-variance decomposition. There, there is variance due to initial parameters, train set, and label noise. Its extremely hard to understand which sources of variance you're talking about in section 2.1. It's clear that initial parameters is certainly one of them, since you are defining $h(\cdot | x) = \mathbb E_{\theta} h_{\theta}(\cdot | x)$, but it is not clear how the variance over train set is entering this (or whether it is at all).

The change to CE loss in appendices E.2, F.6 is not very readable. It seems that the effect mostly goes away. Given the ubiquity of CE in modern ML, it would be nice to expand and make these currently tiny sections more clear.

### Questions
My understanding is that real-world models do not generally exhibit calibration. Given this, would you still expect the bias-variance equality to hold approximately for uncalibrated models as well?

I don't really understand why you're saying that in Figure 7, Bias and Variance don't align well. There definitely seems to be nontrivial correlation. Is it just that it is worse than Figures 3, 4?

It would be interesting to study the bias and variance as a function of feature learning strength in the network. The scale of the variance over initializations is shown to depend inversely on feature learning strength in e.g. https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.12147
