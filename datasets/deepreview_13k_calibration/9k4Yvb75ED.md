## Abstract
Advancements in audio-visual representation learning have showcased its effectiveness in acquiring rich and comprehensive representations by leveraging both auditory and visual modalities. Recent works have attempted to improve performance using contrastive learning or masked modeling techniques. However, the effort to maximize the impact of data augmentations for learning semantically rich representation has remained relatively narrow. Without a proper strategy for utilizing data augmentation, the model can be adversely affected or fail to achieve sufficient performance gains. To address this limitation, we present EquiAV, a novel framework that integrates single-modal equivariant contrastive learning with audio-visual contrastive learning. In the proposed framework, audio-visual correspondence and rich modality-specific representations are learned in separate latent spaces. In particular, augmentation-related and modality-specific information is learned in the intra-modal latent space by making the representations equivariant to data augmentation. Extensive ablation studies verify that our framework is the most suitable architecture for maximizing the benefits of the augmentation while ensuring model robustness to strong augmentation. EquiAV outperforms the existing audio-visual self-supervised pre-training methods on audio-visual event classification and zero-shot audio-visual retrieval tasks.

### Summary
In this paper, the authors introduce EquiAV, a new framework that integrates single-modal equivariant contrastive learning with audio-visual contrastive learning. In the proposed framework, audio-visual correspondence and rich modality-specific representations are learned in separate latent spaces.  Extensive ablation studies verify that EquiAV outperforms the existing audio-visual self-supervised learning methods on audio-visual event classification and zero-shot audio-visual retrieval tasks.

### Strengths
The authors extend single-modal equivariant representation learning to the audio-visual domain, achieving better performance than previous audio-visual self-supervised learning methods.

### Weaknesses
 + Novelty. The technical contribution of the proposed method is relatively limited. It extends the existing EQUIMOD [1] method to audio and visual modalities, applying it to audio-visual self-supervised learning. I do not see any specific contributions of this work to the audio-visual learning field. The intra loss was applied to the two modalities separately, and I do not believe that this work contributes any new insights into cross-modal modality. Simply applying a state-of-the-art approach to a new application does not necessarily result in new significant contributions.

+ Writing. Some statements about the key contributions are vague. For example, the authors state that "employing augmentations in multi-modal contrastive learning requires careful consideration, as augmentations can severely distort the inter-modal correspondence." It would be helpful to provide some specific examples to illustrate how augmentations can distort the inter-modal correspondence. Additionally, "the equivariance loss term in the proposed framework differs slightly from the single-modal equivariant self-supervised learning (Devillers & Lefort, 2023). The key distinction is whether or not the similarity of the positive pair is included in the denominator of the loss term." However, it is unclear why the positive pair is included in the denominator. Finally, the authors state that "to model the displacement in the latent space caused by data augmentations, augmentation predictors take as input the concatenation of the original input embeddings and the augmentation vectors, and output equivariant embeddings." It would be helpful to describe more specifically what kinds of displacements these predictors can model and why concatenating the input embedding and augmentation vector is helpful.

+ Experiment. What if we applied Equimod to audio and visual data directly without the positive term in the loss?

### Summary
The EquiAV framework proposed in this paper aims to improve audio-visual self-supervised learning by finding a strategy for utilizing data augmentation that maximizes the benefits of the model while maintaining robustness to substantial augmentation. The approach combines single-modal equivariant contrastive learning and audio-visual contrastive learning to learn audio-visual correspondence and modality-specific representations separately. The paper also compared various techniques employed in audio-visual representation learning. The EquiAV ensures that diverse augmentations applied to both audio and visual modalities benefit the model. Experimental results demonstrate that the EquiAV approach outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in audio-visual event classification and zero-shot audio-visual retrieval tasks. Extensive ablation studies are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in learning audio-visual correspondence and enhancing representation capability.

### Strengths
- The author uses detailed comparative experiments and ablation experiments to prove the effectiveness and advancement of the EquiAV framework using single-modal equivariant representation learning. The article is also logically clear and uses reasonable diagrams to explain the relevant content clearly.
- In the experiment, EquiAV showed impressive results and also provided the best settings for Audio-visual data augmentation as a reference for subsequent research.

### Weaknesses
 - The novelty of the article is limited. The article only applies the single-modal equivariant representation learning that has been proven effective to the A-V learning task and does not try to solve particular problems in this field (for example, compared with the Text-audio, Text-vision field, what specific difficulties can this method solve?)
- Although the author tried to compare different pre-training methods, he did not clearly explain the advantages of equivariant representation learning. The paper lacks a rigorous analysis of why equivariance is superior to invariance in this specific audio-visual context, beyond simply stating it leads to more robust learning. The authors should provide a more in-depth discussion on how the specific properties of audio and visual data benefit from equivariant transformations compared to invariant ones.
- The author lacks design details for augmentation predictors in the article. How does it work? Why can it make the framework achieve better results? What are the specific settings? Whether to only perform linear transformations on original input embeddings and augmentation vectors. The paper does not specify the architecture of the augmentation predictor, nor does it discuss the choice of activation functions or the number of layers used. This lack of detail makes it difficult to reproduce the results and understand the contribution of this component.
- The author uses InvAV as the baseline but does not give a reference to this solution. It is unclear what specific implementation of intra-modal contrastive loss is used in InvAV, making it difficult to assess the validity of the comparison. The authors should provide a clear definition of InvAV, either by referencing an existing method or by providing a detailed description of its implementation.
- Tables 1 and 5 appear in the wrong chapter positions, and the layout of the article needs to be carefully revised.

### Questions
- The specific details of Figure 1 are missing. What is the specific meaning of augmentation level? What specific settings were used to draw this figure?
- In Table 1, the performance of MAViL is better than EquiAV. What is the specific reason?
- Applying intra-modal representations equivariant to the augmentations has been proven effective in previous research. What is the novelty of this article?

### Summary
This work introduces EquiAV, a framework to incorporate data augmentation in audio-visual representation learning. Modality specific information is learned in a separate space from the audio-visual correspondence space. Furthermore, the modality-specific representations are learned such that they are equivariant to data augmentations. This work demonstrated the benefits of the proposed framework through downstream tasks of event classification and zero-shot retrieval. In a addition to this, an ablation study is also provided to show model robusteness to augmentation along with the proposed approach's ability to maximize the benefits of augmentation itself.

### Strengths
Originality :

The work is somewhat original as it combines a contrastive learning framework with an equivariance framework that was extended to a multimodal formulation from a single modality formulation. 

Quality :

This work creates a well structured framework to introduce data augmentations as part of a contrastive loss based learning of audio-visual representations. The proposed approach is supported by ablation studies and explorations on several downstream tasks. However, there are some questions that come up.

Clarity :

This work is somewhat clear although there are some parts (such as those mentioned under Questions) that could be made more clear.


Significance:

Data augmentation is one of the ways to not just improve the performance of models but also to increase their robustness. To this end, the proposed work presents a step forward in the context of audio-visual (and potentially general multimodal) representation learning.

### Weaknesses
Although the work is well structured, some of the decisions/formulations are not fully explained (as mentioned in the Questions section). This work can also benefit by providing additional evidence to see of its claims through different downstream tasks and ablation studies (as indicated in the Questions section)

If the loss is formulation (1) is contrastive in nature then the $\mathcal{L}$ should not just output the dissimilarity as the optimization minimizes $\mathcal{L}$ and contrastive loss is about maximizing similarity of aligned data and minimizing similarity of non-aligned data. I assume that the author's meant a formulation of contrastive loss and not just a dissimilarity measuring mechanism. Please clarify.

Conceptually, the augmented and non-augmented variants can be considered as two different modalities. Therefore, standard contrastive loss setup (as used in Eq 11) can be used. Is there a specific reason for using the Eq 9 formulation.  

Furthermore, the reasoning behind inclusion of  'positive pair ...in the denominator ' is not clear. The appendix does seem to allude to the different weights during gradient calculations but does not elaborate on why those specific weights should necessarily be a factor. Table 5 does give results that demonstrate that it can be important but there is not an explanation as to why it is so. 

There are two types of features for each modality, one from the head corresponding to the inter-modal space and the other from the intra-modal space. Perhaps I missed it, but it is not apparent which features were used in the experiments. 

According to the manuscript, Table 4 implies 'that by utilizing equivariant intra-modal representation learning, our model is able to capture augmentation-related information within each modality'. It would be good to dig deeper into this facet perhaps through heatmaps to show stronger evidence as Table 4 results show that the proposed setup is good for the given downstream tasks which is perhaps not enough evidence to strongly claim the models ability to capture augmentation related information.

As there are individual modality branches (and multiple types of modality features) available it would be beneficial to have comparisons with other (non-augmentation focused) baselines on common tasks such as unimodal action recognition (such as on UCF and HMDB) and sound classification (such as on ESC) that are often explored in works that explore audio-visual representation learning.

### Summary
This paper introduces equivariant contrastive learning for intra-model learning in audio-visual self-supervised learning (SSL). It adapts the recently proposed equivariant predictor [1] to predict representations extracted from transformed audio/video from the representations extracted from the untransformed audio/video, respectively in each of the two modalities independently. This replaces the typical invariance loss used in intra-model learning in other audio-visual SSL works e.g. [2], and, as in these previous works, is used in addition to a cross-modal loss, which in this paper enforces invariance as in previous works. Through ablations on invariance vs. equivariance, different augmentations, the changes made to the loss proposed in [1], and different types of initialization for the backbones, the authors reach an optimal training strategy and achieve competitive results on audio/visual/AV classification on AudioSet and VGGSound, and also audio-visual retrieval.

### Strengths
The paper is well-written and easy to follow. The narrative and motivation are simple but quite clear and make sense overall. The results seem to confirm the hypotheses that are laid out in the introduction. 

The methodology is well explained and does not overcomplicate the description of the losses and learning strategies used in this work/previous works. 

Figures 2 and 3 are well-made and highlight the important parts of the method.

The comparison with other works on classifications features a wide range of previous works, table 4 presents a very thorough and welcome ablation study, and the tables are in general clear and well-presented.

The appendix features some further ablations and a lot of details, which lead to some reasonably insightful conclusions and further validate the paper's proposed methodology.

### Weaknesses
In short, I think this paper's contribution is not really sufficient, and it is difficult for me to recommend that it be accepted to such a conference in this state, even though it is technically and scientifically sound work.

Basically, what the paper does is apply the intra-model equivariance loss from [1], modify it so that, in the authors' own words, it "differs slightly" from that original loss, and then apply it to each of the modalities (audio and video). The inter-modal loss, which is what makes AVSSL unique, is unchanged. Therefore it is solely applying the methodology of [1] to the modalities of audio and video, and then fine-tuning the hyperparameters as would be done for any uni-modal framework. It is therefore unsurprising, and a direct conclusion of [1], that this would work in some way. Therefore I just don't think there is enough novelty/creativity to this approach to call it truly novel.

We can compare this to, for example, CAV-MAE, which extends AudioMAE but clearly distinguishes itself by proposing a new framework with many new aspects that are unique to their work and exploring how to best model the interactions between audio and video in audio-visual SSL. The same can be said about MAViL, and others - their contributions are more than the direct, naive application of an existing SSL strategy.

The lack of novelty would be acceptable if the results were state-of-the-art by far, but in Table 1 they are outperformed by MAViL in some cases, and in Table 2 they are only compared with a single previous work. As a side note, I don't think it's reasonable to grey out MaVIl as concurrent work in Table 1 - the paper was released on arXiv in Dec. 2022.

Finally, another paper that combines intra-modal and inter-modal losses in self-supervised audio-visual learning (although not in a contrastive way, like MAVil) is RAVEn [2]. Although it is likely not a useful comparison since they only experiment with speech, this is perhaps worth adding to the discussion, especially since their intra-model loss seems to have similar goals to yours (they don't enforce invariance - instead, they leverage a predictor).

Apart from this, I only found a small typo in the title of section C of the appendix: "ADDTIONAL EXPERIMENTS" should be "ADDITIONAL EXPERIMENTS"

### Questions
Are you planning to release 1. inference code 2. pre-trained models and 3. training code? These would be very welcome, and an important contribution to the audio-visual SSL community.
