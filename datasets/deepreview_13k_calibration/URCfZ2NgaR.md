## Abstract
Recent studies in multivariate time series (MTS) forecasting reveal that explicitly modeling the hidden dependencies among different time series can yield promising forecasting performance and reliable explanations. However, modeling variable dependencies remains underexplored when MTS is continuously accumulated under different regimes (stages). Due to the potential distribution and dependency disparities, the underlying model may encounter the catastrophic forgetting problem, \textit{i.e.}, it is challenging to memorize and infer different types of variable dependencies across different regimes while maintaining forecasting performance.
To address this issue, we propose a novel Structural Knowledge Informed Continual Learning (SKI-CL) framework to perform MTS forecasting within a continual learning paradigm, which leverages structural knowledge to steer the forecasting model toward identifying and adapting to different regimes, and selects representative MTS samples from each regime for memory replay.
Specifically, we develop a forecasting model based on graph structure learning, where a consistency regularization scheme is imposed between the learned variable dependencies and the structural knowledge (\textit{e.g.}, physical constraints, domain knowledge, feature similarity, which provides regime characterization) while optimizing the forecasting objective over the MTS data. As such, MTS representations learned in each regime are associated with distinct structural knowledge, which helps the model memorize a variety of conceivable scenarios and results in accurate forecasts in the continual learning context.
Meanwhile, we develop a representation-matching memory replay scheme that maximizes the temporal coverage of MTS data to efficiently preserve the underlying temporal dynamics and dependency structures of each regime. 
Thorough empirical studies on synthetic and real-world benchmarks validate SKI-CL's efficacy and advantages over the state-of-the-art for continual MTS forecasting tasks. SKI-CL can also infer faithful dependency structures that closely align to structural knowledge in the test stage.

### Confidence
3: You are fairly confident in your assessment. It is possible that you did not understand some parts of the submission or that you are unfamiliar with some pieces of related work. Math/other details were not carefully checked.

### Summary
This paper propose a novel Structural Knowledge Informed Continual Learning (SKI-CL) framework to perform MTS forecasting under the
continual learning setting, which leverages the structural knowledge to characterize the dynamic variable dependencies within each regime.



In my opinion, the proposed dynamic graph learning module is not very novel, and many papers have used this structure, such as adaptive GCN, for forecasting. And the main contribution is applying your model in a continuous learning setting, which is not enough for ICLR.

### Strengths
1.  The paper is well written and easy to understand

2. The paper proposes incorporating knowledge for Dependencies Characterization.

### Weaknesses
1. My main concern is: why not compare it with a series of Sota time series models? And why not compare it with other continuing learning models?

2. The dynamic structure learning is not novel.

### Questions
What is structural knowledge? prior knowledge? or learned knowledge?

### Summary
This paper develops a novel structural knowledge informed continual learning framework to perform multivariate time series forecasting under continual learning setting. The key idea is to exploit structural knowledge to characterize the variable dependencies within each different regime and leverage a representation matching sample selection technique to construct memory buffer for replay. The experiment results on 4 public datasets showed the effectiveness of the proposed SKI-CL.

### Strengths
+ This paper is well written and organized. The structural knowledge informed continual learning framework is well-motivated and a comprehensive overview of related research is provided.
+ This paper introduces a novel SKI-CL framework for MTS forecasting and dependency structure inference under continual learning. This is an interesting, new, and practical MTS forecasting scenario to explore. 
+ The proposed dynamic graph structure learning module to capture temporal dependencies and infer dependency structures are elegantly articulated and technically sound. 
+ The idea to incorporate structural knowledge via adaptive regularization over the parameterized graph can enable the proposed model to infer the structural knowledge from all learned scenarios (regimes).
+ An innovative representation-matching memory replay scheme is proposed to maximize temporal data coverage and preserve dynamics and structures.
+ The experiment results are comprehensive and solid. Ablation studies of different components and some case studies are also provided.

### Weaknesses
 - This paper studies MTS forecasting under continual learning setting, however, some datasets used for evaluation is standard benchmark. How do you define different regimes in this case?
- I notice that Autoformer which focuses on long term forecasting has been compared here. I wonder what’s the performance of PatchTST here, although it is also originally designed for long term forecasting.

### Summary
The paper proposes a novel framework called Structural Knowledge Informed Continual Multivariate Time Series Forecasting (SKI-CL) that leverages structural knowledge to improve MTS forecasting under the continual learning setting. The proposed framework consists of a deep forecasting model that incorporates a graph learner to capture the variable dependencies and a regularization scheme to ensure consistency between learned variable dependencies and structural knowledge. The authors address the challenge of modeling variable dependencies across different regimes while maintaining forecasting performance. The paper presents experimental results on several real-world datasets, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed framework in improving forecasting performance and maintaining consistency with structural knowledge.

### Strengths
1. The paper proposes a novel framework, SKI-CL, that leverages structural knowledge to improve MTS forecasting under the continual learning setting. 
2. The proposed framework consists of a deep forecasting model that incorporates a graph learner to capture the variable dependencies and a regularization scheme to ensure consistency between learned variable dependencies and structural knowledge. 
3. The paper presents experimental results on several real-world datasets, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed framework in improving forecasting performance and maintaining consistency with structural knowledge.

### Weaknesses
1. This paper is written in a way that takes time to understand the term "regime", so it is not easy to follow.
2. This paper omits related work on continual learning in time series and graph domains.
3. The hyperparameter analysis used in the sensitivity analysis is unclear, which reduces confidence in the experimental results.
4. There is no comparison of model complexity or training time with other baselines.
5. This paper can be read as an incremental work that brings the existing graph continual learning problem to the MTS domain. While the authors define the catastrophic forgetting problem in different regime settings in this paper, they overshadow all other similar problems in the time series domain. For example, this paper almost entirely ignores concept/temporal drift, dynamic graph learning, and continual learning on traditional time series. In this paper, it is necessary to clarify the similarities and differences with these fields and show the relative position in these research lines.

### Questions
1. The definition of regime written by the authors in the introduction is unclear, so readers may have difficulty understanding it. The motivation to solve problems caused by different regimes is good, but if readers do not understand regimes, the motivation of this paper may be meaningless. Readers may want to look at Figure 1 for simple examples of problems caused by different regimes instead of SKI-CL's framework.
2. The introduction on page 2 of this paper explains that the catastrophic forgetting problem in the MTS task is "the model performance will deteriorate over existing regimes as their associated structural knowledge cannot be maintained." Compared to the definitions of catastrophic forgetting in other existing domains, this is a setting in which no tasks or classes are added/incremented. Is this description appropriate compared to definitions in other domains?
3. This paper needs to add related research to papers that solve concept drift and temporal drift, where the distribution changes with time in a time series. In this paper, there is a need to add related research to the paper that addresses concept drift and temporal drift, where distributions change over time in time-series data. The authors also need to compare the models and experiments in these papers.
4. This paper needs to describe the position in the research of continuous learning, incremental learning, concept/temporal drift, and dynamic graph learning in each domain. Can the authors explain what the similarities and differences are with these research topics?
5. As written in the last paragraph of Section 2.2, the authors are aware that FSNet [1] uses MTS data, but do not consider it in the baseline due to the online learning setting. However, the experimental baseline of FSNet also performs including **DER++** and **ER**. This appears to be possible in the experimental settings of this paper, and comparative experiments are needed. If you can compare FSNet, compare the performance difference compared to the model proposed by the author.
6. Additionally, the paper makes no mention of the MIR [2] method. This should be considered similarly to FSNet above.
7. The authors need to mention that papers [3-5] dealing with temporal drift are either experimental baselines or related work.
8. Can you explain how the dependency structure learning proposed by the author differs from the graph structure parameterization in the GTS paper [6]? If there is a similarity, it is necessary to cite the GTS paper.
9. Section 4.4 of the paper explains as follows: “We perform experiments on the Traffic-CL dataset to validate the effectiveness and sensitivity of two key hyperparameters in SKI-CL, the weight of structure regularizer $\lambda$ (1 by default) and the memory budget (sampling ratio) at each regime (0.01 by default).” However, the results for $\lambda$ of 1 are not shown in Table 3. And the results in Table 3 and Table 4 do not show any settings that match the results in Table 2, so the reliability of the experimental results is reduced.
10. From the experimental results in Table 2, the AF of SKI-CL of the proposed model does not result in the lowest error compared to all baselines. For example, $\text{Autoformer}_{\text{der++}}$ has the lowest MAE for AF in Traffic-CL. There seems to be a lack of explanation as to why other baselines have lower errors.
11. There is a grammatical error in the sentence "given the a collection" above Eq.(1) on page 5.
