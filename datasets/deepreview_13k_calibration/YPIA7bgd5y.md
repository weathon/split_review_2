## Abstract
The predictions of Large Language Models (LLMs) on downstream tasks often improve significantly when including examples of the input--label relationship in the context.
However, there is currently no consensus about \emph{how} this in-context learning (ICL) ability of LLMs works.
For example, while \citet{xie2021explanation} liken ICL to a general-purpose learning algorithm, \citet{min2022rethinking} argue ICL does not even learn label relationships from in-context examples.
In this paper, we provide novel insights into how ICL leverages label information, revealing both capabilities and limitations.
To ensure we obtain a comprehensive picture of ICL behavior, we study probabilistic aspects of ICL predictions and thoroughly examine the dynamics of ICL as more examples are provided.
Our experiments show that ICL predictions almost always depend on in-context labels and that ICL can learn truly novel tasks in-context.
However, we also find that ICL struggles to fully overcome prediction preferences acquired from pre-training data and, further, that ICL does not consider all in-context information equally.

### Summary
This paper investigates different aspect of ICL, including does ICL rely on label information, does ICL view different orders of examples the same, can ICL overcome the pre-training preference. By using extensive study, the authors show that ICL do rely on label information, ICL treat different position differently, and ICL cannot overcome the pre-training preference. Thus reaching the conclusion that ICL is not conventional learning.

### Strengths
I really appreciate the number of experiments done in this paper. The authors try lots of parameters and spend lots of time to do the experiments (including ablation studies). These experiments make the paper sound and solid. Besides, the presentation is generally good. The argument that: ICL cannot overcome the pretraining preference is very interesting!

### Weaknesses
My main concern is that: although some of the claims in this paper are interesting, the depth of the explanation/experiment design is not enough. For example, in Min et al, even in their experiment results (just focusing on the accuracy), the random label ICL performance and the true label ICL performance are not the same (I remember in Min et al, claim that many tasks’ acc difference is less than 5%, but it is not a small number of classification tasks), and on some tasks, they are different very different. Thus, one can already reach the conclusion that ICL needs to use the label information **to some extent**. However, people do not know how ICL utilizes this label information. The experiment results in this paper are not enough to tell people how ICL utilizes this label information. It only shows that under another metric (the probability), using true labels and random labels is very different. It seems more like an ablation study of Min et al. Another claim for the position importance of different ICL examples, the author claims that ICL does not treat each in-context example equally. From my side, it seems to be a well-known thing, since people change the order of the ICL examples and can observe huge differences in the prediction accuracy [1]. However, people don’t know how ICL treats these examples. I don’t think the experiment in this section deepens our understanding of how/why ICL treats different in-context examples differently. It seems to use new experiments to support some known or folklore claims.

### Questions
Please see the weakness part, thanks! In addition, in the NH2 --- the ICL cannot overcome pre-trained preferences-- did you try the calibrated version of ICL, proposed by [1]? I am not sure if NH2 is still rejected if you calibrate the output.

### Summary
In-context learning is an important property of LLMs and is often utilized to improve performance. However, there is disagreement on how in-context learning works, with some papers drawing analogy to SGD, others to kernel regression, Bayesian inference, etc. To understand how ICL works, this paper identifies several assumptions of expected behavior of "conventional learning algorithms", e.g., models that learn P(y | x) from x_train, y_train ~ P and tests if ICL follows such behaviors. There are several questions proposed for the classification setting: do model predictions depend on ICL example labels? Can ICL work on tasks that are not seen in the pre-training corpus? Can ICL ignore bias from pre-training data? And does ICL treat all in-context information equally? 

Through a systematic evaluation of several models and classification tasks, the paper concludes that 1) ICL depends on the in-context labels 2) ICL can work on tasks not seen in pre-training corpus 3) the pre-training preference matters, and 4) not all information is regarded equally. This refutes the findings of a previous paper (Min et. al.) and has implications for alignment and robustness of LLMs. More generally, it imposes some conditions on the loose analogy of ICL as a conventional learning algorithm.

### Strengths
Originality:
- Breaking down the understanding of ICL into parallels with conventional learning algorithms and experiments on label relationships is quite novel to me. It reminds me a bit of Zhang et. al (2016)'s famous paper on rethinking generalization. 

Quality:
- Thorough experimental results, well-designed experiments. 

Clarity:
- The paper was very clear and I enjoyed reading it overall. 

Significance:
- The conclusions are pretty valuable and suggest that we should reevaluate our expectations of alignment and robustness of LLMs via ICL.

### Weaknesses
Originality:
- Some of the results on their own are not surprising, such as the model paying more attention to the last in-context example. However, I think the study overall is quite novel and rigorous.

Quality:
- For section 5, it would be nice to show how the model performance degrades as randomization increases. Similarly in section 7, you could try gradually mixing in the flipped labels or the arbitrary labels. I think this could help us study the robustness of ICL (in contrast to deep learning models or conventional learning algorithms), as in-context information can often be noisy in general. For instance, I am thinking of an example where the human prompter is giving examples of their preferences to align a model, and fails to accurately articulate one or two examples.
- Another experiment I'd be interested in seeing: can you study the Lipschitzness/label consistency of ICL? For example, you can come up with a setting like "x1 y1 x2 y2 .... xtest ?" where xtest is a perturbation of one of the x_i's (e.g. a slight rewording, or very close by in embedding space). Will the model predict ytest to be equal to y_i? And will this happen even if we scramble the labels? How different from x_i does x_test need to be in order for it to no longer be significantly influenced by a flipped y_i? Overall I think extending your study to consider the relationships among the x_i's and the x_test w.r.t. the label is interesting, since this is a property of conventional learning algorithms (inputs with similar feature vectors have similar labels).

Clarity:
- Minor nit: I'd prefer some more signposting about how a conventional learning algorithm is defined, or some notation of (x_ICL, y_ICL) versus conventional (x_train, y_train). Is a deep learning model considered a conventional learner if it can fit to arbitrary noise?
- In section 5 I'd appreciate an example of what randomizing the labels exactly means. I had it confused with the experiment in section 7, whose arbitrary (A, B) experiment could be thought of as randomizing the label space but not the label relationships.
- While I found the experiment in section 6 to be quite clever, I feel like "novel task we create" can be made a bit more explicit by specifying it's based on your private data. Without any elaboration, I was surprised about how you were so certain about the task.

### Questions
- This observation that larger models are more sensitive to label randomization is concerning. I would have expected that with more pre-training data and parameters, the model would be more confident in its prediction and less influenced by random noise in the in-context examples. On the other hand, I do buy the argument that for small models and hard tasks, changing the in-context examples significantly will still result in the model doing poorly, thus appearing to not be as impacted by the random labels. Do you have any thoughts on how to interpret this? 

- See "Quality" section of Weaknesses. Would be curious to see what these behaviors are.

### Summary
This paper offers an empirical study into characteristics of ICL compared to in-context learning. The authors start with 3 null hypotheses about how ICL works, and empirically address those hypotheses.
H1. ICL does not learn p(yIx). This Hypothesis is rejected through an experiment with label randomization.
H2. ICL can overcome model priors that gained through pre-training about label semantics. This hypothesis is rejected because changing label words in ICL examples to have neutral or opposite meanings does affect the performance of the model.
H3. ICL example order does not matter. This hypothesis is rejected through an experiment where labels of some ICL examples are corrupted in different positions of the input sequence and the performance is shown to depend on which ICL examples were corrupted. 

The paper concludes that ICL is in some ways similar to conventional learning algorithms (H1) but different in other ways (H2 and H3).

### Strengths
This is clearly written paper that is easy to follow, with plots that tell the story well. The question of how ICL really works is an open question in the field that has not been addressed sufficiently yet. The authors go beyond using only accuracy and use several metrics to measure the model performance before and after ICL (log likelihood and entropy). The results are reported on models with various sizes.

### Weaknesses
 The paper is framed as a comparison between ICL and conventional learning and claims that hypotheses 2 and 3 reveal differences between ICL and conventional learning. I do not agree with this for the following reasons:
H2. The empirical observations corresponding to this hypothesis are not novel and not limited to ICL. For example, in "Making Pre-trained Language Models Better Few-shot Learners", Gao et al show that even fine-tuning the models with flipped or neutral labels degrades their performance, so even conventional learning is not able to overcome the pre-training priors.
H3. Sample order does matter in conventional learning too, that is why we shuffle the training data. In addition, these experiments seem to be a re-discovery of the recency bias in LLMs, for example studied in "Calibrate Before Use: Improving Few-Shot Performance of Language Models", Zhao. et al

Lastly, one major claim of the paper is that although flipping/randomizing labels of ICL examples sometimes does not affect accuracy of the model much, but probabilistic metrics such as log likelihood or entropy reveal larger gaps in performance. But this claim is not quantified well, because accuracy has a clear and interpretable range but the same cannot be said about loglikelihood.



Minor writing suggestions:
- "expresses the sentiment" --> the word sentiment not appropriate for describing a scientific paper's conclusion
- "This is important when the context contains diverging information about a label relationship" --> unclear

### Questions
A hopefully minor concern I have about this work is I see a lot of traditional NLP benchmark tasks e.g. GLUE tasks being used against modern models such as LLAMA. Do we know if GLUE benchmark was present in LLAMA's training data? Could the paper's conclusions be different if newer harder benchmarks were used?

Did you try the novel task of author identification in the label flipping experiments as well? If so, can we see some examples of the author-id prompts as well as results regarding all hypotheses? I am interested in the results using novel tasks because as the authors mentioned in the paper, in that case there is less chance of contamination in the models' pretraining data.

### Summary
This paper explores how label information is used within ICL for LLMs. Experiments suggest that predictions given ICL almost invariably rely on the labels provided in-context. They also suggest that novel tasks can be acquired given this simple technique. In contrast, priors in the model remain hard to overcome, and statistical biases remain in the use of particular subsets of ICL components. Experiments are run on (technically) three families of LLM.

### Strengths
- The appendices appear very numerous, although it was not possible to read the entirety of the ~60 pages for this review and, since most of these are in the form of (at least superficially) very similar plots, the depth of their informativeness is not clear.
- A good number (perhaps moderate variety) of LLMs are considered, and a very good number of tasks.
- The inclusion of observations and discussions directly with the associated questions was appreciated, especially with regards to previous work (e.g., Min et al (2022b)).
- Section 8, regarding NH3 (which is not really treated as a null hypothesis, admittedly) is convincing.

### Weaknesses
 - Several of the outcomes of this paper are, admittedly, already examined in some of the background work described in Sec 2 (and elsewhere), e.g., Zhao et al (2021). It may be advised to add differentiating factors with previous work directly into Sec 2.
- Additional differences exist between this work and that of Zhao et al (2021; e.g., the models are entirely different) so a direct comparison in Sec 8 of this type is somewhat disingenuous. The comparison in Section 8 focuses on a recency bias, but the core of this paper is about the effect of labels in ICL, which is a distinct issue. The comparison is therefore not only disingenuous but also somewhat tangential.
- Although not a direct effect of this paper, the extent to which these particular results will generalize to future models is somewhat limited. On a positive note, the methods used to obtain these results may be applicable for some time. 
- Some of the arguments seem to fall to the ‘hasty generalization’ fallacy. E.g., claims are made about ICL in general (at least within the context of LLMs), but really only specific examples are applicable. This is most notable on the experimentation around NH2, which is perhaps the weakest of the three so-called null-hypothesis experiments. The framing of NH2, that ICL *can* overcome zero-shot preferences, is not a true null hypothesis, and the experiments are set up to confirm this expectation, rather than to test it. The experiments around NH2 are therefore not as informative as they could be.

### Questions
- Can you please check your work for grammatical errors (e.g., ‘we rephrase these them as…’) and formatting errors (e.g., capitalization in references can be resolved by adding {} appropriately)?
- Would it have been more appropriate had Null Hypothesis 2 ($H^{(2)}_0$) been the reverse — that ICL cannot overcome 0-shot prediction preferences. Or is the original version of “NH2” even a null hypothesis in the statistical sense, or merely a proposition that can be proved or disproved by example? It seems like this was set up with the expected outcome in mind.
- Is it really necessary to examine _all possible_ numbers of demonstrations if the behaviours are so macroscopically clear?
- Is it really the case that the authorship identification task is truly novel? It could be confidently assumed that neither the particular messages were used in training the LLMs, nor even the particular authors, but author attribution itself is something LLMs learn implicitly, and ‘authorship embeddings’ of the authors of this paper are surely plausibly part of decoding/inference? I.e., this may be a novel dataset (which is not uncommon to see in NLP writ large), but how is this a novel _task_?
- If you couch your _research questions_ as null hypotheses, why do you not do any significance testing?
