## Abstract
Domain generalization (DG) aims to learn predictors that perform well on unseen data distributions by leveraging multiple related training environments. To this end, DG is commonly formulated as an average or worst-case optimization problem, which however either lacks robustness or is overly conservative. In this work, we propose a novel probabilistic framework for DG by minimizing the gap between training and test-domain population risks. Our formulation is built upon comprehensive information-theoretic analysis and enables direct optimization without stringent assumptions. Specifically, we establish information-theoretic upper bounds for both source and target-domain generalization errors, revealing the key quantities that control the capability of learning algorithms to generalize on unseen domains. Based on the theoretical findings, we propose Inter-domain Distribution Matching (IDM) for high-probability DG by simultaneously aligning inter-domain gradients and representations, and Per-sample Distribution Matching (PDM) for high-dimensional and complex data distribution alignment. Extensive experimental results validate the efficacy of our methods, showing superior performance over various baseline methods.

### Summary
This paper assumes that test domains are sampled iid from the training domains in a domain generalization problem. First, the authors prove information-theoretic bounds on the generalization error using the mutual information between domain index and inputs (Theorem 5). They also give bounds in terms of the mutual information between domain index and the classifier learned by the algorithm (Theorem 3). Second, an algorithm is proposed as a new method for domain generalization. The algorithm simultaneously matches the distributions of conditional representations and the distributions of gradients (with respect to the classifier head only). In contrast to previous works that does domain matching, the new algorithm matches at each dimension, e.g. sorts the examples along each dimension and try to match the conditional distribution. Third, experiments are performed on ColoredMNIST and DomainNet. This algorithm achieves good performance when selecting hyper-parameters based on the test domain validation set (using test domain labels), but average when selecting hyper-parameters based on training domain validation set.

### Strengths
1. The paper is very well written. I like how the assumptions are clearly listed for the theory part.
2. I like the soundness of the claims and conclusions in this paper. Most notably, the authors are very clear about hyperparameter selection criteria and gave clear justifications in the appendix. They also discussed why the algorithm isn't very effective on TerraIncognita and tried to reason about why.

### Weaknesses
1. The first major problem I find is that the theoretical part doesn't connect closely to the algorithms. The fact that I(W, D) and I(Z, D) appear in a generalization bound doesn't give direct justification for gradient space or representation space distribution matching. For example, Invariant Risk Minimization (IRM) would be minimizing I(W, D) more directly. The distinction of encoder vs classifier is quite arbitrary for deep neural networks, and I(Z,D) to me seems like a lower bound that says no domain generalization algorithm can do better than I(Z,D) than justifying a representation matching algorithm. The main reason that the authors picked the specific form of algorithms in this paper is perhaps they found superior empirical performance, which leads to the next problem.
2. On the empirical results, the proposed algorithm is a combination of existing gradient-matching algorithm and a somewhat new representation matching algorithm. There's some innovation in the latter part, where the per-dimension sorting and matching is more fine-grained, but the general idea is not new. When we look at empirical performance, the paper shows that this new combination achieves better average OOD accuracy only when tuning hyperparameters on test domains, which many previous papers have argued against [Gulrajani and Lopez-Paz, In Search of Lost Domain generalization]. When selecting on training domains, the method doesn't outperform baselines. The authors made a strong argument in the appendix for their model selection method. I don't have a fundamental objection to the argument, but I think the fact that the proposed algorithm has more hyperparameters than many baselines mean that it has an unfair disadvantage when tuned on test domains.
3. Overall I think the novelty in algorithm and theory is lacking, and the empirical performance are not much better.

### Questions
1. Are your generalization bounds vacuous for deep neural networks?
2. Table 6 shows that not doing gradient matching is actually better for OfficeHome. How do you do warm-up when you don't do gradient matching? Does this ablation also hold for other realistic datasets? I think ColoredMNIST is quite contrived and we should show more ablations on realistic datasets.

### Summary
This paper addresses the domain generalization problem through the lens of information theory. Under some mild conditions, the authors provide useful statements to understand the domain generalization problem: (1) the achievable level of average-case risk is constrained by the degree of concept shift; (2) test-domain population risk is an unbiased estimate of unconditional population risk; (3) generalization bounds for source and target domains. Based on the theoretical analysis, the inter-domain distribution matching to solve the high-probability domain generalization problem is introduced. Finally, the authors applied the proposed method by comparing it with several representative domain generalization algorithms.

### Strengths
- Sound theoretical analysis of domain generalization problem, which aligns with previous (empirical) findings.
- Most previous work focused on worst-case optimization, which is more appropriate for subpopulation shift. However, this paper considers a random testing domain, which covers more general cases.
- Proposes a novel algorithm based on the theoretical analysis. Provides extensive experimental results and thorough analysis.

### Weaknesses
 - It might have been better if the authors included some other DG benchmark dataset other than the domainbed, such as WILDS, which is often regarded as more realistic. Also, it could have been more interesting if the authors considered some tasks other than computer vision classification.
- Even if the authors included extensive sets of datasets and algorithms in Table 2, it doesn't seem like the methods show substantially different average accuracies, except for CMNIST. It seems like in most cases, the IDM doesn't completely fail, however, at the same time, it does clearly outperform the others in most cases. The lack of substantial differences in average accuracy across methods, even with a large number of datasets and algorithms, raises questions about the practical significance of the proposed approach. The fact that IDM does not consistently and significantly outperform other methods, except on CMNIST, suggests that its advantages might be limited to specific scenarios or datasets.
- Comparing the results presented in Table 2 (model selection using test domain) and Table 10 (model selection using training domain) seems to suggest that the practical utility of the IDM might be a bit limited; however, still, it outperforms the ERM, implying that the IDM provides better generalizability.

### Questions
- Just a follow-up question about "it doesn't seem like the methods show substantially different average accuracies." It might be because, as many previous studies reported, the DG methods do not outperform the ERM by a large margin. However, on the other hand, I think it probably is because the authors used the average of accuracies from multiple cases with different combinations of training/testing domains. If we look into more details, e.g., relative improvement compared to the ERM, or the worst case, we might be able to observe more apparent differences. For example, for the PACS dataset, P and A as testing domains are easier (higher accuracies), while C and S as testing domains are relatively more difficult (lower accuracies). Improvement of e.g., 2%p from P as testing and S as testing should be treated differently. But by averaging, one is ignoring such differences. 
- For a similar reason, not sure if the average across different datasets makes sense.
- It seems like finding a decent model selection strategy for the IDM is left as a future study. Do the authors have any rough ideas on that?
- Plans to share the codes to reproduce all the results?

### Summary
Authors propose a new probabilistic framework of domain generalization and propose IDM and PDM with theoretical analyses on information theory. They conduct experiments on DomainBed to confirm the effectiveness.

### Strengths
The idea is generally easy to follow and theoretical contributions are made.

### Weaknesses
Theory:

- Assumption 1 is quite confusing "The target domains $D_{te}$ are independent of source domains $D_{tr}$" Here, "independent" does not seem well-defined. It is unclear how independence is defined between sets of distributions, as $D_{tr}$ and $D_{te}$ appear to represent sets of distributions rather than random variables. The assumption requires more rigorous justification.

Algorithm:

- The operation of diving data points into separate dimensions assume the independence between these dimensions. It is not obvious whether this assumption is realistic or not. The method aligns marginal distributions, but it is unclear if this is sufficient to align the joint distribution, especially when dimensions are dependent. The paper should discuss the limitations of this simplification.
- If the representation has already been aligned, why is the gradient alignment needed? The paper claims that representation alignment addresses covariate shift, while gradient alignment addresses concept shift. However, the precise mechanism by which gradient alignment achieves this, especially when representations are already aligned, is not clear.
- Fishr [1] also aligns the gradients across domains, reducing the algorithm's novelty. The paper should more clearly differentiate its approach from Fishr, beyond claiming a novel information-theoretic perspective. The specific differences in the gradient alignment procedure and its impact on performance should be highlighted.

Experiments:

- An important baseline SWAD [2] is missing in Table 2. The absence of this baseline makes it difficult to assess the relative performance of the proposed method. SWAD is a widely recognized method and should be included for a comprehensive comparison.
- In the ablation study of Table 6, removing GA (gradient alignment) brings increase to the performance. Is gradient alignment really needed? The ablation study raises concerns about the necessity of gradient alignment. The paper needs to provide a more detailed analysis of when and why gradient alignment is beneficial.
- In Table 2, IDM brings the biggest increase on CMNIST compared with Fishr, while CMNIST is a half-synthetic and simple dataset. This weakens the demonstrations of the algorithm's effectiveness. The strong performance on CMNIST, a synthetic dataset with a manually induced concept shift, does not fully demonstrate the algorithm's effectiveness on real-world datasets where covariate shift is more prevalent.

Others:

- Writing and presentation could be improved. For example, the implementation of algorithms should be put in the main body instead of the appendix to make it clearer. The subscript $ma$ in $X_{ma}$ in Algorithm 1 may be mistakenly interpreted as $m$ and $a$ since $m$ represents the number of training domains.

### Questions
Please refer to weaknesses.

## Post-Rebuttal

After going through authors' response to me and other reviewers' feedback along with authors' corresponding responses, I find new major concerns, stated in detail in my responses. Considering the new concerns along with the non-technical issues, I find that I still overestimated the contributions of this work in my initial review, so I decide to lower my score from 3 to 1 after a more careful review.

### Summary
This paper provides an information-theoretic analysis of the difference between the training and test-domain population risks for the domain generalization (DG) problem. Specifically, different upper bounds for both source and target-domain generalization errors are presented, revealing the key information quantities that control the capability of learning algorithms to generalize on unseen domains. Motivated by the theoretical analysis, this paper proposes the Inter-domain Distribution Matching (IDM) algorithm for high-probability DG by simultaneously aligning inter-domain gradients and representations, and Per-sample Distribution Matching (PDM) for high-dimensional and complex data distribution alignment. Experimental results are provided to validate the efficacy of the proposed algorithm.

### Strengths
1. The information-theoretic analysis provided by the paper is quite inspiring. It separates the difference between L_tr and L_te using L(W), and constructs generalization error bounds for source-domain/target domain population risk, respectively. 
2. The Per-sample Distribution Matching (PDM) idea is cute, and the connection to the slicing technique is quite interesting.
3. The proposed algorithm is justified by the information-theoretic analysis, and it works well on multiple datasets.

### Weaknesses
1. From the definitions of L_tr and L_te, this paper assumes that we have an infinite number of samples for each domain so that we can evaluate the population risk of each domain. This means that only the generalization gap caused by finite number of domains is considered, but the generalization gap due to finite number of samples is ignored. It is fine to only focus on the gap between L_tr and L_te, but it should be mentioned that in practice we also need to deal with the standard generalization error gap, which cannot be handled by the method proposed in the paper.

2. It seems that the assumption in Theorem 7 seldom holds in practice. Note that R is a representation of X, so for any fixed d, $I(Y;X|D=d)\ge I(Y;R|D=d)$ by data processing inequality. Take expectation over D, we have $I(Y;X|D)\ge I(Y;R|D)$, and therefore $H(Y|X,D)\le H(Y|R,D)$. 
In the discussion after Theorem 7, it is said that “$I(Y;D|R)$ is hard to estimate, and minimizing the covariate shift $I(R;D)$ solely is sufficient.” Note that $I(Y;D|X)$ is not a lower bound for $I(Y;D|R)$ in general. Why does the proposed algorithm only minimize $I(R_i;D_i)$?  From my understanding, we should minimize $I(Y;D|R)$ together with $I(R;D)$, which corresponds to the invariant risk minimization or sufficiency condition in fairness literature.

### Questions
1. The information-theoretic generalization bound presented in Theorem 2 looks similar to Propositions 1 and 2 in the following paper. Roughly speaking, the result presented in this paper can be viewed as the multi-domain version of the standard generalization error bound in supervised learning by replacing the mutual information $I(W;Z_i)$ with $I(W;D_i)$. Such a connection should be discussed in the paper.

Minor comments:
1. After equation (4) line 7, “Secondly, gradient alignment is not required when I(Y ;D|X)”, it should be when I(Y ;D|X)=0 ?
