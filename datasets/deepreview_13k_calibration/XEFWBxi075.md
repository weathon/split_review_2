## Abstract
Despite the success of deep learning for text and image data, tree-based ensemble models are still state-of-the-art for machine learning with heterogeneous tabular data. However, there is a significant need for tabular-specific gradient-based methods due to their high flexibility. In this paper, we propose GRANDE, \textbf{GRA}die\textbf{N}t-Based \textbf{D}ecision Tree \textbf{E}nsembles, a novel approach for learning hard, axis-aligned decision tree ensembles using end-to-end gradient descent. GRANDE is based on a dense representation of tree ensembles, which affords to use backpropagation with a straight-through operator to jointly optimize all model parameters. Our method combines axis-aligned splits, which is a useful inductive bias for tabular data, with the flexibility of gradient-based optimization. Furthermore, we introduce an advanced instance-wise weighting that facilitates learning representations for both, simple and complex relations, within a single model. We conducted an extensive evaluation on a predefined benchmark with 19 classification datasets and demonstrate that our method outperforms existing gradient-boosting and deep learning frameworks on most datasets

### Confidence
3: You are fairly confident in your assessment. It is possible that you did not understand some parts of the submission or that you are unfamiliar with some pieces of related work. Math/other details were not carefully checked.

### Summary
The paper extends the GradTree support of Marton to weighted ensembles of trees, and using a different splitting function based on the soft-sign.
The paper compares their results to XGBoost, CatBoost and NODE, and show that they outperform these based on average rank of F1 score.

### Strengths
The paper gives a detailed and clear description of the approach. The experimental evaluation and the evaluation protocol are well-defined and sound, and the results look promising.

### Weaknesses
Given the popularity of gradient-based tree models in recent years, I feel like a more thorough comparison with competing methods would be warranted. In particular relating this work to work on learning weighting for fixed tree structures would be interesting, as first discussed in "Practical Lessons from Predicting Clicks on Ads at Facebook" by He et.al.
"Deep Neural Decision Trees" by Yang et al also seems relevant, as well as "Deep Neural Decision Forests" by Kontschieder et al, "SDTR: Soft Decision Tree Regressor for Tabular Data" by Luo and ". The tree ensemble layer: Differentiability meets conditional computation." by Hazimeh et al.


"WindTunnel: Towards Differentiable ML Pipelines Beyond a Single Model" also seems closely related, though they only fine-tune existing tree models with gradient descent.

I find it also somewhat confusing that it is claimed that gradient boosted models are the defacto state-of-the-art on tabular data, when there has been a lot of recent work on neural networks for tabular data, often outperforming gradient boosting models, see "Well-tuned Simple Nets Excel on Tabular Datasets" by Kadra for example. It would be great to include at least one other neural approach in the comparison.


For the evaluation, I would have expected performance profiles or critical difference diagrams based on AUC or AP, instead of the mean and rank (or in addition to it, though the unnormalized mean is not a good way to aggregate performance across datasets).

Overall, I find the contribution beyond Borisov somewhat slim, though that work is not published at a conference. If these are the same authors, I would recommend combining the two into a single submission.

Minor:
The cylinder-bands dataset is called out, it would be interesting to see if this is the version with target leakage via the job_number column, or without that column.
The "straight-through operator" is simply the subgradient of the max, and I think the standard reference for that is "Evaluation of pooling operations in convolutional architectures for object recognition" by Scherer et.al.

### Summary
This paper proposes a novel approach for learning hard, axis-aligned decision tree ensembles using end-to-end gradient descent based on the straight-through operator. The core contributions are two folds: 1) using an alternative differentiable split function (softsign); 2) introducing an advanced instance-wise weighting mechanism for tree ensemble. Experiments on tabular benchmark show that this method outperforms existing gradient-boosting and deep learning frameworks.

### Strengths
1. This is one of the few deep learning based works which beat XGB on tabular benchmark. 
2. The contributions (alternative differentiable split function and instance-wise weighting) are supported by ablation experiments.
3. It provides all the hyperparameters in appendix, which helps reproduction.

### Weaknesses
1. This paper lacks further analysis for instance-wise weighting. Because the final results are weighted by Softmax, the prediction of each tree is not separate now. If we cut off one tree, the contributions of the other tree are also changed. This is different from XGB and NODE, but the authors did not point out it. Moreover, it is better to analysis the distribution of instance weights. For example:

a) Is it long-tailed?

b) Are some trees very important for most of the samples?

2. Too many hyperparameters, i.e. 11 are tuned for the proposed method. While the number of hyperparameters is no more than 4 for compared methods. We have reason to doubt that the performance gain is obtained by finer hyperparameter tuning. Could you reduce your number of hyperparameters to 4 and retrain your model for comparison?

### Summary
This article present "GRANDE" a gradient-based extension of GradTree to weighed ensembles of trees.
"GradTree: Learning Axis-Aligned Decision Trees with Gradient Descent" is a (yet-unpuplished to the best of my knowledge) work by (Marton et al. 2023) that proposes to learn by gradient descent on a relaxation of decision trees.
This relaxation works by reformulating the decision tree as a sum of indicative functions (one for each leaf), and relaxing the decision thresholds with a "straight-through" (ST) operator that replaces the hard decision by a soft decision during the backward pass of gradient descent.
The article first summarizes GradTree, then introduces the specificities of GRANDE:
- a novel variant soft-thresholding called "softsign" that is used with the straigh-through operator
- a novel instance-wise weighing scheme for ensemble of trees

Then a thorough experimental study is provided to evaluate the model and other models on several datasets. The appendix provides several experiments and ablation studies.

### Strengths
Dealing with tabular data, as efficiently as gradient-boosted trees do, though neural networks and gradient descent is yet an open challenge. For this very reason, proposing new, or even slightly new models that are able to train tree ensembles in a reasonable time through gradient descent is an interesting contribution.

- The paper is clear, well written, and illustrated with several illustrating Figures. I liked reading it.
- I could not manage to run the supplementary material code, but the provided experiments seems serious and convincing with several datasets and models tested and some ablation studies
- This method, although very slow at training time when compared to gradient-boosting, seems promising for the many neural/tree hybridizations its suggests
- The instance-based weighing is interesting (especially for explainability)

### Weaknesses
 - My major concern is about hyper-parameters tuning (section C of appendix): I understand that compute resources should be spared, but it seems unfair to optimize the number of trees for GRANDE but not for XGBoost and CatBoost, especially given the fact that XGBoost and CatBoost are the cheapest algorithms to train. The lack of tuning for these baselines makes the comparison less convincing, as the optimal number of trees can significantly impact their performance. A more rigorous comparison would involve a grid search or similar optimization for all methods, ensuring a fair evaluation.
- The results of GRANDE are good on several datasets, but become less impressive when the number of features is high. The method's performance seems to degrade as the dimensionality of the input data increases, suggesting a potential limitation in handling high-dimensional feature spaces. This is a critical point, as many real-world datasets have a large number of features. The paper should provide a more in-depth analysis of this behavior and discuss potential strategies to mitigate this issue.
- The 2^d term in the sums suggests that the depth is a real limitation of the method. The exponential growth with depth poses a significant computational challenge, potentially limiting the applicability of the method to shallow trees. This limitation should be more explicitly addressed, with a discussion of its practical implications and possible solutions.
- Fact is that gradient descent is much slower than greedy optimization. The computational cost of gradient descent is a practical concern, especially when compared to the efficiency of greedy optimization methods. This difference in training time should be more thoroughly discussed, with an evaluation of the trade-off between performance and computational cost.
- The related-works part seems a bit short given the huge literature on ensemble trees.

Minor Remarks:
page 4 (section 3.3) : the W matrix is in R^{E\times 2^d}, not R^E \times R^{2^d}
Regarding the code I tried unsuccessfully to run the notebooks: two packages were missing in the installation script: "chardet" and "cchardet", even with this that fixed there is a remaining issue with the "TabSurvey" sub-package which seems to require a specific environment to run (It fails on "from models import" statements).
page 7:  the Phishing Website study should appear as a subsection

### Questions
- Your weighing scheme seems interesting but does it really require gradient descent ? Could you take a fixed forest, add weights to the leaves and optimize these weights afterwards ? I am thinking of a paper like (Cui et al. 2023) https://arxiv.org/pdf/2304.13761.pdf
- Did you consider hybridizing greedy and gradient approaches ?

### Summary
This paper presents GRANDE, a novel method for learning hard, axis-aligned decision tree ensembles using end-to-end gradient descent. The paper extends GradTree to a weighted tree ensemble, introduces softsign as a differentiable split function, and proposes a novel instance-wise weighting technique. The paper evaluates GRANDE on a predefined benchmark of 19 binary classification datasets and shows that it outperforms existing gradient-boosting and deep learning frameworks on most datasets The paper also demonstrates that GRANDE can learn simple and complex rules within a single model and provide local explanations based on instance-wise weights.

### Strengths
1. The transition from GradTree to a Tree ensemble is a natural and straightforward progression, and the reported performance is commendable.
    
2. The choice of an approximation function for the Heaviside step function is well-justified. The concept of instance-wise weighting is innovative and logically sound.

### Weaknesses
My main concern is about the performance evaluation. Instead of using exclusively binary class benchmark datasets, the authors should present comparative results for multi-label classification problems. It would also be valuable to include comparisons with other tree ensemble methods, such as random forest and extra trees, to properly contextualize the performance of GRANDE. Regarding the interpretability advantages of instance-wise weighting, the authors need to provide a more comprehensive analysis. For instance, they could share statistics like the average node count of the highest-weighted estimators across all datasets. Furthermore, the authors should offer theoretical insights into the benefits of instance-wise weighting. Instance-wise weighting introduces a larger number of weights compared to estimator-wise weighting. Particularly when trees have greater depth (e.g., depth=10, 2^10 vs. 1 for one estimator), it is unclear if there is a significant impact on the training time due to the increased number of weights.
