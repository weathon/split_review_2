## Abstract
Traffic on roads, packets on the Internet, and electricity on power grids share a structure abstracted in congestion games, where self-interested behaviour can lead to socially sub-optimal results. External recommendations may seek to alleviate these issues, but recommenders must take into account the effect that their recommendations have on the system. In this paper, we investigate the effects that dynamic recommendations have on $Q$-learners as they repeatedly play congestion games. To do so, we propose a novel model of recommendation whereby a $Q$-learner receives a recommendation as a state. Thus, the recommender strategically picks states during learning, which we call the Learning Dynamic Manipulation Problem. We define the \textit{manipulative potential} of these recommenders in repeated congestion games and propose an algorithm for the Learning Dynamic Manipulation Problem designed to drive the actions of $Q$-learners toward a target action distribution. We simulate our algorithm and show that it can drive the system to convergence at the social optimum of a well-known congestion game. Our results show theoretically and empirically that increasing the recommendation space can increase the manipulative potential of the recommender.

### Summary
The authors proposed a novel model of recommendation in which a set of Q-learners receive recommendations as their states and play a congestion game repeatedly. An heuristic algorithm was proposed to drive the actions of Q-learners toward a target action distribution for optimizing social welfare. Experiments show that the proposed algorithm can drive the system to convergence at the social optimum of a specific congestion game.

### Strengths
The proposed problem setting is timely and interesting and the high-level idea of recommending states to influence agents' beliefs sounds reasonable.

### Weaknesses
The writing of section 2 needs to be significantly improved. I'm not able to understand how the RS works from reading section 2.1. For example, what is the meaning of the space Z? And intuitively why we should believe the heuristic algorithm can achieve what we want? The description of Algorithm 1 is directly followed by the experiment results, and useful discussions are missing. Theorem 1 and 2 are not stated in rigorous ways. Could you quantify what does it mean by 'slower' and 'smaller'?

The assumption that the RS has access to the q-values of the Q-learners might be overly strong. In reality, it is unreasonable to believe that the platform has full understanding about each agent's belief state. It would be more interesting to relax this assumption.

The experiment is only performed on Braess Paradox instances, which seems limited and less convincing to me. It would be nice to demonstrate a comprehensive result on various congestion game instances.

For the motivation, could you justify why it is reasonable to study the Q-learning agents in routing games, given that it is known that any better-response dynamics converges to the NE of congestion games. 

the description in section 1.2 is confusing to me: it is said that the congestion game can be framed as a stateless MDP, but the formulation of Q-learners involves the state S. What is the state S here? And is a player allowed to observe other players' actions or rewards? It is beneficial to add a detailed description of players' Q-learning policy.

could you give an intuitive explanation why Q-learning agents can escape from the low-welfare NE of the Braess Paradox game even without the help of recommendations? I wish I could get some takeaway insight in this section but unfortunately the discussion is too little. 

In terms of the better social outcome result, it is known that the for smooth games (including the class of congestion games), the PoA under NE is essentially the same as the PoA under CE/CCE [1]. So I suppose in general, the social welfare improvement from steering the NE to CE in congestion games can be very little. Do you agree with this argument?

there are some related works, e.g., [2,3] regarding mechanism designs for content recommendation platform, which also involves dynamical optimization over a congestion game structure. It would be nice to add some discussion in the intro or related work.

### Summary
This work considers the problem of designing recommendation systems to induce Q-learning agents in traffic networks to achieve near socially optimal outcomes; this problem is termed the Learning Dynamic Manipulation Problem (LDMP). In this model, agents are assumed to use greedy Q-learning to choose routes, and a central recommendation system can provide recommendations to each agent so as to influence the learning towards specific outcomes that minimize total congestion. This work proposes a heuristic algorithm for recommendation systems and shows that on the Braess paradox network, the heuristic algorithm can steer Q-learners towards more socially optimal outcomes, and this effect increases with the size of recommendation space.

### Strengths
The problem of inducing learning agents towards particular solutions is a very interesting direction on both the theoretical and applied side that is worth further explanation.

### Weaknesses
Certain parts of the modeling are not entirely clear and could benefit from more motivation or discussion (see below). The theoretical results (Theorem 1 and 2) appear somewhat unclear; they could benefit from more details or precision. On the experimental side, while the improvements for the improved recommendation system look quite interesting, they appear to be localized to a single network structure and it is not clear how general these results are.

---Was $\varepsilon$-greedy Q-learning ever defined? My understanding was that this means that each agent uniformly explores with probability $\varepsilon$; if so, how does this connect with Assumption 1?

---What is the intuition behind the objective function of the RS in equation (2) in terms of KL divergence? Wouldn't a more natural objective be to minimize the weighted congestion of the actions of the Q-learners?

---Regarding Assumption 1: should there be a $t$ dependence somewhere here? If so, is that meant to hold for all $t$?

---It might be useful to provide pseudocode for the subroutines in Algorithm 1, at least in the Appendix.

---I had significant difficulty parsing the statement and content of Theorems 1 and 2. In Theorem 1, what does it mean that "the manipulative potential for every timestep $t$ is maximized"? The proof itself seems to use ``infinity'' in somewhat unclear ways that made it hard to understand. I also had issues determining a precise way to formalize the statement of Theorem 2. For both results, it might be very useful to give a more formal statement and proof to make clear what is meant.

---What is the (empirical or theoretical) computational cost of the heuristic algorithm, especially on generalizations to larger network topologies?

---My impression is that the empirical performance of the heuristic algorithm is quite interesting. But as mentioned above, my main concern is that these experiments seem to have only been done in the Braess paradox network and not on more general topologies.

### Questions
Recommendation: In full disclosure, my own interests are more on the theoretical side. Nonetheless, I think that this is a very interesting problem, but my current feeling is that this paper would greatly benefit from a clearer discussion of the modeling assumptions and choices. Since this is primarily an empirical paper, testing the heuristic algorithms on more general networks would also provide much better evidence for the utility of this approach. As a result, my initial belief would be to reject; that said, I could be convinced by the authors or the other reviewers to raise my score.

### Confidence
3: You are fairly confident in your assessment. It is possible that you did not understand some parts of the submission or that you are unfamiliar with some pieces of related work. Math/other details were not carefully checked.

### Summary
The authors consider the atomic, unweighted, symmetric, linear cost congestion games and introduces a framework where an agent, playing the role of a recommender system (RS), learns to give recommendations to Q-learning agents (playing the role of players in the congestion games) in order to optimize social welfare. The authors then derive some results regarding the manipulative potential of the recommender. The authors then propose a heuristic algorithm of RS and show, by experimental means, that it can drive the system toward social optimum.

### Strengths
- The questions posed by the paper is quite interesting.
- The effort of the authors made in conducting a quite extensive experiment on the Braess 's paradox is applaudable. 
- The presentation of the proposed framework is quite clear.

### Weaknesses
 - In general, the writing is quite confusing. This includes a lack of robust mathematical presentations of results (Theorem 1 and 2) and several typos/grammar issues.
- The practicality aspect of this work is also questionable. As pointed out by the authors, the omniscience requirement for RS is a major limitation. Moreover, it is quite far-fetched to impose the Q-learning framework on all players in a congestion network. 
- The main results (Theorem 1 and 2) do not give any guarantee on the convergence toward a social optimum (or at least, it lacks an explanation/justification). These theorems are not presented in a mathematically manner which hinders the readers to understand their contributions. As an heuristic scheme, the proposed algorithm is not supported by any performance analyses. It is quite disappointing as it can be seen from the experiments that as the number of states (recommendation options) increases, the proposed algorithm does drive the system closer to the social optimum.

- Some possible typos/ unclear sentences:  
   + p.6, first paragraph, Regarding Theorem 1?
   + p.6, greater detail --> greater details
   + p.6 "....reflects the action that most need agents to be assigned to them"  ?
   + notation r is used both for welfare function W (page 2) and reward function (page 5)
   + In Equation (1), should z_t be a subscript instead of being a superscript?
   + In Section 2.1., there is a sentence saying that " the goal of RS is to find P*(a)" and another sentence saying that the goal of RS is to find the policy Pi^*_RS.

### Questions
- How the optimistic estimate $\bar{r}$ is computed in the heuristic algorithm ?
- What d*_a means exactly in the paragraph after Equation (3) ?
- Given a congestion game model, how an RS can design a recommendation set that guarantees Assumption 1? 
- What is the relation between maximizing the manipulative potential and converging toward a social optimum?
- How precisely does the proposed algorithm confuses the Q-leaner (as remarked in Conclusion)?

### Summary
This paper investigates the problem of performing recommendations for agents who repeatedly play congestion games to improve the social welfare. More specifically, this paper considers a situation where every agent is a Q-learner with states and he/she switches the state by the recommendation (Learning Dynamic Manipulation Problem, LDMP, in this paper). First, this paper defines the manipulative potential of a recommender and proves that it increases with the number of states, i.e., the possible kind of recommendations. Next, this paper proposes an algorithm for recommendation and empirically shows the effectiveness of this recommender by well-known Braess's paradox instance.

### Strengths
This paper investigates both theoretical and algorithmic aspects of LDMP. On the theoretical aspect, it proves that if more recommendation space is allowed, we can induce more combinations of actions that agents take. On the algorithmic aspect, it proposes a heuristic algorithm for recommenders that can improve the social welfare. Since this algorithm is not only intended to improve the social welfare, it can also be used for improving the other objective depending on the preference of recommender; which is of independent interest.

### Weaknesses
The main weakness of this paper is that the proposed heuristics is empirically evaluated on only a toy example of Braess's paradox that have only 3 actions. Although I admitted that toy examples like Braess's paradox is useful for investigating the behavior of the proposed and existing frameworks, the effectiveness of the proposed approach should be verified for more general and large datasets.
It is known that there are many instances that phenomenon like Braess's paradox occurs [1][2]. Therefore, the applicability for more larger congestion game should be empirically examined.

### Questions
In many congestion games including Braess's paradox, it is natural that the action of every agent is given as a combination of shared resources. In such a case, explicitly maintaining all the actions is prohibitive since the number of actions is generally exponentially large with respect to the number of shared resources. I think for some sets of actions (like path-sets of selfish routing setting), it may be possible to alleviate this issue because some computational components fall into easy problem like shortest-path problem; this is true for the equilibrium computation of congestion games. Do you have any idea for improving the time complexity of the proposed algorithm under such a situation where the set of actions is paths?
