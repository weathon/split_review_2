## Abstract
Autoregressive modeling of text via transformers has led to recent breakthroughs in language. In this work, we study the effectiveness of this framework for routing problems on graphs. In particular, we aim to develop a learning based routing system that can process rich natural language based queries indicating various desired criteria and produce near optimal routes from the source to the destination. Furthermore, the system should be able to generalize to new geographies not seen during training time. 

Solving the above problem via combinatorial approaches is challenging since one has to learn specific cost functions over the edges of the graphs for each possible type of query. We instead investigate the efficacy of autoregressive modeling for routing. We propose a multimodal architecture that jointly encodes text and graph data and present a simple way of training the architecture via {\em next token prediction}. In particular, given a text query and a prefix of a ground truth path, we train the network to predict the next vertex on the path. While a priori this approach may seem suboptimal due to the local nature of the predictions made, we show that when done at scale, this yields near optimal performance. 

We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach via extensive experiments on synthetic graphs as well as graphs from the OpenStreetMap repository. We also present recommendations for the training techniques, architecture choices and the inference algorithms needed to get the desired performance for such problems.

### Summary
The paper proposes using transformer models trained via next-vertex prediction for solving complex routing problems on graphs based on natural language queries.

Specifically, the paper formulates routing as an autoregressive next-vertex prediction task. Given a query, source, destination, and partial route, the goal is to predict the next vertex on the optimal route with transformer models. This transformer model jointly encodes the textual query and graph structure, and the paper trains the model on large amounts of routing data by decomposing optimal routes into next-vertex prediction examples. Beam search is used during inference to generate high-quality route candidates. Experiments on synthetic graphs as well as graphs from the OpenStreetMap repository prove the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

### Strengths
* Novel framing of routing as next-vertex prediction enables leveraging powerful transformer models and large-scale pretraining.

* Architecture jointly encodes textual queries and graph structure in an elegant way.

* Road embeddings allow scaling to massive real-world graphs.

* Training methodology based on next-vertex prediction is simple and efficient.

* Strong empirical results demonstrating high query fulfillment rates and near optimal routes.

### Weaknesses
 * Relying only on local graph context could limit long-range reasoning.

The paper relies on representing each vertex and edge using features derived only from their local neighborhood in the graph. This local context allows the model to scale to massive graphs. However, it means the model may struggle with some types of long-range reasoning during routing. One example is to identify long shortcuts in the graph between distant vertices. With only local context, long shortcuts may not be recognized. Another example is reasoning about global properties of the graph such as determining a route which should avoid an entire region of the graph. In summary, the reliance on local context enables scaling to large graphs but inherently restricts the model's ability to reason about global graph structure and long-range dependencies. This could become a limitation for certain complex routing queries that require broader reasoning.

* Query fulfillment prioritized over efficiency may lead to suboptimal routes.

The paper prioritizes training the model to fulfill query constraints, even if that results in slightly less efficient routes. This makes sense for satisfying user requirements, but may produce routes that are longer or slower than necessary. In other words, the model lacks an explicit training signal to prefer efficient routing conditional on fulfilling the query. The lack of joint training on both query fulfillment and efficiency could lead to routes that satisfy the query but are not optimally efficient. This could become problematic in practice if it generates unnecessarily long routes over many queries. Explicitly optimizing for efficiency while still satisfying queries could improve the overall routing performance.

* Lack comparisons to other learning-based routing methods.

The paper does not provide direct comparisons to other machine learning approaches for routing, such as graph neural networks for routing, reinforcement learning for routing, attention-based models for vehicle routing. Without comparisons, it is hard to assess if the performance is truly state-of-the-art among learning-based methods.

### Summary
This paper considers the problem of predicting shortest paths in networks under a variety of possible constraints which are specified in natural language. The authors present a language modeling inspired approach to predicting shortest paths by using a transformer to predict the next vertex in path given a partial path. The model jointly encodes the natural language constraints, the source vertex, the destination vertex, the path taken so far, and candidates for the next vertex and predicts the next vertex in the path. The model is trained autoregressively on ground truth paths and beam search decoding is used to predict the shortest path at inference time. Experimental results are show that the trained model is able to produce high-quality paths given natural language queries on real-world datasets.

### Strengths
* The paper is very well written and the figures are clear and helpful
* The proposed approach is elegant and effectively applies progress in language modeling to the problem of constrained routing
* The results show that the method is effective in producing high-quality paths under the natural language constraints

### Weaknesses
 * There is a lack of comparable baselines to the proposed method. The authors claim that the unguided search electrical flows with omnipotent referee is a strong baseline, but several other methods are mentioned in the introduction and related work seem to be viable candidates. If these methods are inadequate as the authors claim, then results should be shown against a reasonable cross section of such methods showing where these methods fail and the proposed method succeeds.
* The results do not elucidate why the proposed method works. The authors present a large volume of great results, but none of which that explain how the model is working. It seems like there is a lack of information for the model to adequately plan a route using just local information in the network.
* The complexity of the natural language queries does not seem to be a large component of the solution, but does seem to be a large component of how complex the problem could be in practice. It seems like the method is just converting natural language to a one-hot encoding a points of interest and matching those with the points of interest in the receptive field of the encoded vertices in the input. Are the natural language queries in the experimental results accomplishing more than just one-hot matching between the natural language query and the points of interest in the receptive field?

### Questions
* Does the performance of the model change as the routes become longer?
* Are there particular types of instances where the model performs quite well and other instances where the model performs poorly?
* Based on Figure 11, it appears that the method does not benefit from a larger than a 2 (or 3)-hop receptive field. Is this a fact of the types of routes being considered at training and test time? Could the method benefit from a larger receptive field if the 
* What information is the model using to "plan" its route? Is it using the coordinates of the destination relative to the source, and just choosing next vertices which greedily move in that direction (analogously for points of interest specified in the constraints)? It seems like there should not always be enough information in the input to accurately predict the next vertex on the path? Are there any examples of failure cases of this method?
