## Abstract
Recently, channel-independent methods have achieved state-of-the-art performance in multivariate time series (MTS) forecasting. Despite reducing overfitting risks, these methods miss potential opportunities in utilizing channel dependence for accurate predictions. We argue that there exist locally stationary lead-lag relationships between variates, i.e., some lagged variates may follow the leading indicators within a short time period. Exploiting such channel dependence is beneficial since leading indicators offer advance information that can be used to reduce the forecasting difficulty of the lagged variates. In this paper, we propose a new method named LIFT that first efficiently estimates leading indicators and their leading steps at each time step and then judiciously allows the lagged variates to utilize the advance information from leading indicators. LIFT plays as a plugin that can be seamlessly collaborated with arbitrary time series forecasting methods. Extensive experiments on six real-world datasets demonstrate that LIFT improves the state-of-the-art methods by 5.4\% in average forecasting performance.

### Summary
This paper proposes a new method, called LIFT, which first efficiently estimates leading indicators and their leading steps at each time step, and then judiciously allows the lagged variates to utilize the advance information from leading indicators. This method can be used as a plugin, which is seamlessly collaborated with arbitrary time series forecasting methods. Extensive experiments on six real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method with respect to the average forecasting performance.

### Strengths
1. This proposed method is somewhat novel, making benefits of the channel dependence. It can efficiently estimate leading indicators and the leading steps, and allow the lagged variates to utilize the advanced information from leading indicators.

2. This method can be regarded as a plugin to collaborate with any other time series forecasting methods.

### Weaknesses
1. It remains unclear to me how instance normalization and denormalization could effect the results and performances. Specifically, the paper does not provide sufficient justification for why instance normalization is the appropriate choice, as opposed to other normalization techniques like batch normalization or min-max scaling. The impact of this choice on the learned lead-lag relationships and the final forecasting accuracy needs further clarification. It is also unclear how the denormalization process interacts with the forecasting model, and whether it introduces any artifacts or biases.

2. In Figure 3, “all layers in the grey background” refer to which part in the figure?  It is difficult to understand the specific operations within the grey boxes, and the paper should provide a more detailed explanation of each step. For example, what specific parameters are used in the Fourier transform, and how are these parameters chosen? The lack of clarity makes it difficult to reproduce the results.

3. Inappropriate expression: “one of the hottest” -> “one the most popular”.

### Summary
This paper considers the problem of multivariate time series forecasting. The authors propose a forecasting algorithm called LIFT that exploits dependencies among the time series by first finding a set of leading time series and their corresponding leading steps for a given time series and then uses a Lead-aware Refiner that adaptively leverages the informative signals of leading indicators in the frequency domain to refine the predictions of lagged variates. The first step, i.e., finding the leading time series and their corresponding steps is designed based on Wiener–Khinchin theorem that uses fast Fourier transformation. The second step contains two main parts: state estimation and a frequency mixer. They evaluate the performance of LIFT through several experiments and their result shows that LIFT makes an average improvement over both CI and CD methods.

### Strengths
They study an important problem. The paper is well-written. 

Using interdependencies among the time series to better forecast is more intuitive than CI methods and this is showing by this work empirically. 

Based on the presented evidence in empirical study, the proposed method shows improvement compared to the state of the art.

### Weaknesses
The main concern is the generality of the proposed method to capture general forms of interactions among time series. The leading relationship in this work is detected based on pairwise cross-correlation. What if there are more complex interactions in which two or more time series jointly influence another time series? A reason that in some applications CI is outperforming CD methods could be the result of such misspecified interactions in the CD methods.   

Consider a setting in which the influence structure among  the time series is a chain, i.e., $X^{(1)} -> X^{(2)} -> \cdots -> X^{(C)}$. In this case, there are scenarios in which the pairwise cross-correlations between $X^{(C)}$ and {$X^{(i)}: 1\leq i\leq C-2$} are all higher than the correlation between $X^{(C)}$ and $X^{(C-1)}$. This means that LIFT will not pick  $X^{(C-1)}$ for forecasting while the only relevant time series for forecasting $X^{(C)}$ is $X^{(C-1)}$.

### Questions
Is it possible to discover causal relationships (e.g., Granger causality) among time series via modifications of LIFT?


Why there is subscript $\Delta$ and $U$ in equation (9)?

### Summary
This paper presented LIFT, a post-hoc plugin that enhance performance for time series forecasting tasks.

LIFT works on top of black-box backbone forecasting models. It first estimates leading indicators and then shift those indicators to sync with target variate. Finally, filter based Adaptive frequency mixer was used to extract valuable information from leading indicators.

Extensive experiments on six real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of LIFT.

### Strengths
1. The design to sync the series with leading indicators is intuitive.
2. Clear design of LIFT starting from preliminary forecasting to lead estimation and target-oriented shifts to reconstruction for the prediction.
3. Very smart post-hoc process which in orthogonal to existing time series models.
4. Proposed LightMTS a simple yet effective lightweight baseline method for MTS forecasting.

### Weaknesses
1. The proposed correlation based leading indicators discovery method may over-simplify the dynamics in the time series data. If the time-delayed relation among those variates is highly complex which cannot easily be captured by cross-correlation coefficient, the estimation of the leading indicators may not be accurate. Some discussion on this case is expected. Specifically, the method relies on a linear measure (cross-correlation) to identify potential leading indicators, which may fail to capture non-linear relationships. For instance, if the relationship between two time series is quadratic or exponential, the cross-correlation might be close to zero, even if there is a strong dependency. This limitation could lead to the exclusion of important leading indicators and hinder the performance of LIFT.

2. As introduced in locally stationary lead-lag relationship, such relationship should be static only in a short period of time, which may indicate that it may not work well in long-term forecasting. However, the author also claims good performance for that case. Some elaboration on this will be very helpful. The assumption of locally stationary lead-lag relationships is a significant concern, especially when dealing with real-world time series data that often exhibit non-stationary behavior over extended periods. The paper does not adequately address how the method adapts to changes in these relationships over time, particularly in long-term forecasting scenarios. For example, a leading indicator identified at the beginning of a time series might become irrelevant or even a lagging indicator later on, which could lead to inaccurate predictions.

3. As a plug-and-play module that works on top of the baseline predictions, some fair comparison about the computation cost such as the total computation load should be considered. Otherwise, it is not surprised to see that after injecting some inductive bias, the performance is better than baselines. The paper lacks a thorough analysis of the computational overhead introduced by LIFT. While the method is presented as a post-hoc plugin, the additional steps of leading indicator estimation, shifting, and adaptive frequency mixing can significantly increase the computational cost, particularly for large datasets. A detailed comparison of the training and inference time, as well as memory consumption, between the baseline models and LIFT is necessary to assess its practical applicability. Without this, it's difficult to determine whether the performance gains justify the added computational burden.

### Summary
The paper introduces LIFT, a novel method aimed at enhancing multivariate time series (MTS) forecasting by leveraging locally stationary lead-lag relationships between variates. The authors suggest that recognizing and utilizing the dependence between channels can significantly improve forecasting accuracy. LIFT is designed to be a flexible plug-in that can integrate with any existing time series forecasting methods. The method was tested across several real-world datasets, showing remarkable improvement. Additionally, the paper presents LightMTS, a new baseline model for MTS forecasting that maintains parameter efficiency while offering competitive performance.

### Strengths
**Originality** The paper proposes a novel approach to leverage the lead-lag relation to contribute to MTS forecasting.

**Quality** The experiment is solid and improvement is fruitful.

**Significance** The proposed framework is flexible and can be incorporated with time series forecasting backbones, indicating its potential to improve predictive performance in a myriad of applications that depend on time series analysis.

**Clarity** The paper is well-written and easy to follow.

### Weaknesses
To me, the paper is well written, logically fluent and the experiment result is fruitful. My only concern is about potential contradiction in results and the slightly limited applicability. Please see the Question part for more details.

### Questions
Please allow me to preface my questions by mentioning that I am relatively new to this field, and as such, my inquiries may not reflect a deep understanding of the intricate concepts presented.

The following question is my major concern:

Q1. While the motivation lies in the exploitation of dependence between variables, the experiment shows better performance and improvement for CI methods compared with CD methods, which is kind of contradicted. Could you provide more insight into the possible reasons?

&nbsp;

The following questions stem from what I believe are confusions arising from differences between different fields (which won't influence my rating): 

Q2.  Is it possible to provide a formal definition of  **locally stationary lead-lag relation** as "influence requires a certain time delay to propagate and take effect" is not clear to interpret mathematically? Furthermore, in the context of cross-correlation used to quantify such relationships, does this indicate that a lead-lag relationship is inferred whenever we observe relatively larger cross-correlation in differing time slots between two variables? (In the causality field, the correlation is not equivalent to influence and effect).
 
Q3. As a continuation of my previous question, the use of cross-correlation for identifying lead-lag relationships suggests a focus on linear associations. May I inquire if this suggests that the algorithm's applicability is confined to variables that share a linear relationship (e.g., $X_1 = X_2^2$, the cross-correlation will return zero)?
