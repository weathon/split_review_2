## Abstract
In recent years, large language models have greatly improved in their ability to perform complex multi-step reasoning. However, even state-of-the-art models still regularly produce logical mistakes. To train more reliable models, we can turn either to outcome supervision, which provides feedback for a final result, or process supervision, which provides feedback for each intermediate reasoning step. Given the importance of training reliable models, and given the high cost of human feedback, it is important to carefully compare the both methods. Recent work has already begun this comparison, but many questions still remain. We conduct our own investigation, finding that process supervision significantly outperforms outcome supervision for training models to solve problems from the challenging MATH dataset. Our process-supervised model solves 78\% of problems from a representative subset of the MATH test set. Additionally, we show that active learning significantly improves the efficacy of process supervision. To support related research, we also release PRM800K, the complete dataset of 800,000 step-level human feedback labels used to train our best reward model.

### Confidence
3: You are fairly confident in your assessment. It is possible that you did not understand some parts of the submission or that you are unfamiliar with some pieces of related work. Math/other details were not carefully checked.

### Summary
This paper investigates the effectiveness of process supervision compared to outcome supervision for training reliable reward models in large language models, focusing on the challenging MATH dataset. The authors conduct a detailed comparison of these two types of supervision for training reward models, using a more capable base model and significantly more human feedback.

The main contributions of the paper are
  * demonstrating that process supervision can train more reliable reward models than outcome supervision, with their model solving 78.2% of problems from a representative subset of the MATH test set
  * showing that active learning can lead to a 2.6× improvement in the data efficiency of process supervision
  * releasing their full process supervision dataset, PRM800K, to promote related research.

### Strengths
1. Assigning rewards for intermediate steps is a novel and intuitive idea. Compared to assigning rewards for the outcome alone, judging intermediate steps better leverages problem structures.
2. The empirical results are very strong.
3. The released dataset can support the research community to further explore this direction.

### Weaknesses
1. The reproducibility for this work is concerning. It is hard to understand under what conditions one can successfully train an effective process reward model.  The authors did not have sufficient details for both models and data.  In the paper, the authors stated, "The small-scale base models are similar in design to GPT-4, but they were pretrained with roughly 200 times less compute." However, the paper neither reveals the size of the small-scale base models nor the large-scale base models.  It is unclear whether the data gets the PRM to work or the scale of the model that gets it to work. I understand that work done at industry has its confidentiality rules to follow, but the authors can maybe conduct experiments on open models on their pretraining and fine-tuning datasets? Due to the reproducibility issue, I think this work would be a better fit for a blog post than a main conference paper.
2. It is unclear whether PRM would work for other types of reasoning problems.

### Questions
1. Who are the human data-labelers?  Are they MTURK crowdsource workers, math teachers, or? What is their proficiency level?
2. "MathMix consists of a smaller set of 1.5B tokens containing individual math problems and their solutions" ---> where are these math problems from?  textbooks or scraping the web?

### Confidence
4: You are confident in your assessment, but not absolutely certain. It is unlikely, but not impossible, that you did not understand some parts of the submission or that you are unfamiliar with some pieces of related work.

### Summary
The authors release a new dataset with process supervision, which provides human feedback for each intermediate reasoning step. The authors label the complex reasoning steps for solving MATH dataset. The authors find that process supervision significantly outperforms outcome supervision, whether only human feedback on the final answer, for training models. The authors also find that active learning significantly improves the efficacy of process supervision.

### Strengths
1, A new dataset with humans verifying each reasoning step.

2. The process supervision is important and the labeled dataset is useful for further research on reasoning with math.

3. The authors have also done experiments with active learning to improve the efficacy.

### Weaknesses
1. The work only explores the math problem. It would be better to explore different tasks.

2. The authors haven't applied it to RLHF. It is still not clear how process supervision and outcome supervision affect the generation model performance. Actually, if outcome supervision is large and diverse enough, the model trained with outcome supervision can also do process supervision by feeding the reason path step by step.

### Questions
Conducting RLHF would be more impressive.

### Confidence
3: You are fairly confident in your assessment. It is possible that you did not understand some parts of the submission or that you are unfamiliar with some pieces of related work. Math/other details were not carefully checked.

### Summary
The paper proposes to provide language models with intermediate supervision on the step level instead of providing a single reward based on the whole generation. They collect step-level feedback with human data-labelers in the math domain and compare outcome-supervised reward models and process-supervised reward models on this dataset. They demonstrate that providing step-level feedback can achieve better performance and also show that active learning can be used to lower the data labeling cost.

### Strengths
1. The idea of providing fine-grained feedback for learning models is intuitive and technically sound.
2. They collect a dataset PRM800K that contains step-level labels across different solutions to math problems, which is helpful for future research in this direction.
3. The paper is well-written and easy to follow.

### Weaknesses
1. It is a well-known problem in the RL community that providing dense rewards can be better than providing sparse rewards, and there is a research direction on reward shaping that is very relevant to this idea. Therefore, the idea of providing intermediate rewards for training can lack novelty.
2. The paper mainly conducts experiments in a math dataset, where it is easy to provide step-by-step intermediate rewards. However, there are many other tasks such as essay writing and story generation where it can be hard to provide such feedback. Therefore, it is unclear if the method is generalizable.
3. It is hard to draw insights from their experiments. It would be better to see the advantages of using step-level rewards in more dimensions.

### Questions
1. Under the same budget, is it better to provide step-level rewards on a small set or outcome-level rewards on a large set?

### Summary
In this work, the authors conducted an investigation to determine whether the outcome supervision method or the process supervision method is more effective for training reliable models. They found that process supervision produces more reliable models, and that a large reward model can accurately approximate human supervision for smaller reward models. Additionally, they discovered that active learning can improve the data efficiency of process supervision by 2.6 times. The authors have also released their comprehensive process supervision dataset, named PRM800K.

### Strengths
1.	This work offers an independent and thorough investigation into the superiority of outcome supervision versus process supervision methods, yielding new and valuable conclusions.

2.	The authors introduce an active learning method to enhance the data efficiency of process supervision, making it more practical for real-world applications.

3.	The authors have released their extensive human-labeled dataset.

### Weaknesses
The experiments were conducted solely on examination datasets. For more robust conclusions, it would be beneficial to conduct experiments on a broader range of significantly diverse datasets.

### Questions
Do the authors have more results on significantly different datasets?
