- Decision: Reject
- Avg Score: 4.25
- Scores: 3, 3, 6, 5

## Abstract
Algorithmic reasoning is a fundamental cognitive ability that plays a pivotal role in problem-solving and decision-making processes.
Although Reinforcement Learning (RL) has demonstrated remarkable proficiency in tasks such as motor control, handling perceptual input, and managing stochastic environments, its potential in learning generalizable and complex algorithms remains largely unexplored.
To evaluate the current state of algorithmic reasoning in RL, we introduce an RL benchmark based on Simon Tatham's Portable Puzzle Collection.
This benchmark contains 40 diverse logic puzzles of varying complexity levels, which serve as captivating challenges that test cognitive abilities, particularly in neural algorithmic reasoning.
Our findings demonstrate that current RL approaches struggle with neural algorithmic reasoning, emphasizing the need for further research in this area.
All of the software, including the environment, is available at https://github.com/rlppaper/rlp.

5: You are absolutely certain about your assessment. You are very familiar with the related work and checked the math/other details carefully.

### Summary
The paper proposes a novel RL environment (named RLP) for benchmarking RL algorithms on neural algorithmic reasoning tasks. Precisely, they wrap the 40 games of Simon Tatham’s Portable Puzzle Collection as a Gymnasium environment. This enables any current or new RL algorithm to be easily evaluated on those games. They then provide empirical results showing the performance of several RL algorithms on a number of those games.

### Strengths
- The paper is mostly well-written and investigates an important problem. 

- RLP is novel, well-motivated, and could be useful for the community.

- It is great that RLP is based on a popular set of games which includes a wide variety of puzzle games with difficulty levels and customizable configurations. The fact that all of the games have known polynomial-time optimal solutions is also extremely useful to evaluate the performance gap of RL algorithms.

- The authors evaluate several RL algorithms (PPO, A2C, DQN, and some of their variants) on several games in the RLP environment, with different types of observations (internal states vs RBP pixels).

### Weaknesses
 - All the experiments report mean episode lengths instead of mean discounted returns. This makes the empirical results not very useful by themselves since some games like "Mines" can terminate at failed states.

- The experiments do not include model-based algorithms, such as state-of-art ones like MuZero [1] and DreamerV3 [2] would perform in this Benchmark. The experiments also do not include RL algorithms designed specifically for such hard puzzle games (e.g [3]) or for neural algorithmic reasoning in general. Hence, it is unclear if this benchmark is indeed a challenge for current RL algorithms as claimed.

- The authors state that one of the benefits of the proposed benchmark is that all of the games have known polynomial-time optimal solutions, but they do not compare the evaluated RL algorithms with the optimal ones in the reported results. Including the optimal performance in the reported results is useful to judge how good the evaluated algorithms are in each game. It is also unclear if the benchmark comes with these optimal solutions.

- The paper only evaluates RL algorithms for game difficulties where a random policy can find a solution. 
  - It is not clear what this means, since all the games at all difficulty levels are solvable by a random policy (just with low probability for higher difficulties). I am guessing the authors meant that the random policy can find a solution in a maximum number of timesteps with high probability.  
  - The authors also claim that this restriction on evaluated games was necessary to enable any learning for the RL agents. This doesn't seem correct, since we know that many RL algorithms like PPO can solve tasks in which a random policy is highly unlikely to find a solution (for example in robot tasks).
  - Given that PPO is solves most of the evaluated tasks, the empirical results do not support the claim that this is a challenging benchmark for current RL. It would have been useful if the paper also evaluated the algorithms for different difficulty levels to show the scaling laws of current RL algorithms for this benchmark.

- Table 3 is referenced on page 9 but does not exist.

### Questions
It would be great if the authors could address the concerns I outlined above. I am happy to increase my score if they are properly addressed, as I may have misunderstood pieces of paper.

**### POST REBUTTAL ###**

Thank you to the authors for their time and effort spent to address my concerns. I also really appreciate the addition of Muzero and DreamerV3 to the baselines, and the addition of the optimal solutions. Their response has helped clarify some points I had, but I still have some outstanding concerns, and the new results and revised paper indicate that this work is not yet ready for publication. Mainly:

- I expected Muzero and DreamerV3 to do much better than reported. Their performance is only stated with no discussion (this is a general trend in this paper). Why is it that they both "still cannot pass the *human easy* setting of any puzzles". Why is Muzero able to solve hard reasoning games like Chess and Go with sparse rewards but fails here, even performing worse than PPO? How do they perform on hard tasks relative to the optimal solution and the other baselines? Why are the training curves (steps/episode) not provided?

- The authors say

> When only the final reward is provided, any RL policy behaves identically to a random policy, as there is no reward to guide it. Therefore, we believe our assessment holds: only when a random policy is able to solve a puzzle with a large enough success rate, an RL approach without intermediate rewards is also able to solve a puzzle.

This is extremely wrong. This is only true for RL algorithms that use the random policy as their main exploration strategy (e.g DQN). This is not necessarily true for other algorithms like PPO, HER, RND, R2D2, IMPALA, RAINBOW, Options framework, etc. Dealing with sparse rewards, exploration vs exploitation, and long horizon tasks are corner stone areas of research in RL, and there is a vast and rich literature in it. 
The statement the authors made here is really concerning. It makes me doubt how much thought really went into the choice of algorithms they evaluated. In general, I suggest the authors:

- Categorise the various aspects of this benchmark that make it supposedly challenging for current RL (e.g sparse rewards, exploration, long horizon). 
- Then choose 2 or more state-of-the-art algorithms in each category to evaluate.
- Evaluate them on all (or sample/representative) difficulty levels of all 40 games (or a sample/representative subset).
- Finally, provide a detailed discussion on why various algorithms belonging to each category succeed or fail on various tasks with various difficulty levels.
 
I really like the proposed benchmark, but the paper just needs a bit more work to provide the details and experiments needed for it to be useful to the community. Hence, I have reduced my score to a 3 and increased my confidence to a 5.

### Summary
The work introduces a novel benchmark for reinforcement learning tailored to understanding capabilities in neural algorithmic reasoning. The benchmark consists of 40 logic puzzle environments, all of which are configurable such that they provide various degrees of difficulty to agents. With a highly sparse reward signal, already small, and, supposedly easier puzzles pose a significant challenge to common model-free RL agents. In an example case study, the proposed RLP benchmark is used to study multiple RL algorithms capabilities in algorithmic reasoning.

### Strengths
The work proposes a novel benchmark to which is relevant to (a subset of) the RL community.
The benchmark covers a variety of logic puzzles, allowing to study RL agents capabilities in neural algorithmic reasoning. In particular, the proposed puzzles are all highly configurable such that multiple degrees of difficulty are achievable, making the benchmark also suitable for targeted curriculum learning.
Details of the benchmark are adequately listed and the code is made openly available such that it is straight forward to try out the benchmark with a variety of different RL algorithms.
The experiments show an example use case of studying how commonly used RL agents perform in the realm of algorithmic reasoning, highlighting that many algorithms struggle to outperform even a random policy.

### Weaknesses
The presentation of the results could be made a bit clearer as the figures is quite crowded and dense. An aggregate result showing how algorithms perform on average across all environments would likely better highlight that PPO and TRPO have a better performance than other algorithms.

The analysis of results might be a bit more detailed. For example, what separates a game like fifteen (where all algorithms seem to perform well) from a game like pegs, pearl or solo? Such a more detailed analysis might help to better convey the usefulness of the proposed benchmark. It would be beneficial to understand the specific characteristics of these puzzles that make them more challenging for RL agents. Are there differences in the state space complexity, the length of optimal solution paths, or the branching factor of the action space that contribute to the observed performance variations? A more granular analysis of the puzzle properties and their correlation with agent performance would strengthen the benchmark's utility.

To my understanding, the presented results are all for the "easiest" instantiation of the puzzles but no other difficulty levels are provided. If some curated settings for different difficulties would be provided, it would make future comparisons on the benchmark much more straight forward. Without such curated settings users are free to report any setting that works for them, which limits potential comparisons in the future. The lack of standardized difficulty levels makes it difficult to compare results across different studies using this benchmark. Providing a set of pre-defined configurations for varying difficulty levels would ensure a more consistent and comparable evaluation of RL algorithms.

Small side note: The Atari 2600 was introduced by Bellemare et al.. Mnih et al. popularized it due to their success with DQNs.

### Questions
What are the episode lengths for the individual environments?

How expensive is training on RLP? Are episodes quick to run due to the c-backend (similar to brax training) or is everything slow due to the pygame bindings?

### Summary
The authors propose and make available through a github repository a new benchmark compatible with the gymnasium interface and dedicated to assessing the logical reasoning capabilities of RL agents, based on the Simon Tatham's Portable Puzzle Collection. They then evaluate 6 RL agents on these benchmarks and conclude that these agents are far from satisfactorily solving these puzzles.

### Strengths
- The idea of making available this new benchmark based on the Simon Tatham's Portable Puzzle Collection is good.

- The paper is clear.

- The empirical study looks correctly executed.

### Weaknesses
 - Part of the design of the benchmark must be discussed (in my opinion it could be improved, see below)

- While the benchmark is proposed to assess the logical reasoning capabilities of RL agents, no serious attempt is made to truly assess these capabilities, nor to evaluate specific agents which may possess such capabilities (see below). It is disappointing that the authors discuss the lack of such capabilities in RL agents in the introduction, but they do not conclude to the need of designing RL agents specifically endowed with such capabilities. They just discuss the way to increase the performance of standard RL agents that do not have such capabilities represented explicitly.

- All RL algorithms used in the empirical study are episodic, and using them in environments without a time limit raises a number of questions. If an agent fails to solve an environment, do you run it forever? "Eternity is very long, particularly when you get close to the end" (Woody Allen, approximate translation from another language). So, probably, you stop it after some time. But what time? How do you make sure it wouldn't have succeeded two steps after you stopped it? If you think of it seriously, a preset time limit is mandatory in RL experiments. You may take as time limit an empirical estimate of the time it takes to a random policy to solve it (not the mean, something closer to an upper quantile estimate).

- The empirical results with "length bars" (Figs 3, 4 and several in appendix) are not easy to read. In particular, the error bars in black can hardly be distinguished from the mean performance in Fig 1. Maybe the main paper should rather show aggregated results (mean over puzzles clustered into relevant groups?) and the full view deferred to an appendix, with environments organized horizontally rather than vertically?
- In particular, it is in no way striking that TRPO and PPO outperform the rest, only a close investigation puzzle by puzzle can reveal this. Maybe tables will numerical results as in appendices and using bold for the 95% best would be more readable without requiring more space?

- I'm not sure Figure 5 brings any important information. Either it should be exploited in more details, or it might move to some appendix, in my opinion.

To me, the most important issues with this paper are the first two above and the time limit issue, if the authors can significantly improve their paper in those respects, I'll be happy to significantly increase my evaluation.

### Questions
## Questions

- Could you categorize the various puzzles in terms of the logical reasoning capabilities they require? Could you then evaluate RL algorithms in terms of displaying such capabilities or not?

- In the first paragraph of the related work, you list a few RL agents that seem to be endowed with some logical reasoning capabilities. Is the source code of some of these agents available? Could you evaluate some of them on your benchmark? 

- Eventually, are there some non-RL based agents that can be used as an oracle to determine the shortest number of steps you need to solve a particular maze, or at least a good performance?

- Could you elaborate on the interest of assessing logical reasoning capabilities of RL agents in puzzles rather than in real world situations where reasoning helps? I think I can find some good arguments, but making such points may make the paper stronger.

- Would it be easy to provide a JAX interface so as to speed up the execution of many instances of the puzzles in parallel, as done in Brax and isaac-gym?
