## Abstract
Black-box combinatorial optimization (black-box CO) is frequently encountered in various industrial fields, such as drug discovery or hardware design. Despite its widespread relevance, solving black-box CO problems is highly challenging due to the vast combinatorial solution space and resource-intensive nature of black-box function evaluations. These inherent complexities induce significant constraints on the efficacy of existing deep reinforcement learning (DRL) methods when applied to practical problem settings. For efficient exploration with the limited availability of function evaluations, this paper introduces a new generic method to enhance sample efficiency. We propose symmetric replay training that leverages the high-reward samples and their under-explored regions in the symmetric space. In replay training, the policy is trained to imitate the symmetric trajectories of these high-rewarded samples. The proposed method is beneficial for the exploration of highly rewarded regions without the necessity for additional online interactions - free. The experimental results show that our method consistently improves the sample efficiency of various DRL methods on real-world tasks, including molecular optimization and hardware design.

### Summary
The paper is motivated by the observation that in various black-box combinatorial optimization problems, exploring the solution space with reinforcement learning can be very costly due to the limited availability of high cost of function evaluations. To address this, the authors notice that there can be multiple symmetric solutions with exactly the same reward (or cost) (e.g., by shifting the original solution, permuting it, etc.). They then propose symmetric replay training, a technique that consists in replaying symmetrically transformed high-reward samples, so that it can better explore the under-explored regions in the symmetric space. For this purpose, we do not need additional interactions with the environment, as the reward (or cost) function in the symmetric configuration is equal to the original one. The authors experimentally assess their approach on the traveling salesman problem, molecular optimization and hardware design. They find that symmetric replay training consistently improves the sample efficiency, often by large margins.

### Strengths
1. The proposed technique of symmetric replay training is simple yet effective. Furthermore, the paper is generally clear and easy to follow.
2. The experimental evaluation covers three distinct settings: a synthetic one (TSP) as well as two real-world scenarios)hardware design and molecular optimization). In all cases, symmetric replay training significantly improves sample efficiency. Furthermore, the authors try their technique with multiple RL algorithms, since the framework is independent of the used RL algorithm. 
3. The positive results even compared to state-of-the-art methods (e.g., in practical molecular optimization) demonstrate the validity of the proposed approach.
4. The task, experimental settings, trailing process, loss functions and hyperparameters for each of the three settings is discussed in detail, both in the main text as well as in the appendix. I like the fact that the synthetic problems are compared to other sample-efficient techniques such as Syn-NCO.

### Weaknesses
1. Overall, the novelty of this work is not very significant. The symmetric replay training idea is rather straightforward and the same holds for the 2-phase algorithm. On the theory front, there are few theoretical results and insights, but at least the experimental evaluation is quite extensive and the results are positive.

2. There are other architectures with inductive bias for symmetries, such as permutation-invariant neural networks by Tang et al, besides the DevFormer. Since this paper is mostly experimental, it would have been great to assess how the proposed technique performs on top of such architectures that already incorporate the symmetric inductive bias. The experiments with the DevFormer in Table 2 and Figure 6 suggest that we can get additional benefit by applying symmetric replay training on top of such symmetric architectures. It would be interesting to understand if this is generally true with other architectures, too. In particular, even if the policy (and possibly value) networks already incorporate the symmetry in their architecture, is it possible for symmetric replay training to give additional benefit, and why would that happen?

3. The ablation study in Figure 4a is a bit unclear to me. How is it in principle possible to do simultaneous updates, given that we must first collect the high-reward samples in Phase 1? I think the idea of a 2-phase algorithm and alternating steps is inevitable, given that we must fist isolate the high-reward samples before applying the symmetric replay training. The authors could explain this part better to avoid confusion. Did they for example only store the high-reward samples in the replay pool for the simultaneous update, and then performed simultaneous updates once the replay buffer was sufficiently large?

### Questions
1. Have the authors tried other symmetric architectures besides the DevFormer? Does symmetric replay training on top of symmetric policy and value network yield additional benefit, and why? The proposed technique could complement other ideas such as symmetric NNs, so their combined impact would be interesting to understand.

2. Can the authors explain how simultaneous updates were performed in Figure 4a? Did they first conduct standard RL to fill the replay buffer with high-reward samples, and then switched to simultaneous updates? This was unclear from the text.

3. The paper emphasizes the fact that evaluating the black box function is an expensive operation. However, Table 8 shows that the proposed method can outperform other sample-efficient algorithms such as Sym-NCO in the synthetic settings, where function evaluation is fast and cheap. In that case, it seems that symmetric replay training could be positioned as a general technique for improved sample efficiency that can be used not only with black-box optimization but also more generally. The authors state "broad spectrum of CO problems and methods" and "a new generic DRL method" in the main text, so perhaps symmetric replay training is positioned as a general-purpose technique. On the other hand, the black-box nature (with expensive function evaluations) is mentioned several times and even in the title. It would make sense for the authors to disambiguate this point and position their method very clearly (i.e., as a general-purpose algorithm or a technique that is better suited for black box optimization with expensive function evaluations).

### Summary
This paper proposes a method called _symmetric replay training_ (SRT) to improve the sample-efficiency of reinforcement learning algorithms on problems where an agent constructs a final state step-by-step (e.g. building a molecule one atom at a time or placing hardware components on a chip one at at time). Such problems contain a natural combinatorial symmetry where the same final state can be reached by performing the same actions but in a different order. The method proposed in the paper is to supplement normal RL training with maximum likelihood training on transformed versions of the action sequences found during the previous round of RL. Experimentally, the authors show that this helps improve sample-efficiency in 3 problem domains.

### Strengths
Overall I thought this paper was well-done.

Strengths:

- The idea is sensible and simple.
- Experimentally, it does seem to provide improvements over the same RL methods done without SRT.
- The paper is well-written and well-presented. This does not feel like a rushed/last-minute submission. I liked the figures and diagrams.
- The experiments are thorough and

### Weaknesses
Weaknesses:

- The key idea is, at least in my opinion, kind of obvious. I'm not an RL expert so I can't comment on how previous works in RL have exploited symmetries, but at least in chemistry the existence of these symmetries is well-known and has been exploited in prior work (e.g. the paper "All SMILES Variational Autoencoder for Molecular Property Prediction and Optimization"). To the authors' credit though, I am not aware of work which has done this specifically for RL methods.
- At least for molecules, the experimental results are not as impressive as they may seem. A recent paper showed that tuning genetic algorithms actually can achieve an average score of `0.639` on the PMO benchmark, which is a bit better than the results shown in this paper (http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.09267). Furthermore, the bolding in Table 3 is a bit misleading: they bold the tasks which achieve the best results just on the methods considered, but not necessarily overall SOTA results on the PMO benchmark. For example, drd2, which the authors bolded with a score of `0.960` is beaten by SynNet with a score of `0.969` (Gao et al 2022).

More broadly, in my opinion, this paper's contribution only makes sense because RL methods are being applied to non-sequential problems by introducing some sort of artificial action sequence. To me, this suggests that RL is not the right tool for these kinds of problems. However, this is just my opinion and I did not take this into account when deciding my score.

### Questions
- In TSP you assume distances are Euclidean. However, is this not an easier subtype of TSP problems? I thought the NP-hard version is occurs when there is no such distance heuristic. I guess it is a toy problem so it doesn't matter much, but it might be more impactful to show result on a harder type of TSP.
- Theorem 1 was unclear to me: what specifically is $p(x|s_1)$? More generally, the importance of this theorem's result was not clear to me...

### Summary
This paper targets expensive combinatorial black-box optimization problems (with limited function evaluations). To enhance the sample efficiency of deep reinforcement learning (DRL), it introduces the Symmetric Replay Training (SRT) method, which suggests training the DRL agent by alternating between the conventional RL loss and a symmetric loss. The symmetric loss is designed to mimic previously generated trajectories that yield high rewards, while taking advantage of the solution-symmetric characteristics inherent in the combinatorial space. Results verified that SRT can boost the sample efficiency of the base DRL method.

### Strengths
From a technical perspective, the proposed SRT method appears to be valid. The emphasis on improving sample efficiency is important. Moreover, the method has been tested across three distinct categories of optimization problems, showcasing its versatility and effectiveness.

### Weaknesses
The paper seems to have a scattered focus. While the abstract suggests a focus on expensive black-box combinatorial optimization, the studied TSP problem and most leveraged baselines (like PPO, AM, GFlowNets) neither belongs to black-box optimization nor expensive optimization problems/algorithms. The paper also lacks a comparison with other methods specifically designed for expensive black-box optimization tasks, such as [1-4]. This makes positioning the paper within the literature quite challenging.

Meanwhile, reinforcement learning methods, especially on-policy ones like PPO, A2C, are criticized for their general sample efficiency. It remains unclear why on-policy RL is necessary for solving expensive black-box optimization problems.  This paper also neglects the comparison with other recent research that explicitly focused on improving the sample efficiency of DRL based on data augmentation and experience replay.

To me, it seems slightly unclear which community the paper could contribute: Is it DRL for CO, DRL's sample efficiency, expensive optimization, or expensive black-box optimization?

In addition, I have concerns about whether all expensive black-box optimizations can identify appropriate symmetries.

### Questions
1. Considering the symmetric loss, should we factor in importance sampling because methods like PPO and A2C are on-policy RL?
2. The paper would benefit from pseudo-code to clearly describe the algorithm. Presently, it's unclear how SRT integrates with PPO, A2C and other baselines.
3. How optimal are the results in Table 1 for TSP? How good are the SRT to advance the state-of-the-art of the expensive black-box combinatorial optimization?
4. Why do the results in Table 3 could differ from those in "Sample efficiency matters: a benchmark for practical molecular optimization"?
5. In Figure 3, PPO demonstrates a significant variance. This raises concerns about whether the hyper-parameters or other settings for PPO have been correctly set.

### Summary
This paper focuses on combinatorial black box optimization (or BBO) problems where candidate solutions need to be generated with a reinforcement learning (RL) policy, and the reward is episodic, and only available once a complete solution is presented to the reward oracle. In this setup, the authors leverage the fact that, in certain problems, distinct action sequences (starting from the same initial state) can lead to the same candidate solution, and make an additional assumption that, given a certain high reward action sequence, such symmetric transformations can be made easily/efficiently. The authors augment the traditional reward-maximizing training of a policy with a ``symmetric replay training'' or SRT, where the policy is additionally trained to imitate symmetric transformations of high rewarding action sequences. This allow the policy training to be more sample efficient by exploring different parts of the action space without needing to query the reward oracle (since the reward is already known).

This method is RL method agnostic, and is added to 5 different RL methods (A2C, PG-Rollout, PPO, GFlowNet, REINVENT), and evaluated across 1 synthetic task, and 2 real world benchmarks. In almost all cases, the proposed SRT significantly improves the sample efficiency of the base methods to different extents (in a couple of cases, SRT is unable to improve upon REINVENT).

### Strengths
The paper is very well presented, and it is easy to follow the proposed idea and the subsequent empirical analysis. The authors clearly explain each step and each experiment (with the corresponding tasks and baselines).

The proposed idea of leveraging symmetry in the solution space is a simple but very useful one. This leads to a general method agnostic technique to improve the sample complexity of **any RL-based combinatorial BBO solver**.

The empirical evaluation highlights the wide applicability of the proposed SRT scheme, and the gain SRT provides almost across the board, making it a critical part of any future RL-based solution where such symmetry preserving transformations are readily available.

### Weaknesses
Based on the presentation, and the literature review, it is not clear how this method compares to other combinatorial BBO solvers that do not rely on a sequence of actions from a policy to create a candidate solution. Examples of these include various versions of Bayesian Optimization [A, B, C, D].

The need for easily accessible symmetric transformations limit the scope of this BBO solver for BBO problem. On a related note (and not as a weakness), this seems more of an instance of "grey-box" combinatorial optimization instead of black-box because we are leveraging a lot of information regarding the solution space even if we do not have access to an analytic objective function.

- (Minor suggestion) It might be better to put all plots in Figure 3 on the same scale if the reader has to compare them side-by-side

### Questions
- How does this RL-based combinatorial BBO solution relate to combinatorial BBO problem handled by Bayesian Optimization schemes such as COMBO [B]? In their case, they would never propose the same solution twice (which is something any RL-based scheme might be producing, and SRT is removing this repetition). And if external information regarding the symmetries between solutions are available, that can be utilized (as is done in this paper) to generate new simulations and/or skip repetitions.
- Are there any existing literature on RL based BBO that discusses or brings up symmetries between action sequences (not necessarily leverages them)?
- Isn't TSP a problem where we can get a reward after every action (and the final reward is the sum of the partial rewards)? What happens if we compare the proposed scheme to such a setup with a RL-based solution?
- Are we looking at symmetric action sequences leading to the same solution $\mathbf{x}$, or are we talking about action sequences that lead to different solutions $\mathbf{x}'$ but $f(\mathbf{x}) = f(\mathbf{x}')$? The TSP example given on page 3 after Definition 1 seem to fit this latter setup. If it is infact the latter, how does that effect the proposed scheme and the related motivations?
- How is the shifting related to the starting point? Will a different sequence of actions from the same starting point lead to a solution with the same cycle (and hence value) but different order? I agree that the reversed order does lead to the same solution with the same initial state, but I am not sure about the other scenarios.
- I am not sure where the 20+% improvement is coming in for PPO+SRT over PPO with K=100k (as discussed in Section 4.1). Table 1 lists PPO at $6.77 \pm 0.12$ vs $6.71 \pm 0.02$ for PPO+SRT, which is more like a 1% improvement. Am I looking at the wrong results?
- In the presence of the symmetry, and the access to symmetric transformations, it seems that we should always see improved sample efficiency (or at least no degradation). Under what conditions might we expect degradation (as we see with 2 cases in Table 3 with REINVENT)?
