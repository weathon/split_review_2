## Abstract
Quantization is an indispensable technique for serving Large Language Models (LLMs) and has recently found its way into LoRA fine-tuning \citep{dettmers2023qlora}.
In this work we focus on the scenario where quantization and LoRA fine-tuning are applied together on a pre-trained model.  
In such cases it is common to observe a consistent gap in the performance on downstream tasks between full fine-tuning and quantization plus LoRA fine-tuning approach.
In response, we propose {\OurAlg} (\textbf{Lo}RA-\textbf{F}ine-\textbf{T}uning-aware \textbf{Q}uantization), a novel quantization framework that simultaneously quantizes an LLM and finds a proper low-rank initialization for LoRA fine-tuning. 
Such an initialization alleviates the discrepancy between the quantized and full-precision model and significantly improves generalization in downstream tasks.
We evaluate our method on natural language understanding, question answering, summarization, and natural language generation tasks. Experiments show that our method is highly effective and outperforms existing quantization methods, especially in the challenging 2-bit and 2/4-bit mixed precision regimes.

### Summary
This work proposes better initialization for LoRA adaptors A and B, and the Quantization of pre-trained weights W_{pt} in a setup where two things are desired:
1) downstream fine-tuning
2) quantization of W_{pt}. 

The authors propose an iterative method to find better initializations for these matrices. Through rigorous experiments the work shows that the proposed initialization is better than the vanilla initialization proposed in QLoRA.
The authors conduct experiments with almost-extreme quantization (2 bit) to show efficacy of their approach, where the traditional methods (QLoRA) even fail to train. 
The work also attempts to analyze the impact of number iterations (of the proposed iterative method) and the experiments are conducted well.

### Strengths
* This work presents well motivated initialization method for LoRA + Quantization
* Through extensive experimentation on several architectures and benchmarks, this work clearly elucidates pitfalls of QLoRA and effectiveness of the proposed method

### Weaknesses
None, but a few clarifying questions stated below.

1) For the XSUM and GSM8k tasks, LoftQ gets better accuracy than full-precision LoRA. I wonder how the FP LoRA was tuned? Maybe 4 bit quantization does implicit regularization, and FP LoRA  was not regularized well enough? This would especially make a difference if the tasks are low dimensional. In other words, if a high capacity LLAMA 13B model is fine-tuned LoRA style on GSM8k, how did the authors ensure that the model was not overfitted? It's crucial to understand if the comparison is made against a well-tuned FP LoRA baseline, as any unfair advantage to LoftQ would misrepresent its true effectiveness. The possibility of implicit regularization through quantization is interesting and warrants further investigation, perhaps by explicitly adding regularization to the FP LoRA baseline.

2) It would be nice to analyze number of epochs, and training steps required for baseline full precision LoRA and LoftQ. It's important to understand the convergence speed and computational cost of LoftQ relative to the full-precision baseline. Ideally, the number of epochs for each method should be reported, along with the training steps, to assess the practical implications of the proposed approach.

3) LoRA's original motivation stems from "training efficiency" while maintaining the inference cost the same as the base model. Conversely quantization's main motivation is inference efficiency. Keeping training efficiency aside, a good baseline maybe quantization aware fine-tuning (i.e. no LoRA), to establish upper bound on accuracy for LoftQ. It would be helpful to see how LoftQ compares against a quantization-aware fine-tuning approach without LoRA, which would provide a clearer understanding of the method's effectiveness compared to a direct quantization approach. This comparison would help determine if the performance gains are due to the initialization method or the LoRA approach itself.

4) It wasn't very fully clear but are the LoRA adaptors, A and B, quantized as well in LoftQ?

### Summary
This paper introduces a method (LoftQ) to initialize the quantized weights in a transformer based model for future LoRA-based fine-tuning. Different from initializations for Quantized Lora used in prior methods, such as fixup or zero-init, LoftQ initalizes the quantized matrix weights and lora weights together to minimize the Frobenious norm of the difference between the floating point weights and the quantized weights. The initialization process is iterative where the quantized matrix is obtained through a standarized quantization process and the lora quantized weights are obtained from a SVD decomposition.

Experiments on encoder models (classification), encoder-decoder models (summarization), and decoder models (math reasoning, language modeling) are conducted and results are in favor of the LoftQ initialization.

### Strengths
1. The lack of a proper initialization of quanitzed lora methods intuitively makes sense, the authors identified this problem and proposed a simple but working solution to address this problem. I appreciate this simplicity.
2. The experiments are well conducted over quite a few domains/datasets, models, and quantization schemas.
3. The paper is well written.

### Weaknesses
1. It might be better to put higher priority and conduct more experiments on decoder-based (or encoder decoder) models for generative tasks. It seems that quantized lora (whether with or without intialization) lacks too much in classification tasks with encoders, to the extent that pratictionars probably won't want to train quantized lora models on these tasks. 
2. Otherwise, I find this paper well rounded without significant weaknesses.

### Questions
1. It would be nice to show the memory footprint for 2-bit quantized models during training. 
2. Would the quantized lora initialization in turn help full quantized fine-tuning?

### Summary
This paper introduces a new approach for weight quantisation and parameter-efficient fine-tuning via low-rank adapters termed LoftQ. LoftQ is inspired by QLoRA and aims to improve over it by providing a better quantisation and better initialisation for the low-rank adapter weight matrices.  

For background: LoRA makes the assumption that the difference between pre-trained and fine-tuned weights can be approximated by a low-rank matrix, i.e. $W_{ft*} = W_{pt} + AB^T$. 

The core contribution of this work relies on the observation that QLoRA quantises $W_{pt}$ but still relies on the default LoRA initialisation which assumes a non-quantised matrix $W_{pt}$.

To address this shortcoming, the authors propose an iterative LoRA-aware quantisation which jointly improves the quantisation of $W_{pt}$, making it more similar to the pre-trained weight, and the initialisation of $A$ and $B$ (as the authors note, QLoRA is a special case of their proposed algorithm). 

The authors compare their proposed approach to QLoRA and full fine-tuning across several models and datasets, showing that it consistently outperforms QLoRA.

In addition to their main experiments, the authors provide ablations investigating their proposed approach in more detail.

### Strengths
- The core contribution of this work is well motivated and grounded in the shortcomings of an existing widely used approach.
- The authors provide sufficient experimental results to demonstrate the usefulness of their approach
- The authors provide ablation studies, investigating important details of their approach
- The paper is well written, the structure is clear and easy to follow

### Weaknesses
I couldn't identify serious weaknesses of this work but I have some suggestions and questions for the authors. See below.



### Questions
**Questions and suggestions**
- The result of the LoftQ algorithm is a quantised weight matrix ($Q_T$) as well as the LoRA matrices ($A_T$, $B_T$). An interesting ablation would be to discard $A_T$ and $B_T$ and use the default LoRA initialisation instead. This would tell us more about the importance of initialising $A_T$ and $B_T$ differently.
- One of the findings in the QLoRA paper is that it is crucial to add LoRA adapters to every linear layer of the model (Figure 2 in the QLoRA paper). It could be interesting to run a similar ablation with your method. Given your improved initialisation, maybe it is sufficient to add LoRA adapters to fewer layers.
- It could be interesting to study the difference in initialisation of the low-rank matrices more. Does your work provide insights into what makes a good LoRA initialisation and could these insights be potentially applied to non-quantised LoRA as well? 


**Typos and writing suggestions**

- Introduction, second paragraph: "It is predicated on the hypothesis ..." 
    - You might want to use "based" instead of predicated
- Discussion, LoftQ better than full precision LoRA: "Such zero initialisation could cause the fine-tuning unstable"
    - This sentence needs rewriting
