## Abstract
In this work we present a new method for the estimation of \gls{MI} between random variables. Our approach is based on an original interpretation of the Girsanov theorem, which allows us to use score-based diffusion models to estimate the \gls{KL} divergence between two densities as a difference between their score functions. As a by-product, our method also enables the estimation of the entropy of random variables. 
Armed with such building blocks, we present a general recipe to measure \gls{MI}, which unfolds in two directions: one uses conditional diffusion process, whereas the other uses joint diffusion processes that allow  simultaneous modelling of two random variables. 
Our results, which derive from a thorough experimental protocol over all the variants of our approach, indicate that our method is more accurate than the main alternatives from the literature, especially for challenging distributions. Furthermore, our methods pass \gls{MI} self-consistency tests, including data processing and additivity under independence, which instead are a pain-point of existing methods. % Finally, we show how to exploit pre-trained, text-to-image models to compute \gls{MI} between input modalities, which is instrumental for the analysis of the generative properties of such models.}

### Summary
The authors derive an estimator of mutual information using neural diffusion.

### Strengths
I really like that the authors used the Czyz benchmark data, and also the consistency tests. 
I also appreciate the creativity of the theoretical advancement, though I don't understand it (see below).

### Weaknesses
 I was super excited to read this paper, because I love thinking about mutual information and entropy, and have recently been working on some related issues.   The ideas are intriguing, and the results are impressive. So, the rest of this review will focus on the issues for me understanding the methods and results.

1. The biggest issue for me is that I almost immediately got lost.  I know information theory pretty well, I learned it from Fred Jelinek before he died. That said, I know very little about diffusion processes and SDEs. My main confusion with this paper was about connecting the math on diffusion processes to the process of estimating MI. There is a leap, which I am willing to believe is justified, that I completely missed.  Why are we talking about a filtration and an Ito process at all?  How do they related to the joint distribution F_{X,Y}? I read the words in Section 2-4, but was completely lost.  To be fair, I was also lost the first time I read the KSG paper (https://journals.aps.org/pre/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevE.69.066138).  I imagine lots of people might have followed the logic and derivation completely. But not me, I just didn't get it. And I spent some time trying to figure it out, as I'd like to get it, it seems cool, and within the realm of possibilities that I did get it, but I didn't. I thought maybe reading Appendix D would help me, but it didn't really help either.  In the end, I don't quite know what you did, or why you did it.  I would love something like Algorithm 1 and 2, which perhaps points to subroutines for how each relevant quantity is computed. For example, I don't see how to do "r.h.s. Eq. (16)". Where does 'g' come from, or k, or T? etc.

2. In terms of the numerical results, I think I understand them, which was exciting for me! Figure 1 shows that MINDE works about as well as other things on relatively easy problems where there is enough data, and slightly better on a spiral dataset when MI is high.  That's cool as far as it goes.  I'm always interested in *finite sample properties* for my estimators, because I always have finite data.  In particular, I often work on biomedical problems, in which sample sizes are typically hundreds.  So, I would be much more interested in seeing plots showing accuracy as a function of sample size, especially for the "easy" ones where many different estimators are getting the right answer. This introduces additional information about convergence rates. The fact that 2 high-dimensional simulations showed it does as well as other things, and one showed it is slightly better for some parametrization, I found not that compelling.

3. I understand why the authors say that the benchmark consists of 40 tasks.  However, in my opinion, this wording is confusing and misrepresenting the work. I would say that there are about 10 different tasks, with an average of 4 different parameterizations per task. Consider, for example, our paper https://elifesciences.org/articles/41690. We describe 20 tasks, but in Figure 2, we should many different parameterizations (dimensions) per task. Claiming that we had more than 20 tasks, in my opinion, would not be in integrity.  Varying parameters, dimensions, and sample sizes for a particular task is important, but claiming that each different parameterization is a different task seems inappropriate to me. Of note, the Czyz et al paper from which the tasks are extracted never seems to make such a claim. Rather, they name about 10 different tasks explicitly.

4. The claim that MINDE outperforms other approaches on 35/40 tasks I also question. No errorbars are provided.  While this is typical in machine learning benchmark comparisons, I think the practice is ill-advised and misleading.  Without errorbars, there is no evidence that if one ran the exact same code again, how likely is it that the results would be similarly ordered.  There is a rich history of non-parametric tests for evaluating whether one estimator tends to be better than another, and I would encourage the authors to only claim something is better when there is statistical evidence supporting the claim. 

5. Directly using kernel density estimators and plugging them into the MI equations, or using the standard approaches to estimating mutual information (eg, KSG, which is included in sklearn), to compare with the neural methods, would also be important.

### Questions
Things that would inspire me to increase the score: 
1. Explain (more/better) why they are talking about SDEs for estimating MI.
2. Perform statistical analyses and/or errorbars indicating whether MINDE is significantly better than anything else on any particular simulation.
3. Clarify how many different settings were considered, and discuss from that perspective.
4. More clear/complete pseudocode.

### Summary
This work proposes *Mutual Information Neural Diffusion Estimation (MINDE)*, a novel method to estimate the mutual information (MI) between random variables. By first decomposing the KL divergence between two generic measures into two terms via its disintegration properties, then utilizing the Girsanov Theorem, MINDE provides a recipe that incorporates score-based diffusion models into the estimation of MI. The work provides four variants of MINDE, each based upon either conditional or joint diffusion processes, and presents experimental results that not only show the effectiveness in estimating MI accurately, especially on more challenging tasks (*e.g.*, spiral diffeomorphism), but also illustrate the robustness and reliability of the proposed method via self-consistency tests (including independency test, data-processing test, and additivity test) on the MNIST dataset.

### Strengths
1. The construction of the basic building blocks that establish the estimation of KL divergence and of the entropy is well organized and clearly written.
2. It’s interesting to see the SDE framework of diffusion models being used under the setting of MI estimation, which could inspire the research community to investigate diffusion models in new directions.

### Weaknesses
1. While the utilization of score-based diffusion models can be justified by the Girsanov Theorem, it’s unclear how they are used as **generative models** (*i.e.*, using the reverse-time SDE to generate samples) — it seems that only forward diffusion SDEs are needed, in order to train the score networks. Therefore, it’s a bit confusing when the authors wrote “we explore the problem of estimating MI using generative models” (Page 1), instead of something like “we explore the problem of estimating MI using score functions”. The core of the method relies on estimating the score function, which is a property of the forward diffusion process, and the paper does not make clear how the reverse process is actually utilized in the MI estimation. The paper should clarify the role of the reverse diffusion process, or reframe the introduction to focus on score function estimation rather than generative modeling.
2. Source code for the experiments is not provided.

### Questions
1. Could the authors discuss the connection between this work and MINE (Belghazi et al., 2018)? The title of this work seems to suggest a close connection with MINE, but the paper only provides the experimental results of MINE as one of the baseline models for MI estimation.
2. In Section 5.1, it is mentioned that using a larger training size shall “avoid confounding factors”. What do authors mean by “confounding factors”?
3. Might be a typo in Page 3: “Radon-Nikodyim derivative” shall be “Radon-Nikodym derivative”.

### Summary
The paper proposes mutual information (MI) estimators based on diffusion models. This is achieved by representing MI as quantities that incorporate KL divergence which itself can be written as equations that involve score functions. Theoretical arguments justifying these claims are presented in the paper and experimental evaluation is performed on a recent benchmark dataset proposed for assessing MI estimators from multiple viewpoints (sparsity, dimensionality, long tails, and transformations). The results suggest that the developed estimator (MINDE) outperforms alternatives in most of these settings.

### Strengths
The problem considered is of critical importance in several applied and theoretical fields. Existing estimators either fail in high dimensions or require large amounts of data to provide precise estimates.

The results are quite impressive, the proposed estimator seems to outperform alternatives in most settings.

Several aspects of MI estimation that make the estimation challenging that were originally introduced in [1] such as sparsity, dimensionality, long tails, transformations, data processing, and consistency are considered in the experimental section making the empirical aspect of the paper strong.

### Weaknesses
The organization of the paper makes it hard to follow. The measure theoretical notations make the paper inaccessible to the broader audience interested in using the estimator in applied settings.

The contributions are not fully clear. The connections between score, KL, MI, and H existed before. In addition, it's an established fact that diffusion process models are more powerful density estimators specifically in higher dimensions making it less surprising that the MI and H estimators are superior.

The comparisons lack several important aspects specifically in the context of MI estimation. The wall-clock runtime and the dataset size requirements are not particularly elaborated on in the paper.

### Questions
How does the method scale with the number of data points used for training? Can you make a plot of the test error as a function of the number of training data points used? The number of training data points can vary between 100, 1K, 10K, and 100K. Can you do this for a varying number of dimensions as well and report results for different estimators?

InfoNCE seems to be doing a very good job, can you come up with an overall score to rank the methods? Does InfoNCE also require a large dataset with the same size as yours?

Can you include time comparisons between different models? I assume learning the score functions from a diffusion process for the joint probability distribution would be an overkill if one only cares about the MI or H. What’s the training time comparison between different models and how do the authors account for computational resources used by various models?

Diffusion processes are known to outperform other density estimators in various settings. Therefore it’s no surprise if it achieves better an estimation of MI and H. That said, I’m having a hard time determining what the main contributions are. I imagine that the main contributions are representing MI and H as quantities that incorporate score functions. However, the connections between KL, score, MI, H are known results in the information theory literature [cite]. Is the extension of those results to the diffusion process (as opposed to generic densities) non-trivial? Is there something critical that I’m missing?

The paper would benefit from reorganization in my opinion. The notations used in the paper as well as the organization of the sections make it difficult to follow the arguments of the paper. The contributions start appearing very late in the paper and there is a large amount of background which might not be necessary for the main arguments. I suggest the following organization:
* Simple intro to diffusion models (no need to include the measure theoretical notation as it’s mainly used for the proofs and can be transported to the supplementary).
* Introducing the joint diffusion model (4.1) and MINDE.
* Making connections between MI and H, score functions, and KL divergence.

A recent paper [1] discusses that the absolute continuity assumption made in the paper might not hold given the architecture of the neural network used for approximating the score function (the cited paper discusses it in the context of functional variational inference but intuitively the same arguments should hold for diffusion process). In this case, the KL divergence will be infinity and the MI and H estimators developed will be ill-defined. Can the authors articulate the underlying assumptions further and explain what datasets can benefit from the estimators developed in the paper?

### Summary
The paper introduces Mutual Information Neural Diffusion Estimation as a family of mutual information estimation models based on estimating the difference of score functions.
The authors introduce and evaluate 4 variants based on the modeled scores (joins vs conditional) and the use of a standard normal as a reference for entropy computation.
An experimental section validates the theory on common mutual information estimation benchmarks, comparing MINDE against modern alternatives in literature and assessing self-consistency and compositionality.

### Strengths
1) The paper provides a solid, detailed derivation for MINDE rooted in SDE theory.

2) The experimental section effectively demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed estimators on common benchmarks.

3) Although a Related Work section is missing, to the best of the reviewer’s knowledge, the paper includes references to all the relevant literature.

Overall I believe in the relevance and novelty of the submission and I am willing to increase my score whenever the authors address my main concerns.

### Weaknesses
 # Main concerns
1) The experimental section benchmarks the estimators against common discriminative estimators such as MINE, NWJ, D-V, and InfoNCE which are designed as lower bounds of mutual information, but no comparison against generative estimators based on difference of entropies is provided [1,2]. Since MINDE, and in particular MINDE-$σ$, is based on the same principle, such a comparison seems natural. The absence of this comparison is a significant oversight, as it leaves open the question of whether the proposed method offers any advantage over existing generative approaches that also leverage entropy differences. Specifically, the paper should demonstrate how MINDE's score-based approach compares to methods that directly model the joint and marginal distributions using normalizing flows and then compute the difference of entropies.

2) The paper mentions previous similar work on diffusion-based mutual information estimation [3], which differs in the derivation and modeling choices. Nevertheless, this work is not included in the experimental comparison, and the advantages of MINDE are not further elaborated. The lack of a direct comparison makes it difficult to assess the novelty and practical benefits of the proposed approach relative to existing diffusion-based methods. A thorough comparison should include an analysis of the computational cost, convergence properties, and performance on a diverse set of benchmarks.

3) No discussion regarding the computational cost or challenges of training MINDE compared to the other models in the literature is included in the main text. This omission is problematic because the practical applicability of the method depends on its computational feasibility. The paper should provide a detailed analysis of the training time, memory requirements, and sensitivity to hyperparameter choices, especially when compared to other neural estimators and non-parametric alternatives.


### Minor Remarks
1) The main text includes in-depth technical details with an extensive notation. If on one hand, this helps to verify the soundness of the derivation, on the other, it makes following the main derivation more difficult. I believe that submission could benefit by including additional intuition to guide the reader. The current presentation makes it challenging for a broader audience to grasp the core ideas and contributions of the paper. The authors should consider adding more high-level explanations and visual aids to complement the detailed mathematical derivations.

2) The plots in Figures 1 and 2 are quite small and difficult to read

### Questions
1) How does MINDE perform compared to classic generative estimators based on the difference of cross-entropies based on normalizing flows such as DoE in [1] and GM in [2]?

2) Can the author elaborate on the differences between MINDE and the work in [3]?

3) What are the main challenges when training the MINDE models? How does the training and inference cost (in terms of memory and computing) compare to the other neural estimators?
