## Abstract
We introduce SocioDojo, an open-ended lifelong learning environment for developing ready-to-deploy autonomous agents capable of performing human-like analysis and decision-making on societal topics such as economics, finance, politics, and culture. It consists of (1) information sources from news, social media, reports, etc., (2) a knowledge base built from books, journals, and encyclopedias, plus a toolbox of Internet and knowledge graph search interfaces, (3) 30K high-quality time series in finance, economy, society, and polls, which support a novel task called "hyperportfolio", that can reliably and scalably evaluate societal analysis and decision-making power of agents, inspired by portfolio optimization with time series as assets to "invest". We also propose a novel Analyst-Assistant-Actuator architecture for the hyperportfolio task, and a Hypothesis & Proof prompting for producing in-depth analyses on input news, articles, etc. to assist decision-making. We perform experiments and ablation studies to explore the factors that impact performance. The results show that our proposed method achieves improvements of 32.4% and 30.4% compared to the state-of-the-art method in the two experimental settings.

### Summary
The paper introduces SocioDojo, a comprehensive and open-ended learning environment designed for the development of autonomous agents capable of conducting human-like analysis and decision-making in areas such as economics, finance, politics, and culture. Such quality of analysis is evaluated by a proposed “hyperportfolio” framework, which generalizes from financial time series to all different time series. The paper also introduces a novel architectural agent approach, the Analyst-Assistant-Actuator, specifically for the “hyperportfolio” management task. The result is evaluated by the “return” of the “hyperportfolio” in a given period of time and it is shown to outperform other approaches like Self-Ask and Plan & Solve.

### Strengths
1. SocioDojo can take in a lot of real-world information sources and knowledge base
2. Propose AAA agent architecture, with an analyst, an assistant, and an actuator, and it seems to work well in the proposed “hyperportfolio” management task.
3. The proposed “hyperportfolio” is novel and interesting, which takes in a large number of different time series and can be used to evaluate the agent’s overall understanding of various aspects of real world

### Weaknesses
1. The definition of POMDP seems to disconnect from the rest part of the manuscript. Those notations are not used in other parts at all. 
2. The main evaluation results are only based on a final return in the defined period, which misses other important aspects for the results to be valid. See questions below
3. The proposed “return” of “hyperportfolio”, as some kind of evaluation metric, is very hard to interpret. While it seems that it is related to how accurately the agent is able to predict the future of various time series, it’s hard to make sense of the numerical value, especially when various time series are fused together.

### Questions
1. Instead of expected return, modern portfolio theory typically tries to maximize risk-adjusted return. Is there any specific reason that the authors do not consider the standard deviation?
2. In Table 1, it is shown that there would be 9 research papers per day. Is this an average statistic or subscribed information that will constantly have 9 papers?
3. How does the “return” of “hyperportfolio” change over time? How is the final “return” distributed across different time periods?
4. For some of the time series, e.g. GDP as an economic time series, we would have existing forecasting beforehand. They might be part of the report, and the model can directly use these numbers, which are typically fairly accurate. In this case, how do you confirm that the agent utilizes the comprehensive information from different sources to make the “investment” instead of directly taking those numbers?
5. Financial time series is typically the most noisy one compared with other time series, which should also be the least predictable. However, it is shown that the financial time series achieves the highest return. How do authors interpret such results?
6. Typos: equation 3.1.2, Table 3.2.1 and Figure 3.2.1 are not pointing to the correct place and are not indexed correctly. Table 1 in the Knowledge Base part should be Table 2.

### Summary
This paper introduced SocioDojo, a framework for developing ready-to-deploy autonomous agents capable of performing human-like analysis and decision-making on societal topics, e.g., finance. The authors demonstrated the use of SocioDojo by a task called "hyperportfolio", where agents read news and time series data and make decision on buying/selling assets. The results show that the proposed method achieves improvements of 32.4% and 30.4% compared to the state-of-the-art method in the experimental settings of "standard" and "tracking".

### Strengths
* The paper was well-written with sufficient details on data sources, work process. Ablation studies explored the factors that impact performance.

* The task of hyperportfolio is carefully designed, for example, commission fee is considered.

* The proposed Analyst-Assistant-Actuator (AAA) agent architecture outperformed several recent baselines such as Self-Ask and AutoGPT.

### Weaknesses
 * Since GPT-3.5-Turbo was used as foundation models with a non-zero (0.2) temperature, the results should not be fully deterministic, while the paper may miss some studies on randomness. It is unclear how much the variance in the model's output affects the overall performance and the conclusions drawn from the experiments. The paper should include a sensitivity analysis of the temperature parameter to better understand the robustness of the results.

* The setting of "Forbid day trading", that an asset cannot be sold within 5 days of purchase to avoid profiting from short-term patterns, might be overly strict. This constraint, while intended to prevent exploitation of short-term fluctuations, may also hinder the agent's ability to react to significant market changes or to optimize its portfolio based on new information. The impact of this constraint on the agent's performance should be further investigated by comparing it with less restrictive trading rules.

* For the experimental setting of "tracking", it remains unclear how the portfolio performs against an actual index tracker. The paper lacks a direct comparison with standard market benchmarks, such as the S&P 500 or other relevant indices. This makes it difficult to assess the practical value of the proposed method in real-world financial scenarios. The evaluation should include a comparison against a passive investment strategy that follows a market index.

### Questions
* When multiple news articles sent out on the same day, did the order of news matter? i.e., to which extend the agent is permutation invariant?

### Summary
This work tries to propose an open-ended lifelong learning environment designed for developing autonomous agents that can perform human-like and up-to-date analysis and decision-making on societal topics. To do so, the environment SocioDojo is structured to emulate the historical development of society using real-world texts and time series data. 

Specifically, it 1) integrates a continuous stream of real-world texts and messages from various information sources, including news, social media, reports, and more. The information in the form of time-stamped messages, ensures that the agents are exposed to up-to-date societal developments, forcing them to analyze and respond to fresh data.
2) incorporates a vast array of time series data spanning various societal aspects like finance, economics, politics, and social trends.
3) incorporates multiple knowledge bases and tools, including books, journals,  encyclopedias, interfaces to search engines and knowledge graphs, etc.

With the environment, the task of the agent is called "Hyperportfolio Task". They are given an initial "cash" value and are tasked with making "investments" in different "assets" that correspond to various time series. The goal is to maximize their total assets over a specified period, just like investment and asset management in the real world.

In this work, the author also proposes the Analyst-Assistant-Actuator agent architecture to tackle the hyperportfolio task, and the Hypothesis and proof prompting technique for generating high-quality analysis, which achieves improvements of 32.4% and 30.4% in two experiment settings compared to the state-of-the-art methods. The ablation study results show 1)the importance of domain-specific analysis techniques and high-quality information sources. 2)The analyst is critical for the hyperportfolio task.

### Strengths
Overall, this paper could be a significant contribution to the research question of "How can we get an environment designed for developing autonomous agents that can perform human-like and up-to-date analysis and decision-making on societal topics." 
The writing is clear and the paper is easy to follow.
The proposed approach to using diverse and real-world information sources to simulate the societal environment can truly grapple with the complexities and nuances of real-world information, which facilitates the exploration of general intelligence. 

The introduction of the hyperportfolio task is novel to me, I do not think such kind of automatic metric is the best way to evaluate agents's foresight and strategic thinking ability but it is good enough. 

The setting of the environment is also meaningful. Such as the prohibition of "day trading"  ensures that agents don't exploit short-term fluctuations but instead focus on understanding and predicting more meaningful, long-term societal trends. 

Overall, I do believe the complexity of the hyperportfolio task could set a high bar for LLM-based agents, challenging the community to rise to the occasion.

### Weaknesses
While the SocioDojo environment is comprehensive and emulates the running of the world, its complexity might make it challenging for researchers to quickly adapt.

I think it would be beneficial to introduce some actual real-world classic scenarios or investment cases. These could serve as short-term goals or benchmarks, allowing researchers to run and evaluate their own model in a phased manner. It could also be useful for evaluating the information coverage level of the system.

The lower bound of the system is not clear. The complexity of SocioDojo might inadvertently obscure the foundational or simpler strategies that also be effective. For instance, SOTA time-series forecasting methods could be employed as a foundational strategy for investment within the SocioDojo environment. It could serve as a baseline or a lower bound against which more complex strategies can be compared.

I also hope the author put more discussion on how the authors have addressed potential biases, screened sources, and ensured the diversity of data, it would bolster the paper's credibility and address potential concerns.

### Questions
Are there any data leakage between the knowledge base and the streaming messages?
