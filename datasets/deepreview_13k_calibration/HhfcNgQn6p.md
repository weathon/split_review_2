## Abstract
Given a sample of size $N$, it is often useful to select a subsample of smaller size $n<N$ to 
be used for statistical estimation or learning. 
Such a data selection step is useful to reduce the requirements of data labeling and the computational complexity
of learning. 
We assume to be given $N$ unlabeled samples $\{\bx_i\}_{i\le N}$, 
and to be given access to a  `surrogate model' 
that can predict labels $y_i$ better than random guessing.
Our goal is to select a subset of the samples, to be denoted by $\{\bx_i\}_{i\in G}$, 
of size $|G|=n<N$.
We then acquire labels  for this set and we use them to train a model
via regularized empirical risk minimization.

By using a mixture of numerical experiments
on real and synthetic data, and mathematical derivations under low- and high- dimensional asymptotics,
we show that: $(i)$~Data selection can be very effective, in particular
beating training on the full sample in some cases; $(ii)$~Certain popular choices in data selection methods (e.g. unbiased reweighted subsampling,
or influence function-based subsampling) can be substantially suboptimal.

### Summary
The paper considers a problem of selecting a subset of the data that results in a best performance under the empirical risk minimization setting. Further, labels are considered to be unknown, with an available surrogate model that can be used for estimating the labels. The task is accomplished by finding selection probabilities and a corresponding reweighting scheme that depends on the input data without labels. There are multiple results, that showcase properties of different selection schemas, their applicability and general recommendations for designing subsampling procedures.

### Strengths
A thorough study is performed about the general properties, that are beneficial for all subsampling schemes. Importantly, model generalization was well studied, in addition to the task of just solving an optimization problem. Biased to unbiased sampling comparison was very insightful, as there are many works where only unbiased sampling is considered, which appeared to be suboptimal under the presented setting.

Additional note after the Reviewer-Authors discussion (review score raised): 

The paper reveals properties of data selection schemes, unusual in the well-established fields of data selection, such as the field of coresets. This is in part accomplished by formulating a different goal (such as the equation 4.3 in section 4) of data selection compared to one of the common goals of replicating the ERM loss on the full labeled data. It is expected that the paper will have a broader impact on the field of data selection under a variety of practical settings.

### Weaknesses
My main concern is the applicability in general setting and the assumptions in the paper:
- There is a concern in that (to my understanding) only the behavior exactly at the the optimum was considered (or at least in a small neighbourhood of the optimum), for example, refering to the equation B.3 (definition of the error based only on optimal values of the parameters); and the assumption B.1.A1. (lack of multiple optimal values). In most non-trivial non-linear models an iterative optimization procedure must be considered, which results in parameters passing through a range of values in addition to the final minima (global or local). In this case, even having a low error at the optimal paramter values will not help the optimization procedure.
- There appears to be a dependency of some calculated values on the value of optimal parameters that are to be estimated (\theta^*) starting from the equation 4.2. It was unclear for me whether we can use estimates of such parameters and how correct would be the final results when the assumptions are violated or some values are replaced with estimates (in case if closed form solutions are unavailable).
- Since the paper is aimed at establishing a new branch of the data selection theory, would be nice to state applicability limits (to my understanding, only linear models were considered in the examples, including linear models with simple single non-linearity, such as generalized linear models)

### Questions
- To clarify the assumptions, how applicable is the method to models with multiple local minimas? (non-convex losses and models)
- Related to the previous question, how applicable is the method to various non-linear models? For example, any model that contains non-trivial non-linearity, such as a two-layer network?
- Is it possible to use gradient-based and similar approximate procedures that require low subsampling error over the whole parameters space to converge (difference between Loss under subsampled data and full data to be small not only at the optimal values of parameters)? 
- There is an extensive theory of data selection in the case when labels are known (in that case there are methods that guarantee low multiplicative or additive error over whole parameters space, far from optimum, when comparing full and subsampled datasets); would it be possible to evaluate the proposed model against such prior art, for example, considering a "perfect oracle" that exactly predicts the labels in the proposed setting?

### Summary
This work studies the problem of data selection: given a large unlabeled dataset of size $N$, we would like to select a subsample of smaller size $n$ to be used for statistical analysis; e.g., one could collect only $n$ instead of $N$ labeled examples and perform statistical estimation only with this subset of data.

The authors assume access to $N$ unlabeled examples $\\{x_i\\}$ and to a "surrogate model", which is a weak-learner for the actual labeling problem (labels data better than random guessing) and hence can be used to predict the label $y_i$ of $x_i$.  We then select a subset $G \subset \\{x_i\\}$ of size $n < N$ of the examples, we label the data of $G$ using the "surrogate model" and finally train a parameterized model with that data via regularized ERM. The question is how to select $G$ so that the trained model is actually "good".  

The paper presents both theoretical results and practical evidence of interesting phenomena for data selection mechanisms (in both low- and high-dimensional settings). For instance, data selection can beat training on the full sample in some cases and unbiased data selection can be highly sub-optimal compared to biased mechanisms.

### Strengths
The paper provides various results that I find interesting: 

(i) While a standard method for data selection is unbiased sub-sampling, Theorem 1 shows that the error coefficient of unbiased schemes can be arbitrarily larger than that of biased ones. Hence, in many cases, unbiased subsampling is sub-optimal (e.g., Figure 1).

(ii) Figure 1 and Theorem 2 provide a setting where ERM using a selected subset of the data can lead to a better model than ERM on the full dataset.

(iii) The surrogate model is an important component in data selection. The authors give an example where better surrogate models do not lead to better selection.

I think that the above results (among others appearing in the paper) paint an interesting picture for data selection and open nice research directions. While most of the results are based on toy examples motivating the underlying phenomena, I find this paper a good fit for ICLR and I vote for acceptance.

### Weaknesses
I think that some parts of the paper are hard to follow and could be more clearly written (for instance, Sections 4-5). I understand that due to space constraints, presentation could be more challenging. 

I do not find some other significant weakness.

### Questions
(1) How does the provided results in semi-supervised learning (where one has a small labeled dataset and many unlabeled examples but uses both for training) compare with the setting of the paper?

(2) The improvement in the ERM generalization using a well-selected subsample holds even for imperfect surrogate models (from Figure 1). Is there a result that compares the weakness of the surrogate model with the improvement (for some specific examples)?

### Summary
The paper studies the following problem.
Suppose we are given $N$ unlabeled samples where each of them has an underlying label and a surrogate model that predicts labels better than random guesses.
We would like to select a small subset of these $N$ samples of size $n$ and use the surrogate model to obtain their corresponding labels.
Then, we train a model based on these $n$ selected samples and their corresponding labels.
The question is: How do we select this subset?
The authors showed that if this subset is selected "correctly" then training on it can beat training on the full dataset in some cases.
Also, the authors showed that some popular choices of data selection can be suboptimal.

### Strengths
- The problem seems well-motivated.

### Weaknesses
 - The presentation is quite technical.
Readers who are not experts in this area may find this paper hard to follow.

- Page 1 second paragraph "close to $n$": $n$ is not defined at this point. It is a bit weird to say close to $n$.

- Paragraph below (1.2): What is cst?

- In (1.3): Is $\ell_{\text{test}}$ a new loss function? Or should $\ell_{\text{test}}$ be $\ell$?

- Section 2: What is $dy$? Is it the label predicted by the surrogate model?

### Summary
This paper investigates subsampling in supervised learning. It begins by assuming a collection of labeled data points, denoted as $\left(x_i, y_i\right)_{i \leq N}$, which are drawn as independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) samples from a given distribution, denoted as $P$. Additionally, they introduce a surrogate model, denoted as $\hat{P}(y \vert x)$, which is capable of predicting labels more effectively than random guessing. The central objective, in the absence of access to the true labels of the data points, is to leverage the surrogate model to perform subsampling on the training data, resulting in a reduced dataset of size $n = \gamma N$, where $\gamma$ is a parameter in the range of $(0,1)$. This reduced dataset is then used to train the final model.

The experiments conducted by the authors have shown some intriguing outcomes. Firstly, the choice of subsampling strategy seems to have a significant impact, offering more than mere randomness in the process of reducing the samples. Secondly, in specific cases, subsampling can actually yield lower estimation errors during testing. It's worth noting that this study is supported by a solid framework of theoretical guarantees.

While the authors have made notable strides in their experimental validations, I believe some theoretical aspects remain unaddressed through analytical tools. Several propositions and theorems presented inside the paper are scattered and might be considered as ancillary results. Nevertheless, this paper is still a solid theoretical work with robust mathematical underpinnings. The theoretical formulation of the problem and the experimental observations collectively present a nice contribution to the field, which makes this work a nice addition to ICLR. My vote is in favor of acceptance, and I am open to revising my evaluation should the authors give convincing responses to the questions raised in the Questions and Weaknesses sections.

### Strengths
- The problem setup is straightforward and easily comprehensible, yet it leads to intriguing and intricate implications from both theoretical and experimental standpoints.

- Notably, the experimental findings presented in Figure 1, particularly when subsampling effectively reduces estimation errors compared to utilizing all data points, are highly intriguing.

- The authors have explored a wide range of subsampling schemes, including both biased and unbiased methods. Additionally, the asymptotic analysis in this work covers scenarios in both low-dimensional and high-dimensional regimes.

- The paper provides a substantial foundation of solid mathematical guarantees. I did not find any notable mathematical errors, and the theoretical results exhibit a commendable level of mathematical rigor. However, these results don't always align seamlessly with the compelling experimental findings, appearing as somewhat scattered attempts to tackle a very challenging problem.

- The authors have asserted that they've uncovered intriguing connections between an almost universally unbiased subsampling scheme and a method based on "influence functions" from prior research, as mentioned in Remark 4.1.

- The paper is well-written and is easy to read.

### Weaknesses
 - The primary limitation of this paper, to the best of my understanding, is that all mathematical analyses beyond Section 4 assume that the surrogate model is equivalent to the optimal Bayes conditional distribution. In other words, the sample selection process somewhat presumes knowledge of the true label distributions. Consequently, the authors have not been able to provide a sound theoretical justification for the "magic" effects claimed in Figure 1. This drawback significantly affects the significance of the work, in my opinion.

- Theorem 1 asserts that $\rho_{\mathrm{unb}}/\rho_{\mathrm{nr}}$ can grow arbitrarily large by selecting the feature vectors' distribution in an adversarial manner. However, can the same be said for $\rho_{\mathrm{nr}}/\rho_{\mathrm{unb}}$? What happens when the feature vectors' distribution is more generic, such as Gaussian? Without additional guarantees in these respects, the theorem may lack substantial significance. It would be beneficial to explore the behavior of these ratios under more common data distributions, as the current analysis seems tailored to a specific, potentially unrealistic, adversarial case. This limits the practical implications of the theorem.

- All the mathematical analyses in this work are based on asymptotic conditions ($n,N\rightarrow\infty$ with $n/N\rightarrow\gamma$), which remain intriguing but could be expanded to encompass a broader scope. For instance, non-asymptotic guarantees and cases where $n/N\rightarrow 0$ could be explored. The current asymptotic framework, while providing valuable insights, may not fully capture the behavior of subsampling in practical scenarios with finite sample sizes. Investigating non-asymptotic bounds would strengthen the applicability of the theoretical results.

- The section related to high-dimensional analysis exclusively considers a linear model with Gaussian feature vectors. Additionally, it assumes that $N/p$ converges to a known constant. These assumptions offer room for extension and relaxation. The reliance on a linear model with Gaussian features and the specific asymptotic behavior of $N/p$ limits the generalizability of the high-dimensional analysis. Exploring other model classes and relaxing these assumptions would enhance the robustness of the theoretical framework.

- This paper is densely packed with intricate mathematical statements, often presented in a dense manner. Many results, sometimes unrelated, may require more context and explanation than a "9-page limit" can accommodate. In this regard, the authors might consider submitting their work to a journal to allow for a more comprehensive presentation. The current presentation, while mathematically rigorous, could benefit from additional context and explanation to improve accessibility and clarity.

- Paper has no conclusions section.

**Minor comments**:
- In Theorem 2: "an non-empty" -> "a non-empty".

### Questions
- **Why $\Omega:\mathbb{R}^p\rightarrow \mathbb{R}$**: In other words, why the dimensionality of parameter $\theta$ has been assumed to be the same as that of the input vector $\boldsymbol{x}$. Obviously, this assumption makes sense when using a linear model. However, does it alter the generality of the presented framework in any shape or form?

- **In Figure 1, how do you justify the reduction in estimation error after subsampling?** The way I have understood the experiment: "Full data" curve uses all the 34345 data samples with **true** labels. On the other hand, the proposed scheme (in the case of a weak surrogate model) 
- - 1) First, uses only 1472 samples (with true labels) from another fraction of the dataset in order to train a surrogate model. 
- - 2) You use the above-mentioned surrogate model to select, say, 50% of the dataset (without seeing their true labels, right?), and then 
- - 3) The training procedure considers the true labels, only for the above-mentioned selected samples, and uses them for training the main model. 

At the end, the main model outperforms the "Full data" curve. Is it because the surrogate model has been trained too good? can you please also report the estimation error of the weak and strong surrogate models? Also, it should be noted that Theorem 2 only shows that there "exists" cases for which $\rho_{\mathrm{nr}}$ is not monotonic. But it does not prove error can become lower than that of a full data ERM.

- **Assumption A.1 (in Proposition B.1)**: I am a little confused here... In Proposition 4.1, do we have to assume that A.1 (of Proposition B.1) holds? Or the subsampling strategy that is guaranteed to minimize $\rho_{\mathrm{unb}}$ automatically satisfies this condition? (i.e., forcing the minimizers of $R_S$ and $R$ to coincide with each other)

- **What (or should I say: Where) is $b(x)$ in Proposition 4.3**?
