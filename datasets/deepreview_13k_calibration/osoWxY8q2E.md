## Abstract
Large Language Models (LLMs) with billions of parameters have drastically transformed AI applications. However, their demanding computation during inference has raised significant challenges for deployment on resource-constrained devices. Despite recent trends favoring alternative activation functions such as GELU or SiLU, known for increased computation, this study strongly advocates for reinstating ReLU activation in LLMs. We demonstrate that using the ReLU activation function has a negligible impact on convergence and performance while significantly reducing computation and weight transfer. This reduction is particularly valuable during the memory-bound inference step, where efficiency is paramount. Exploring sparsity patterns in ReLU-based LLMs, we unveil the reutilization of activated neurons for generating new tokens and leveraging these insights, we propose practical strategies to substantially reduce LLM inference computation up to three times, using ReLU activations with minimal performance trade-offs.

### Summary
This paper advocates for the use of ReLU activation function in LLM. ReLU can significantly increase the activation sparsity level, leading to promising inference efficiency. The authors argue that both training from scratch with ReLU and Relufication finetuning a trained model lead to comparable performance. In addition, the authors introduce aggregated sparsity, saying that consecutive tokens will only use a subset of all neurons as well. Aggregated sparsity can be applied on top of speculative decoding to save the I/O of loading weights.

### Strengths
Overall, quality and clarity are solid. This work discusses the significance of the activation function from the inference efficiency perspective, which is rather under-explored but should be discussed.  The idea of a similar sparsity pattern among consecutive tokens is also novel, to the best of my knowledge.

### Weaknesses
The authors argue that pretraining with other activation only gives at best marginal performance, and longer training could compensate for the gap. However, I believe this argument can be better supported. The bottom row of Figure 2 only considers three downstream datasets ( maybe perplexity would be more indicative here), and it seems like the accuracy is still growing. It is hard to judge whether longer training could compensate, and if yes, how much more training we need.



### Questions
(1)	We observe different aggregated sparsity ratios at different layers: the deep layer seems less sparse, according to Figure 7(a). Then, for the perplexity experiment with aggregated sparsity, did the authors use the same γ for all layers? If not, could this help recover more performance?
(2)	Could the authors elaborate on how they would imagine optimizing the finetuning process in relufication further to recover the full performance?

### Summary
Recent LLMs have favored non-ReLU activations like GELU and SiLU despite their higher computation because they were thought to improve performance. This paper argues that ReLU activation can match performance of non-ReLU while significantly reducing computation due to inducing sparsity. Experiments show training LLMs from scratch with different activations yields similar performance but ReLU is much more sparse. The paper proposes "relufication" - modifying pretrained non-ReLU LLMs by replacing activations with ReLU and re-finetuning. Relufied LLMs regain original performance quickly during finetuning while being 3x more sparse, reducing computation. Additional techniques like inserting ReLU after normalization layers further improve sparsity and efficiency. Analysis shows relufied ReLU LLMs reuse neurons across tokens, enabling optimizations like faster speculative decoding. Shifted ReLU aligned to preactivations can achieve even higher sparsity with minimal impact on performance. Overall, the paper advocates reinstating ReLU in LLMs for inferencing efficiency with manageable tradeoffs.

Authors also explore aggregated sparsity, which they defined as the ratio of neurons that have not been used up to processing the first t token. They show that models using RELU display up to 50% aggregated sparsity and the usage pattern is not random so only a subset of the model can be loaded up speculatively for some cases.

### Strengths
- The paper tackles an important issue in deep learning - how to improve the efficiency of large language models during inference. This is a very relevant topic given the large computational requirements of state-of-the-art LLMs.
- The solutions presented by authors is very simple (applying RELU activations) making it very attractive for making 
- The paper proposes practical strategies like relu-fying already existing network rather than training ones from scratch. They suggest that replacing the activation functions of pretrained LLMs with ReLU is possible, and the performance can be recovered very rapidly during finetuning. This makes this approach more practical as costly pre-training can be removed.
- Authors evaluate the performance of RELU-trained networks on a realistic benchmark, testing three models on the HEML benchmark which contains a representative sample of datasets.
- Authors show that the performance of sufficiently large models trained on sufficiently large data depends heavily on compute and data, rather than the choice of the activation function. This is supported by previous work on scaling laws (Kaplan et al., 2020; Hoffmann et al., 2022)

### Weaknesses
 - Authors should provide more empirical comparisons to other size-reduction methods to validate thesucess of their strategy. The approach they develop is not compared to any pruning methods such as [https://openreview.net/forum?id=0GRBKLBjJE, https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.03033] which could be seen as competition.
- The sparsification mechanism relies on the underlying architecture supporting the sparse BLAS operations which is not the case for some applications. It would be good to discuss this shortcoming in more detail and perhaps include latency measurements in the main text.
- Takig advantage of the sparsity-promoting property of RELU is not trivial with regular implementations. Authors do not provide the link to their implementation of the method/experiments making applying this approach quite difficult.

### Questions
- What are the latency speedups of this approach on the hardware it was tested on?
- What are prerequisites to make sure a user can realize the full benefits from this approach? I understand one needs a specific implementation of the NN code to take advantage of the sparsity.

### Summary
This paper studies the sparsity properties associated with activation functions in Large Language Models (LLMs). It highlights that LLMs employing ReLU-based activations exhibit pronounced sparsity in FFN, which can be harnessed for more efficient LLM inference. Conversely, modern LLMs commonly utilize activation functions such as GeLU and SiLU, which generate non-zero outputs even for negative inputs. This behavior hinders the model from achieving optimal sparsity. This paper proposes to replace GeLU, SiLU with ReLu for better sparsity. The paper studies both training the model from scratch and fine-tuning the model to make non-ReLU models adapt to ReLU activations. The authors suggest that replacing other activations with ReLU does not largely hurt the model performance. Finally, this paper also discusses the potential applications of this sparsity property.

### Strengths
1. This paper conducts an evaluation to study how different activations influence model performance under both pre-training and finetuning scenarios.
2. The evaluation of inserting ReLU in attention layers is interesting (Stage 2). Even it generally hurts in-context learning (ICL) performance.

### Weaknesses
1. The observation that replacing activation functions like GeLU, SiLU with ReLU only marginally influences performance is not new. It is also mentioned and discussed in [1][2].

2. The evaluation (Table 1 & 2) majorly focuses on zero-shot learning and ICL scenarios. Although I understand that zero-shot learning and ICL are common settings to compare LLM performance, it can be helpful to compare the model performance on generation tasks to better understand how different activations influence model performance.

3. I am confused by the applications studied in Section 5.1, what does “loading new weights” mean here? Shouldn’t all weights be pre-loaded to the GPU HBM in common inference frameworks like vLLM [3]? 

4. Although the paper claims that replacing other activations with ReLU only has negligible impacts on the performance, the accuracy drop seems not to be so marginal. However, I agree that this replacement can also be a potential good trade-off between model performance and model efficiency.
