## Abstract
Many real-world networks evolve over time, and predicting the evolution of such networks remains a challenging task. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have shown empirical success for learning on static graphs, but they lack the ability to effectively learn from nodes and edges with different timestamps. Consequently, the prediction of future properties in temporal graphs remains a relatively under-explored area.
In this paper, we aim to bridge this gap by introducing a principled framework, named GraphPulse. The framework combines two important techniques for the analysis of temporal graphs within a Newtonian framework. First, we employ the Mapper method, a key tool in topological data analysis, to extract essential clustering information from graph nodes. Next, we harness the sequential modeling capabilities of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) for temporal reasoning regarding the graph's evolution. Through extensive experimentation, we demonstrate that our model enhances the ROC-AUC metric by 10.2\% in comparison to the top-performing state-of-the-art method across various temporal networks. We provide the implementation of GraphPulse at https://github.com/kiarashamsi/GraphPulse.

### Summary
GraphPulse is a novel framework proposed for analyzing and predicting the evolution of temporal graphs through a combination of temporal graph neural networks and topological data analysis (TDA). The paper presents a process that takes snapshots of temporal graphs at fixed intervals, constructs TDA Mapper representations for these snapshots, and then uses these topological features along with snapshot graph features for sequential modeling to predict future graph properties. The paper claims superior performance over existing models in predicting network growth on several datasets, including new cryptocurrency network datasets.

### Strengths
1. The paper pioneers the integration of TDA into the study of temporal graphs, which represents a significant methodological advancement, potentially unlocking new insights into graph structure and evolution over time.

2. The paper is commended for its clear presentation style and the provision of solid supporting materials, which aid in the understanding and reproducibility of the proposed approach. The introduction of TDA Mapper method and the examples given are very helpful for audiences who do not have prior knowledges on TDA.

3. The proposed algorithm's simplicity and ease of implementation make it accessible for broad application across various temporal graph analysis tasks, facilitating its adoption in practice.

### Weaknesses
1. Focusing solely on the growth rate as a graph property is a limitation; the model's adaptability to other graph properties remains unexplored, which could be a significant aspect to consider for comprehensive temporal graph analysis.

2. The omission of key recent models like PINT[1] and ROLAND[2] from the baseline comparisons limits the evaluation's depth, potentially skewing the perception of the proposed model's performance. Specifically, the absence of comparisons with models designed for continuous-time dynamic graphs and those that leverage static GNNs in a dynamic setting raises concerns about the completeness of the benchmark.

3. The introduction of the Newtonian phase space model is an interesting conceptual proposition but remains unexploited in the actual modeling and theoretical justification, which can be seen as a disconnect between the proposed concepts and their practical implementation. The paper does not provide a clear explanation of how the Newtonian framework directly influences the model's architecture or training process, making its relevance unclear beyond a conceptual analogy.

### Questions
1) How does the algorithm perform on other prediction task in addition to the growth rate prediction. Possible metrics include temporal global efficiency, temporal-correlation coefficient, temporal betweenness centrality  and more. [1]
2) What role does the Newtonian dynamics play in the proposed algorithm?

### Summary
This paper studies the problem of temporal graph learning. The main contribution is GraphPulse, which combines structural and topological insights to predict graph properties. Experiments on ER graphs and SBM graphs demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method.

### Strengths
S1. The problem is well motivated by the need of tracking evolving graphs.

S2. It’s novel to incorporate the topological technical with dynamic graph represent learning. Using TDA Mapper to learn and predict graph trajectory is interesting.

### Weaknesses
W1. The authors use the set of nodes as the input point cloud of the Mapper network, aggregating the summation of incoming/outcoming edge weights and the counts of incoming/outcoming edges to conduct node features. However, there is a notable absence of retained graph structure information when compared to the original graph structure. In my opinion, the overall structure and the connections between nodes are more crucial and directly effective in the process of learning dynamic graphs. I would suggest the authors to incorporate the connection information into the model. Specifically, the current approach loses the crucial adjacency information, which is fundamental to graph analysis. The aggregated node features, while capturing some aspects of node activity, fail to represent the relationships between nodes, which are essential for understanding graph evolution. For instance, two nodes with similar aggregated features could have vastly different roles in the graph depending on their connections.

W2. The current assessment of the graph property focuses on determining whether there is a rise or decline in the number of edges, resulting in a fairly limited perspective. I would suggest the authors utilize more comprehensive graph properties to evaluate model capabilities on temporal graphs, such as changing node counts, density, diameter, degree distribution, and the number of triangles. Additionally, rather than binary classification, predicting the specific number of increased/decreased edges would test a finer-grained understanding of edge dynamics. The binary classification approach simplifies the problem and might not fully capture the nuances of temporal graph evolution. For example, a small increase in edges might be classified the same as a large increase, which limits the model's ability to distinguish between different levels of change.

### Questions
See W1-W2 for details.

===== After rebuttal =====
I would like to thank the authors for answering precisely and comprehensively to my concerns. The extent of work and the additional experiments presented during this period are noteworthy. These efforts have enhanced my understanding of the model's principles, leading me to a more favorable evaluation. Consequently, I have raised my score to 6.

### Summary
This paper introduces a new framework called GraphPulse for predicting the evolution of temporal graphs, combining topological data analysis and recurrent neural networks. One of the most important insights of this study is that the evolution of a graph can be represented as a temporal trajectory in a Newtonian phase space. This advances the understanding of the principle of graph evolution for this research community. The proposed GraphPulse is evaluated on financial and cryptocurrency transaction networks and compared to state-of-the-art methods, showing a significant performance improvement.

### Strengths
1. This paper identified that the evolution of a graph can be represented as a temporal trajectory in a Newtonian phase space and conducted comprehensive studies on it. Existing study [1] has pointed out that the evolution of a dynamic graph can be treated as a trajectory in a latent space without further studying what space it is and any properties the space should have. This study advances the understanding of the principle of graph evolution, which I believe is very valuable to this research community.

2. A novel temporal graph embedding framework is proposed, which is highly effective at capturing the evolution of temporal graphs in the phase space. The proposed GraphPulse is technically sound.
3. GraphPulse demonstrates significant performance improvement compared to state-of-the-art dynamic graph neural networks.
4. The authors create cryptoasset networks for the temporal graph property task and publish them as temporal benchmark datasets for future research.

### Weaknesses
1. It is unclear how hyperparameters sensitive the model is.
2. Since GraphPulse is a generic framework applicable to extend the embedding algorithms to embed a temporal graph, the generalizability of GraphPulse should be discussed and tested. It is suggested to replace Mapper with two or more static graph embedding techniques to test the impact on GraphPulse.
3. There are some typos. For example, in page 18, there are two different “neighborhood” styles of writing.

### Questions
Is the GraphPulse applicable in link prediction, edge sign prediction in signed networks, edge/node attribute prediction? Compared to the embedding algorithms that are customized for those particular graph mining applications, what are the advantage of the proposed GraphPulse? It would be better to discuss the application conditions of GraphPulse so that the audience knows under what application conditions GraphPulse will get better performance.

### Summary
The paper proposes an approach (GraphPulse) for learning on Discrete Time Dynamic Graphs (DTDGs). GraphPulse relies on the mapper method (a Topological Data Analysis technique used to compress high dimensional data in a small and comprehensible graphical representation) to extract latent topological properties of each graph snapshot. More in detail, provided a sequence of graphs (G_1, G_2, …, G_N), for each graph G_i, the authors extract a finite set of “snapshot” features describing the general properties of G_i (i.e. the
number of nodes, the number of edges, and the average value of edge weights). They then proceed at computing for G_i a compact graphical representation using the mapper method, and from the obtained graph they extract 5 new “mapper” features (the number of nodes, the number of edges, the maximum cluster size, the average cluster size, and the average value of edge weights). The snapshot and mapper features of each graph are then fed in input to a sequential model (LSTM+GRU), which outputs a prediction for the sequence of graphs. To evaluate their method, the authors defined a network growth problem where they aim at predicting whether a given network in a future interval will show more edges than in the past or not.

### Strengths
The paper illustrates an interesting application of a Topological Data Analysis technique for constructing a model able to tackle prediction tasks on DTDGs. While the approach is not quite straightforward to explain due to the multiple steps that are involved, the paper is generally clear (see although some weaknesses on this below). Experimental evaluation on a variety of datasets show good performance of the method for the considered task.

### Weaknesses
While I found the manuscript rather interesting and generally well presented, in some parts I had some difficulties completely understanding the paper. For instance, in Section 3, the clustering method is not really introduced in the mapper method and I found it difficult at first to understand the role that this would have in the overall approach. Similarly, in the experimental section I did not find details on what clustering algorithm or lens function the authors used for computing the Mapper Network (edge weights for the mapper network and mapper hyperparameters in Section 6 are also not defined in the paper). I would greatly appreciate it if the authors could provide some details in their rebuttal on this to clarify my understanding of their paper (and in general improve readability).

For what concerns the experimental evaluation, the results look promising, however I wonder if using a GIN as a static GNN baseline might not be fair. The goal of the model is to predict whether in a future window of time there will be more edges in the graph than in the past. As such, being able to understand whether the network is growing in size (or not) over time seems a priori a meaningful feature for the model. This information can however not be captured with a GIN, as the only features this has access to are: Outgoing EdgeWeight Sum, Incoming EdgeWeight Sum, Outgoing Edge Count, and Incoming Edge Count; which do not describe such evolution. For this reason I wonder if decorating edge features with the timestamp associated to the time when an edge appears and using an architecture able to compute graph embeddings based on edge features (e.g. a MPNN) could be a better baseline for the given prediction task.

### Questions
I found it interesting that the authors handcrafted a feature descriptor for both a snapshot and the mapper network. While reading the paper I was expecting to see a GNN for extrapolating graph-wise features that would have then been used in input to the recurrent model. This would have provided (ignoring the construction of the mapper network with a fixed lens function) an end-to-end learnable approach that would have indeed suited a generic classification problem. I wonder if the authors have experimented with such a solution in their experiments and whether this could provide a further boost in performance.
