## Abstract
Automatic Sign Language Translation requires the integration of both computer vision and natural language processing to effectively bridge the communication gap between sign and spoken languages. However, the deficiency in large-scale training data to support sign language translation means we need to leverage resources from spoken language. We introduce, Sign2GPT, a novel framework for sign language translation that utilizes large-scale pretrained vision and language models via lightweight adapters for gloss-free sign language translation. The lightweight adapters are crucial for sign language translation, due to the constraints imposed by limited dataset sizes and the computational requirements when training with long sign videos.
We also propose a novel pretraining strategy that directs our encoder to learn sign representations from automatically extracted pseudo-glosses without requiring gloss order information or annotations.
We evaluate our approach on two public benchmark sign language translation datasets, namely RWTH-PHOENIX-Weather 2014T and CSL-Daily, and improve on state-of-the-art gloss-free translation performance with a significant margin.

### Summary
This paper aims to leverage the large-scale pretrained vision and language models via lightweight adapters for gloss-free sign language translation. Besides, it also proposes a pretraining strategy which make the framework aware of important text information. The experiments are conducted on two benchmarks to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

### Strengths
Leveraging large-scale pretrained model for SLT is sound.

The paper is well-written and well-organized.

The overall performance seems promising.

### Weaknesses
The introduction part seems inconsistent with the title. The introduction mentions the both large-scale vision and language model, while the title only mentions the language one. What do the authors want to emphasize?

The pseudo-gloss pretraining technique shares the similar core idea with CSGCR. The authors should discuss the difference.

Utilization of pretrained model is not new. The author should cite the following work and discuss the difference with it.
Chen Y, Wei F, Sun X, et al. A simple multi-modality transfer learning baseline for sign language translation[C]//Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition. 2022: 5120-5130.

What are the performance gains derived from the utilization of large-scale vision and language models? The ablation part should demonstrate it.

### Summary
The paper proposes an automatic sign language translation based on large language models. 
The amount of training data for sign language is limited, but the authors present an idea to leverage the large-scale resources from spoken language. 
The proposed framework utilises large-scale vision and language models with lightweight adapters. 
In particular, the method leverages a fronzen GPT model for translation.
The method is gloss-free, so that large-scale data can be used without gloss-level annotations for supervised learning. 
Instead, the authors propose a novel encoder pretraining strategy based on pseudo-gloss that can be extracted from natural language sentences. 
The authors experiment on the popular PHOENIX and CSL-Daily datasets, on which they demonstrate state-of-the-art performance compared to all baselines.

### Strengths
- The use of LLM for sign language recognition is novel and effective.
- The gloss-free framework using pseudo-gloss mitigates the challenging supervision problem in sign language recognition.
- The results are state-of-the-art, and the ablations in Tables 2 and 3 show that the proposed pre-training helps to improve performance.
- The writing is generally clear.

### Weaknesses
 - The method is mostly based on existing models such as GPT, Dino-V2 and LoRA, so there is not much novelty from the architectural standpoint.
- There is no ablations to demonstrate if the choice to use parts-of-speech tagging effective. How does it compare to using the words as tokens? Can the downstream translation learn to generate meaningful words that are missing in the parts-of-speech tagging?

### Summary
This paper aims to improve gloss-free sign language translation by exploring pretrained vison and language models, i.e., ViT and GPT models. The authors use pretrained ViT models to extract spatial features from sign frames and use pretrained GPT models to perform the translation. They design a sign encoder and a zero-gated cross-attention module to bridge these two models and pretrain the encoder with a pseudo-gloss pretraining strategy. On Phoenix14T and CSL-Daily, this method achieves new SOTA in the gloss-free setting.

### Strengths
1) Introducing a simple method leveraging pretrained vision and language models to improve SLT: SOTA performance
2) Proposing a pretraining strategy based on pseudo glosses that induce meaningful sign representations

### Weaknesses
1) While achieving good performance, the pretrained models are significantly larger than previous approaches, raising concerns about fair comparison and what helps translation. Relevant ablation is missing. Specifically, the use of a 1.7B parameter XGLM model compared to the 600M parameter MBart in GFSLT-VLP makes it difficult to isolate the impact of the proposed method from the sheer scale of the language model. The ablation should explore the performance with different sizes of GPT models to understand the contribution of the proposed method.
2) Analysis regarding the sign encoder and pseudo-gloss pretraining is insufficient. The role of the sign encoder in capturing temporal dependencies is not thoroughly investigated. The analysis of pseudo-gloss pretraining is limited to visual inspection, lacking quantitative metrics such as top-N prediction accuracy and recall, which are crucial for evaluating the quality of the generated pseudo-glosses.
3) The used SLT benchmarks are somehow artificial albeit popular. The limited vocabulary and data size of Phoenix14T and CSL-Daily raise concerns about the generalizability of the proposed method to more realistic scenarios.
4) Some details are confusing. Specifically, the description of V and K in Eq (1) is unclear, as both should originate from sign features rather than one from textual features.

### Questions
1) It's great that the proposed method outperforms GFSLT-VLP. However, GFSLT-VLP is based on MBart with ~600M parameters, and this study adopts XGLM with ~1.7B parameters, making the fairness of the comparison questionable. It's unclear whether the improvements are really from the proposed modeling and pretraining strategy. Could you please add further ablations regarding the size of GPT models? 
2) The sign encoder and pseudo-gloss pretraining take a crucial role in the proposed method, but analysis and ablation regarding them are insufficient. 
  - Do we need the sign encoder? What if dropping it? 
  - Apart from the visual analysis, what about the top-N prediction accuracy and recall?
3) Please also add gloss-based SOTA systems in Tables 2 and 3 so that readers can understand the gap.
4) In Eq (1), you mentioned that V represents keys from textual features while K originates from sign features. Shouldn't they both come from sign features?
5) How did you set the rank in LoRA?
6) While Phoenix14T and CSL-Daily are popular, they are less significant due to limited vocabulary and data size. Please consider adding results for DGS3-T (Zhang et al., 2023).


After Response:

Thanks for the new results which address part of my concerns. I increased my score for this. Still, I believe the study of gloss-free approach should be performed on more realistic datasets, such as DGS3-T and WMT-SLT.

### Summary
The paper propose Sign2GPT, which enjoys the benefit of large pretrained language model to promote gloss-free sign language translation. The authors also propose a CLIP-styple pseudo-gloss pretraining technique to better learn visual-lingusitic representations. The overall method achieves SOTA performance on two widely adopted benchmarks, Phoenix-2014T and CSL-Daily.

### Strengths
1. The idea is sound. It is good to see that current large language model can be helpful for sign language understanding.
2. The proposed pseudo-gloss pretraining is novel, which can inspire future works.
3. SOTA gloss-free sign language translation performance on two benchmarks.

### Weaknesses
1. Using pretrained language model to boost sign language translation (SLT) is not surprisingly novel. Several works [1,2] have already verified that pretrained language model can boost (gloss-free) SLT.

2. The name of pseudo-gloss pretraining is a bit confusing, although the method itself is sound. Because the pseudo-glosses are in spoken language order, it is not quite appropriate to call them "glosses".

3. The notations of "P", "F", "D" in Table 2 and 3 are also confusing. For example, D denotes without pretraining and P denotes pretraining, then what does "P+D" mean? I suggest authors adding a "check mark" column to show which parts are pretrained.

4. I cannot find an ablation study on the pseudo-gloss pretraining. What is the performance if removing it?

5. In Table 4, removing sinusoidal positional encoding leads to the best performance. Then what poistional encoding is used by default?

6. The paper uses a new spatial backbone which is under-explored in previous sign language papers. The authors need to better motivate it. For example, is it better than other vision transformers, or is it better than widely adopted 2D/3D CNNs?

7. In figure 2, how to fuse the outputs of adapted masked attention (solid lines) and zero-gated cross attention (dashed lines)? Besides, what is adapted masked attention? I didn't see a clear definition of it.
