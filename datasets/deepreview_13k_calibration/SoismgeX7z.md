## Abstract
Modern distribution matching algorithms for training diffusion or flow models directly \emph{prescribe} the time evolution of the marginal distributions between two boundary distributions.
    In this work, we consider a generalized distribution matching setup, where these marginals are only \emph{implicitly} described as a solution to some task-specific objective function.
    The problem setup, known as the Generalized Schr{\"o}dinger Bridge (GSB),
    appears prevalently in many scientific areas both within and without machine learning.
    We propose \textbf{\GSBM{} (GSBM)}, a new matching algorithm inspired by recent advances,
    generalizing them beyond kinetic energy minimization and to account for task-specific state costs.
    We show that such a generalization can be cast as solving \emph{conditional} stochastic optimal control, for which efficient variational approximations can be used, and further debiased with the aid of path integral theory.
    Compared to prior methods for solving GSB problems, our GSBM algorithm better preserves a feasible transport map between the boundary distributions throughout training, thereby enabling stable convergence and significantly improved scalability.
    We empirically validate our claims on an extensive suite of experimental setups, including crowd navigation, opinion depolarization, LiDAR manifolds, and image domain transfer.
    Our work brings new algorithmic opportunities for training diffusion models enhanced with task-specific optimality structures

### Summary
The authors consider so-called generalised Schrödinger Bridge Matching problem: unlike standard SBM, which can be formulated as an optimisation problem of a drift of some diffusion, the corresponding optimisation problem in case of GSBM involved an additional state cost. The authors proposed an iterative algorithm to solve the problem. One of interesting tricks, proposed to increase computational efficiency of the solution, is a spline-based  approximation. The authors verified the algorithm for GSBM problem on a number of toy and practical tasks.

### Strengths
- the authors consider an import problem statement, which is a very natural generalisation of the SBM problem

- the proposed approach is theoretically sound

- the authors test their approach on a diverse set of problems

- the text is easy to follow

### Weaknesses
 - the authors did not investigate computational limits of the proposed approach 

- it seems that the proposed approach does not work in case of image data, only if we consider some latent space like in sec. 4.2. Any ideas how we can improve here?

### Questions
- how do computational efficiency and accuracy scale w.r.t. dimensionality? sample size?

- how do specific strategies for placement of spline control points influence accuracy (see sec. 3.2)?

- Gaussian path approximation in (7) looks like a strong assumption. It is not clear from theorem 5 whether it is always possible to decrease L in case we base our computational algorithm on such assumption. Are there any other assumptions such that we can get closed form expressions like (8)?

### Summary
This paper focuses on the problem of controlled measure transport. Given a time dependent density $p_t(x)$, how do you adapt $p_t(x)$ with respect to some potential function $V_t(x)$ so that it arrives at a target density $p_{T}(x)$ and does so in some measure of least cost (or as they refer to it, energy). 

They rely on recent distribution matching algorithms to do this, writing the discovery of some vector field $s_t(x)$ and the least cost set of $p_t(x)$ that correspond in Fokker-Planck sense to this $s_t(x)$ as the solution to two constrained minimization problems. 

The reviewer interprets the "generalized" in the title to refer to the fact that the paper moves away from the notion of just connecting two densities, but also opens the avenue for doing this e.g. with obstacles (a la optimal control problems). 

They demonstrate their method e.g. on toy blockade examples and with the effects of stochasticity on the energy minimization, as well on image-to-image translation examples and a cool LiDAR surface example.

### Strengths
The authors exposit their work quite well (with adjustments needed mentioned in the weaknesses and questions section). The experimental section is thorough and highlights the myriad applications of the perspectives presented in the paper. With the proper contextualization, the method presented is interesting and falls in line well with a series of other related works, highlighting the benefits of controllable paths (for the limited set of potentials the consider).

### Weaknesses
While the experiments are cool and thorough, and while the framing of the optimization problem is coherent, the paper diminishes itself by its framing. *This is an addressable issue* and the reviewer thinks it can be straightforwardly, especially during a rebuttal period, as it's not an experimental thing. The framing issue is that it oversells itself in a way that misleads the reader.

I think a good principle of academia (that we can all reasonably agree with) is to only assert what we can reasonably back-up and to not mislead. This paper does not provide a numerical solution to optimal transport or the schrodinger bridge. In the introduction, it casts OT and Schrodinger Bridge as edge-cases of their variational problem. *However, they do not provide an actual solution to that variational problem*. The statement of this problem has been well known. The **application** of it in the context of generative modeling and dynamical systems is compelling (even if approximate! you don't need to solve OT/SB to do cool control!) but it does not need to be couched as if it is solving those problems. It is still compelling to say "we came up with an approximate way to do stochastic optimal control in the context of deep generative modeling" without saying "we have provided a variational method for solving optimal transport and SB."

The issue is that the constraint (6b) is actually quite hard to enforce. The Gaussian approximation is fine. But the authors should really be careful in stating what it is they are doing and how it relates to the problem they are seeking to solve, because gaussian paths are not going to do it. The paper that this one primarily cites (Flow Matching for Generative Modeling) seems to do this too -- in which it specifies an "optimal transport path" that isn't actually providing a means to solve OT.

The reason the reviewer stresses this point is two-fold: the first is that mathematicians have spent many years carefully characterizing the hardness of these problems and approximate solutions without overstating them. The second is that doing this induces confusion to new readers who come into the field. This is a damaging effect, it muddles points and slows down new members, and one the reviewer has already had to deal with from students misinterpreting the claims of OT in these types of papers.

This can be addressed by simply toning down some of claims, and including these caveats, e.g. in the bullet points on page two summarizing the papers contributions.

**References**

There are some necessary adjustments to the citations needed, but that can be cleared up. Here are some things that should be addressed:

- At the beginning of section 3.1: Neither [Liu 2023b] nor [Peluchetti 2022] propose any sort of entropic optimal transport. Perhaps there was a typo in the citep. While Liu 2023b proposes a procedure for OT (when the iterating field is a gradient field), nothing about it is entropic.
- There seems to be some missing citations with regards to the matching algorithms. On page one following the line "a mixture of tractable conditional probability paths (Ho, Song, Lipman)" should include [1,2,3] listed below. These should likewise be included Bridge and Flow matching (explicit) section. There is also related follow-up work by Tong et al listed as [4]
- The Schrodinger Bridge problem in the introduction should not be attributed to the machine learners. It's been studied for decades. The original citation is provided in [5], and a follow-up is provided in [6].


**Other adjustments**
- The discussion about feasibility seems not so useful. The statement of the problem the paper wants to solve is that the solution is feasible (it's chicken-egg). That's the point of a constraint in an optimization problem. If the one paper the authors want to compare this work to (the Generalized Schrodinger Bridge one) fails to meet this, it doesn't seem worth taking the reader down that line when the problem statement assumes it. Table 1 could be in an appendix :)
- There are some minor things throughout the text to adjust, which are semantically inexact. For example: in the line in the "Implicit action matching" paragraph:  "...then the unique gradient field $\nabla s^\theta_t(X_t)$ that matches $p_t$ can be obtained by minimizing...". The noun comparison is wrong here. $\nabla s^\theta_t(Xt)$ does not match a probability density. The learning problem is to find the $\nabla s^\theta_t(X_t)$ for which the probability density *of the pushforward* from the initial density $p_0$ to $\tilde p_t$ by this $s_t^\theta$ matches $p_t$. Densities match densities.
- The authors should adjust the first paragraph of the second page to highlight that optimal transport as a field does consider a wide variety of other costs besides the $\mathcal W-2$ cost. There are e.g. repulsive costs, e.g. in the study of quantum dynamics, etc. The notion of optimality still holds.
- Lastly, are the authors sure that a reasonably different coupling $p(x_0, x_1)$ emerges at the minimizer? Neither set of experiments seems to suggest this. While it is true in the image-to-image translation, that the intermediate density $p_t(x)$ has a more semantically meaningful translation, the marginal endpoints (the $x_0$ associated with $x_1$) for both algorithms look pretty much identical. Moreover, Figure 1 highlights an equivalent picture. The initial and final empirical densities (light green and dark green) are identical even after learning.


**The reviewer is more than happy to improve their score if the framing, citations, and "other adjustments"**. As of now I would ideally mark this as a 4/10 and not a 5/10, but that isn't an option any more it seems.

### Questions
- A comment rather than a question: For an exciting read on the problem, the authors should see [6] , it's quite fun.
- Can the authors come up with a problem for which conditional density is actually far from Gaussian, or show that any of their examples currently are far from Gaussian? 
- Can the authors try to quantify the "semantically meaningful" coupling?

### Confidence
2: You are willing to defend your assessment, but it is quite likely that you did not understand the central parts of the submission or that you are unfamiliar with some pieces of related work. Math/other details were not carefully checked.

### Summary
The paper considers a novel method for the generalized Schrodinger bridge method, which allows for incorporation of a control cost into the interpolation. Their method works by alternating between optimizing the drift and the marginals, with the second done via a tie to conditional stochastic optimal control. In this second step, the optimal probability path between two fixed endpoint marginal samples is approximated with a Gaussian spline (splines separately for the time-varying means and standard deviations). The method is tested and compared primarily against DeepGSB in crowd navigation, image interpolation, and opinion depolarization.

### Strengths
The paper presents a method which improves upon previous methods by ensuring guaranteed feasibility and stronger performance in high dimension. The method also seems to clearly outperform comparable methods in the various application settings.

### Weaknesses
* The convergence guarantees obtained are merely local, and do not guarantee convergence to a global optimum. 
* As noted in the conclusion, the method requires a differentiable state cost.

### Questions
In relation to the first item above: 
1. Can you prove convergence to a global optimum for a particular class of state cost V?
2. If not, do you have any commentary on other strategies for initialization of the spline optimization?

### Summary
This paper propose Generalized Schrodinger Bridge Matching (GSBM) that can be view as solving conditional stochastic optimal control, for which efficient variational approximations can be used, and further debiased with the aid of path integral theory.  Compared to other methods for solving GSB problems, GSBM algorithm preserves a feasible transport map between the boundary distributions throughout training, thereby enabling stable convergence and significantly improved scalability.

### Strengths
The paper has rigorous logic, clear expression and abundant experimental details. This work broadens the scope of application of Schrodinger bridge matching (SBM) algorithm and converts the existing optimal transport mapping and SBM methods into the special case of variational formulas. In addition, the feasibility conditions are met at any time during the entire training process, which is a big difference from the previous methods. Overall, this work opens up new algorithmic opportunities for training diffusion models with task-specific optimal structures.

### Weaknesses
The Generalized Schodinger Bridge Matching (GSBM) proposed in this paper is not applicable to any form of V_{t}, but requires the differentiability of V_{t} and relies on quadratic control costs to establish its convergence analysis. Although it is a significant improvement over previous GSB solvers, the Generalized Schodinger Bridge Matching (GSBM) method is not applicable to any form of V_{t}. But differentiability is still a necessary condition. Furthermore, the reliance on quadratic control costs for convergence analysis limits the scope of the theoretical results, potentially excluding scenarios with more complex control cost structures. The paper does not fully explore the implications of this restriction on the practical applicability of the method, particularly in cases where non-quadratic costs might be more appropriate or arise naturally from the problem formulation. The differentiability requirement of V_t, while allowing for efficient gradient-based solvers, may also restrict the types of state costs that can be used, potentially excluding cases where V_t is non-smooth or discontinuous, which could be relevant in certain applications.

### Questions
Does (6) have an analytic solution only if V_{t} is quadratic and \sigma>0?
