## Abstract
One of the key challenges in deep neural network training is the substantial amount of GPU memory required to store activations obtained in the forward pass. Various Activation-Compressed Training (ACT) schemes have been proposed to mitigate this issue; however, it is challenging to adopt those approaches in recent transformer-based large language models (LLMs), which experience significant performance drops when the activations are deeply compressed during training. In this paper, we introduce ALAM, a novel ACT framework that utilizes average quantization and a lightweight sensitivity calculation scheme, enabling large memory saving in LLMs while maintaining training performance. We first demonstrate that compressing activations into their group average values minimizes the gradient variance. Employing this property, we propose Average Quantization which provides high-quality deeply compressed activations with an effective precision of less than 1 bit and improved flexibility of precision allocation. In addition, we present a cost-effective yet accurate sensitivity calculation algorithm that solely relies on the L2 norm of parameter gradients, substantially reducing memory overhead due to sensitivity calculation. In experiments, the ALAM framework significantly reduces activation memory without compromising accuracy, achieving up to a 10$\times$ compression rate in LLMs.

### Summary
This work focuses on the challenge of high GPU memory consumption for storing activation for deep neural network training, especially for large language models (LLMs). Existing activation-compressed training (ACT) approaches introduce significant performance drops when applied to LLMs. This paper proposes a new ACT framework, ALAM, that applies average quantization and a lightweight sensitivity calculation scheme to enable substantial memory savings for LLM training while maintaining training performance. The experiments show that the ALAM framework can support up to a 12.5x compression rate with 1-bit quantization without compromising accuracy.

### Strengths
+ The paper is well-written and easy to follow.
+ The proposed average quantization in ACT is simple but effective.
+ The proposed GradNormVar algorithm significantly reduces the memory requirement for storing the gradients during the sensitivity evaluation.
+ The evaluation results cover both the classical model BERT and the latest model LLaMa in terms of large language model training/finetuning. The results of fine-tuning LLaMa-2 with 2-bit and even 1-bit ALAM are promising.

### Weaknesses
 - It would be better to add QLoRA as a baseline for evaluation.
- It is unclear how the proposed ALAM performs on larger models, such as LLaMa-13B, LLaMa-30B, etc. It would be better to show the results on these larger models.

### Summary
This paper introduces ALAM, an ACT framework that applies average quantization and a novel sensitivity calculation method to reduce memory usage while preserving the performance of LLMs. By compressing activations to their group averages, ALAM minimizes the impact on gradient variance, enabling deep compression with an effective precision of less than 1 bit. ALAM’s sensitivity calculation is based on the L2 norm of parameter gradients, which is a memory-efficient approach. The paper's experiments show that ALAM can achieve up to 12.5× activation memory compression in LLMs without sacrificing accuracy. This method represents a significant advancement in making the training of large neural networks more memory-efficient.

### Strengths
1. The quantization method based on group average value is very easy to understand and very practical, given the experimental demonstration and equation proof in the paper.
2. The training overhead is acceptable, since the efficient sensitivity calculation method is proposed, and the training time is comparable with the baseline.
3. The evaluation result is very promising and the improvement compared with GACT (SOTA work based on activation compression) is very significant.

### Weaknesses
1. The evaluation part is not sufficient. This paper only compares the result with GACT, which is based on activation compression. However, for model compression, other techniques like pruning and low-rank compression are widely used. The lack of comparison with these methods makes it difficult to assess the true novelty and effectiveness of ALAM in the broader context of model compression. Specifically, it is unclear how ALAM's memory savings and accuracy trade-offs compare to methods like low-rank factorization or structured pruning, which can also significantly reduce the memory footprint of large models.
2. How to choose the parameter group is unclear. Is this parameter related to the sensitivity? What if the adjacent activations have little similarity? The paper does not provide a clear rationale for the grouping strategy, and it is not apparent how the group size affects the compression performance. The method of simply flattening and grouping adjacent activations may not be optimal, especially if those activations represent semantically distinct features. This raises concerns about potential information loss and the robustness of the method across different network architectures and tasks.

### Questions
1. It would be better to provide the evaluation result with other compression techniques.
2. In Table 1, there is an accuracy drop from 98.72 to 96.09 in a small model. However, in the evaluation result, the compressed model retains the accuracy performance. Can you identify the reason for this? This is because the large model has more redundancy or other reasons?

5: You are absolutely certain about your assessment. You are very familiar with the related work and checked the math/other details carefully.

### Summary
This paper proposes a method for reducing the memory usage of activations during the training of large-scale models. The techniques extend well-established methods like GACT, further improving the activation compression rate by introducing group-wise quantization. The methods are evaluated on popular transformer models such as BERT and LLaMa, demonstrating enhanced compression rate while preserving baseline accuracy.

### Strengths
1). The paper is well-written. 

2). The compression rates have been improved compared with previous methods.

### Weaknesses
The primary concern is the lack of novelty. The method relies heavily on existing frameworks, such as GACT and ActNN, using the same concept of quantization for activation compression. Additionally, the proposed quantization method is also a well-known clustering approach. The theoretical analysis, suggesting the minimization of quantization MSE (as shown in quation 6) appears rather straightforward. While the authors did introduce some tricks, such as gradient normalization variance, to improve the existing framework, the overall technical contribution seems to be relatively modest.

### Questions
Could the authors explain the overhead involved in doing the group-wise quantization?
