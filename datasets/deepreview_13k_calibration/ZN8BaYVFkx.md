## Abstract
Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) have attracted much attention for their energy-efficient operations and biologically inspired structures, offering potential advantages over Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) in terms of interpretability and energy efficiency. However, similar to ANNs, the robustness of SNNs remains a challenge, especially when facing adversarial attacks. Existing techniques, whether adapted from ANNs or specifically designed for SNNs, have shown limitations in traing SNNs or defending against strong attacks.
In this paper, we present a novel approach to enhance the robustness of SNNs through gradient sparsity regularization. We observe that SNNs exhibit greater resilience to random perturbations compared to adversarial perturbations, even at larger scales. Motivated by this finding, we aim to minimize the gap between SNNs under adversarial and random perturbations, thereby improving their overall robustness. 
To achieve this, we theoretically prove that this performance gap is upper bounded by the gradient sparsity of the output probability after the softmax layer with respect to the input image, laying the groundwork for a practical strategy to train robust SNNs by regularizing the gradient sparsity. 
The effectiveness of our approach is validated through extensive experiments conducted on the CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets. The results demonstrate enhancements in the robustness of SNNs.
Overall, our work contributes to the understanding and improvement of SNN robustness, highlighting the importance of considering gradient sparsity in SNNs.

### Summary
This paper studies the adversarial robustness of spiking neural networks. First, the authors observe that SNNs exhibit robustness against random perturbations, but display vulnerability to small-scale adversarial perturbations. After that, the authors derive some theoretical results on the bounds of the gap between the robustness of SNNs under these two kinds of perturbations, and show that it is upper bounded by the sparsity of gradients of the output probability with respect to the input image. Motivated by such observations and theoretical bounds, the authors propose an algorithm to add the gradient sparsity regularization term to the loss function during SNN training to narrow the gap between these two kinds of perturbations. Various experimental results on the CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets show that the proposed algorithm enhances the robustness of SNNs.

### Strengths
Originality: The related works are adequately cited. The main results in this paper will certainly help us have a better understanding of the adversarial robustness of spiking neural networks. I have checked the technique parts and found that the proofs are solid. Some strengths of this paper are listed below:
1. The authors provide several useful observations and theoretical bounds on the robustness against random perturbations and small-scale adversarial perturbations, and derive the upper bound of the gap between the robustness of SNNs under these two kinds of perturbations.

2. Based on the observations and theoretical bounds, the authors proposed a novel loss function involving the gradient sparsity regularization term, which could improve the robustness of SNNs.  

3. Various results verify the effectiveness of their proposed algorithms.

Quality: This paper is technically sound.

Clarity: This paper is well written. I find it is easy to follow.

Significance: I think the results and the proposed algorithm in this paper are significant, as explained above.

### Weaknesses
1. The paper conducts the experiments on the CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets. Is it possible to conduct the experiments on more large-scale datasets, such as ImageNet or ImageNet-Tiny datasets? 

2. It requires some assumptions for Theorem 1 to be true, such as the function $f$ should be differentiable, and $\epsilon$ should be small enough, could you add these assumptions to Theorem 1?
   
Some other minor questions:
1. Line 4 in Proposition 1, Page 6,  The proof is provides -->  The proof is provided.
2. The last line in (17), Page 15,  $\epsilon$ -->  $\epsilon^2$.

### Summary
This paper proposes a framework to improve the robustness of an SNN model. They first identify the SNN robustness under random attack and adversarial attack. Then, they add a regularization term in loss to make the SNN model more robust under adversarial attack.

### Strengths
1.	This work analyzed the SNN robustness under random attack and adversarial attack, which provides very meaningful observations.
2.	The proposed idea is interesting that tries to shrink the gap between two attacks.
3.	Detailed experiments are presented to demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed method.

### Weaknesses
The specialization of the regularization term is not highlighted, see common for details.

### Questions
1.	In Formula 10, I think the left part tries to compute the gradient of input, however, the right parts compute the gradient of last layer.
2.	I think adding regularization in loss to improve the robustness is a widely used method. It is better to highlight the specialization, i.e. whether ANN can adopt this technique?
3.	Whether the proposed method will affect the robustness under random attack?

### Summary
This paper focuses on the problem of improving adversarial robustness of SNNs. Authors propose an input gradient sparsity promoting regularization scheme for training robust SNNs. An l0-norm penalty term on the input gradient is approximated via a sparsity-promoting l1-norm penalty, which is then again approximated with a softmax output regularization term using the finite differences method. Proposed approach is then combined with a traditional adversarial training method for SNNs, and empirically showcased on CIFAR-10/100.

### Strengths
- Theoretical justification on why this method could be applicable for robustness is presented nicely.
- Writing is clear and the storyline is presented well.

### Weaknesses
 - Robustness evaluations of the SNNs are ambiguous in a weak way, and need much more rigor & depth.
- Limited innovation and justification from the ML security methodology aspect, as well as the practical side.

 - Proposed approach has several simplifications/assumptions on the ultimate gradient l0-norm regularization idea. At the end, the used training algorithm seems to become also similar to the well-known (clean) logit pairing approach [Kannan, Kurakin & Goodfellow, 2018]. At the very least, the objective simply uses adversarial examples for an output probability distribution regularizer, which has been the most fundamental form of adversarial training to date (see e.g., [Zhang et al. ICML 2019]). Hence all in all, I can not clearly see any innovation from the ML security side in this paper. Can the authors experimentally compare why their choice would be particularly any better in the case of SNNs, than using one of the other powerful adversarial training/regularization methods (e.g., TRADES [Zhang et al. ICML 2019] or adversarial logit pairing [Kannan, Kurakin & Goodfellow, 2018])?

 - Authors claim to use an "ensemble attack" for white-box evaluations, which requires further clarification. Their implementation of an ensemble "conducts multiple attacks on each sample and reports the strongest attack". Can the authors provide an exemplary outlined test set case more clearly on how these evaluations are reported?

 - For this attack ensemble to be meaningful and reveal any impact of gradient obfuscation, there should actually be cases where the surrogate gradient function is changing its width, rather than only its shape for fixed parameters. The width parameter $\gamma=1$ of the triangular surrogate should be accounted for. Authors should run an extensive evaluation with for instance $\gamma\in[0.1,3.0]$ in fine-grained steps of 0.1, and demonstrate that changing this parameter does not at all influence the capability of the adversary any better than using different surrogate gradient shapes. This part overall needs strong empirical justification.

 - Models were trained using PGD-5 adversarial examples, but the Algorithm 1 denotes adv. examples obtained via one-step FGSM. Which one is correct? Does this mean that PGD-5 is the general AT approach adopted in SR* models, but in any case the regularizer term was always obtained via FGSM? Needs clarification overall.

 - Following my question above, Table 2 is a bit complicated in how SR and AT can be disentangled. In the case of ablation models without AT but SR, how were the adv. examples to compute the regularization term, obtained? None of these details are clear in the paper.

 - Proof of Thm 1 in Appendix A seems agnostic to any function f, regardless of being an SNN. However, it appears to implicitly make the assumption that the SNN uses direct input coding. Can the authors comment if these assumptions would also hold for SNNs that use Poisson input coding, or SNNs that do not necessarily use IF neurons (i.e.., with membrane potential leak)? Wouldn't then the error that should be accounted for in the finite differences approximation would be large? Did the authors experiment with other types of more realistic SNNs at all?

 - Did the authors perform any simulations on dynamic vision sensor data where SNNs are designed to be more beneficial for?

 - Since PGD-5 is used via BPTT during training for 200 epochs, than the authors should outline a table with the computational overhead (wall-clock time) of their approach, in comparison to simple AT or RAT with PGD-5 as well.

 - Figure 3 should also include adversarially trained models in comparison (not only Vanilla), since such SNNs are already implicitly inducing a similar behavior.

 Minor comment: Eq (3) & (4) are already defined as solutions of an adversarial example in the l_infty norm (since the sign function is used). Therefore at the end of Sec 3.2, authors should correct the "l_p norm", since p is already infty in this setting.

### Questions
1) Can the authors clearly state/elaborate in their paper, in which ways their training algorithm is different than the work by [Finlay & Oberman 2019]? https://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.11468.pdf

### Summary
This paper investigates the robustness of SNNs against adversarial perturbations. An initial robustness analysis reveals that SNNs are robust against random perturbations, but vulnerable against adversarial attacks. The proposed method incorporates the gradient sparsity regularization in the loss function to reduce the gap between the SNN robustness against random noise and adversarial perturbations. The experiments of the proposed method conducted on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 dataset reveal higher SNN robustness compared to the traditional approach.
