## Abstract
Robust optimization provides a mathematical framework for modeling and solving decision-making problems under worst-case uncertainty.  This work addresses two-stage robust optimization (2RO) problems (also called *adjustable robust optimization*), wherein first-stage and second-stage decisions are made before and after uncertainty is realized, respectively.  This results in a nested min-max-min optimization problem which is extremely challenging computationally, especially when the decisions are discrete.  We propose Neur2RO, an efficient machine learning-driven instantiation of column-and-constraint generation (CCG), a classical iterative algorithm for 2RO.  Specifically, we learn to estimate the value function of the second-stage problem via a novel neural network architecture that is easy to optimize over by design. Embedding our neural network into CCG yields high-quality solutions quickly as evidenced by experiments on two 2RO benchmarks, knapsack and capital budgeting. For knapsack, Neur2RO finds solutions that are within roughly $2$% of the best-known values in a few seconds compared to the three hours of the state-of-the-art exact branch-and-price algorithm; for larger and more complex instances, Neur2RO finds even better solutions. For capital budgeting, Neur2RO outperforms three variants of the $k$-adaptability algorithm, particularly on the largest instances, with a $10$ to $100$-fold reduction in solution time.

### Summary
The authors study the problem of solving robust mixed integer programming problems using deep learning. As a main contribution, deep neural networks (DNN) are used as a building block to accelerate existing column and constraint generation algorithms. To be specific, the DNN model is first used to learn a mapping from input to the objective value of the stage-2 problem. Then, the trained DNN is embeded into the original robust optimization problem based on its mixed integer linear programming formulation. Simulations on over several cases are conducted to show the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

### questions:
 1. The contribution of the paper is not clear. In [R1], deep neural network (DNN) is used to solve the stochastic mixed integer programming problem. The key idea is to use DNN to learn the input to objective value mapping of the stage-2 problem. Then, the DNN model is embeded into the original stochastic programming problem as a mixed integer programming formulation. The idea of the paper is similar to that in [R1]. The authors are suggested to explain the key differecens the these two papers and show the contribution of the paper clearly. 

2. In paragraph 4 of Sec. 3.2, the authors mention "Prediction inaccuracy is then compensated for in equation 4a by exactly modeling the second-stage cost. As a result, when solving the MP, the true optimal first-stage decision for the selected scenario will be the minimizer, rather than a potentially suboptimal first-stage decision based on any inaccuracy of the learning model." This is not easy to follow. The authors are suggested to express it more clearly.

3. To accelerat the column and constraint genration algorithm using DNN, one straightforward approach is using DNN to predict the worst-scenario for the stage-2 problem and then add the obtained scenario to the main problem. The authors are suggested to explain why this straightforwrd design will not work. Otherwise, the authors are suggested to use this straightfoward design as a baseline approach to show the superiority of the proposed approach. 

4. The authors are suggested to use more real-world problem as the case study. For example, the robust unit commitment problem in power system operation.

5. The authors are suggested to analyze the impact of the DNN prediction errors to the performance (such as convergence and optimality gap) of the proposed approach.

### Summary
In this paper the authors combine machine learning and optimization to develop an algorithm to solve two stage robust optimization problems in a more efficient fashion. They do so by modifying the column and constraint generation algorithm for two stage RO problems. 

They train a Neural Network which predicts the optimal value of the second stage problem given the first stage decisions and the uncertainty realizations and incorporate the NN into the mathematical programming problems used to compute the initial decision and uncertainty realizations.
 
This allows for faster and better computation of the first stage decisions and the worst case realizations. 
They also show that their algorithm will terminate after a finite number of steps if the initial feasible region is finite. 

They numerically illustrate their results on a Knapsack and a capital budgeting problem.

### Strengths
**originality**: The use of neural networks to predict value functions is quite commmon especially in reinforcement learning literature. However, the incorporation of the neural network into a standard mathematical programming problem is new. 

**quality**: The algorithm developed is justified theoretically and works well on the problems under consideration. 

**clarity**: The paper is well written and presents its arguments well. The experiments are clear and succinct. 

**significance**: This approach presents a new approach which can be used to solve challenging two stage constrained robust optimization problem while still maintaining optimality guarantees.

### Weaknesses
The applications considered are quite limited and don't really give an idea of how the approach will work in problems with other constraints beyond just the packing constraint. The experiments focus on relatively simple problem instances, and it is unclear how the method would scale to larger, more complex problems with a greater number of decision variables and constraints. Specifically, the knapsack and capital budgeting problems are both essentially single constraint problems, and the performance on problems with multiple, interacting constraints is not explored. This raises concerns about the general applicability of the proposed approach to more realistic scenarios. Furthermore, the paper does not explore the sensitivity of the method to the choice of neural network architecture and hyperparameters, which could significantly impact the performance and computational cost. The training process for the neural network is also not detailed, leaving questions about the data requirements and computational resources needed to achieve good performance.

### Questions
1. How much of an impact does the complexity of the Neural Network have on solution time vs relative error. 
2. Did you evaluate the approach on any non binary problems. How was the performance on them. 
3. Did both the knapsack and the budgeting problems involve only one constraint? Did you try the approach on problems with more constraints?

### Summary
The authors propose an approach for solving two stage robust optimization that empirically solves previously intractable problems. The setting considers optimization problems where a set of initial decisions are made, and then a worst-case setting is evaluated and in that worst-case setting the decision-maker can make second-stage decisions to react and ideally improve their deployment. Here the first stage solutions are evaluated based on how robust they are to adversarial settings considering that the decision-maker can react in a pre-specified manner. As this problem considers the nesting of 3 optimization problems it’s empirically very difficult to solve. The standard method here is to maintain a main problem, and then add worst-case scenarios modeling them as cutting planes. The issue here is that due to the inherent multi-level optimization problem, these problems are intractable. The proposed approach is to approximate the value of the lower-level problem in each of these settings using a neural network and then embed the neural network in the outer optimization formulation. Here the neural network is trained to take in a first stage decision as well as a setting and output a value estimating the quality of the best possible second stage recourse given the first stage solution and setting. As such, finding the worst-case adversarial setting amounts to optimizing the output of the neural network value estimator, and finding an estimate of the best possible first-stage solution amounts to optimizing over all possible settings, the output of the neural network estimator. They demonstrate performance on a robust two stage knapsack setting and a capital budgeting setting, demonstrating that their approach can give high-quality solutions in tens of seconds which aren’t solvable by previous methods in 3 hours. The approach demonstrates scalability, and the authors also prove convergence guarantees demonstrating that the algorithm is guaranteed to converge in finite settings.

### Strengths
The core strengths are the drastically improved performance over previous approaches and well-motivated approach. ¬
The improved performance means that problems that were previously intractable are now heuristically solved in tens of seconds, enabling the use of two stage robust optimization for larger or more complex problem settings. 
Additionally, the approach itself is well-motivated by approaches in the optimization literature. By embedding a neural network in the subproblem solver as well as the top-level solver they ensure that the deployed solution is guaranteed to satisfy the constraints and be robust to the enumerated settings. Furthermore, by working with an exact solver, and using the true objective function, the authors guarantee that the resulting objective value of the top-level problem is an objective value corresponding to the first-stage solution for an actual setting.

### Weaknesses
The main weakness is that the scope of impact is somewhat limited to two stage robust optimization. It might be helpful to expand somewhat on where this approach might be useful by giving some examples that are two stage robust optimization from the cited survey on adjustable robust optimization. Alternatively, it might be helpful to give some examples on ways that this can be readily extended to cover more flexible problems such as general-purpose multi-level solver.

Additionally, it is not the first use case of embedding neural networks in optimization to solve hard optimization problems as this was previous done in the cited Dumouchelle 2022 paper. However, this is certainly not a direct extension of that work as the neural network is embedded both in the subproblem as well as the main problem in a manner that is cohesive with the optimization formulation to ensure convergence guarantees and which mimics the original solver.

One slight weakness might be that there are limited baselines. However, it should be noted that there are not many general-purpose solvers in these settings. Would it be possible to compare against a naïve extension of Dumouchelle 2022? It might be possible to train a neural network to take in as input only first stage decisions and output the value of all subsequent decisions. It might be computationally expensive to create a training dataset as one would have to evaluate first stage solutions; however, it may be possible. It seems that might be more difficult for a neural network to model, but potentially give a heuristic solution with one solver call.

Another slight weakness is that there are not many settings evaluated outside of two knapsack-like settings. It might be helpful to demonstrate this approach on other two stage robust optimization settings with potentially more complex feasible regions that would potentially be more difficult for the neural network to model.

### Questions
It may be helpful to define what the “adversarial problem” is versus the “second stage problem” (and the corresponding second stage value function). It seems that the adversarial problem is the minimization over xi. Is the second stage problem the optimization over y?

Are the samples used for training randomly drawn before any solving happens? Are those samples representative of the settings in which the optimization will be occurring over? For instance, the optimization may be performed over a very different part of the feasible space than what was used for sampling. It would be interesting to see a measure of accuracy for the learned models over time at different stages of the solving process.

What does the solving performance look like over time? The solution qualities are somewhat similar whereas the runtimes are drastically different. Is it the case that the baseline very quickly jumps to high quality solutions and stays there? Or does it continue to improve gradually. You might consider evaluating a form of primal integral measuring the performance of the first stage solutions over time. As a quick solution, you might also consider evaluating the solution quality at around the same time it takes the Neur2RO model to terminate.

It would help to have notions of error on the statistics since some of the relative errors are somewhat close.
