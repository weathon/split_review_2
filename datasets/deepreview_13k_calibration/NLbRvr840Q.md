## Abstract
Recently, hypergraph neural networks (HGNNs) exhibit the potential to tackle tasks with high-order correlations and have achieved success in many tasks. However, existing evolution on the hypergraph has poor controllability and lacks sufficient theoretical support (like dynamic systems), thus yielding sub-optimal performance. One typical scenario is that only one or two layers of HGNNs can achieve good results and more layers lead to degeneration of performance. Under such circumstances, it is important to increase the controllability of HGNNs. In this paper, we first introduce hypergraph dynamic systems (HDS), which bridge hypergraphs and dynamic systems and characterize the continuous dynamics of representations. We then propose a control-diffusion hypergraph dynamic system by an ordinary differential equation (ODE). We design a multi-layer HDS$^{ode}$ as a neural implementation, which contains control steps and diffusion steps. HDS$^{ode}$ has the properties of controllability and stabilization and is allowed to capture long-range correlations among vertices. Experiments on $9$ datasets demonstrate HDS$^{ode}$ beat all compared methods. HDS$^{ode}$ achieves stable performance with increased layers and solves the poor controllability of HGNNs. We also provide the feature visualization of the evolutionary process to demonstrate the controllability and stabilization of HDS$^{ode}$.

### Summary
This paper introduces hypergraph dynamic systems (HDS) to characerize the continuous dynamics of representations, and then proposes a control-diffusion HDS by an ODE. A multi-layer HDS-ODE is designed as a neural implementation, having the properties of controllability and stabilization, and   can capture long-range correlations among vertices. The paper performs evaluation experiments on 7 datsets to show its dominant performance.

### Strengths
1. The pape present the implementation of HDS-ODE framework by posing the neural implementation of the control step and diffusion step in sequence  via Lie-Trotter splitting method.
2. The time complexity and relation to HGNN+ are analyzed. And the experiments show its very good performance.
3. The properties of HDS-ODE are discussed and we appreciate such an effort on analysis in theory, although we do have concerns on these contents (please see comments below).

### Weaknesses
1. To the terminology (and the preliminary math tools) of dynamical systems used in this paper, it seems that the authors does not soundly cook its article based on the strict math that has been widely accepted in math and engineering. See Queation 1, Weakness point 2 and 3.

2. The discussion of statibility seems wrong. That's why we say the authors may not well pick up knowledge of (linear/nonlinear) dynamical systems. Sec. 5.1 discussed the stability of HDS-ODE, where the statement of the first sentence in this section is basically wrong. The so-called "control" term also iterate over time. It cannot be simplified the stability analysis of HDS-ODE as simply a dissusion of linear system X_dot = A X. Let us use the eq.(3) to clarify the point simply. Supposing we accept the split of the general state-space equation X_dot = f(X, t) as eq.(3), it is obviously that the stability analysis is a general stability analysis of nonlinear system, besides AX(t) there also exists g(X(t))! If you said your discussion of HDS-ODE refer to the neural implementation, we can see that in eq. (6) the nonlinear term is still there, except it is in NN form, and then embeds into eq.(7) to complete the iteration t+1. Furthermore, these propositions on stability for your "simplified" linear systems are well-known in the field of electrical engineering.

3. Your abstract and contribution summary tell that yours studies the "controllability", which we could find anything related to it. And regarding the starting point of the most general eq.(2), there cannot be any controllablity-related problem can be formulated. Maybe you refer to something different? We strongly recommend the authors to learn essentials of dynamical systems, it helps to avoid conceptual misunderstandings and misuse for better communications.

   To help you with essential knowledge on dynamical systems, you may refer to the following classic textbooks (basics on linear, nonlinear systems):

   - Zhou, K., Doyle, J. C., & Glover, K. (1995). Robust and Optimal Control. Pearson.
   - H. K. Khalil, “Nonlinear Systems,” 3rd Edition, Prentice Hall, Upper Saddle River, 2002.

Your idea may be valuable and appreciated, considering your sound performance in experiments. However, you really have to first carefully deal with theory and fix any possible mistakes.

### Questions
1. Why do you call these two terms in eq.(3) as the "control" term and the "diffusion" term. We are not familiar with the terminology in the "small" field (that is consisted of these ~5 papers in introduction). However, in the mature fields of "dynamical systems" in math, "stochastic analysis" in probability or mathematical finance  and "control theory/engineering" or "cybernetics" in engineering, neither the name of "control" nor "diffusion" may be  properly defined. The control term usually refers to external signals or extrogeneous variables (in econometrics) that can be designed or modified. Indeed, if you assume, eq.(3) is not an autonomous system in nature (if purely looking at (3) itself, it is), but the feedback system by using the nonlinear state feedback law g(X) as the control "u" for the linear dynamical system X_dot = A X + u. It somehow legitimate the name "control". However, it is still not recommended in this way since it is confusing. Referring to the diffusion term, we cannot see why it can be call as this name, since the diffusion term is h(X)dW in the SDE dX(t) = f(X, t) dt + h(X,t) dW, where W is the Brownian motion. The AX(t) term in eq.(3) is actually the term of f(X,t), so the drift term. 
2. See Weakness point 2 on Sec.5.1. Please explain, in particular, the first sentence of Sec.5.1, which seems not correct.

### Summary
In this paper, the authors target on the task of representation learning with high-order correlations on hypergraph, in which the challenge is the sub-optimal problem during the process the neural network. Existing hypergraph neural networks cannot be deeper than 2 layers and is unstable. This problem is a common but challenged issue in this field. The authors introduce the framework of hypergraph dynamic systems, which connects hypergraph learning and dynamic systems to achieve continuous dynamics of representation using high-order correlations. The authors further propose an implementation of hypergraph dynamic systems based on ordinary differential equation and experiments have shown stable and satisfied performance. This control-diffusion process introduced in this paper have been demonstrated effectiveness through the results and theoretical discussions.

### Strengths
This paper targets on an important but challenged task in representation learning, i.e., how to achieve stable representation learning in hypergraph neural network, which is also a common issue in the general graph neural networks. Usually, HGNNs cannot be more than 2 layers, which leads to performance degradation significantly. The introduced hypergraph dynamic systems framework in this paper bridges hypergraph learning and dynamic systems, which can take the advantages of hypergraph on high-order correlation modeling and dynamic systems on controllable diffusion process. The idea of hypergraph dynamic systems is novel. It is a good attempt towards better representation learning and could be helpful to a broad field.

The authors also propose an implementation of HDS using ODE, and a multi-layer HDS-ode is given. The stability analysis has also been detailed analyzed. The difference between HDS-ode and traditional HGNNs has discussed.

Experiments are sufficient. Experiments on semi-supervised vertex classification with two different settings have been conducted on 7 datasets. Experimental results have clearly shown the superior performance of HDS-ode compared with recent state-of-the-art GNN/HGNN methods. From the results, we can observe the control-diffusion process of HDS-ode is stable, which solves the limitations of existing HGNNs, i.e. only 1 or 2 layers can be used.

In general, this paper is well organized and writing. The related works are sufficient and the motivation is clear. The method has been detailed introduced. This paper brings in a new aspect of representation learning of taking both high-order correlation modeling and dynamic systems into consideration simultaneously, which has the potential to have broad impact.

### Weaknesses
For the framework figure (Fig. 2), a more detailed and clearer introduction should be helpful.

There are a few typos. Please find and correct them.

### Questions
1. For the framework figure (Fig. 2), a more detailed and clearer introduction should be helpful.
2. As shown in Fig. 1, the performance of HDS-ode increases during the first 8 layers and becomes stable then. Can the authors further explain how to control the diffusion speed during this procedure?
3. There are a few typos. Please find and correct them.

### Summary
This paper theoretically introduces hypergraph dynamical systems based on a control-diffusion
ODE, which bridge hypergraphs and dynamical systems. It then proposes a neural implementation $HDS^{ode}$ and presents stability analysis of it and the connection to hypergraph neural networks. Finally, the paper empirically evaluates $HDS^{ode}$ using benchmark datasets and show its effectiveness to some extent. Some ablation studies are also included for more thorough investigation of the proposed method.

### Strengths
1.	Given the graph counterpart, it is a natural and interesting idea to develop a hypergraph neural ODE to improve the controllability and stabilization of information diffusion on hypergraphs. On the other hand, given that graphs and hypergraphs are different in nature, it is also a challenging problem how the system should be designed. 
2.	The paper is well-written and easy to follow.
3.	The paper is very complete, with clear presentation of the method, some theoretical analysis and thorough empirical evaluation.

### Weaknesses
The main weakness of the paper is the weak empirical results supporting the effectiveness of the proposed method. It is unconvincing why small diffusion steps themselves constitute a real problem for hyper graph neural networks. Although $HDS^{ode}$’s performance does not suffer from more layers, $HDS^{ode}$ has very marginal improvement in terms of optimal performance. This is evident from all the experimental results (Figure 1, Table 1 and Table 2), where the improvement over baseline methods is barely noticeable and almost never statistically significant. The claim that the method captures more complex and global relationships is not well supported by the empirical results. The datasets used may not fully reflect the potential benefits of the proposed approach, as the performance gains are not substantial enough to justify the added complexity of the ODE-based model. The experimental results do not clearly demonstrate a significant advantage over simpler, existing methods, particularly in scenarios where information beyond 1-2 hops is not critical for performance.

### Questions
"Dynamic systems" reads weird, and it is used kind of interchangeably with "dynamical systems" in the paper. Is there any specific reason to sometimes use "dynamic systems" instead of "dynamical systems" in the paper? If not, sticking with "dynamical systems" and "hypergraph dynamical systems" might be more appropriate. See discussion on Mathoverflow https://mathoverflow.net/questions/366856/why-is-a-dynamical-system-not-a-dynamic-system" about why the right mathematical jargon is "dynamical systems".

### Summary
This paper extends hypergraph neural networks (HGNNs) to model hypergraph dynamic systems. Specifically, the authors integrate the graph propagation scheme of HGNN into a control-diffusion ODE form to capture dynamics. Theoretical analysis highlights the controllability and stabilization properties of the proposed HDS$^{ode}$, which allows it to capture long-range correlations among vertices. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of HDS$^{ode}$.

### Strengths
+ The combination of Neural ODEs with hypergraphs is an interesting idea, bringing together two distinct approaches to modeling dynamic systems.
+ The authors introduce a Lie-Trotter splitting method as the ODE solver, which is a notable contribution.
+ The theoretical analysis on stability and eigenvalue properties of hypergraphs is solid and persuasive.

### Weaknesses
- The proposed model appears to be a straightforward combination of existing efforts on HGNN and neural graph ODEs, essentially replacing the message-passing scheme of GNNs with a diffusive hypergraph adjacency. It would be beneficial to clarify how this combination advances the field beyond existing approaches. Specifically, the paper does not articulate how the continuous-time formulation provides unique benefits over discrete-time hypergraph models, beyond simply using a different propagation mechanism. The use of a Lie-Trotter splitting method, while mentioned as a contribution, is not sufficiently justified in the context of hypergraph dynamics, and it is unclear if this method provides any advantage over other numerical solvers.
- The application of hypergraph ODEs is not sufficiently motivated. Although the proposed model claims to capture system dynamics, it is evaluated on node classification tasks using static graphs, leaving the potential benefits on dynamical systems unclear. The paper lacks a compelling argument for why a continuous-time model is necessary or advantageous for static graph data. Furthermore, the choice of node classification as the evaluation task does not align well with the stated goal of modeling dynamics. A more suitable evaluation would involve tasks that explicitly involve temporal data or dynamic graphs.
- The experimental results show limited improvement over baseline methods, and from the comprehensive comparison it seems that variations in model structures have little influence on performance. The reported improvements are marginal, and the standard deviations indicate that the differences may not be statistically significant. The paper does not provide a clear explanation for why the proposed model does not demonstrate substantial performance gains, and it is unclear whether the slight improvements are due to the model's architecture or other factors.

### Questions
1. What is the rationale for applying ODEs and continuous methods to static graphs? How does the model benefit from the system dynamics brought by its structure?
2. Could you provide insights into the model's performance when the hypergraph convolution is replaced with simpler graph operators like GCN, as part of ablation studies? The functionality of hypergraph convolution in the model is unclear.
