## Abstract
Class-Incremental Learning (CIL) aims to learn deep models on sequential tasks continually, where each new task includes a batch of new classes and deep models do not have access to task-ID information at the inference time. Recent vast pre-trained models (PTMs) have achieved outstanding performance by prompt technique in practical CIL without the old samples (rehearsal-free) and with a memory constraint (memory-constrained): Prompt-extending and Prompt-fixed methods. However, prompt-extending methods need a large memory buffer to maintain an ever-expanding prompt pool and meet an extra challenging prompt selection problem. Prompt-fixed methods only learn a fixed number of prompts on one of the incremental tasks and can not handle all the incremental tasks effectively. To achieve a good balance between the memory cost and the performance on all the tasks, we propose a Parameter-Efficient Cross-Task Prompt (PECTP) framework with a prompt retention module (PRM). To make the final learned prompts effective on the whole incremental tasks, PRM constrains the evolution of cross-task prompts' parameters from Outer Prompt Granularity and Inner Prompt Granularity. Extensive experiments show the effectiveness of our method.

### Summary
The paper presents a prompt-fixed continual learning method based on pre-trained transformer models. By introducing a regularization module for the task prompts, the method constrains the update of prompts. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed method.

### Strengths
- The paper is easy to understand.
- Using prompting-based method for continual learning is interesting.

### Weaknesses
 - The idea of adding regularization terms to a fixed set of prompts is not quite persuasive. I have a series of related questions:
1. What is the intuition behind limiting the update of prompts? 
2. How is it different from usual regularization-based CL methods, besides the fact that you are doing on prompt parameters instead of all model parameters? 
3. Wouldn't limiting the update also limits the ability of learning new tasks?
4. Why using a fixed set of prompts is even better than extending the set of prompts? For example, if the domain gaps are large between different tasks, the fixed set of prompts might not be able to represent them well without conflicts.
- To me it seems the "feature fusion" module is the most interesting part that fixed prompts method work well. However, this is not the main contribution of the method, and the authors did not describe them in detail in the main paper.

### Summary
The authors propose the prompt-fixed CIL method for rehearsal-free CIL setup. Also, they also propose the Prompt Retention Module (PRM) to regularize the updating prompt parameters, and it utilizes two granularity features called Outer Prompt Granularity (OPG) and Inner Prompt Granularity (IPG).

### Strengths
**1 (Well-defined problem).** There was a scalable issue by proposing prompt-extending methods such as DualPrompt and Coda-prompt. However, they propose the prompt-fixed method with PRM which is a regularization term for avoiding forgetting, so they solve the scalable issue as the number of tasks increases. 

**2 (Intuitive Idea).** Their proposed method is intuitive, and well-organized. If I have to solve this problem, I also think the approach like this paper. 

**3 (Enough Experiment).** There are several experimental results to prove the effectiveness of their method. Most of my concerns are solved via their experiments, but some are still remaining. I wrote them in the weakness section. 

**4 (Well-written).** It is easily written for understanding.

### Weaknesses
 **1 (Table 2).** While L2P has the prompt pool, the number of prompts does not depend on the number of tasks. As such, L2P should be prompt-fixed, not prompt-extending. Also, I'm wondering the results on comparison of PECTP and the other baselines with same prompt number (Either You can increase the prompt number in PECTP or you can decrease the prompt number in other baselines is fine).

**2 (Necessity of Inner Prompt Granularity).** According to Table 3, utilizing both IPG and OPG has the good synergy to enhance the performance. To the best of my understanding, the roles of IPG and OPG are to prevent forgetting knowledge from the previous task and pretrained model, respectively. To validate the hypothesis that I mentioned, the additional ablation study is needed (i.e, we can split the test set for each task). For example, in table 3, baseline+IPG do not forget in the previous task compared to baseline+OPG or baseline, and baseline+OPG has the consistent results for all the tasks.

**3 (Stress Test).** This work is noteworthy when the number of tasks is large (e.g, n_task=1000) due to scaling issue. As such, reporting the results in large number of tasks setup would be helpful to validate the effectiveness of their method.

### Summary
In this work, the author introduces the use of a parameter-efficient cross-task prompt for pre-trained models to tackle the challenges of class incremental learning in a rehearsal-free and memory-constrained manner. Specifically, unlike memory-based incremental learning methods, this approach obviates the need to retrain old samples. In comparison to the previous "Prompt-fixed" and "Prompt-extending" methods, the author proposes a more parameter-efficient manner of extracting relevant prompts.

### Strengths
The foundation of this idea appears solid. The parameter efficient way seems memory friendly than the previous methods.

To validate this approach, it was tested across seven popular benchmarks, yielding promising results in some datasets.

### Weaknesses
However, I have several concerns:

1. Data Leakage from Pre-trained Model: The model has been pre-trained on ImageNet21k, and subsequently, the author employs a subset of this, ImageNet, for the incremental learning task. This presents a potential data leakage concern, as the pre-trained model has already been exposed to the entirety of ImageNet during its initial training. This practice may inadvertently violate the foundational principles of class incremental learning.

2. Not being directly immersed in prompt learning, I'm concerned that the prompts might inadvertently leak information or task-id specifics to the broader model, especially when compared with prior class incremental learning methodologies, which only obtains the task id based on model itself, no prompts are used.

3. Reproducibility of experiments is crucial. The primary results in Table 1 seem to have been conducted only once, without any mention of variance or average performance.

4. While the number of prompts is detailed in the table, there's a noticeable lack of information regarding model size, computational complexity, and the execution time spent on distinct model components.

5. The paper neglects the discussion of certain challenging tasks. Managing tasks in larger scales, such as when the number of tasks is 50 or 100, can be formidable. I'm curious about the performance of this method under such rigorous testing scenarios.

6. A missing baseline: Given that the pre-trained model might already contain a wealth of information or representations, including those of the dataset under testing, there's a potential risk of the model being over-fitted to the dataset in question. I strongly recommend that the author includes performance metrics without the prompt, thereby delineating the actual gains derived from this approach.

### Questions
Regarding the weaknesses, my main concern is data leakage from the pre-trained model itself. If the author can address this concern during the rebuttals, I will increase the scores accordingly.
