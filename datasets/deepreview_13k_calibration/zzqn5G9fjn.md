## Abstract
Pretrained large language models (LLMs) have emerged as a cornerstone in modern natural language processing, with their utility expanding to various applications and languages. However, the fine-tuning of multilingual LLMs, particularly for low-resource languages, is fraught with challenges steming from data-sharing restrictions (the physical border) and from the inherent linguistic differences (the linguistic border). These barriers hinder users of various languages, especially those in low-resource regions, from fully benefiting from the advantages of LLMs.

To overcome these challenges, we propose the Federated Prompt Tuning Paradigm for Multilingual Scenarios, which leverages parameter-efficient fine-tuning in a manner that preserves user privacy. We have designed a comprehensive set of experiments and introduced the concept of "language distance" to highlight the several strengths of this paradigm. Even under computational constraints, our method not only bolsters data efficiency but also facilitates mutual enhancements across languages, particularly benefiting low-resource ones. Compared to traditional local crosslingual transfer tuning methods, our approach achieves a 6.9\% higher accuracy, reduces the training parameters by over 99\%, and demonstrates stronger cross-lingual generalization. Such findings underscore the potential of our approach to promote social equality, ensure user privacy, and champion linguistic diversity.

### Confidence
4: You are confident in your assessment, but not absolutely certain. It is unlikely, but not impossible, that you did not understand some parts of the submission or that you are unfamiliar with some pieces of related work.

### Summary
The paper applies federated learning on multilingual scenarios to efficiently parameter-efficient prompt fine-tuning in a manner that preserves user privacy. The idea is to utilize a single global encoder that accumulates the information via federated prompt averaging. Thus, it learns the language patterns without knowing about the user information. They evaluated the experiment on NC and XNLI datasets and found performance improvement over the baseline.

### Strengths
- The method is very practical since it is simple and efficient, and it is an appropriate method for training multilingual model.
- Good analysis on the data efficiency and distance measurement, showing the effectiveness of the proposed method.

### Weaknesses
 - In terms of novelty, the proposed idea is not new, and it is only a further investigation of the multilingual setting.
- Lack of clarity. The paper does not provide enough information about how the prompts are constructed or look like and hyperparameters for all settings. I suggest adding the information to the paper or appendix.

### Questions
Questions:
- Do you have any findings on why multilingual centralized learning is far worse than federated learning in Table 2?
- How did you tune the training and parameter averaging?

Suggestions:
- Figure number is missing on Page 2

"As depicted in Figure , "

- Missing Figure/Table 

"This translates to over 99% reduction in the communication overhead shown in 3"

- Typo

"Finetuning accuracy across different lanugages on the NC task."

### Summary
The paper proposes a Multilingual Federated Prompt Tuning paradigm, where lightweight multilingual prompts are encoded and on regional devices in different languages and aggregated by averaging the prompt embeddings. The goal is fine-tuning multilingual large language models on resource-constraint devices in a privacy-preserving way. The paper evaluates this approach via the XNLI task, ablated into data efficiency, "language distance", and communication cost, against "monolingual" training (baseline).

### Strengths
The innovation lies in that the paper somehow mashes federated learning, multi-lingual (low resource) language models, and Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning in one paper. The fact that they managed to come up with a storyline for a system that bolsters the benefit of each approach is commendable.

### Weaknesses
 - poor presentation: the citations are not separable enough from the main text, e.g., without any parenthesis, rendering the submission unreadable. Against the tradition and ease of reading, abbreviations are not defined in advance, e.g., NLI, PFL, PLM.
- claims unverifiable: no code release.
- conflating existing metrics with innovation: language distance is not a new concept.
- conceptual weakness: the contrived baseline was bound to give the proposed approach an edge due to lack of federated learning. Also, what the paper refers to as prompts are just classifier model input, which are different from decoders-style LLM prompts as commonly acknowledged. Finally, the approach has absolutely nothing to do with privacy which the abstract and the main body consistently bolsters. 
- evaluation weakness: only two tasks (new classification and XNLI) was used in evaluation.

### Questions
In section 5.4.1 

>  In both the NC and XNLI tasks, despite the total number of
parameters exceeding 278 million, the trainable parameters are only around 1.2 million, accounting
for less than 0.5% of the total.

Could the authors clarify which part of the model is being fine-tuned?

### Summary
The paper introduces a finetuning paradigm that combines federated learning (FL) with prompt tuning for multilingual finetuning on certain, with the goal to preserve the privacy of the local data used for the finetuning job. The results show better performance in certain classification tasks, such as New Classification and XNLI.

### Strengths
- Federated learning have recently gained good traction, the paper is a good application of it in the tasks of finetuning LLM. The paper chooses to use prompt tuning instead of full tuning to save costs, as well as to avoid overfitting on small data.
- The method produces better performance on the 2 classification tasks compared to baselines

### Weaknesses
 - The proposed is a very trivial combination of federated learning and prompt tuning, which both are established methodology in their own realm. There is no novelty, such as modification or adjustment to the method that may have give a better results. In other words, people with an objective to do federated learning for privacy purpose can easily come up with prompt tuning as a solution to reduce costs.
- Though it may have implicitly inferred by the concept of FL, the paper did not mention why and how federated learning helps with privacy and in which case one should use FL for their application.
- The purpose of the task of multilingual finetuning in this case, is not warranted use case of privacy preservation.
- There is no reported evidence that privacy is actually preserved. Such as whether the final model memorize the local data.
- There are better parameter-efficient finetuning methods, such as LORA/QLora, that the authors should conduct experiments on and do comparision with prompt tuning.
- The results show prompt tuning are much worse than full-federated tuning, thus casting doubt if the cost-saving is worth it.
- Other generative and knowledge-based tasks, such as QA, translations and summarizations should be performed.

**I have read the author responses and I advocate for a strong reject, below are reasons:**

* I mentioned the paper has fundamental problems with originality, novelty, where the paper uses an unrelated existing and non-novel method designed for a different problem (fed-learning) to solve a low-resource "privacy" problem that does not make sense or exist yet, in which the method itself much worse than standard training. 
* Instead of addressing the scientific issue, the authors distracted away by pressing that they are helping the low-resource communities, or improving inequality as a societal issue. These multiple responses are lengthy, wordy, unnecessary, and filled with many "politically correct" (I don't know better word) things to avoid the scientific issue. Agree that we should help those under-represented communities, but after reading these, I shouldn't feel like rejecting the paper is an action against those communities.
* The problem of "a low-resource community who wants to shut down their internet and border" is unfounded. We train LLM on public data we can find. If they wants to protect their secret data, they can download a public pre-trained model and fine-tune on their own. 
* The real problem is how to improve low-resource with the limited data we have, which the paper fails to suggest a better solution than trivial.
* Less communication doens't mean more privacy, because we transfer model weights, not the data. And less parameters doesn't mean less private information be leaked. This misconception leads to wrong approach.
* The author claims to be the first to target the low-resource problem and many other things, but there have been many works in previous years about this. Please be careful with this kind of "we are first" statements.
* Overall, none of the responses has helped resolve the issues stated in the review.

### Questions
- Citation formet incorrect, \citep{} be used to produce something like (Abc, et al., 2023) and not Abc, et al., 2023 everywhere.
- Many grammatical errors, such as "Throughout the fine-tuning...""

### Summary
This paper is about multilingual federated prompt tuning for low-resource languages, bringing together federated learning and prompt-tuning techniques. This approach leverages parameter-efficient fine-tuning which preserves user privacy, and additionally, the authors introduce language distance in order to highlight the strengths of the proposed paradigm. The results show that the technique is parameter efficient and computationally beneficial, reducing by 99% the number of trainable parameters while increasing the performance on downstream tasks (XNLI, NC) of ~7% accuracy.

### Strengths
This paper makes a contribution to the federated learning field showing how federated learning can be used to enhance the performance of language models while preserving user privacy. The experiments are well-designed and the results are convincing - added to extensive analyses in order to leverage the capabilities of the proposed paradigm, but also its limitations.

### Weaknesses
Although the paper is generally well-structured, the title mentions `low-resource` languages. However, the two tasks leveraged are primarily on high-resource languages, rather than low-resourced language. I would suggest to the authors to include more tasks - there are many low-resource language datasets (for instance on African languages MasakhaNEWS, Masakhaner (1.0 and 2.0 - which have been cited by the way but not used), MasakhaPOS; Indic languages: https://github.com/AI4Bharat/indicnlp_catalog; etc) and tasks.

This is rather a highly recommended suggestion, that does not take away the contribution of the paper. Including them would strengthen the paper and be more in accordance with the title.

### Questions
The Aggregation formula is a bit confusing. Did you mean h_{global, t+1} = \sum_{k=1}^{m} h_{k, t}? Because the `t+1` on the last term does not make sense to me.
