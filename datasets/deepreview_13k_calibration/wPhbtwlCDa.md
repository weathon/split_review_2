## Abstract
In order to solve a task using reinforcement learning, it is necessary to first formalise the goal of that task as a \emph{reward function}. However, for many real-world tasks, it is very difficult to manually specify a reward function that never incentivises undesirable behaviour. As a result, it is increasingly popular to use \emph{reward learning algorithms}, which attempt to \emph{learn} a reward function from data. 
However, the theoretical foundations of reward learning are not yet well-developed. 
In particular, it is typically not known when a given reward learning algorithm with high probability will learn a reward function that is safe to optimise.
This means that reward learning algorithms generally must be evaluated empirically, which is expensive, and that their failure modes are difficult to anticipate in advance. 
One of the roadblocks to deriving better theoretical guarantees is the lack of good methods for \emph{quantifying} the difference between reward functions.
In this paper we provide a solution to this problem, in the form of
a class of pseudometrics on the space of all reward functions that we call STARC (STAndardised Reward Comparison) metrics. We show that STARC metrics induce both an upper and a lower bound on worst-case regret, which implies that our metrics are tight, and that any metric with the same properties must be bilipschitz equivalent to ours. Moreover, we also identify a number of issues with reward metrics proposed by earlier works. Finally, we evaluate our metrics empirically, to demonstrate their practical efficacy.
STARC metrics can be used to make both theoretical and empirical analysis of reward learning algorithms both easier and more principled.

### Summary
The paper introduces STARC, a class of pseudo-metric over reward functions. Intuitively, it measures how two reward functions differ by computing a distance between the normalized representative elements of their equivalence classes with respect to potential shaping and S'-redistribution. Theoretical results are proven for STARC, which is also contrasted with previous propositions.

### Strengths
The proposed class of pseudo-metrics is novel and natural. It enjoys nice theoretical properties such as soundness and completeness, which are not satisfied by previously-proposed pseudo-metrics.

Concrete examples of instances of such pseudo-metrics are provided.

The paper is well-written and clear.

### Weaknesses
The premise of this work is that the proposed pseudo-metric could be used to quantify how a learned reward function differs from the true one. Unfortunately, in practice, when one needs to learn a reward function, the true one is not known, which makes the usefulness of such pseudo-metric not clear to me.

The interchangeable use in the text of pseudo-metric and metric makes things a bit confusing sometimes. I think it would be better to use consistently pseudo-metric to refer to pseudo-metric. 

Minor:

The definition of metric m from norm n contains a typo (page 3).
The definition of the L_p norm is missing the absolute value.

Definition 6: there exists two -> there exist two

The following paper:

appears twice in the references.

### Questions
The authors first write: 
"STARC metrics in practice CAN have a much tighter correlation with worst-case regret than both EPIC and DARD" 
then continue with:
"This means that STARC metrics both attain better empirical performance"
Is it this always true?

What does this sentence mean? "the property that increasing R1 cannot decrease R2"

Could you provide some examples where the true reward is not known, but such pseudo-metrics could be helpful?

### Summary
The authors motivate the need for metrics quantifying the differences between reward functions without having to compare policies optimized on those rewards. Comparison is provided to previous work, namely EPIC and DARD. The authors define "canonicalization function" as a collapsing of reward functions equivalent under potential shaping and S'-redistribution. Interestingly C_EPIC and C_DARD are not canonicalization functions under this distribution because they do not consider S'-redistribution. STARC is then introduced as a class of metrics defined by a canonicalization function, norm, and metric satisfying various properties. STARC metrics crucially are defined relative to the environment, meaning they are implicitly parameterized by S, A, T, lambda, and the initial state distribution. Value-Adjusted Leveling (VAL) is provided as one example construction of a canonicalization function. The paper proves that all STARC metrics are both sound and complete, providing both upper and lower bounds on worst-case regret, and that any sound and complete pseudometrics are bilipschitz equivalent to STARC metrics. Experiments are conducted on both small MDPs, where strong correlation between STARC-VAL and regret is demonstrated, and in a MuJoCo environment.

### Strengths
There is an appreciable amount of novel theory in this work. The definition of canonicalization function simply adds S'-redistribution to the list of invariances compared to EPIC and DARD, but there is novelty in the definition of VAL, definitions of sound and complete pseudometrics in reward space, and theorems stating that STARC is both sound and complete. 

The paper provides a satisfying comparison between STARC, EPIC, and DARD, and convincingly explains why EPIC and DARD are not both sound and complete. 

The experiment in the small MDP is a convincing demonstration of the superiority of STARC-VAL in practice over other baselines (and also that canonicalization is crucial). The experiment in Reacher demonstrated that STARC-VAL produced the correct (expected) ranking of rewards. 

The work is significant because reward function evaluation separate from policy optimization is an important issue in the field, and the work demonstrates that existing methods have issues which STARC resolves.

The paper is well-written and very clear.

### Weaknesses
One substantial weakness I see with the reward comparison literature in general is its applicability: the paper is missing a discussion of how reward comparison might be used in practice, when there is no access to the ground truth reward. Is it meant to be used to compare two learned rewards? How does the value influence a ML system designer's decision on what to do next?

In section 2.3, the authors argue for why they think the dependence on T is meaningful. I think it is missing a discussion of the sim2real setting. Does it require a simulator with the true transitions, or simply samples from the true transitions? If the former, I would argue it is a meaningful limitation for many real world tasks due to the sim2real gap.

In Reacher, the authors acknowledge that estimating the metric via sampling involves summing over absolute values which makes all noise positive, thus inflating the metric for PotentialShaped which should have 0 distance. Indeed in table 1, the distance values are not linearly related to what I'd want the metric to say. The authors argue it is not problematic for ranking, which I agree with, but it is crucial for absolute evaluation (as opposed to ranking), which I think is also important. The paper is missing a discussion of absolute evaluation, as well as a discussion of how big an issue they expect this to be for environments in general.

The authors claim to provide a complete answer to the question of how to measure distance between reward functions, but I'd argue completeness requires providing a tight bound. We're not sure how large the spread L to U is.

The authors also acknowledge the theory assumes finite S and A and uses a strong definition of regret.

### Questions
- typo on pg 3? definition of pseudometric: should be n(x-v)
- would be great to provide (even 1-sentence) intuition for EPIC (explain the various normalization terms that EPIC paper explains), because it is crucial for understanding your definition of canonicalization function
- how are D_S and D_A chosen in EPIC?
- can you give a brief explanation/intuition for S'-distribution? since it is the difference between your definition of canonicalization function and that used in EPIC
- in def 1: where do R, R_1, R_2 come from? is it all such R's in the reward class?
- can you provide intuition for Im(c)? it appears somewhat out of nowhere.
- in def 1 and 4: should it say differ *only* by (potential shaping and S'-redistribution)?
- why is it not given that minimal CFs exist for any given norm or are unique?
- how should norm and distance metric be chosen in practice?
- how do you choose the policy for VAL canonicalization? why uniform for reacher?

### Summary
Considering that there is a lack of good methods for quantifying the difference between reward functions, this paper proposes STARC, a class of pseudo metrics on the space of all reward functions. Authors show that STARC metrics are tight, which gives both an upper and a lower bound on worst-case regret. Empirical results demonstrate the practical efficacy of STARC metrics.

### Strengths
1. This paper is clearly written, with extensive theoretical results and empirical verification.
2. Quantifying the differences of reward functions, especially from the perspective of their induced orders of policies is an interesting and important topic in RL, but is lack of consideration. This paper makes a new step.

### Weaknesses
1. From the experimental results shown in Figure 1, we can see that the choice of normalization function $n$ and distance metric $m$ can have a significant impact on the metric’s accuracy. But the theoretical results presented in this paper cannot indicate which STARC metrics work best in practice. Specifically, it is unclear whether certain combinations of $n$ and $m$ are theoretically better justified or lead to tighter bounds in specific scenarios. Further analysis into the properties of different $n$ and $m$ choices would be beneficial.

2. The theoretical results assume that $\mathcal{S}$ and $\mathcal{A}$ are finite, which are not applicable to continuous environments. While the empirical results suggest that STARC metrics might work in continuous settings, a theoretical extension to continuous state and action spaces would significantly strengthen the paper's contributions. Without this, the applicability of STARC to many real-world RL problems remains uncertain.

3. In Definition 1 and throughout the paper, the phrase “differ by” is used frequently but lacks precise definition. For instance, the statement “$C(R)$ and $R$ differ by potential shaping and $S’$-distribution” in Definition 1 is ambiguous. It is not clear if this implies a specific order of operations (first potential shaping, then $S’$-distribution) or if the order is irrelevant. Clarifying this aspect is crucial for understanding the core concepts of the paper.

4. Definition 3 defines $s(R)=c(R)/n(c(R))$ and claims that $s$ reduces rewards that have the same ordering of policies to the same one. However, a concrete example illustrating this process would greatly enhance clarity. Providing a simple MDP, calculating the STARC metric, and demonstrating how different reward functions with the same policy ordering are mapped to the same value would make this concept more accessible.

5. In Proposition 2, it is not explicitly stated which reward function is used when calculating $V^\pi$. This ambiguity needs to be resolved to ensure the proposition is well-defined.

6. In the proof of Proposition 9 and 10, you just prove that “that $c(R_1)=c(R_2)$ if $R_1$ and $R_2$ differ by potential shaping and $S’$-redistribution”. However, in the definition of canonicalization function, a canonicalization must satisfy that “$c(R_1)=c(R_2) $if and only if $R_1$ and $R_2$ only differ by potential shaping and $S’$-redistribution”. The “only if” part is not considered, which is a significant omission.

### Questions
1.	In Definition 1 and the entire paper, the phrase “differ by” frequently occurs. But what do you mean by it? Say, “$C(R)$ and $R$ differ by potential shaping and $S’$-distribution” in Definition 1, do you mean that we can get $C(R)$ by first potential shaping $R$ and then $S’$-distribution? Does the order matters?
2.	Considering Definition 3, you define $s(R)=c(R)/n(c(R))$ and claim in the following sentence that $s$ would reduce rewards that have the same ordering of policies to the same one. Could you please give a simple example (MDP) and illustrate the calculation process of your defined STARC metric and verifies your claim.
3.	In proposition 2, what is the reward function when calculating $V^\pi$?
4.	In the proof of Proposition 9 and 10, you just prove that “that $c(R_1)=c(R_2)$ if $R_1$ and $R_2$ differ by potential shaping and $S’$-redistribution”. However, in the definition of canonicalization function, a canonicalization must satisfy that “$c(R_1)=c(R_2) $if and only if $R_1$ and $R_2$ only differ by potential shaping and $S’$-redistribution”. Why not consider “only if”?


I am willing to raise my scores if you could solve my concerns.

### Summary
This paper proposes a new family of metrics to measure similarity between reward functions in the MDP setting. The proposed family is based on a strong definition of regret and is defined such that it allows to estimate both an upper and a lower bound on such difference, so that similar functions are guaranteed to also yield a similar policy ordering. Also, the mathematical definition is simple and can well be applied both theoretically and empirically.

### Strengths
This work investigates a very interesting problem, as it is often unclear how and to what extent different reward functions can lead to the same policy preferences, and in general how different rewards can be compared. The theoretical characterization is rigorous but also easily readable, which is not always obvious in this kind of math-heavy works.

### Weaknesses
I do not have that much to say about eventual weaknesses, other than some points about the empirical results presentation (detailed in the Questions below).

- The definition of a pseudometric by a norm seems wrong: why $m(x,y)=n(x-v)$? What is $v$? Should not that be $n(x-y)$?
- The results in Figure 1 are a bit difficult to parse. Each column corresponds to a different metric family, and each point is a different choice of either the metric $m$, the norm $n$ or the canonicalisation $c$. But what is the None column? Are the choices of $m$, $n$ and $c$ consistent throughout different families? Although I appreciate the space constraints imposed by the venue, I really feel that some details on how these are chosen should fit into this section, as these are crucial to properly assess the proposed results.
- I think it would have been also interesting to assess the individual impact of the choice of $m$, $n$ or $c$ when the values of the other is fixed: for example, how important is the choice of the canonicalisation $c$ w.r.t. the chosen metric and norm? Although there is some discussion w.r.t. this at the end of page 8, it is a bit difficult for me to relate such discussion to the results in Figure 1.
