## Abstract
Diffusion models have established new state of the art in a multitude of computer vision tasks, including image restoration. Diffusion-based inverse problem solvers generate reconstructions of exceptional visual quality from heavily corrupted measurements. However, in what is widely known as the perception-distortion trade-off, the price of perceptually appealing reconstructions is often paid in declined distortion metrics, such as PSNR. Distortion metrics measure faithfulness to the observation, a crucial requirement in inverse problems.  In this work, we propose a novel framework for inverse problem solving, namely we assume that the observation comes from a stochastic degradation process that gradually degrades and noises the original clean image. We learn to reverse the degradation process in order to recover the clean image. Our technique maintains consistency with the original measurement throughout the reverse process, and allows for great flexibility in trading off perceptual quality for improved distortion metrics and sampling speedup via early-stopping.

### Summary
This paper proposes a diffusion model based method for inverse problem solving, with application to computer vision tasks such as image restoration. The authors consider a model that the observation is generated from a stochastic degradation process that gradually degrades the clean image, under which a model is learned to reverse the degradation process to restore the clean image. The proposed method is shown to maintain consistency with the original measurement in the reverse process. Moreover, an early-stopping scheme is adopted for distortion-perception tradeoff. Experimental results on synthetic deblurring and inpainting have been provided to demonstrate the better performance of the proposed method.

### Strengths
1. The proposed method is sound and the synthetic experimental results well verified the effectiveness of the proposed method.
2. It is shown the proposed method well maintains data consistency with the original measurement in the reverse process. Moreover, an early-stopping scheme to control the distortion-perception trade-off is proposed.
3. Analysis on the accuracy and limitations of the proposed method have been provided and verified by experimental results.

### Weaknesses
1. My main concern is that, while the proposed method is sound, it relies on an assumption that seems unrealistic. Specifically, it assumes the degradation model $A$ being a priori known, which is unrealistic in practical applications, even in the tasks of deblurring and inpainting considered in this paper. The provided experimental results are based on synthetic data, in which the degradation model $A$ can be easily specified. However, when considering practical tasks, I believe the proposed method would not perform satisfactorily, as it is hard or even impossible to accurately specify the degradation model $A$. The authors have not provided evaluation on practical tasks, e.g., practical deblurring and inpainting tasks, in comparison with representative methods.

2. The proposed perception-distortion tradeoff method by early-stopping the reverse process is quite straightforward and heuristic.

3. Experiment details are lacking in Appendix. It seems that the degradation function $A_t(·)$ is necessary in the training process. However, for the deblurring problem, $A(·)$ is unknown, only clean image $x$ and its degraded version $\hat{x}$ are available. How to design $A_t(·)$ with only $x$ and $\hat{x}$?

4. In equation (10), the network learns to reconstruct $A_t(x0)$ rather than directly reconstructing $x_0$ or noise, compared with DDPM. However, when the degradation function $A_t(·)$ is linear, it would be equivalent to reconstructing $x_0$. In some tasks, the degradation model $A(·)$ would be linear, for example, the blur function $y=k*x + n$ in the deblurring task, where $k$ is a blur kernel. How can the deblurring experiment show the superiority of Dirac over DDPM when the degradation model $A(·)$ is linear?

### Questions
1. There should be a space in “projectionSong”, line 11, the second paragraph of Introduction.
2. See the Weaknesses above.

### Summary
This paper introduces a framework for solving inverse problems by reversing a known stochastic degradation process. The main advantage of the method is that leads to a more clear compromise in the Perception-Distortion trade off than other works. The core of the method is to define a continuous path of the degradations from the high-quality to the low-quality observation (Definition 3.1). The idea is to reverse the analytical sthocastic degradation with a model trained for this specific purpose. The method is evaluated on a series of inverse problems on popular benchmarks.

### Strengths
* The paper addresses the interesting and relevant problem of solving inverse problems using a diffusion strategy.
* The paper is well written and the theoretical presentation is sound and clear.
* Experimental results show that the method performance is competitive to other relevant work.

### Weaknesses
 * Comparison and discussion to other relevant published work is not complete (see questions below)
* Experimental results compare the proposed method to general frameworks that do not require retraining for specific degradations. In that sense it should be more faire to compare to other methods that train a dedicated model for a given degradation process.

### Questions
The paper is in general well written. The two main concerns are related to the two main weknesses described below. That is:

1. **Comparison and discussion to published relevant work**. In particular, I would like the authors to comment how the presented work compares to Daras et al. (2022). It seems that Daras et al. (2022) can be used to solve inverse problems, in a non-blind formulation, similar to what this paper is proposing. Can the same strategy/sampling be used in this context? Additionally, I would like the authors to comment on how the present work compares to Delbracio and Milanfar (2023), since this work also discusses the advantage of their bridge formulation in terms of Perception-Distortion trade off. This work is also similar in the sense that requires to train a dedicated model for a specific degradation, and the convex combination formulation leads to a series of intermediate degraded images. This comment also applies to Bridge methods that are applied to solving inverse problems, as the one in Liu, G.H., et al $I^2$ SB: Image-to-Image Schr\" odinger Bridge, ICML 2023)

2. **Experimental results**. The experimental results should also include methods that require training of finetuning a diffusion prior for solving a specific inverse problems as what the authors are proposing. I wouuld like the authors to comment on this point

[After Rebuttal]

### Confidence
3: You are fairly confident in your assessment. It is possible that you did not understand some parts of the submission or that you are unfamiliar with some pieces of related work. Math/other details were not carefully checked.

### Summary
This paper is interesting. It proposes a new scheme using assumption that the observation comes from a stochastic degradation process that gradually degrades and noises the original clean image. By learning to reverse the degradation process in order to recover the clean image. The proposed technique maintains consistency with the original measurement throughout the reverse process, and allows for great flexibility in trading off perceptual quality for improved distortion metrics and sampling speedup via early-stopping. 
Experiemental results show better trade-offs between both perceptual and distortion metrics.

### Strengths
A novel framework by gradually degrading and noises the original clean image, and by learning to reverse the degradation process in order to recover the clean image.
New SOTA results show better trade-offs between both perceptual and distortion metrics.

### Weaknesses
Each degradation needs a re-training of the inverse network. 
Flexibility to extend to more complex image restoration tasks is unknown.

### Questions
Can this network be trained to tackle other types of degradations excluding paper's Guassian denoising and inpainting?

### Summary
The paper presents a method to solve inverse problems in imaging by means of denoising diffusion models. The main challenge with this lies in enforcing consistency with the forward model of the problem and controlling the distortion-perception tradeoff. The proposed approach maintains consistency with the measurements throughout the reverse diffusion process and can prioritize distortion or perception in the solutions depending on the number of iterations.

### Strengths
The paper is generally well-written and the method is sound. The technique used to enforce measurement consistency seems to outperform existing approaches in the same area. Overall, the method is a valuable contribution and has practical relevance for the solution of inverse problems.

### Weaknesses
As it is common for most papers on solving inverse problems with diffusion models, the experimental setting is rather limited. Only two degradations (deblurring and inpainting) have been studied so generalization to other ones is unclear (e.g. compressive sensing may exhibit significantly different behaviour). The selection of baselines in the comparion tables is reasonable but I would have added a state-of-the-art method from the supervised training literature (e.g. NAFNet from Chen et al. "Simple Baselines for Image Restoration") as a further reference prioritizing distortion.

### Questions
It would be interesting to know what happens under a mismatch of the degradation process between training and testing.
