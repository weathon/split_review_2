## Abstract
\label{sec: abstract}
Although large language models (LLMs) have achieved significant success in various tasks, they often struggle with hallucination problems, especially in scenarios requiring deep and responsible reasoning. These issues could be partially addressed by introducing external knowledge graphs (KG) in LLM reasoning. In this paper, we propose a new LLM-KG integrating paradigm ``$\hbox{LLM}\otimes\hbox{KG}$'' which treats the LLM as an agent to interactively explore related entities and relations on KGs and perform reasoning based on the retrieved knowledge. We further implement this paradigm by introducing a new approach called Think-on-Graph (ToG), in which the LLM agent iteratively executes beam search on KG, discovers the most promising reasoning paths, and returns the most likely reasoning results. We use a number of well-designed experiments to examine and illustrate the following advantages of ToG: 1) compared with LLMs, ToG has better deep reasoning power; 2) ToG has the ability of knowledge traceability and knowledge correctability by leveraging LLMs reasoning and expert feedback; 3) ToG provides a flexible plug-and-play framework for different LLMs, KGs and prompting strategies without any additional training cost; 4) the performance of ToG with small LLM models could exceed large LLM such as GPT-4 in certain scenarios and this reduces the cost of LLM deployment and application. As a training-free method with lower computational cost and better generality, ToG achieves overall SOTA in 6 out of 9 datasets where most previous SOTAs rely on additional training.

### Summary
This work aims at improving the integration of knowledge graphs (KGs) in LLMs. The authors propose a method called Think-on-Graph (ToG) that performs beam-search on knowledge graphs, keeping track and exploring reasoning paths. Specifically, they use a "search" operation backed by the KG and a "prune" operation backed by the LLM. Through the experiments on benchmarks of KBQA/open QA/etc, the authors find an advantage of ToG in several of them compared to prior work. They also perform analyses on the effect of individual components of ToG like the selection of KG, search depth, pruning method, etc.

### Strengths
This paper proposes an intuitive and novel method in LLM-KG integration. The experiments are performed on a variety of datasets. The performance of the method is overall positive. The analyses on each component of the method is extensive. The writing of the paper is overall clear.

### Weaknesses
The reliance on very strong (production-level) LLMs and the choice of baselines. The authors explored the use of Llama-2-chat (70b), ChatGPT, and GPT-4 as the LLM in the ToG method. From Table 1 and Table 2, it seems that the strength of the LLM is essential to the method (Llama worse than ChatGPT, ChatGPT much worse than GPT-4). And the performance advantage on 6 out of 9 benchmarks is only observed with GPT-4. Additionally, though the authors show GPT-4 benefits from ToG compared to non-KG prompting (e.g., CoT), stronger prompting methods targeting for compositionality may be investigated, for example, self-ask [1]. Web search and vanilla retrieval augmentation methods can also be investigated [2].

Efficiency of the method. The process of beam search and pruning with LLMs can be costly. An extensive comparison on decoding time and cost across all methods should be performed and discussed.

### Summary
The paper proposes ToG (Think-on-Graph) for deep, responsible, and efficient LLM reasoning with knowledge graphs with a new paradigm of "LLM×KG." The ToG is with the searching and pruning procedures to conduct deep reasoning. Empirical results on five KBQA datasets with extensive experiments justify the effectiveness of the proposed ToG method.

### Strengths
The paper is rather solid and detailed from a technical perspective.

The figures are clear and easy to understand.

The solution of LLM×KG is reasonable and new to the LLM community.

The depth and width of Toc are clearly investigated in the ablation study.

The limitations of the proposed method are extensively discussed in Appendix A.

Several technical details, case studies, and evaluation results are also elaborated on in the Appendix.

### Weaknesses
The writing of the paper can be largely improved.

Besides, the mathematical notations and equations can be improved to be clearer.
 
It would be better to summarize the frequently used notations in one table or sentence.

The empirical performance of ToG is not consistently the best, which is outperformed by the "prior finetune SOTA" in some cases of Tab. 1. Although not requiring training is a major benefit of ToG, its reasoning power is not fully convincing enough. I would suggest the paper make a further discussion and explanation for that.

Besides, the important baseline, "Prior Prompting SOTA" in Tab.1, is not sufficiently evaluated and compared. It would be much better and more convincing to fill in the blanks in Tab.1.

The paper mentions the hallucination problem many times and uses it as the motivation of ToG. However, the hallucination problem is not sufficiently studied. As far as I can see, there is only one preliminary analysis of error is provided in Appendix D.2.

The paper is empirically driven and lacks in-depth analysis, whether from methodological or theoretical perspectives.

### Questions
What is the running-time efficiency of ToG?

How do the KGs used in the experiment part solve the limitation of out-of-date knowledge?

The beam search with pruning adopted by ToG is quite relevant to the progressive reasoning methods equipped with learnable search and pruning mechanisms, which also come from the KG areas (e.g., AdaProp [1] and Astarnet [2]). I would suggest the paper have a discussion with these relevant works. In addition, is it possible to achieve a kind of learnable pruning as an enhancement of ToG?

### Summary
This paper presents a novel approach called Think-on-Graph (ToG) to synergize the LLMs and KGs for reasoning. ToG enables LLMs as agents to iteratively execute searches on KGs to discover promising reasoning paths, which are then used to guide the LLMs to generate accurate answers. ToG is a general framework that can be applied to various LLMs and KGs. Extensive experiments on several datasets show that ToG can significantly improve the reasoning performance of LLMs.

### Strengths
1. This paper is well-presented and easy to follow. The authors provide a clear motivation and a good introduction to the problem.

2. The proposed framework can be easily plugged into existing LLMs and KGs without incurring additional training costs.

3. Extensive experiments on several datasets show that ToG can significantly improve the reasoning performance of LLMs.

### Weaknesses
1. The computational cost of ToG is relatively high. The searching process of ToG involves multiple LLM calls, which may be costly and limit its practical applicability in some settings. The paper does not provide a detailed analysis of the computational overhead, such as the average number of LLM calls per query, the latency introduced by each call, and the overall cost in terms of API usage. This lack of concrete data makes it difficult to assess the practical feasibility of the approach, especially for real-time applications or large-scale datasets.

2. Some details are inconsistent in the paper. For example, in the approach introduction section, ToG selects the next step triples/relations based on current expended reasoning paths. However, in the prompt illustrated in G.3, I cannot find the current reasoning paths used for the pruning process. This discrepancy raises concerns about the clarity and accuracy of the method's description, making it hard to reproduce the results or implement the approach correctly. The paper needs to provide a more precise and consistent explanation of how the pruning process is performed.

3. I have concerns that ToG might not understand the meaning of relations well and generalize to different KGs. The relations defined in KGs are usually in diverse formats. For example, the relations in Freebase are defined in a hierarchical format, while the relations in Yago have clearer semantics. If the relations do not reveal the clear semantics, the searching process of ToG might be misled. The paper does not discuss how the LLM handles the diverse formats of relations in different KGs, and whether the performance of ToG is sensitive to the format of relations.

### Questions
1. Can the authors discuss the cost of ToG in detail? What is the average number of calls for the reasoning? What is the overall price for the ChatGPT/GPT-4 API calls?

2. Can the authors explain the inconsistency I discussed above and present a clear illustration of the whole reasoning process?

3. Can the authors explain how ToG can generalize to different KGs? How LLMs in ToG understand the meaning of relations in different KGs without additional training?

4. Can other search algorithms be used for ToG? For example, depth-first search, breadth-first search, A* search, etc.

5. Can ToG be used to solve complex reasoning problems that cannot be solved by path-based reasoning? For example, in GrailQA, there are questions like: "How many TV programs has Bob Boyett created?". This question needs to count the KG structures to get the answer. Besides, there are other complex questions requiring intersection, union, and negation operations. Can ToG be used to solve these kinds of questions? Maybe a limitations section can be added to the paper.

### Summary
This paper presents an LLM-KG integration paradigm to incorporate structural knowledge stored in KGs in LLMs reasoning, namely Think-on-Graph (ToG). ToG makes LLM serve as an agent to walk on KGs by iteratively searching and pruning relations and entities from KGs. Experiments show that ToG could enhance the LLM’s reasoning capabilities and achieve SOTA on 6 datasets. ToG also exhibits knowledge traceability and correctability to improve KG quality.

### Strengths
1. Good written paper, very easy to read.
2. Strong experimental performance, achieving SOTA on 6 datasets without training.
3. The motivation is strong and clear, incorporating external knowledge (KGs) would be an important problem to enhance LLMs.

### Weaknesses
1. I believe it would be interesting to see the ToG performance when encountering the knowledge conflict between external KG knowledge and parametric knowledge stored in LLMs, which is an aspect to test the robustness of ToG.
2. I am concerned that ToG would bring too many intermediate steps and cause high latency in reasoning and expensive deployment, especially when using API-based black-box models like GPT-4. The iterative nature of the graph traversal, involving multiple calls to the LLM for relation and entity selection, could lead to significant overhead. This is especially concerning when each API call incurs a cost, making the method potentially impractical for large-scale applications.
3. It would be interesting to see the performance of ToG when incorporating the KGs of low quality (sparsity, noisy, etc), since most KGs are sparse and out of date to some extent. So investigating the impact of KG quality would enhance the understanding of ToG method and its limitations. The method's reliance on the KG's completeness and accuracy is a potential vulnerability. If the KG is missing crucial information or contains incorrect facts, the reasoning process could be severely hampered, leading to incorrect conclusions. A sensitivity analysis of KG quality would be beneficial.
4. I would encourage authors to present experiment results on small LLMs, such as 7B and 13B.
