## Abstract
We present \Ours, a multimodal foundation model that seamlessly generates images and text in multimodal context.
This omnivore model can take in any single-modality or multimodal data input indiscriminately (\eg, interleaved image, text and video) through a one-model-for-all autoregressive training process.
First, visual signals are encoded into embeddings, and together with text tokens form an interleaved input sequence.
\Ours is end-to-end trained with a unified objective of classifying the next text token or regressing the next visual embedding in the multimodal sequence.
This versatile multimodality empowers the leverage of diverse pretraining data sources at scale, such as videos with interleaved frames and text, webpages with interleaved images and text, as well as web-scale image-text pairs and video-text pairs.
\Ours can serve as a generalist multimodal interface for both image-to-text and text-to-image tasks, supporting in-context image and text generation. 
Across a broad range of zero-shot/few-shot tasks including image captioning, visual question answering, video question answering and text-to-image generation, \Ours demonstrates superb performance compared to state-of-the-art large multimodal models.
Extended capabilities such as multimodal assistants via instruction tuning are also demonstrated with impressive performance.

4: You are confident in your assessment, but not absolutely certain. It is unlikely, but not impossible, that you did not understand some parts of the submission or that you are unfamiliar with some pieces of related work.

### Summary
The paper presents a novel large multimodal model, Emu that takes as input the interleaved visual and textual data and generates images and text. The key contributions of the paper are three-folds: leveraging web-scale video data as a new source of interleaved data, proposing a novel objective of predicting-the-next-element in an unified autoregressive manner, and the model architecture enabling learning under such objective. The pretrained, or instruct-tuned models show remarkable performance on diverse multimodal tasks, which are shown qualitatively and quantitatively in the paper.

### Strengths
+ I agree with that the importance of video as a data source for learning large multimodal models has been overlooked so far. Leveraging videos as interleaved data will definitely provide much diverse supervision signals and facilitate scaling up training data
+ The writing and presentation of the paper is really good. The paper is overall well-written and easy to read. Especially, the authors describe all the details of the model architecture and training/inference procedures.
+ The experimental results validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

### Weaknesses
Emu applies the regression loss to latent embeddings computed by the Causal Transformer, whose parameters are randomly initialized and also learned during pretraining. I was surprised that the training went well with the proposed objective, because I think that without additional constraints, the model may easily fall into a degenerate case, like the Causal Transformer always outputting constant vectors. Please elaborate on the mechanism of the proposed l2 regression loss.

### Questions
I am not sure about the composition of each mini-batch: does each mini-batch comprise heterogeneous samples with a batch size of 128+128+64+16+16=352, or homogeneous samples with a batch size of at most 128? And the authors said that they pretranied Emu only for 10k steps while the total number of training samples is 82M. This means that the model has seen at most 4.3% of the training data during pretraining. Is this a typo? otherwise, please explain how it was possible to learn so well with such a small amount of data.

### Summary
The paper introduces "Emu", a multimodal foundation model adept at generating both images and text in a multimodal context. Unlike traditional models that focus solely on text, Emu can accept various data inputs, including image, text, and video, through a unified autoregressive training process. Visual data is converted into embeddings, which, when combined with text tokens, form an integrated input sequence. The model's training objective is to either classify the next text token or regress the next visual embedding in this sequence. Emu's strength lies in its ability to utilize a wide range of pretraining data sources, such as videos combined with text or web pages with intermingled images and text. This versatility makes Emu suitable for tasks like image captioning, visual question answering, and text-to-image generation, where it outperforms other leading multimodal models. Emu's advanced features include in-context generation of text and images, image blending, video comprehension, and knowledge grounding. The model's effectiveness is further showcased as a multimodal assistant that can interact with users using both text and visuals.

### Strengths
The model shows ability to do versatile generation and strong in-context learning capability.

### Weaknesses
Certain model details is not clear:
1. How does causal transformer convert an image as multiple visual tokens. In section 2, is {z_1, z_2, ... z_N} the same as g(I).
2. Is the N visual embeddings for the image decoder the same as the visual ebmedding after the causal transformer.

Potential data issue impact the "zero-shot" restult:
EMU is trained with Laion-COCO, which has image caption in the style of COCO. How does that impact results in table 1? Is the zero-shot results as good if removing Laion-COCO?

Miss baselines:
Other multimodal baselines for FID such as https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.02591 should be added to table 2.

Suboptimal image generation capbility:
As shown in table2, there is performance loss due to regression to visual embeddings, instead of directly optimizing generating the best images.

### Questions
what is the FID before and after the visual decoding training?

### Summary
The paper presents a novel multimodal foundation model named Emu, designed to handle both images and text in a multimodal context. The primary innovation lies in its autoregressive training process which can accommodate single-modality or multimodal data inputs like images, text, and video. Visual signals are initially encoded into embeddings, which, along with text tokens, form an interleaved input sequence. Emu is trained end-to-end with a unified objective which alternates between classifying the next text token and regressing the next visual embedding within the multimodal sequence. This model's flexibility allows it to harness diverse pretraining data sources, including videos with interleaved frames and text, webpages with interleaved images and text, as well as web-scale image-text pairs and video-text pairs. By doing so, it demonstrates superior performance across a range of zero-shot and few-shot tasks like image captioning, visual question answering, and text-to-image generation.

Emu's architecture is divided into four components: the Visual Encoder, Causal Transformer, Multimodal Modeling, and Visual Decoder. The Visual Encoder and Causal Transformer handle the conversion of images and videos into a format compatible with the Multimodal Modeling LLM (Large Language Model). Specifically, the visual data is first encoded into dense visual features, which are then transformed into a fixed number of visual causal embeddings. These visual causal embeddings, along with text tokens, are fed into the Multimodal Modeling LLM, which performs unified autoregressive modeling. Post-training, a Visual Decoder is fine-tuned to convert visual embeddings back into realistic images. The training data spans web-scale collections of image-text pairs, video-text pairs, interleaved image-text data, and interleaved video-text data, with Emu being pretrained on these multimodal data sequences under a unified objective of predicting the next element in a multimodal sequence.

The evaluation of Emu covered a broad spectrum of vision-language tasks, demonstrating its effectiveness and superior performance in comparison to other large multimodal models in many instances. In zero-shot evaluations, Emu showcased remarkable results in tasks like COCO captioning and VizWiz VQA. In few-shot evaluations, Emu continued to exhibit strong performance across various image and video question answering tasks. The qualitative evaluation also underlined Emu's real-world knowledge grounding, detailed video understanding, and in-context text-to-image generation capabilities. Moreover, the paper also explores an "in-the-wild" evaluation and instruction tuning to align Emu with human instructions further. Through its innovative architecture and comprehensive evaluation, Emu lays down a significant milestone in the journey towards more capable and versatile multimodal AI models.

### Strengths
- The paper is well-organized and the problem is clearly defined. The authors provide a comprehensive introduction to the problem and the proposed solution, Emu, which appears to be novel and well thought out.

- The unified objective for both text and visual data seems to be a promising approach to handle multimodal tasks, and the autoregressive training process is well justified.

- The authors have undertaken extensive evaluations including zero-shot, few-shot, and in-the-wild evaluations, showcasing the model's performance across a variety of tasks. The performance of Emu, particularly in zero-shot tasks, appears to be impressive and competitive with other state-of-the-art models.

- The qualitative evaluation provided a good insight into the model's capabilities in real-world scenarios, which is a strong point of this paper. It’s interesting to see the model's performance in text-to-image generation, image blending, and real-world knowledge grounding.

- Incorporation of various pre-training data sources, including videos with subtitles and image-text interleaved data, could contribute to the model's strong performance and is a positive aspect of this work.

### Weaknesses
 - The paper misses some key and very relevant comparative works like Cm3Leon (https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.02591), AnyMAL(https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.16058) etc. These papers should be compared against and explained how the authors work differes from the same.
- It would be beneficial to see a discussion on the scalability of Emu with respect to the size and diversity of training data, and how the model might perform with fewer resources or less diverse data.
- Autoregressive models are know to be notoriously slow at inference time due to the sequential nature of their execution. A comparative study of the same and ideas to make it better could help the paper.
- The image generation models are capable of generating harmful content like pornography, child abuse etc. These also have human faces which are not in compliance with privacy laws in several states and countries and the authors dont talk about taking any steps to ensure compliance to the same. This should potentially be addressed to ensure the model isnt misused.

### Questions
- The paper could benefit from a deeper discussion on the limitations of Emu, and potential strategies for overcoming these limitations in future work. Maybe the authors can add the same?

### Summary
This paper presents Emu, a foundation model designed for multimodal tasks, capable of handling text, image, and video inputs. It uses a unified autoregressive training approach to encode visual signals and text tokens into an interleaved sequence. Trained on diverse data sources, Emu is versatile in both image-to-text and text-to-image tasks, and performs well in zero-shot and few-shot inference. It also shows promise in extended applications like multimodal assistants, using instruction tuning.

### Strengths
- It is a strong paper that investigates a unified multimodal pre-training recipe on creating generative model that inputs and produces interleaved image and text sequence, capable of multimodal understanding and image generation.
- The model is comprehensively evaluated, on a wide variety of tasks, both generative and discriminative.

### Weaknesses
 - The comparison of image-text and video-text tasks should be also made with other state-of-the-art multimodal models, such as GPT-4V, PaLI-X (55B). It is okay to underperform given that those models are (likely) larger in the model size. The important part is to give reader a full picture of how this work compares to those important (private) models

 - The paper does not evaluate, analyze or discuss the potential bias the model could have learned from the data. Particularly given that it is also an image generation model, I am wondering if language bias could be transferred to visual domain. For example, we know that in NLP,  programmer is often higher correlated to male, and I wonder if such situation would also transfer to the text-to-image generation. If you prompt the model to generate 'a programmer standing in front of Googleplex', how often would it be male vs. female?

### Questions
- I am curious if the pre-trained model can do more complex tasks such as the in-context subject-driven generation introduced in the paper [1]. Given that the model is general enough to handle prompts such as "Given the a few images about a common subject {subject_name}: {image_1}, {image_2}, {image_3}. Generate a new rendition of this same subject, in the Hall of Mirrors in Versailles.". If would be amazing if such complex task can be done in zero-shot.
