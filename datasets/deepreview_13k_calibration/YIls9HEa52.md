## Abstract
Unsupervised methods for dimensionality reduction of neural activity and behavior have provided unprecedented insights into the underpinnings of neural information processing. One popular approach involves the recurrent switching linear dynamical system (rSLDS) model, which describes the latent dynamics of neural spike train data using discrete switches between a finite number of low-dimensional linear dynamical systems. However, a few properties of rSLDS model limit its deployability on trial-varying data, such as a fixed number of states over trials, and no latent structure or organization of states. Here we overcome these limitations by endowing the rSLDS model with a semi-Markov discrete state process, with latent geometry, that captures key properties of stochastic processes over partitions with flexible state cardinality. We leverage partial differential equations (PDE) theory to derive an efficient, semi-parametric formulation for dynamical sufficient statistics to the discrete states. This process, combined with switching dynamics, defines our infinite recurrent switching linear dynamical system (irSLDS) model class. We first validate and demonstrate the capabilities of our model on synthetic data. Next, we turn to the analysis of mice electrophysiological data during decision-making, and uncover strong non-stationary processes underlying both within-trial and trial-averaged neural activity.

### Summary
This work presents an addition to recurrent switching state-space models by using PDEs to develop an input-driven prior that induces state geometry over the HMM while still retaining its recurrent capability. The proposed infinite recurrent switching linear dynamical system (irSLDS) allows for more expressible and flexible state cardinality over a fixed number of discrete states while yielding fewer parameters compared to previous HMM models but greater performance on two time-varying datasets: NASCAR and the “Brainwide map” dataset from the International Brain Laboratory. This is achieved by differentiating the influence functions of each state using the heat equation as a spatial smoothness prior. The forward difference of the time derivative and central difference approximation to the second order spatial partial derivative are utilized to retrieve an infinite prior for the dynamics of the influence functions and sampled to compose the overall discrete state process.

### Strengths
The paper's originality derives from improvements it makes in the class of AR-HMM and SLDS models by removing exchangeability without removing input recurrence. This enables greater efficiency with expressibility. Overall, this work nicely integrates the heat-equation generalization and recurrent switching state space models. They present overall improvements on two different experiments with greater efficiency of parameters. Visuals are strong, particularly ones pertaining to the flow fields and the switching states of the rSLDS and irSLDS.

### Weaknesses
Most of the comparisons are done between rSLDS and irSLDS, yet the results are not convincing and substantially novel in the experiments conducted. If the authors are adamant about just comparing these two models, then it would be nice to see comparisons at greater scales instead of just testing 4-8 states for NASCAR and the IBL experiments. The results at just these scales do not appear novel.
Furthermore, both experiments show that the irSLDS models uncovered switching at task-relevant states, yet it isn't clear why adding the heat equation prior itself is the best choice in discovering this switching. The authors discuss their reasons for using the heat equations but don't explain further into infinite priors that possibly could have achieved the same if not more.
The efficient of the parallel scan is not clear. Other works that utilize scans to efficiently compute the transition probabilities such as S4D (Gu et al., 2022), DSS (Gupta et al., 2022), S5 (Smith et al., 2023) are done on diagonalized transition matrices. The connection to the parallelization of the linear dynamics in Equation 8 is unclear since the transition matrix in this work is not diagonalized, so this work does not reap the same computational benefits that they claim, and their algorithm cannot scale effectively since it incurs cubic cost.

### Questions
Smith et al. is cited in reference to the use of a scan operation to compute transition probabilities. However, S5 assumes a diagonal state matrix to efficiently compute the linear recurrence which takes a different form than the time-varying transition matrices in this work. How can this scan method scale efficiently?
Why does the heat equation prior directly enable discovery of greater fluctuations/switching in the data? Can you attribute the performance gains to this specific infinite prior?
Why not compare to other linear state space models and generalize outside of rSLDS and irSLDS that can allow for input-dependent transitions and recurrent relations without the explicit use of the influence functions as a geometric prior?

### Summary
The authors proposed a novel infinite recurrent switching linear dynamical system (irSLDS) model, which combines partial differential equations (PDE) theory, semi-parametric formulation, and switching dynamical models. The authors validate and demonstrate the capabilities of their model on simulated data, and compare their model with existing popular methods. Finally, they use the model to explore mouse electrophysiological data during decision-making and uncover strong non-stationary processes underlying both within-trial and trial-averaged neural activity.

### Strengths
The authors introduced an influence function of the states in switching linear dynamical systems, which controls the switches between discrete states by adding time-dependent parameters to constrain the duration of a state, and a space smoothness prior to the influence function.

### Weaknesses
How is the smoothness prior determined? In the paper, the authors state “Each time a discrete state j is chosen, “nearby” states also become more probable at the next time step”, it may be better to show the comparison with no smoothness or other smoothness formulations. 

The prior based on dist-CRP is sensitive to time, what if there is a state with a long duration in the real dynamics? Or what if the dynamics are influenced by time a lot, such as in a Lorenz attractor?

How was the upper bound of K in irSLDS determined? Since the method is called infinite rSLDS, can the K be very large?

Clarity:
In 4.2 paragraph3, “we fit a spline to this curve a ...” seems to have a typo.

### Summary
The authors propose a method for fitting dynamical models onto neural data that estimates the latent state of the system/organism.  A commonly used approach in the recent years is to fit a recurrent switching linear model, that approximates the latent dynamics with a finite set of low dimensional linear systems, where the system state is assumed to switch at discrete points between these discrete states. However this formalism requires stationary dynamics across all trials and does not impose any geometry on the discrete latent state space. Here the authors propose an extension to the recurrent switching linear systems, by considering that the evolution between the discreet states follow a Markov process itself (a distance-dependent Chinese restaurant process). To perform inference on the proposed model, they introduce a time-dependent sufficient statistic for the discrete state, the influence function, that is assumed to follow the heat (PDE) equation. The advantage of this statistic is that it is deterministically determined given the latent discrete state and the observations, and therefore does not arise in the posterior inference. Thus the authors can apply existing variational Laplace-EM proposed for these type of models like in Zoltowski et al. (2020). 

They validate their approach on a synthetic dataset devised to imitate o stationary discrete latent state dynamics, and on an neural electrophysiology dataset from IBL with neural recordings from mice performing  a decision-making task.

Overall the paper is very well written and is a sound extetion to the existing literature of switching linear dynamical systems.

### Strengths
- They endow the switching linear dynamical system framework with a latent discrete-state Markov structure that allows the continuous state of the system to guide the discrete state switches.
- The proposed formalism induces a geometry in the discrete latent state between switches. 
- The paper is very well written providing a very well constructed introduction and build-up to their proposed extention.

### Weaknesses
 - The resulting computations for this model are considerably more expensive compared to the previous approaches recurrent switching linear system framework, however this might be the tradeoff of dealing with non-stationarity.

 - In Figure 3 F lower,  irSLDS identifies the state 2, although it does predict (as I understand from the absence of orange dots) that the discrete state of the system was never at that state through the trials. Isn’t that strange? Shouldn’t the framework have estimated 7 states in total for this dataset?

- In the NASCAR experiment, can you provide the same plot as in Figure 2F that shows the sequence of the identified states also for the rSLDS?

- What are the limitations for considering Poisson instead of Gaussian observation process for the irSLDS framework?

- I understand that in the caption of Figure 1 you do not want to write out the full abbreviated terms, but you can at least provide a hyperlink to their mention in the main text for the reader to follow.

### Summary
This paper builds upon the recurrent switching linear dynamical system (rSLDS) in the context of modeling latent dynamics of neural spike train data. The infinite recurrent SLDS (irSLDS) is proposed to overcome the fixed number of discrete states in the rSLDS, which can limit its capabilities on trial-varying data that may require a varying number of states. Prior methods have proposed using Dirichlet processes to infer the number of states from the data, often using a Chinese Restaurant Process (CRP). But this is limited in the rSLDS case, since the CRP has exchangeability assumptions which the state-dependence of the rSLDS breaks. The proposed method introduces a sufficient statistic to express the cluster allocations of a distance-dependent Chinese Restaurant Process (dist-CRP) which can be used to address the exchangeability issue and determine the discrete state switching probabilities. This sufficient statistic is implemented following a heat-equation combined with finite difference methods, resulting in linear recurrences. The proposed irSLDS is compared with SLDS and rSLDS on a synthetic NASCAR experiment and compared to the rSLDS on Neuropixel data recorded from mice.

### Strengths
- For the most part, the paper is clear and presented well

- The method is motivated well. In the scientific community, there is a strong desire for models that are both expressive and interpretable that can be used to gain insights into data, e.g. neural spike trains.  While rSLDS has been popular in this regard, addressing its weakness of having a fixed number of states is of interest to the community

- The idea to characterize the distance-dependent CRP in the context of SLDS with a heat equation appears (to my knowledge) to be novel and is an interesting idea that seems to lead to a relatively straightforward implementation (the basic implementation of the code in the appendix is also appreciated).

- The considered experiments appear to show that the irSLDS can have a performance/interpretability edge in practice and can potentially lead to insights that rSLDS cannot

### Weaknesses
 - The paper would benefit from providing a bit more context/intuition behind the Polya-gamma approach in Section 3.1 and its weaknesses. Just reading this section currently does not make it as clear why the approach in section 3.2 is necessary. Section C.1 in the appendix is helpful. Perhaps a bit more details about the Gaussians with time-dependent sizes could be added to the main paper to make this point more clear?

- The experimental results are the biggest weakness of the paper. It is not currently obvious that a practitioner should clearly reach for irSLDS as the preferred method.
  -  Are there other datasets (synthetic or real) that could be added to make the benefits of irSLDS more clear? 
   - Can the extended NASCAR example be made more extreme (e.g. more states) to make the differences between irSLDS and rSDLS more apparent? It is not clear that the differences in test log-likelihood are that drastic (and there do not appear to be underlying states of rSDLS displayed to compare to)
   - Why not also show rSLDS continuous states in Figure 2.E? I would expect these to not look good (unlike in Figure 2.D where rSLDS and irSLDS look similar) and think highlighting this would be helpful

- It is claimed in Section 3.3 that irSLDS has a similar time complexity to rSLDS. It would be nice to see some kind of empirical runtime comparison to support this. How does this change when choosing different upper bounds of $K$?

- Related to the 2 previous points above, it seems 2 potentially simple baselines would be an rSLDS with a large number of states or alternatively performing a grid search with rSLDS over different state sizes. On the other hand, given the flexibility of irSLDS, I would think it should be able to achieve better performance than these 2 baselines in one-shot. Instead, it seems the same amount of grid search was done for each method over the number of states. Alternatively, if either of these two baselines still takes less time/cost than running irSLDS (this is where the empirical runtime comparison comes in), then it seems perhaps rSLDS would be preferable for a practitioner in many cases? I think empirical evidence to resolve these doubts, both in terms of the empirical runtime under different scenarios and the time/cost per methods to achieve strong results, would strengthen the paper.

### Questions
For major points, see weaknesses above. 

Additional questions/comments:

- In Table 1, can you make it more clear what the true number of states in the system are and what size $K$ is used by the models? I believe the number currently listed is the true number of states in the system, but it is unclear what $K$ was chosen for the models.

- Unless I am missing something, I believe the last paragraph of Section 3.3 has an error regarding the computational complexity of the sequential vs parallel versions of the algorithm. It is stated that the sequential scan requires $\mathcal{O}(K^3T)$ ops, but shouldn't this be  $\mathcal{O}(K^2T)$ ops? This is because it requires $T$ sequential matrix-vector multiplications (compared to the cubic cost of matrix-matrix multiplications of the parallel version of the scan). Thus the choice of parallel vs sequential scan would be dependent on the state size and sequence length, since the cubic cost could grow quite large for larger state sizes.

- This paper https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.01256 seems relevant to infinite switching states and could be cited as related work

5: You are absolutely certain about your assessment. You are very familiar with the related work and checked the math/other details carefully.

### Summary
This work extends the rSLDS. It embeds the latent modes (discrete states) in Euclidean space with PDE, and endows the former nominal states with geometry. The proposed method was validated on synthetic data and real neural recordings. The results show that the proposed method better captures the change of dynamics on nonstationary DS.

### Strengths
This work shows good performance for nonstationary systems.
The extension brings up new interpretations on the discrete states.

### Weaknesses
rSLDS has the intuition of partitioning the latent space into regions that are governed by different linear DS individually, and the resultant nonlinear DS globally. It's not very suitable to do comparison on a nonstationary system. The goodness of fit numbers do not show irSLDS significantly outperform rSLDS. It seems better state inference does not help much with explaining the data.

In the extended NASCAR example
- Why the trajectory is not smooth? The bias is too large?
- Why not show MSE for extended NASCAR in Tab 1.

It would be more convincing to see the discrete state inference from continuous recording for real nonstationary system.
