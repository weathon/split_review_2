### Summary
This paper proposes an offline tracking framework with object permanence to reduce the expensive labor cost in labeling large-scale autonomous driving datasets. The proposed approach can be briefly summarised as several steps: 1) applying the off-the-shell detector and tracker to generate initial tracklets; 2) using the Re-ID module for tracklet association; 3) employing the track completion module for trajectory completion. Specifically, the effectiveness of the model is validated on the nuScenes validation split.

### Strengths
- This paper aims to solve an essential problem in autonomous driving dataset labelling.
- Quantitative and qualitative results show some superiority of the proposed approach over the compared approaches.

### Weaknesses
 - The technical contribution is limited. The proposed approach heavily relies on off-the-shell detectors/tracker, and are inspired from existing approaches a lot (especially for the track completion module), which seems not significant enough as the main contributions by considering the object permanence conception had already been proposed in previous works [1]. Specifically, the paper doesn't clearly articulate how their method innovates beyond simply combining existing components. The track completion module, in particular, appears to be a direct adaptation of existing techniques, lacking a novel methodological contribution. The core idea of leveraging object permanence for tracking is not new, and the paper fails to demonstrate a unique application or extension of this concept.
- Missing details about the training hyper-parameters for reproduction. The paper lacks crucial information regarding the training process, such as learning rates, batch sizes, optimization algorithms, and specific data augmentation techniques used. This absence of detail makes it difficult, if not impossible, for other researchers to reproduce the results, hindering the scientific value of the work. Furthermore, the specific configurations of the off-the-shelf detectors and trackers are not clearly specified, which further limits reproducibility.
- The proposed approach does not show significant improvements over the compared Immortal tracker (See Tables 1-3). Is there any specifically design in Immortal tracker making the comparison unfair? Otherwise, it cannot effectively show the superiority of the proposed approach in this paper. The results presented in Tables 1-3 do not convincingly demonstrate a clear advantage over the Immortal tracker. The performance differences are marginal, raising questions about the practical significance of the proposed method. The paper should provide a more in-depth analysis of the Immortal tracker's design and implementation to justify the comparison and highlight the unique advantages of the proposed approach. Without this, the comparison appears to be weak, and the claimed superiority remains unsubstantiated.

### Summary
To track occluded objects, this paper proposes an offline tracking framework, including an online tracker to generate initial tracklets, a reid module to associate tracklets, and a track completion module to complete the fragmented tracks. Through aggregating and decoding outputs from several different encoders, the track completion model will output the final refined trajectory. Experiments are performed on nuScenes dataset with different evaluation setups.

### Strengths
1. The proposed framework is novel, which embeds both the motion and lane map to obtain the final matching matrix, and also fuses the time query embeddings to implement the trajectory regression.
2. This paper evaluates the proposed method under different evaluation setups, which demonstrate the effectiveness of the method more clearly in addressing occlusion situations.

### Weaknesses
Unfortunately, the paper is difficult to understand for the reader. Many details are presented in a course to a more detailed manner.
After reading the paper, it is not clear what exactly the contribution is. The idea of using object permanence for tracking has been introduced previously (Tokmakov et al.). The three steps of MOT are not new (Zhang, Li, Nevatia, Global Data Association for Multi-Object Tracking Using Network Flows, 2012).
The neural models seem novel. However, the claim in the abstract that the new models improve IDS by 45% is not confirmed by the experimental results. Table 2 shows the causal MOT of Wang et al., 2021 with 109 IDS better than the proposed method with 147+ depending on the version. The performance measures do not show significant evidence for improvement over the causal MOT approach, neither for table 1 nor for table 3.

### Questions
The issues I am concerned about are listed in order in the above "Weaknesses". I'll change my rating if the authors explain the first two issues well.

### Summary
This paper proposes a non-causal MOT technique for labelling large datasets in autonomous driving without human intervention. The technique reconsiders three well-known steps: 1) finding tracklets using causal MOT, 2) associating those tracklets by Re-ID and 3) trajectory completion compensating occlusions. The authors propose novel neural models for each step, including bipartite matching for association. The paper is well structured and readable; the literature research at least shows recent work to compare with.

### Strengths
The paper shows an elaborated approach to noncausal MOT. The neural models used seem innovative and novel and the attempt to combine tracklet association with a priori knowledge of lane maps in one end-to-end framework is promising.

### Weaknesses
The paper has limited novelty. The tracker, Re-ID, and track completion components all employ established techniques, resulting in a relatively straightforward solution.



### Questions
Considering the result of your experiments, as shown in table 1 - 3, why is the proposed method superior to the compared causal trackers?
Why is the proposed method better suited for offline labelling than the online trackers?
Does the proposed methods with approx. AMOTP 0.603 and IDS 145 allow the labelling of datasets?

### Summary
The paper introduces an offline tracking method utilizing point clouds, specifically designed to handle challenging heavy occlusions on vehicles. This method comprises three key components: a tracker, a Re-ID module for linking trackless segments before and after occlusions, and a track completion module that interpolates missing tracks caused by occlusions. The study showcases the method's efficacy in tracking objects even under conditions of occlusion.

### Strengths
The paper proposes a method to handle the occluded object tracking.

### Weaknesses
The paper has limited novelty. The tracker, Re-ID, and track completion components all employ established techniques, resulting in a relatively straightforward solution.

### Questions
1. In tracklet association, there appears to be a division between the utilization of map and motion data. However, it's worth considering their complementary contributions. For instance, map information could enhance the accuracy of motion association. Separating these aspects might lead to a loss of crucial information.
2. Appearance features could serve as a pivotal factor in tracklet association. Even when an object becomes temporarily occluded and untrackable, its re-emergence could still benefit from utilizing appearance data for accurate association.
3. Considering the use of map information, it's important to assess its impact on association when an object undergoes occlusion and a simultaneous lane change. This scenario introduces an additional layer of complexity that warrants thorough investigation.
