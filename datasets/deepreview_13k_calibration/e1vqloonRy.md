## Abstract
Few neural architectures lend themselves to provable learning with gradient based methods. One popular model is the single-index model, in which labels are produced by composing an unknown linear projection with a possibly unknown scalar link function. Learning this model with SGD is relatively well-understood, whereby the so-called information exponent of the link function governs a polynomial sample complexity rate.  However, extending this analysis to deeper or more complicated architectures remains challenging.

In this work, we consider single index learning in the setting of symmetric neural networks.  Under analytic assumptions on the activation and maximum degree assumptions on the link function, we prove that gradient flow recovers the hidden planted direction, represented as a finitely supported vector in the feature space of power sum polynomials.  We characterize a notion of information exponent adapted to our setting that controls the efficiency of learning.

### Summary
The paper analyzes single-index learning, especially when the underlying teacher model has permutation invariance and the student model is a variant of the DeepSets architecture. 
The paper shows that under the squared Vandermonde density over a complex domain, the hidden direction (of a finite support in the power-sum polynomials feature space) can be recovered up to an $s$-th root of unity via the gradient flow applied for a variant of correlation loss with regularization loss, where $s$ is the information exponent. A provably good initialization scheme is also provided as well as a concrete form of a good activation function that meets the regularity condition.

### Strengths
- Understanding convergence of a neural network training with gradient-based methods is an important problem, and this paper provides a new theoretical framework that admits a clean analysis. The problem setting and techniques may be useful for further work in this line of study.
- The paper is well written overall. I am new to this area, but I was able to understand a high-level landscape of the previous works and the contribution of this work compared to the existing works. Though there are several simplifying assumptions on the teacher network, the input distribution, the loss function, and etc., the rationale behind them are clearly explained and discussed appropriately. The reasonings behind the choice of loss functions and the assumptions are well thought out and helpful.
- A technical difficulty in a SGD analysis is also insightful.

### Weaknesses
 - There are several assumptions that limit the applicability of the framework, though they are properly discussed. Proposition 2.3 is the key technique that governs the whole technical assumptions including the assumption on the link function (Assumption 2.4). It is unclear for me as a newbie reader to this field how much it is restrictive and whether this can be relaxed. Any further discussion would be appreciated.
- Though the paper starts with the single-index learning, it seems that the framework deviates from the framework by considering a different link function in the final form of the modified correlation loss in eq. (14). I found it quite confusing at first sight. After this modification, is this technically qualified as a single-index learning?

### Questions
Minor suggestions
- After eq. (6), "In other words" sounds confusing. It might be better to explicitly say that the first-layer weights ($\{a_1,\ldots,a_M\}$) and the third-layer weight (the function $g$) will be fixed (frozen), and the second-layer weight ($w$) will be the only trainable parameter.
- In Corollary 4.7, delete "And" before "Consider".
- Please consider different notation for the summary statistics in Theorem 4.1 other than $m$ as it clashes with its other usage as an index.
- The usage of $\inf$ in the definition of the information exponent seems unnecessary.  
- Figure 1 can be much improved. For examples, y-axes can be shifted to hide unused range.

### Summary
This paper studies the problem of studying single-index functions on the feature space given by power-sum polynomials.
Thus, all of the teacher functions fall into the class of symmetric functions, which are those functions such that f(x1,...,xn).

Under a specific data distribution that allows for an inner product with nice orthogonality properties, this paper analyzes the gradient flow of learning with a student model under the correlation loss.

An information exponent (similar to Ben arous et al.), plus the initial correlation with the ground truth, is shown to upper-bound the time needed to learn.

### Strengths
The presentation is clear and easy to follow.

The problem of provable guarantees for the dynamics of learning symmetric functions has not been studied as far as I know, so this can be of interest to the community.

Related literature is covered well.

The analysis seems correct.

### Weaknesses
1) "These dynamics naturally motivate the question of learning efficiency, measured in convergence rates in time in the
case of gradient flow". Does this say anything about sample complexity when discretized? Because gradient flow time can be rescaled, so it doesn't appear to be a well-defined complexity measure?

2) Can you prove a converse to Theorem 4.2 with corresponding lower bounds on the time? This seems doable and like it would strengthen the result to make it more of a characterization.

3) It is unclear to me what is conceptually new in this work that does not appear in previous analyses of single-index learning?
* (a) the teacher model / student model are single-index models, but on a different data distribution than usual. But this has a similar inner product to what allows analyzing the Gaussian case.
* (b) the analysis of the single-index model appears to follow a now-standardized template. Would be interesting for the authors to highlight what are the new elements, or how this generalizes the currently-known techniques.



### Questions
See questions in the weaknesses section.
Also:
4) It is unclear to me what I am supposed to be learning from the experiments in Figure 1. How does the initial alignment of the model correspond to the gradient flow time in these cases?

Typos:
* "The former assumptions essentially corresponds"
* "any other works that demonstrates"
* "dynamcis"
* Assumption 4.4(iv) seems like it should be Omega(sqrt(N)) instead of O(sqrt(N)); Lemma 4.5 should be exp(-Omega(N)) instead of exp(-O(N)), and similarly for Lemma 4.6; other places including in the appendix there are some Omega(.) vs O(.) issues

### Summary
This paper studies the convergence guarantees of gradient flow for the problem of retrieving the unknown parameters of a symmetric single index model with a known analytic link function, under appropriate assumptions on the distribution of the features, which are complex vectors. It is shown that gradient flow on some appropriately defined loss function based on a DeepSets student model structure converges to a student model whose parameters are highly correlated with the ground truth, in time that scales logarithmically with the approximation error parameter and exponentially to the (square of the) information exponent associated with the link function, whenever the chosen student model satisfies certain properties. Moreover, an explicit choice of the student model is proposed and precise bounds for the associated convergence rate are provided. The authors also provide experimental demonstration of their results on synthetic data.

The results in this paper work under a set of modeling assumptions. First, the teacher model is assumed to have a symmetric structure, in the sense that variable relabelling does not change the value of the function. Each of the unknown parameters influences each variable in the exact same way and, in particular, the $k$-th parameter multiplies the sum of all the monomials of degree $k$. Moreover, the link function is assumed to be analytic and supported on monomials of degree at most equal to the square root of the input dimension. Finally, the input distribution is assumed to be the squared Vandermode density, which is shown to enjoy properties in the symmetric setting analogous to those of the Gaussian for a non-symmetric setting.

The proof techniques used include complex calculus as well as a crucial identity of Vandermode distributions on the symmetric polynomials setting, which motivates establishing Vandermode distributions as the Gaussian analogue in the symmetric polynomials setting.

### Strengths
The paper provides the first positive result in the proposed setting and acquires bounds in terms of the information exponent, which is well-studied quantity. The presentation is clear, sufficiently detailed and accurate. The techniques proposed in this paper might be of independent interest, especially as they motivate further study of learning problems under Vandermode marginals.

### Weaknesses
As the authors mention in their limitations section, the (distributional and modeling) assumptions required for the proposed analysis to work are not as common in the literature. Therefore, it is not clear to what extent such assumptions are realistic or significantly valuable from a theoretical perspective. Specifically, the assumption that the teacher model has a symmetric structure, where each parameter influences each variable identically, is quite restrictive. This limits the applicability of the results to scenarios where such a strong symmetry is present. Furthermore, the assumption that the link function is analytic and supported on monomials of degree at most equal to the square root of the input dimension is also a significant constraint, as many practical link functions may not satisfy this. Finally, the requirement that the input distribution follows a squared Vandermonde density, while mathematically convenient, is not a standard assumption and its practical relevance is questionable.

Another weakness of this work is that the results do not seem to be immediately interpretable in the Probably Approximately Correct (PAC) learning setting, since it is implicitly assumed that one has access to exact gradient oracles for optimizing the chosen loss function. This is a strong assumption, as in practice, one only has access to noisy gradients computed from a finite sample. The analysis does not address the impact of using stochastic gradient descent (SGD) or other practical optimization algorithms, which would introduce additional challenges related to the variance of the gradient estimates and the convergence behavior in the presence of noise. The theoretical guarantees provided are thus limited to an idealized scenario and may not directly translate to real-world applications.

### Questions
My main question concerns my second comment in the weaknesses section: Can the results provided in this paper be translated to standard PAC learning guarantees? If not, then what are the main obstacles in doing so?

### Summary
This paper studies the population gradient flow dynamics for learning a single index model using a symmetric neural network. It is shown that under powersum polynomial features and inputs following the Vandermonde distribution, identities appear that are similar to those of Hermite polynomials in Gaussian space. Using this property, the authors track the high-dimensional gradient flow dynamics using a small number of summary statistics and show the recovery of the hidden direction in the single index model.

### Strengths
This paper presents an interesting analysis that goes beyond the standard two-layer fully connected network and Gaussian input assumptions of the recent literature on single index learning, specifically by considering symmetric neural networks under a Vandermonde distribution. Furthermore, the authors are able to generalize the intuitions of Gaussian single index learning by showing that a proper notion of *information exponent* is still controlling the complexity of learning.

### Weaknesses
 * There is no finite-sample analysis which is in contrast to the majority of recent works on learning single index models which had a particular focus on the sample complexity of the learning problem.

* Certain assumptions of the work are a bit restrictive. For example, the assumption on the activation is only verified for a particular choice that is not commonly used in practice, and the student link function $g$ needs to be carefully constructed using full information on the teacher link function $f$. However, these restrictions are understandable given that this work is a first attempt of studying the training dynamics of symmetric neural networks under a single index model.

* The writing of the paper can be improved with examples provided below.

### Questions
* The authors have mentioned why analyzing the SGD counterpart of the population gradient flow using the drift and martingale decomposition technique can be challenging. Another avenue for obtaining sample complexity is to use full-batch (empirical) gradient flow similar to Bietti et al., 2022 instead of the population version. I'm wondering if the six-stage proof can be adapted to handle such concentration errors and lead to a sample complexity.

* A particularly relevant paper could be [1] where the authors consider learning a single index model with anisotropic Gaussian data, and show that a structure in the covariance can reduce sample/runtime complexity and even remove dependency on the information exponent. I am wondering if similar observations can be made in this paper by introducing additional structure in the inputs. Furthermore, some aspects of the current analysis also appear in [1] due to dealing with anisotropy, such as having to control a quantity of the type $\Vert f(\langle Aw, x\rangle)\Vert_{L^2}^2$ or preconditioning, which might be interesting to point out.

* The squared Vandermonde density is never explicitly defined in the manuscript. Perhaps providing an explicit definition and recalling some of its relevant properties can help the readers better understand the problem setting.

## Minor Comments:
* Is the probability in Lemma 4.5 is over the randomness of $(a_m)$? In that case, it might be helpful to point this out in the statement of the lemma.
* Theorem 4.2 point (iii) asks for $v_0 = 1 - r_0^2$. Could it be more intuitive to introduce this condition as $\Vert Aw_0 \Vert = 1$?
