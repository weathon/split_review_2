## Abstract
Recent works have revealed the vulnerability of deep neural network (DNN) classifiers to adversarial attacks. Among such attacks, it is common to distinguish specific attacks adapted to each example from universal ones referred as example-agnostic. Even though specific adversarial attacks are efficient on their target DNN classifier to attack, they struggle to transfer to others. Conversely, universal adversarial attacks suffer from lower attack success. To reconcile universality and efficiency, we propose a model of the adversarial noise space allowing to frame specific adversarial perturbation as a linear combination of universal adversarial directions. We bring in two stochastic gradient based algorithms for learning these universal directions and the associated adversarial attacks. Empirical analyses conducted with the CIFAR-10 and ImageNet datasets show that LIMANS (i) enables crafting specific and robust adversarial attacks with high probability, (ii) provides a deeper understanding of DNN flaws, and (iii) shows significant ability in transferability.

### Confidence
3: You are fairly confident in your assessment. It is possible that you did not understand some parts of the submission or that you are unfamiliar with some pieces of related work. Math/other details were not carefully checked.

### Summary
The authors propose a method to model the adversarial perturbation in a linear combination space, which builds a dictionary to bridge the link between the universal adversarial attack and specific adversarial attack. Experiments on different datasets illustrate the strong attacking performance wrt existing adversarial example detectors, and the learned adversarial noise space brings superior transferability.

### Strengths
+ The paper is well-structured and organized, and easy to follow. The methodology and experimental setup are adequately explained.
+ The proposed LIMANS build the bridge between the universal adversarial perturbation and specific adversarial perturbation.
+ Extensive experiments are conducted to support their proposed method. Empirically and theoretically, compared to the previous universal attack methods, the LIMANS is more efficient on the two datasets.

### Weaknesses
 - The performance of the proposed LIMANS relies on the choice of the source classifier.
- It is not clear the extra computation overhead for learning the model from the source classifier, it would be better the compare the spending time across different attacks (for Simple-LIMANS and Regularized-LIMANS respectively).
- The results of the transferability performance of UAP look much lower than that in the existing literature, even lower than some specific attacks when attacking a standard-trained model. Why?
- Could you explain more about why you only use the validation set and not the training set?
- To my knowledge, you seem to miss some SOTA methods in the field of universal attack (e.g., [1]).
- The simple-LIMANS seems to remove the tunable hyper-parameter lambda of regularized-LIMASNS, therefore also providing the results of regularized-LIMASNS would be desirable.
- A lot of typos/mistakes, e.g. "Table ??", "FOR FUTUR", "learn The associated"...

### Summary
The paper introduces LIMANS, a model that bridges the gap between specific and universal adversarial attacks on deep neural network (DNN) classifiers. LIMANS defines an adversarial noise space, enabling specific attacks to be represented as combinations of universal adversarial directions. This approach enhances the efficiency and transferability of adversarial attacks while also providing insights into DNN vulnerabilities.

### Strengths
+ The paper is well-written and presents its concepts in a clear and understandable manner.
+ The formulation that bridges the gap between universal and specific adversarial attacks is an intriguing contribution, offering a promising avenue for improving deep neural network security.

### Weaknesses
 - The study primarily relies on empirical evaluations to support its claims, which may leave room for a more in-depth theoretical exploration of the connection between universal and specific adversarial attacks.
- The results suggest a trade-off between the transferability of attacks to other models and their effectiveness on the source model, potentially requiring further investigation and trade-off analysis.
- The conflicting results observed on different datasets indicate that the proposed approach might not be universally applicable, and its limitations should be carefully considered in practical applications.

- The paper builds upon the notion that specific attacks exhibit poor transferability. However, specific attacks (as known as adversarial examples) are shown to be transferable in prior literature [refA, B]. Thus, it is crucial for the paper to substantiate this assertion with empirical evidence, shedding light on the extent to which specific attacks struggle when transferred.

The paper also posits that the proximity of decision boundaries among multiple DNN classifiers trained on the same dataset suggests potential transferability in the adversarial noise space, which can be applicable for both specific and universal adversarial examples. However, the distinction between specific and universal adversarial attacks and why universals tend to excel in transferability remains somewhat unclear in the current version.

While the paper's formulation is intriguing, reinforcing it with theoretical contributions that establish the linkage and connection between specific and universal adversarial attacks in the adversarial space would enhance its significance.

Notably, the results in Table 3 appear to indicate a trade-off between the proposed approach's transferability and its effectiveness, with better transferability when the source and target models differ but reduced effectiveness in scenarios where they are the same. These findings conflict with those presented in Table 2. Given the empirical nature of the paper, these conflicting results cast some doubt on the validity of the hypothesis and the efficacy of the proposed method.

### Summary
This work proposes LIMANS, a process for creating adversarial examples via a learned linear combination of adversarial atoms (noise patterns). The motivation for this work is to explicitly define a process to vary the specificity of an adversarial perturbation to a particular input vs the ability of the perturbation to be successfully applied to multiple inputs. The efficacy of this work is demonstrated by producing adversarial examples (composed of differently weighted 'atoms' learned via one of two provided algorithms) on several different model architectures trained on CIFAR-10 and Imagenet. The ability of these same atoms to be used on other architectures (while still learning the correct weights of these atoms) is evaluated, along with performance against an adversarial example detector. As a result, this work is able to explore the dimensionality of adversarial spaces in CIFAR-10 and Imagenet trained DNN classifiers, and how it is shared across different architectures trained on the same dataset.

### Strengths
* (Major) This work shows each contribution of LIMANS stated in the introduction via sound experiments on CIFAR-10 and Imagenet, with multiple DNN architectures, and against a detector. With some exceptions detailed in questions, the results seem convincing.

* (Moderate) Figure 2 does a good job in how varying example-specificity affects the attack success rate.

* (Moderate) The motivation for this work is interesting, and could lead to better understanding of different causes of DNN vulnerability.

### Weaknesses
 * (Major) The main results show the superiority of LIMANS transferability over example-specific attacks in Table 2 and Table 3. However, this does not quite seem like a fair comparison since, in my understanding, LIMANS is allowed to adjust $v$ for each example on the other architectures whereas the other example-specific attacks are not allowed to adapt at all. Therefore, it is not really surprising that an attack allowed to adapt in any way would have a much higher attack success rate.

* (Moderate) At least in the main text, this work omits a full description of how the learned "atoms" are calculated. Specifically, the text mentions that the atoms may not be suitable (i.e., $D$ not in $\mathcal{D}$) after Algorithm 2, but only says some post-processing is done to fix it. A description of this post-processing and discussion on how it retains the desired qualities of $D$ is necessary.

* (Moderate) This work has several typos or critical missing words that introduce ambiguity on what is meant and makes this paper more difficult to read (shapes of variables are inconsistent, some variables are undefined, incomplete sentences, missing critical words e.g., writing "1" instead of "Algorithm 1" or "Figure 1", missing periods in between sentences, missing letters (FUTUR -> FUTURE), no space before some sentences). More details in questions.

* (Moderate) The baselines for universal attacks seem low when comparing to values in prior work. For example, Figure 2 shows three different versions of UAP getting near 0% success rate, but the original works get near 90% success rate on the same dataset (CIFAR-10) and similar architectures (VGG11 vs VGG16).

### Questions
* Am I correct in my understanding that LIMANS is allowed to adjust $v$ via gradient feedback from unseen model architectures to enhance the "transferability" measurements in Tables 2 and 3? If so, is it the case that the other baselines (e.g., VNI-FGSM, NAA, RAP) were not allowed to have this same feedback?

* In equation 1, the subscript $p$ seems to denote the type of norm, but the upper case P represents the dimensionality of the input. Is this correct? If so, it would be best to change one of these to avoid confusion.

* What is capital V in algorithms 1 and 2? is it the same as lower case v? If so, why is it initialized to a shape of $\mathcal{N}(0, 1_{P \times M})$ when $v$ is earlier said to be a vector of size $M$ for each example?

* Why do the universal attacks have low success rates in this work compared to their higher success rates in the original works given the same dataset and similar architectures?

* Section 3 says that Simple-LIMANS may produce a $D$ that is not in $\mathcal{D}$ (i.e., does not fit the dictionary requirements). The work mentions that some post-processing is used to fix this. What is this post-processing and how does it ensure the atoms are still universal adversarial directions? Also, how does this post-processing ensure that later $v$s calculated on unseen examples can still work with this modified $D$? It could be the case that one atom in the original $D$ had a large magnitude (outside $l_p$ constraints) that allowed a small corresponding element of $v$ to have a large effect. Assuming post-processing reduces this magnitude of this atom of $D$, how can a $v$ calculated on unseen examples be able to have the same effect?

* What is the reasoning for why LIMANS is able to evade detection better in Table 1? I did not notice any discussion on this trend or a justification of why LIMANS would have this advantage.

* In Table 1, what is meant by Detectors $d$ having different attack names as subscripts to them such as $d_{\text{FGSM}}$? Is this detector tuned to defend against FGSM? If so, why is there only one detector for $LIMANS_{10}$ and not one for the claimed strongest attack of $\text{LIMANS}_{4000}$? What is SA (standard accuracy?)? 

* Can you provide a citation for this statement in Section 4.2 please? "Moreover, for robust classifiers, the decision boundaries are more complicated..." In my understanding, and as evidenced by the pictures in Figure 3, it seems that the decision boundaries are smoother and less complicated looking.

* Could you provide citations for this sentence near the beginning of section 2: "However, it has been found that they are not as effective in fooling other classifiers, namely, adversarial examples yielded by specific attacks are poorly transferable from one classifier to another."

### Summary
The paper introduces LIMANS, a new way to model adversarial perturbations as linear combinations of universal adversarial directions. A white-box adversarial attack is developed based of the proposed formalism. The attack and proposed modeling aim to bridge the gap between universal perturbations (high transferability, low attack success) and instance-based attacks (high attack success, low transferability). Two stochastic gradient-based algorithms for learning universal adversarial directions are proposed. Experiments are performed on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet, comparing LIMANS against other white-box attacks.

### Strengths
- The idea of unifying universal and custom adversarial examples seems novel and interesting.
- LIMANS exhibits improved attack transferability and success rate when detectors are used.

### Weaknesses
 # Lack of in-depth analysis

- The proposed method, optimization objectives, relaxations, etc., are introduced as they are, without any small or large scale analyses or too many explanations.
- The paper does not show the universality of the adversarial directions computed by LIMANS, other than through attack transferability. Each input point seems to get its own atom in the learned parameters, so there is no reason to believe that they are universal.
- When studying transferability of adversarial examples, one should arguably look beyond universal perturbations and also consider black-box attacks. These are some of the attacks that offer improved transferability by default. While black-box attacks are listed as an item for future work, to me they are well within the scope of this paper. [Boundary attack](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=SyZI0GWCZ) in particular seems relevant to the motivation presented around stability of decision boundaries per dataset.

# Relation to prior work

- The adversarial ML community has seen many ideas and frameworks for explaining adversarial examples. Many of these were disproven since, and the ones that still hold provide only partial explanations. The paper cites very few (if any) of these results and does not set the current work in the appropriate context. Coupled with the prior point on the depth of the proposed analysis, I am not convinced by the potential significance and impact of the proposed results.

# Potential performance limitations

- A significant practical limitation of the proposed method is that it needs access to at least a thousand clean samples in order to achieve performance remotely close to state-of-the-art attacks in white-box.
- Another limitation that is not addressed in the paper is the cost of crafting adversarial examples with LIMANS after fitting the initial parameters. It seems parameters need to be fitted for each new data point.

# Clarity

- The presentation and typography of the paper could be improved, please see some suggestions among minor points. The paper could also use additional proofreading.

# Minor points

- Consider using `\citep` when the cited references are not part of a sentence for proper citation formatting (see [here](https://www.overleaf.com/learn/latex/Natbib_citation_styles)).
- Repeat sentence fragment in Contributions: "The associated optimization problem, allowing to learn"
- "the decision boundaries of different classifiers are closed" -> use "close" instead of "closed".
- Some elements of the ICLR style are missing from the draft, like the document header. The header sizes also differ. The authors should ensure they use the ICLR style.

### Questions
1. It would be interesting to see to which extent the learned directions vary, e.g., when the data sample changes. Are the learned atoms relatively stable or indeed universal?
2. How does the present work relate to the other theories trying to explain the existence of adversarial examples (e.g., based on robust and non robust features in the data [[Ilyas et al., 2019](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.02175.pdf)] [[Kim et al., 2021](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper/2021/file/8e5e15c4e6d09c8333a17843461041a9-Paper.pdf)], the structure of adversarial spaces [[He et al., 2018](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1812.01198.pdf)], [[Paiton et al., 2022](https://openreview.net/forum?id=2p_5F9sHN9)], [[Sheatsley et al., 2023](https://www.usenix.org/system/files/sec23summer_256-sheatsley-prepub.pdf)])?
