## Abstract
Chatbots such as GPT-4 and ChatGPT are now serving millions of users. Despite their widespread use, there remains a lack of public datasets showcasing how these tools are used by a population of users in practice. 
To bridge this gap, we offered free access to ChatGPT for online users in exchange for their affirmative, consensual opt-in to anonymously collect their chat transcripts and request headers.
From this, we compiled \corpus, a corpus of 1 million user-ChatGPT conversations, which consists of over 2.5 million interaction turns.
We compare \corpus with other popular user-chatbot interaction datasets, and find that our dataset offers the most diverse user prompts, contains the largest number of languages, and presents the richest variety of potentially toxic use-cases for researchers to study.
In addition to timestamped chat transcripts, we enrich the dataset with demographic data, including state, country, and hashed IP addresses, alongside request headers. This augmentation allows for more detailed analysis of user behaviors across different geographical regions and temporal dimensions.
Finally, because it captures a broad range of use cases, we demonstrate the dataset's potential utility in fine-tuning instruction-following models. %\model, a chatbot fine-tuned on \corpus, outperforms a Vicuna model of the same size on MT-Bench, which shows that \corpus has a high utility in addition to being a source for toxicity study.
\corpus is released at \url{https://wildchat.allen.ai} under AI2 ImpACT Licenses\footnote{\url{https://allenai.org/impact-license}}.

### Confidence
4: You are confident in your assessment, but not absolutely certain. It is unlikely, but not impossible, that you did not understand some parts of the submission or that you are unfamiliar with some pieces of related work.

### Summary
This paper proposes a large-scale corpus of 570K user-ChatGPT conversations called WildChat. Compared with other user-chatbot interaction datasets, WildChat shows the most diverse user prompts and language usage and better aligns with real user distribution. The dataset also contains rich potentially toxic samples for research on AI safety. The authors fine-tune a chatbot on this dataset and show better performance on MT-Bench compared with the same size of the Vicuna model.

### Strengths
- The proposed dataset will be very valuable for LLM research communities. It will benefit the research on aligning LLM with real user prompt distribution, as well as for the safety of LLM.
- The dataset is collected under explicit user consent, the authors also try their best to protect user privacy well.
- They conduct extensive analyses on this dataset, including lexical diversity, language diversity, and data coverage, as well as toxicity, these analyses will be insightful for future research.

### Weaknesses
 - The analysis of the dataset focuses on the toxicity aspect, along with some basic statistics. Adding more statistics such as query categories, domains, and so on, and comparing them to existing datasets, will more clearly present the information of the dataset.

- Although the data collection was done with the user's consent, I still worried about the potential privacy and legal risks, as well as toxic content. For this reason, I have requested an ethics review.

- The paper itself lacks methodological contributions, but I do appreciate the contribution of the dataset, which is also the main claim of the authors.

### Questions
The authors note that users are biased towards the IT domain, and that anonymization brings more harmful content, which can lead to inconsistencies with real scenarios. Is there any way to make some improvements?

### Summary
The authors compiled (INTHE)WILDCHAT, a corpus of 570K user-ChatGPT conversations, which consists of over 1.5 million interaction turns. They also study the diversity and toxicity of the corpus. The also show that fine-tuning over WILDCHAT outperforms the latest
Vicuna model of the same size on MT-Bench, which shows that WILDCHAT has a high utility.

### Strengths
1. The WILDCHAT dataset fills a critical gap in the available resources for the research community. The quantity of conversations surpasses the existing datasets (such as Alpaca, ShareGPT) by an order of magnitude.
2. WILDCHAT exhibits greater diversity than existing datasets, both linguistically and semantically.
3. Results demonstrates that the mere fine-tuning of a language model on the raw dataset surpasses the performance of leading open-source chatbots.

### Weaknesses
 1. In comparing WILDCHAT with other datasets, the paper emphasizes that the token count of user prompts and assistant responses is significantly higher than that of other datasets. However, it is important to note that dialogue length does not necessarily reflect the overall quality of a dataset. Furthermore, while longer dialogues might capture more complex interactions, they could also introduce noise or redundancy, potentially diluting the signal for specific tasks.
2. The paper incorporates lexical diversity as a component of the diversity of user prompts. However, whether lexical diversity alone is sufficient to reflect the diversity of user prompts is questionable. More specifically, if unigram entropy is used to calculate lexical diversity, does a scenario where each word in the user prompts is distinct necessarily indicate superior user prompts? A high unigram entropy could simply mean the prompts are nonsensical or grammatically incorrect, rather than diverse in a meaningful way.
3. Could the toxic rate observed on Detoxify be potentially attributed to the selection of 0.1 as the threshold? This relatively low threshold might lead to false positives. Furthermore, it would be beneficial to see the performance of the other four datasets on Detoxify using the same threshold for a fair comparison. Without this, it is difficult to assess whether the toxicity observed is specific to the WILDCHAT dataset or a general characteristic of such datasets.
4. Given that Llama-2 Chat has traded performance for alignment with humans through RLHF, one might expect its capabilities on STEM and Extraction (on MT-bench) to be somewhat diminished. Why, then, does WildLlama still fall short of Llama-2 Chat in these two areas? It would be helpful to understand if the fine-tuning process on WILDCHAT is not effectively capturing the nuances required for these specific tasks, or if there is a fundamental limitation in the dataset itself.
5. In Table 8, WILDLLAMA still inferior to Llama-2 Chat.

### Summary
This paper releases a well-collected multilingual and large-scale instruction tuning datasets collected from real user interactions with GPT-4 and GPT-3.5. Currently, improving quality and quantity of instruction tuning data is the most effective way to boost the performance of open-source large language models. The authors present very comprehensive on the statistics and analysis in terms of data distribution, quality, quantity, toxicity, and diversity. The dataset is also a multilingual dataset, which will help the minority researchers in non-English area to develop strong large language models.

### Strengths
1. As far as a I know, if the authors plan to release the dataset, the WILDCHAT will be the largest public instruction tuning dataset. Such instruction scale will definitely help the open-source community to construct better LLMs. Additionally, the WILDCHAT provides the coverage for 66 languages and it will help the researchers in minor languages a lot.

2. The authors adopt comprehensive and strong control and analysis on the ethical issues of the collected instruction, especially the toxicity issue.

### Weaknesses
1.I believe the evaluation of the instructionally tuned WILDLLAMA is too limited to demonstrate the effectiveness. In addition to MT-Bench, I strongly suggest that you can follow InstructEval (Chia et al., 2023) to evaluate WILDLLAMA on MMLU, DROP, Human-eval, and BBH. The performance superiority is not the thing to worry. Such benchmark results can help you better assess the coverage and diversity of the released WILDCHAT dataset.

2. I suggest that the authors should find a taxonomy for analyzing the task coverage, i.e. Flan, of the proposed WILDCHAT. The diverse coverage on different tasks might be more significant than the quantity. The t-SNE visualization on the diversity is not that intuitive as task coverage.

### Questions
1. If I understand the paper well, the 570k pool includes the harmful instructions with toxicity issues. How much instructions will be filtered and remained as harmless instructions for public release after your internal processing?

2. Can you provide the statistics on how much conversations are collected from GPT3.5-Turbo based services and GPT-4 based services, respectively? Can you also conduct other experiments to present whether fine-tuning a LLAMA2-7B model with only GPT-4 output instruction following samples might lead to better performance due to a better teacher model?

### Summary
This paper introduces the WildChat dataset, which contains 570K user-ChatGPT dialogues with a total of 1.5 million interaction turns. The data is derived from anonymous user chat transcripts on HuggingFace, where the authors strategically deployed free chatbots in exchange for access to these interaction logs. The biggest advantange of the WildChat dataset is its significant volume of toxic content. This can greatly aid the community in analyzing toxic behavior and subsequently implementing robust models to detect such harmful content. However, it's crucial to rigorously review the toxic content prior to its release.

### Strengths
1. This paper deploys chatbots on HuggingFace and gathers conversational logs over a 6-month period to construct the WildChat dataset.

2. The dataset is "up-to-date" with September 2023 being the last entry.

### Weaknesses
1. The presentation requires a significant improvement. I suggest enhancing the writing for better clarity. Additionally, the tables and figures in the paper could benefit from improvements to enhance their readability, e.g., consider (1) increasing the spacing between the bars in Figure 1(a) for clearer visualization, (2) using `wrapfigure`  to prevent the large left and right blank margin in Figure 2, and (3) please find a way to distinguish between the overlapping blue and red scatter points in Figure 3.
2. The potential applications of the WildChat dataset appear to be restricted. While this paper has presented the dataset's utility for toxic content classification, the broader applications of this dataset remain unclear to me.
3. I understand the challenges associated with releasing the full dataset during a double-blind review process. However, it would have been beneficial if the paper had included a few sample data examples for evaluation. Additionally, it seems that the tutorial and documentation for the WildChat dataset are missing, which would have been valuable for a comprehensive review.

### Questions
1. I appreciate the authors' efforts in deploying chatbots on HuggingFace and gathering user interaction logs to develop the WildChat dataset.  But the intended application of the WildChat dataset is not clear. Beyond the toxic content classification, what kind of tasks researchers might undertake using this dataset?
2. The experimental assessment primarily utilizes Large Language Models (LLM) like GPT-3.5 and Llama-2 Chat. I wonder if the WildChat dataset would also be beneficial for smaller-scale language models?
