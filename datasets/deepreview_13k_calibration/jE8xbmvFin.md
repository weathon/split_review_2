## Abstract
The capabilities of large language models (LLMs) have sparked debate over whether such systems just learn an enormous collection of superficial statistics or a set of more coherent and grounded representations that reflect the real world. We find evidence for the latter by analyzing the learned representations of three spatial datasets (world, US, NYC places) and three temporal datasets (historical figures, artworks, news headlines) in the Llama-2 family of models. 
We discover that LLMs learn \textit{linear} representations of space and time across multiple scales. These representations are robust to prompting variations and unified across different entity types (e.g. cities and landmarks). In addition, we identify individual ``space neurons'' and ``time neurons'' that reliably encode spatial and temporal coordinates. \rev{While further investigation is needed, our results suggest modern LLMs learn rich spatiotemporal representations of the real world and possess basic ingredients of a world model.}

### Summary
Do LLMs encode an enomous collection of superficial statistics, or do LLMs encode a coherent model of the data generation process (”a world model”)? This paper presents some evidence towards the latter. 

This paper finds that Llama-2 family of models encode linear representations of space and time across multiple scales. Further, this paper finds “space neurons” and “time neurons” that reliably encode spatial and temporal coordinates.

### Strengths
- This paper presents important evidence towards a critical debate (what do LLMs encode).
- This paper organizes the probing studies in a way that is more comprehensive and rigorous than most probing papers that I have seen. To illustrate that the features are encoded linearly, this paper compares linear (ridge) regression probes and nonlinear MLP probes, and found that the nonlinear probes show minimal improvement in performance in any dataset or model. To illustrate the sensitivity to prompts, this paper tries many different types of prompts and discuss the effects. To test the robustness of the encoding, this paper sets up several block holdout and entity-holdout settings. These combinations of settings make the findings rigorous and compelling.
- The dimensionality reduction and space & time neuron experiments make this paper even more appealing.

### Weaknesses
The experiments only involve Llama-2 series models, whereas various locations in the paper stretches the claim to be about all LLMs and modern LLMs. I recommend rephrasing some texts into e.g., “LLMs, with Llama as examples” to make the claims better supported by the scope of the experiments.

Typo and comments:

- There are some minor typos. In page 6, a punctuation is needed before the footnote. In the end of the next paragraph, the period should be before the footnote.
- A related work should be referred: [Distributional vectors encode referential attributes](https://aclanthology.org/D15-1002) (Gupta et al., EMNLP 2015) This is one of the earliest probing papers, and it probed for the attributes involving geographic locations.

### Questions
- Do the findings generalize to other LLMs, for example bidirectional models?

### Summary
This work examines whether representations of entities from the Llama-2 family language models represent important properties such as spatial coordinates for famous landmarks and years for famous people and events. This is done via training linear ridge regression probes on top of the representations extracted from activations at individual layers of the models. The results are that across several datasets, the LLM representations encode space and time information, and that these representations improve through the first half of the model layers and are then stable through the remainder of the model.

### Strengths
- examine an interesting and timely question that will be relevant to the ICLR community
- well-designed experiments to rule out confounding factors
- investigate several different open source models

### Weaknesses
W1. This work uses established methods for probing and there is no methodological innovation, though this is on its own not a deal breaker

W2. The research question is motivated as trying to study whether LLMs build a world model, but it's not clear to me why learning important properties of famous landmarks, such as location, and of famous events, such as years, are a sign of a "world model". My guess is that these properties co-occur with the names of the landmarks, events, and people in the training datasets and this is how they are learned by the LLM. It would be helpful if the authors can explain more about why they think that the LLM learning these properties is a sign of learning a world model.

W3. Only results from probing experiments are provided as evidence, and only when either the entity is given directly to the model as input or when a prompt that agrees with the task is appended to the context ("What is the location of.."). It would be informative to present the accuracy of the model under those prompts (e.g. is the probing needed to answer the question of whether the model has this information?), and also to show whether the representation of time and space is still decodable even if the task the model is asked to perform is not related to the time/location or is even adversarially related.

### Questions
Q1. Are the neurons that the authors point out as aligning with the space/time directions sufficient, necessary, or not even sufficient for representing these properties? In other words, what happens to the space/time representations if these neurons are ablated and the ridge regression probes are relearned?

Other questions: please respond to weaknesses 2 and 3 above.

Minor point: 
page 3 is the first time when it's clear that what is meant by a spatial representation is the two-dimensional latitude and longitude coordinates. This should be made clear earlier in the paper.

### Summary
This paper studies the spatial and temporal data representations for LLMs. It utilizes three spatial datasets (world, US, NYC places) and three temporal datasets (historical figures, artworks, news headlines) to analyze the internal representations in the Llama-2 model family. The study finds that LLMs develop linear, robust representations of space and time, unified across various entity types. It also identifies specific "space neurons" and "time neurons" within these models, indicating that LLMs form structured knowledge about space and time. The research, which employs linear regression probes on model activations to predict real-world locations or times, underscores the potential of LLMs in developing complex world models, impacting their robustness and application in AI systems.

### Strengths
1. The paper presents an exploration into the internal workings of large language models (LLMs), particularly focusing on how these models internalize and represent continuous variables including spatial and temporal dimensions. 
2. The investigation is well-conducted, employing rigorous experiments and analysis methods to support that the probing results are not merely superficial statistics. The identification of specific "space neurons" and "time neurons" within these models is an innovative aspect to understand LLMs.
3. This study provides evidence that large language models possess an intrinsic comprehension of world models. This insight can enhance researchers' understanding of how information is represented within large language models.

### Weaknesses
1. One of the paper's limitations is its potential overlap with findings already established in the word embedding literature. Earlier works in this area, such as those by Mikolov et al. (2013), have demonstrated that simpler word embedding models can capture relational information and regularities in a linear fashion. This raises the question of whether the findings in this paper are genuinely novel or simply an extension of what is already known about linear representations in language models. The paper could strengthen its contribution by more directly addressing how its findings with large language models (LLMs) differ significantly from those with simpler models, and by delving deeper into the implications of these differences for the field. Specifically, the paper lacks a rigorous comparison showing how the observed linear representations in LLMs offer advantages over those in simpler models such as word2vec or GloVe, particularly in terms of robustness, generalizability, and the complexity of relationships captured. A more thorough analysis is needed to demonstrate that the LLM's representations are not just a scaled-up version of what is already known.
2. The assertion that LLMs learn literal 'world models' may be overstated. The concept of a 'world model' in the context of AI and cognitive science typically refers to a comprehensive and dynamic representation of the external world, including an understanding of causal relationships and the ability to predict future states. The paper's findings, while impressive, primarily demonstrate that LLMs can encode spatial and temporal information linearly. This is a far cry from the richer and more dynamic conception of a world model. A more accurate claim might be that LLMs are capable of forming structured and useful representations of spatial and temporal information, but these do not necessarily constitute comprehensive world models. The paper does not explore if these learned representations are actually used by the LLM for downstream tasks that require reasoning about space and time, or if they are merely an artifact of the training process. Further exploration into how these representations are utilized by LLMs in real-world tasks, and how they compare to human cognitive processes, could provide a more nuanced understanding of their nature and limitations. For instance, do these representations enable the model to perform complex spatial reasoning tasks, such as path-finding or predicting the outcome of physical interactions?
3. Though the analysis experiments are useful and abundant within the given datasets and LLMs, the scope of data and experiments is limited. In particular, the datasets used, while diverse, primarily represent well-known entities and locations, potentially biasing the results towards more frequently encountered data points. This could limit the generalizability of the findings to less common or more ambiguous entities. The study largely focuses on data in English and from a Western perspective. Exploring how these models represent space and time in other languages and cultural contexts could provide valuable insights into their versatility and limitations. Also, the study is conducted on the Llama-2 model family. Testing the findings across different models and architectures, and especially across models trained on different data, would strengthen the argument that these capabilities are inherent to LLMs in general, rather than specific to a particular model. The paper would benefit from a more detailed discussion of the potential biases introduced by the dataset and model choices, and how these limitations might affect the interpretation of the results.

### Summary
This paper probes language models (specifically the Llama-2 type) for representations of spatial location of place names at different levels of granularity, as well as placement in time of people, products and events.
Activations in language models are mapped to explicit geographical and temporal coordinates via linear probes. The paper finds that the tested language models in general have robust representations of both spatial and temporal location; locations within New York City however are mapped with relatively lower accuracy. Additionally the paper localizes specific neurons especially sensitive to location in either space or time.

### Strengths
The works uses straightforward methods and well thought out experimental setup. Experiments are exhaustive. The results are presented in a clear and easy to follow fashion.

### Weaknesses
The main problem with this work is the serious lack of awareness and engagement with very similar work carried out not so long ago [1,2]. As a results, the paper doesn't acknowledge that qualitatively similar results obtain even in extremely simplistic models applied to text such as SVD and LSA, and overinterprets the results as evidence of the language models analyzed possessing "a coherent model of the data generating process—a world model". 
If the spatial and temporal representations found here count as a world  model, it's a a very partial and almost trivial one. It certainly is very far from a complete model of the process generating textual data in general. The paper would be much improved if it seriously toned down these overly dramatic claims.

A minor methodological quibble: longitude wraps around, so linear correlation is not an ideal measure here.

### Questions
Proximity error is defined as "fraction of predictions closer to the target point than the actual prediction". I don't understand what this means; should this read "fraction of datapoints closer to the target point than the actual prediction"?

I don't understand how the mere presence of specific neurons correlated to spatial/temporal probes counts as evidence that these representations are used by the model. A more convincing evidence would involve some intervention on these neurons.
