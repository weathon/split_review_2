## Abstract
Multi-camera setups find widespread use across various applications, such as autonomous driving, as they greatly expand sensing capabilities. 
Despite the fast development of Neural radiance field (NeRF) techniques and their wide applications in both indoor and outdoor scenes, applying NeRF to multi-camera systems remains very challenging. This is primarily due to the inherent under-calibration issues in multi-camera setup, including inconsistent imaging effects stemming from separately calibrated image signal processing units in diverse cameras, and system errors arising from mechanical vibrations during driving that affect relative camera poses.
In this paper, we present UC-NeRF, a novel method tailored for novel view synthesis in under-calibrated multi-view camera systems.
Firstly, we propose a layer-based color correction to rectify the color inconsistency in different image regions. Second, we propose virtual warping to generate more viewpoint-diverse but color-consistent virtual views for color correction and 3D recovery. Finally, a spatiotemporally constrained pose refinement is designed for more robust and accurate pose calibration in multi-camera systems.
Our method not only achieves state-of-the-art performance of novel view synthesis in multi-camera setups, but also effectively facilitates depth estimation in large-scale outdoor scenes with the synthesized novel views.

### Summary
The paper proposes a neural rendering system for automotive multi-camera temporally captured data (which they should explicitly mention in title and is misleading if not mentioned), which accounts for color variation, extrinsic errors and lack of sufficient training data typically effecting previous automotive applied Nerf methods. They first handle extrinsic errors by SLAM and again do something similar to SLAM as post-processing to recalibrate the cameras across time. To handle color variation across cameras at a given time instant, an affine color correction matrix is learnt separately from sky and foreground (as they can get sky mask from previous work) and thus there are separate NeRF models. Since NeRF requires dense sampling of input images, they also propose to get novel views via a separate pre-existing MVS method and use that depth map to render novel views. These novel views are then added to the training set of images. A new NeRF optimizing function is then defined taking all these into account. The results show improvement compared to many existing SOTA methods.

### Strengths
The paper handles a relevant problem in real life data. The proposed method looks sound. The references look adequate. The comparative results look good.

### Weaknesses
- First, I would like the title to be more specific. Its very misleading as the paper does use automotive setting (sky+fg) as necessary input. The title seems to suggest that its a generic method for uncalibrated cameras. Also all results are on automotive. Please correct it.

- In Eq. 5, what is b and d. I think the authors missed defining those params.

- In Eq.7, isn't it  better to reduce reprojection error as a function of direct 4x4 transformation between the cameras across time. For example directly modeling the transformation between cameras labeled T^i*delta_T1 and T^j * delta_T1 in Fig4. The reason for this is that at time t=0, its convenient to bring all the three cameras in Fig4 to the car's coordinate system, but later assuming that this transformation is fixed and won't perturb due to camera shake, bad roads, bumps etc. is an unrealistic assumption. Then propagating this incorrect assumption across time from T^i to T^j can lead to erroneous extrinsics estimation in Eq. 7.

- When virtual views are created and added to the training set as discussed in Section 3.3, it has holes either due to low confidence or occlusion as shown in Fig 9, then how does the sky segmentation from Yin 2022 perform in these images. What happens to the mask value in the missing image regions in virtual view and how does in impact Equation 3.

- The training strategy is not very clear. So, you train using Eq.4 upto some convergence, Then you get A and C color correction matrices. Then again you apply the corrected A and C matrices to virtual views in Section 3.3. Then you get color corrected virutal views. Then you again train the original set of spatial+temporal data but this time include virtual views? I think Section 3.5 needs more explanation because it joins all your individual modules and is critical to understand how the complete system is working.

- Section 4.4 is redundant I think. It has nothing to do with the main goal of your paper and that space could have been used to explain your main parts e.g. Section 3.5 in detail.


- In Fig5, the part of the image where the road appears to merge, the green region adjoining the bright sky appears to be hazy in the proposed result compared to Zip-Nerf results. In other words Zip-Nerf results are much sharper in that region. What could be the reason for that?

### Questions
Kindly address the weakness as much as possible. I will update my review based on the rebuttal. Currently its borderline for me.

### Summary
In this work, a novel method tailored for novel view synthesis is proposed for under-calibrated multi-view camera systems. In particular, a layer-based color correction is designed to rectify the color inconsistency in different image regions. To generate more viewpoint-diverse but color-consistent virtual views for color correction and 3D recovery, the authors further propose the virtual warping technique. And a spatiotemporally constrained pose optimization strategy is presented to explicitly model the spatial and temporal connections between cameras for pose optimization. Experiments on the Waymoand and NuScenes datasets show that this work achieves high-quality renderings with a multi-camera system and outperforms other baselines by a large margin.

### Strengths
+ The proposed layer-based color correction well addresses color inconsistencies in the training images, especially for those taken by different cameras.
+ The virtual warping strategy naturally expands the range of the training views for NeRF, enhancing its effectiveness in learning both the scene's appearance and geometry.
+ The experimental results look promising, and the proposed work significantly leads state-of-the-art methods.

### Weaknesses
 - The whole pipeline seems verbose since three independent modules are stitched together with few connections. Could the proposed UC-NeRF be trained in an end-to-end manner? Additionally, the efficiency comparisons of different methods are expected to be provided in the experiments.
- The first two contributions, i.e., Layer-based Color Correction and Virtual Warping, are kind of trivial and have limited novelty. They are constructed based on existing methods like the pretrained segmentation model, the MVS model, and a geometric consistent check approach. The procedures of these two parts perform a preprocessing-like role in the proposed method. The authors are suggested to give more clarifications and highlight their specific contributions.
- For the color correction part, it seems that the accuracy of the correction performance highly depends on the sky segmentation. However, the cases shown in the paper only contain clean skies and sunny weather. I am wondering how this work performs under diverse weather conditions. Because this work aims at multi-camera systems that are widely used in outdoor scenes (such as autonomous driving), the real-world application would be preferred over the method itself.
- For the proposed Spatiotemporally Constrained Pose Refinement, please clarify its relationship and difference to the bundle adjustment.

### Questions
How's the time cost to filter out inaccurate depths through a geometric consistency check?

### Summary
The paper introduces UC-NeRF, a novel approach designed specifically for under-calibrated multi-view camera systems, addressing the challenges faced when applying NeRF techniques in such setups. The method incorporates layer-based color correction, virtual warping, and spatiotemporally constrained pose refinement to achieve exceptional performance in novel view synthesis and enhance the sensing capabilities of multi-camera systems. The contributions of the paper encompass the introduction of a new dataset tailored for under-calibrated multi-view camera systems, a novel layer-based color correction method, and an algorithm for spatiotemporally constrained pose refinement. The effectiveness of UC-NeRF is demonstrated through experiments conducted on the new dataset, and comparisons are made against state-of-the-art methods.

### Strengths
S1. This paper is well-written and easy to follow. 
S2. The proposed method is technically sound. 
S3. The experiment design especially the ablation study is solid and the results are noticeable.

### Weaknesses
W1. The novelty of this paper is somewhat limited to me:
W1-1. In terms of the first key innovation, namely layer-based color correction, why we can not use some classical multiple views color correction solutions in the structure-from-motion field as a pre-processing step instead of a module inside the NeRF? It should be justified. Besides, some existing NeRFs also addresses similar problem such as RAWNeRF and block-NeRF, what are the main differences between the proposed method and these works?
W1-2 In terms of the spatiotemporally constrained pose refinement, there are some similar NeRFs that also consider the spatial and temporal connections between cameras for pose optimization. Name a few but not completed lists such as BARF (Lin et al. ICCV 2021) and BAD-Nerf (Wang et al. CVPR 2023). What is the novelty of the proposed method over these works? 

W2. The experiment comparisons are limited since only Mip-NeRF was used. Why not compare to some large-scale NeRDs such as block-NeRF or multi-views NeRFs such as MC-NeRF and NeRF-MS. The authors should justify the reason.

### Summary
The paper presents UC-NeRF, a method for new view image synthesis in multicamera systems. They introduce models for color correction, virtual warping, and pose refinement to improve upon the results of Zip-NeRF and NeRF. Each of these operations defines a loss function L_{sky}, L_{reg}, and L_{rpj}. The results seem to suggest that they are achieving state-of-the-art results. Yet, the code to verify this claim is not available. Further details may be needed to implement their ideas completely.

### Strengths
The paper presents state-of-the-art results. They benchmark the performance of UC-NeRF with several other strategies that have been recently introduced. Their ablation study suggests that each term in the loss function improves the results.

### Weaknesses
It would be great if the authors could share their code; even promising to share upon acceptance will be understandable. NeRF code is readily available. Otherwise, the authors should increase the clarity of their presentation to explain how their ideas could be implemented and the results reproduced for verification. 

In 3.5, I understand that UC-NeRF is NeRF trained on the original NeRF’s photometric loss and L_{sky} and L_{reg}, but you are also using L_{rpj}, correct? Is the total loss the sum of the individual losses? Are there weights on the losses before adding them?

What is mathbf{b} and mathbf{d} in (5)?

Define d_v and d_o in (6)

### Summary
This work proposed UC-NeRF, a method for novel view synthesis in under-calibrated multi-view camera systems. The authors propose a three-step approach to address these challenges:

1. Layer-based color correction: This step rectifies the color inconsistency in different image regions by applying color correction to each layer of the image pyramid.

2. Virtual warping: This step generates more viewpoint-diverse but color-consistent virtual views for color correction and 3D recovery. The authors show that virtual warping benefits color correction and edge sharpness.

3. Spatiotemporally constrained pose refinement: This step is designed for more robust and accurate pose calibration in multi-camera systems. The authors demonstrate that this step improves the accuracy of depth estimation in large-scale outdoor scenes.

The paper includes experimental results on several datasets and comparisons with other methods. The authors show that UC-NeRF achieves state-of-the-art performance in novel view synthesis and improves the sensing capabilities of multi-camera systems.

### Strengths
- The problem setting is interesting. The proposed method can be an enhancement of current NeRF techniques.

- The proposed method is sound and effective, regardless of its simplicity - complexity is not a criterion for us to judge whether a paper is good or not.

- The authors did exhaustive experiments to show the effectiveness of the proposed method. Ablation studies also show the effectiveness of each module.

### Weaknesses
 - I think the introduction of this paper is not well written. It took me some time to understand why this work needs virtual warping and what are the differences between single-camera NeRF and multi-camera NeRF (since each camera in a multi-camera system can be deemed as a single camera).

- The virtual warping step relies on the MVS method to generate dense depth maps, which may not generalize to street views (I'm not certain about this) and may need further pertaining.

- In Eq.(5), the author does not explain what is $\mathbf{b}$ and $\mathbf{d}$ denote.

- In Eq. (7), it is unclear whether the relative transformation $\Delta \mathbf{T}_k$ is optimized.

- The final training loss is missing, e.g. $\mathcal{L} = \mathcal{L}_{\text{pho}} + \lambda_1 \mathcal{L}_{\text{reg}} +  \lambda_1 \lambda_2 \mathcal{L}_{\text{rpj}} $.

- The pose refinement step is quite straightforward. Since the relative pose constraints $\Delta \mathbf{T}$ in the same rig can be obtained through calibration, I think it is naive to decompose the camera pose into the ego pose and a relative transformation $\Delta \mathbf{T}$. Moreover, the pose refinement step requires point correspondences, which could introduce outliers since it is well known that SOTA point matching methods are prone to repetitive structures and moving objects.

### Questions
- The pose refinement step relies on keypoints, which could be a shortcoming. Did the author consider DBARF (CVPR 2023) and FlowCam (NeurIPS 2023), which jointly optimize consecutive camera poses and NeRF?
Actually, due to the vibrations during driving, the relative camera poses in a rig could change. I think the author mentioned it in the introduction, but the case is not handled in the formulation (Eq. (7)).

- Did you reimplement Zip-NeRF or use others' reimplementation of Zip-NeRF? If it is the latter case, the URL should be provided since Zip-NeRF does not release its code.
