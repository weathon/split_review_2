## Abstract
Whittle index is a heuristic tool that leads to good performance for the restless bandits problem. In this paper, we extend Whittle index to a new multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) setting with multiple discrete actions and a possibly changing constraint on the state space, resulting in WIMS (Whittle Index with Multiple actions and State constraint). This setting is common for inventory management where each agent chooses a replenishing quantity level for the corresponding stock-keeping-unit (SKU) such that the total profit is maximized while the total inventory does not exceed a certain limit. Accordingly, we propose a deep MARL algorithm based on WIMS for inventory management. Empirically, our algorithm is evaluated on real large-scale inventory management problems with up to 2307 SKUs and outperforms operation-research-based methods and baseline MARL algorithms.

### Summary
This paper extended Whittle index method to a multi-agent reinforcement learning setting under the inventory management setup with multiple discrete actions (number of replenishments) and a global constraint on the state space (total inventory not exceeds a certain limit). The paper bridges two gaps to the restless bandits problem: the constraint is imposed on the state instead of the actions; there are multiple actions for each agent instead of binary actions; by measuring the cost of unit budget consumption and generates the critical points for different actions (changes index into vectors). Then the author proposed a algorithm combines their WIMS with a neural network to solve problem more efficiently. The real data experiments shows that the new policy performs good and efficiently with less constraint violations compared to existing policies.

### Strengths
-	This paper introduces a novel adaptation of the Whittle Index tailored for a MARL setting. The adaptation addresses challenges that previously hindered the direct application of the Whittle Index such as multiple actions for each agent and constraints on state spaces instead of action spaces. The application of WIMS in a deep MARL algorithm, called WIMSN, further establishes its originality.
-	This paper compares the proposed algorithm with both traditional operation research methods and other MARL baselines, providing a comprehensive evaluation. The adaptive nature of WIMSN to changes in constraints or combinations of SKUs without requiring retraining emphasizes the quality and flexibility of the proposed approach.
-	This paper is well-structured and organized. Technical concepts such as WIMS are well explained using simple examples, making them easily accessible to readers. 
-	The ability to scale WIMSN to thousands of agents highlight its significant, especially in large-scale industrial scenarios. 
-	This paper is original in that it measures the cost of unit budget consumption and generates the whittle index to be a vector. Furthermore, the author gave a reasonable sufficient condition of indexability for the vector whittle index, (which is the optimal policy should not reduce the replenishment quantity when the inventory cost decreases.)
-	This paper has high contributions since the methods generally applied to other problems where the global constraint of a multi-agent learning problem depends on states instead of on actions.

### Weaknesses
-	This paper builds upon the Whittle index, but there is no comprehensive exploration of the inherent limitations or challenges of using this index in a MARL context. This oversight could result in practical challenges or unintended outcomes when transitioning to real-world implementations. It would be beneficial for the authors to outline specific assumptions made when integrating the Whittle Index. One potential area of exploration could be the interplay of local constraints in conjunction with global constraints. Some SKUs might have their own unique storage.
-	This paper does not have details on how the dataset is partitioned into training, validation, and testing subsets. Providing this information is essential for ensuring replicability and comprehending the robustness of the outcomes. It would be beneficial for the authors to explicitly define and justify their splitting methodology, particularly given the time series nature of the data.
-	It would be helpful if the authors mentioned areas where their method (WIMSN) could be improved or further developed. By discussing potential future studies or enhancements, the authors would make their paper even more valuable.
-	The literature review seems not very complete and up-to-date. The author reviewed a lot of works on the operation research and on independent learning based MARL without global constraints, and the main comparisons were made with works in 217,2018. I am wondering if there are more recent works focus on similar topic.
-	One of the focuses, main assumptions and challenges in this paper, which is the limit of the total inventory capacity changes across the different seasons is not very reasonable to me. If the constraint is only changed once a long time like once a seasons, it seems to me that wrong those previous algorithms and re-train the model does not bring many troubles.

### Questions
-	Based on the above mentioned weaknesses, I feel that the comparison in Figure 2 does not complete or fair enough.  The author compared their adaptive algorithm with two IPPO models trained with two different capacity limits, but the author didn’t mention any training cost or training time for IPPO, so I am wondering why the IPPO users can’t re-train their models on the 50th day, since the reward was compared on a daily manner. 
-	In the neural network training phase, in the network update steps, they sample a batch of transitions from the replay buffer, could this word “batch” be more clarified? And is this replay buffer something important to computational efficient of the algorithm? What is the difference from regular learning algorithms that runs a sequence of data first and without a replay buffer?
-	OR-based methods was first mentioned without explanation, should add an abbreviation after first mentioning operation research.
-	It's unclear from the given text what dataset was used for training and testing the proposed methods. This raises concerns about the generalizability and robustness of the proposed models. Are the datasets representative of real-world scenarios? Are they publicly available for verification and reproducibility?
-	While the paper mentions computational costs and standard deviations of daily profits, are there other metrics (like fill rate, stockout rate, etc.) used in inventory management that could provide a more comprehensive view of performance?
-	(Typo in Proposition 3.3) In the third case, Q(s,1) = Q(s,i) -> Q(s,1) = Q(s,0)

### Summary
This paper considered a multi-agent reinforcement learning setting with multiple actions and one coupling state constraint which has broad applicability across various fields, including inventory management.  The authors proposed WIMS by leveraging deep multi-agent reinforcement learning. Specifically, WIMS built on top of the state-of-the-art Whittle index policy, and generalize it to multi-action and dynamic state constraint settings. Experimental results were provided to validate the performance of WIMS.

### Strengths
This paper considered a multi-agent reinforcement learning setting with multiple actions and one coupling state constraint which has broad applicability across various fields, including inventory management.  The authors proposed WIMS by leveraging deep multi-agent reinforcement learning.

### Weaknesses
1. In this paper, the authors assume that the multiple SKUs are independent and their total inventory level cannot exceed some capacity constraint. Unfortunately, this assumption is problematic and lack of justification. For example, rewards are not only independent in large-scale systems (a large number of SKU), and the substitution effect can occur. 

2. The proposed algorithm WIMS is mostly heuristic based and lack performance guarantees. First, this paper introduces a state constraint that must be satisfied in each time step $t$ in Section 4.1. However, WIMS is NOT guarantee to satisfy this constraint at all, and hence there is a gap between the formulated problem and the proposed solution. Second, it is not quite clear if the proposed WIMS is asymptotically optimal or not, which is a key performance in restless bandits literature. For example, the state-of-the-art Whittle index policy is provably asymptotically optimal. However, Whittle index policy is designed for restless bandits with a constraint on the action, rather than on the state. It is not straightforward to the reviewer if the asymptotic proof of Whittle index policy can be generalized to that for WIMS. Third, as discussed above, there is a gap between the problem formulation (with state constraint) and the proposed WIMS (ignore the constraint). To this end, this paper tunes the parameters of $\lambda_g$. Though empirical results are provided, it is unclear if this is theoretically sound given that there is not performance guarantee in this paper. 

3. From the experimental results, the proposed WIMS outperformed the considered baselines in terms of accumulated profit. What about the computational complexity? The reviewer did not fully understand the results presented in Table 4. It seems that WIMS takes significant larger computational costs, measured in mins. Given these large numbers (mins), how could this algorithm adapt to dynamic settings?

### Summary
This paper is about computational studies of a Whittle index-based policy on a variant of the restless bandit problem. The restless bandit setting allows multiple actions for each bandit, and there is a constraint that controls the joint state of the bandits. In particular, the paper focuses on the inventory management of multiple stock-keeping units. Here, each stocking-keeping unit corresponds to a bandit, and the list of stock levels that a unit can maintain is the set of actions. The distinction with the existing works on restless bandits is that the problem is not about selecting one bandit but about choosing an action for each bandit. That said, it makes sense to define and compare the indices of multiple actions, instead of comparing some indices of distinct bandits. Moreover, the inventory level constraint imposes restrictions on taking which actions to different units. Therefore, the problem can be viewed as an instance of multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL).

### Strengths
* The paper provides a novel definition of a Whittle index-type policy for a multi-agent inventory management problem. Indexability for the setting is defined, and some sufficient conditions for the notion of indexability are provided. The framework seems novel.
* In general, implementing a Whittle index policy can be inefficient as computing Whittle indices is difficult. However, numerical results show that the proposed Whittle index-based policy can be efficiently implemented and at the same time, one can impose satisfying the joint inventory level constraint at least computationally.

### Weaknesses
 * No theoretical guarantee on the proposed method is provided. It seems that the framework sits between restless bandits and multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL). That said, the reader would wonder if any theoretical results on either restless bandits or MARL extend to the particular problem setting of this paper. Specifically, while Whittle index policies have known asymptotic optimality results in certain restless bandit settings without constraints, it is unclear if these results extend to the constrained case considered here. The paper lacks any analysis of the suboptimality introduced by the joint inventory constraint.
* It is not clear how the joint inventory level constraint is satisfied by the WIMS policy. The WIMS policy controls individual stock-keeping units separately while the only joint control is on updating the dual variable. That said, in principle, one may use any algorithm for dealing with individual units. It is difficult to convince that the WIMS policy is particularly effective for the multi-agent setting studied in this paper. The paper does not sufficiently explain why the specific structure of the Whittle index is crucial for coordinating the agents, or why other inventory control policies, combined with dual variable updates, would not achieve similar performance.

### Questions
* Is it possible to prove that without the joint inventory level constraint, the Whittle index-based policy of this paper achieves optimality?
* Is it possible to discover and explain any connection between the setting of this paper and the MARL settings, e.g., fully competitive and cooperative settings?
* Is it possible to compare the proposed framework of this paper and the existing single-agent inventory control methods combined with dual penalization as done in this paper?
