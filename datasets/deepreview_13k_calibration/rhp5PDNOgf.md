## Abstract
The recent popularity of large language models has been fueled in part by advances in instruction tuning, which has helped unlock new levels of zero-shot model performance. Much of the prior work in this area has focused on creating new datasets to improve or add specific skills (e.g., improving reasoning via chain-of-thought prompting), or improving existing data sets by increasing the diversity of tasks and prompting templates. However, recent work has shown that instruction tuning can sometimes lead to performance degradation, and recent work has sought to overcome this issue by creating better dataset mixes (or collections) involving laborious and careful ablation studies to find the right composition. In this work, we propose a novel adaptive scheduling strategy we call spaced scheduling motivated by the spaced repetition learning method used by humans that creates an optimal curriculum (or schedule) of training examples. Our approach aims to perform the data mix selection process online during training, tailoring the training data composition to the chosen pre-trained model, reducing the need for extensive studies over different compositions of training data. Our results show that Spaced Scheduling yields better performance than random sampling and comparable results in the worst case, using less training data and minimizing catastrophic forgetting. Further, our proposed approach also yields more \textit{balanced} performance across all subcategories of the tested benchmarks.

3: You are fairly confident in your assessment. It is possible that you did not understand some parts of the submission or that you are unfamiliar with some pieces of related work. Math/other details were not carefully checked.

### Summary
This work proposes an adaptive strategy for fine-tuning, where the fine-tuning algorithm actively decides which examples are worth training on based on whether they are too "trivial" or "difficult". This technique is inspired by results in psychology demonstrating how human learning benefits from the technique of spaced repetition. Across LLaMa-2 7B and 13B and 5 benchmark scores, the method outperforms vanilla fine-tuning by 0.6-5.8%. Across several ablations, it's found that every component of this method is needed.

### Strengths
1. Spaced repetition consistently improves accuracy across all 5 benchmarks and 2 models, demonstrating robust gains.
2. The paper provides an ablation study for three components of the algorithm, and it seems that all 3 improve performance
3. The paper spends time clearly outlining their precise algorithm

### Weaknesses
I overall would appreciate better contextualization/analysis of the method to prove that it's improving upon our current understanding/practice of fine-tuning.

1. Baselines: Though it is encouraging that this model improves over vanilla fine-tuning, this is not the only work in improving data quality/curriculum for fine-tuning. In terms of static pruning methods, one naive baseline is to filter sentences with too high or low perplexity (similar to high/low difficulty), as done [for pretraining](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.04564). In terms of active learning methods, [Data diets](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.03208) performs a very similar algorithm to the one in this work, dynamically pruning based on a notion of sample importance (the related work of this paper also provides other references). I believe the paper should reflect this in two ways.
    - The related work and contextualization of the current paper make it seem that this problem has not been studied before, which can be misleading. Better contextualizing the work in terms of prior research in this area will help highlight the novel contributions by this paper.
    - Though the results provide an ablation study, it is unclear where prior work lies in this spectrum. Regardless of the motivation, this paper is providing a new method, and its important to contextualize its gains with respect to prior work. Though there are too many baselines to evaluate all, I would appreciate seeing a reasonable baseline to confirm that along some axis, this work pushes along various fine-tuning tradeoffs. 
2. Overhead: This algorithm should induce extra time overhead since examples have to be scored, and "currently difficult" examples may have to go through the model multiple times. The authors should report the time taken by both algorithms to evaluate this slowdown so one can evaluate whether this accuracy improvement is worth the additional cost.
3. Connection to spaced repetition in psychology: From reading the paper, it is not clear to me how connected the algorithm is to spaced repetition learning for humans. According to the paper, spaced repetition says that "brains retain information more effectively when we learn in multiple, spread-out sessions". However, the actual algorithm proposed does not do this, and frames example selection under dynamic filtering based on example difficulty. Even if the analysis in Section 5.3 implies that the method is implicitly setting a curriculum, it is not clear to me how this connects to spaced repetition. I wonder what value the psychological motivation provides in the context of this work, and if there is a connection I'm missing in this regard.

### Questions
1. Is it possible to see the ablation study for all the benchmarks, or is it only possible to report for MMLU and BBH?
2. Is there any ablation result on the importance of (a) doing this dynamically instead of statically with the pretrained model and (b) adding backdropped data into the dataset?

### Summary
The paper discusses the advancement in instruction tuning for large language models, a method that has propelled their popularity. While most prior work has concentrated on the development or improvement of datasets, instruction tuning has sometimes led to a decline in performance. To address this, researchers have been carefully selecting the best dataset mixes through intensive ablation studies. The paper introduces a new adaptive scheduling strategy, termed "spaced scheduling", inspired by the spaced repetition learning method in humans. This approach dynamically selects the training data mix online, specifically tailored to the pre-trained model, eliminating the need for extensive studies on training data compositions. The results indicate that Spaced Scheduling surpasses random sampling, requires less training data, and prevents catastrophic forgetting. It also delivers balanced performance across all benchmark subcategories.

### Strengths
- The paper is well-written and clearly presented; 
- The paper tackled the important problem of data mixture & curriculum  learning of instruction tuning for large language model and proposed a novel method, "space scheduling", quantitive results on 4 benchmark suite show the effectiveness of the proposed methods versus baseline or random mixture methods; 
- Detailed ablation and qualitative examples w.r.t other scheduling variants have been presented to show the effectiveness of the proposed 
- It is great to show the proposed methods are based on LoRA, which offers extra accessibility to large research community;

### Weaknesses
 - There is a missing comparison in Table 1 versus Tulu as mentioned in 4.2 for the effectiveness of MERCURY versus original Tulu paper. Besides, MT-Bench or other human-involved evaluations might also be good to show the comprehensive effectiveness of the proposed methods; 
- Another concern of the proposed method is that it seems the benefits are enlarged for Math/Code with both MERCURY / Space Scheduling. However, when adding OpenOrca dataset only will contribute to that effect should be ablated; 
- The scalability of the proposed method is questionable but it is great to show the purposed methods are based on LoRA;

### Questions
- Just wondering the performance based on OpenOrca / Tulu-only for 7B/13B models to show the comprehensive view of MERCURY； 
- Could the authors imply the decreased performance on MMLU / World-Knowledge, is that due to the introduce of OpenOrca or other datasets may pose negative impact on the overall performance? 
- Could the authors explain the design choice of selected instruction dataset more, since according to Tulu, different data mixture as well as each dataset may contribute to positive/negative effects on each domain;

### Summary
The paper proposes an adaptive scheduling strategy called spaced scheduling motivated by the spaced repetition learning method used by humans. The approach aims to perform the data mix selection process online during training, tailoring the training data composition to the chosen pre-trained model. In addition, the paper creates a new instruction meta-collection, i.e., Mercury-Instruct.

### Strengths
- The introduction seems interesting. The analogy drawn to human learning processes is quite inspiring.
- The author performed an ablation study to show the benefit of each main component of the proposed algorithm.

### Weaknesses
 - Some parts of the writing are ambiguous. I think it is better to provide a representative concept figure.
- The experimental results are not so good. Stating that there is an overall performance improvement seems risky because there was a performance gain in four out of seven evaluations.
- While there are numerous hyperparameters within the proposed algorithm, the impact of their variations on performance has not been analyzed. Some ablation studies on hyperparameters, e.g., $s_t$ and $\rho_0$, seem necessary. This is necessary to determine whether this method is insensitive to hyperparameters.
- There are often instances where explanations are missing. For instance, it would be advisable for the authors to explain why the formula for the minimum score threshold based on competency is $z_t \leftarrow z_{max} - \kappa -1$.

### Questions
- How do you define the minimum score to deem a response good enough and the threshold repetitions to deem an example learned?
- Could you explain in more detail how you define the data categories?
- How do you define initial competency?
- Could you please provide a more detailed explanation of the criteria used to construct the Mercury-Instruct collection?
- Was there no paper using CL in instruction tuning for LLM previously? If there was, please explain the reason for not comparing with them.

### Confidence
4: You are confident in your assessment, but not absolutely certain. It is unlikely, but not impossible, that you did not understand some parts of the submission or that you are unfamiliar with some pieces of related work.

### Summary
The authors argue that spaced scheduling (inspired by spaced repetition, a popular technique used by students to memorize content)
can be used to better instruction-tune LLMs. They aggregate existing
instruction tuning datasets into one training benchmark, Mercury-instruct.
They then verify, on this benchmark, that their technique outperforms
random data selection when instruction tuning LLAMA-2 at model sizes 7B and 13B.

### Strengths
1. Motivating the technique with relevant psychology literature.

1. Applying the technique to instruction tuning LLMs, which is a research
  topic that is attracting considerable attention.

1. Conducting an ablation analysis on the components of the proposed algorithm.

### Weaknesses
 * Discussion of related work. For example, spaced scheduling for deep
  learning has been considered in **Hadi Amiri et. al**: 
  *Repeat before Forgetting: Spaced Repetition for Efficient and Effective
  Training of Neural Networks (ACL 2017, see page 2404)*

* The proposed method does not appear to be motivated with a memory model; compare
  **Amiri et al.** or **https://arxiv.org/pdf/1602.07032.pdf**, both works seem to motivate
  their proposals based on a memory model.

* In my opinion, the empirical part should have at least a comparison to
  another spaced scheduling method (compare **Amiri et al.**).

* In my opinion, it is hard to conclude if one should use the proposed method
  or some other online scheduling approach. For example, there is prior
  relevant work on automated curriculum learning, see for example **Kreutzer et. al**: *Bandits Don’t Follow Rules: Balancing Multi-Facet Machine Translation with Multi-Armed Bandits (ACL 2021)*. While I am **not necessarily** advocating direct comparison
  to the algorithm of **Kreutzer et al.**, I think the empirical part would be
  more solid by having a comparison to one or two additional approaches
  that schedule the data dynamically.


### Questions
My initial rating / recommendation is inclined towards rejection because:
* the novelty claim needs a better positioning wrt. previous work
* the empirical investigation feels limited. 

I am leaving some questions that would greatly help me to improve
my assessment and in case change the rating / recommendation towards acceptance.

**Major Questions**
1. Could you position your work wrt. to **Amiri et al.**? What makes this proposal
of spaced scheduling novel wrt. prior work?

1. Could you elaborate on why there is not a comparison to another spaced
  scheduler or to other approaches that dynamically schedule the training examples? (e.g. **Kreutzer et al.**)

**Minor Questions**
* Table 1: The performance decrease on some tasks (e.g. World Knowledge)
might be due to instruction tuning on the Mercury dataset. Since one
is interested in comparing instruction-tuning strategies, it might be
worth considering using the **LLAMA-2 Mercury**, which is instruction-tuned without spaced scheduling, as the baseline and reporting the gains/losses wrt. to **LLAMA-2 Mercury**.
