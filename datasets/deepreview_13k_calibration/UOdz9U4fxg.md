## Abstract
An important aspect of developing reliable deep learning systems is devising strategies that make these systems robust to adversarial attacks. There is a long line of work that focuses on developing defenses against these attacks, but recently, researchers have began to study ways to {\it reverse engineer the attack process}. This allows us to not only defend against several attack models, but also classify the threat model. However, there is still a lack of theoretical guarantees for the reverse engineering process. Current approaches that give any guarantees are based on the assumption that the data lies in a union of linear subspaces, which is not a valid assumption for more complex datasets. In this paper, we build on prior work and propose a novel framework for reverse engineering of deceptions which supposes that the clean data lies in the range of a GAN. To classify the signal and attack, we jointly solve a GAN inversion problem and a block-sparse recovery problem.  For the first time in the literature, we provide deterministic {\it linear convergence guarantees} for this problem. We also empirically demonstrate the merits of the proposed approach on several nonlinear datasets as compared to state-of-the-art methods.

### Summary
This paper introduces a GAN inversion-based approach to reverse engineering of deceptions (RED), providing provable guarantees.  The objective of RED extends beyond mere defense against attacks; it encompasses the ability to reverse engineer and deduce the specific nature of the attack. The approach deviates from previous assumptions that clean data is contained within linear subspaces, instead utilizing the capabilities of nonlinear deep generative models. The research paper presents a theoretical analysis that demonstrates the achievement of linear convergence towards global optima in the context of the nonconvex inverse problem, subject to certain local error bound conditions. The proposed model's robustness is demonstrated through empirical validations conducted on the MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, and CIFAR-10 datasets.

### Strengths
+ Contrary to adopting overly constraining assumptions like assuming data resides in a union of linear subspaces, which proves inadequate for intricate datasets, or employing networks with randomized weights, as some studies have done, this research opts for more rational assumptions. Specifically, it embraces considerations such as the Local Error Bound Condition (highlighted as Assumptions 2 and 5 in the paper) and proximal Polyak-Łojasiewicz conditions.
+ This study has not only addressed the theoretical aspect but has also presented empirical proof across various datasets.
+ In addition to conducting experiments with real data, the researchers also performed experiments using synthetic data, thereby contributing further evidence to their study.

### Weaknesses
 - The paper could enhance its comparison with State-of-the-Art methods, particularly by evaluating signal accuracy in comparison to other leading works. A broader array of these methods should be taken into account for a more comprehensive comparison. Specifically, the evaluation should include methods that leverage diffusion models for image purification, given their demonstrated effectiveness in this domain. The current comparison lacks a thorough analysis against these relevant techniques, which are increasingly becoming the standard in practical applications.
- The evaluation included a comparison of performance in terms of adversarial signal classification accuracy and attack classification accuracy. In addition to assessing robust accuracy, it would be beneficial to extend the comparison to include clean accuracy. This is crucial for understanding the model's performance under non-adversarial conditions and provides a baseline for evaluating its overall effectiveness.
- The assessment could extend to more sophisticated datasets, like ImageNet, as numerous other State-of-the-Art methods have previously reported their performance on such datasets. Evaluating on more complex datasets would provide a more comprehensive understanding of the model's scalability and generalizability.
- To empirically demonstrate the Error Bound, it would be advantageous to present it across a set of samples with varying sizes and illustrate its consistency. If the consistency holds, the maximum/standard deviation should remain nearly constant with an increase in the number of data samples. This would provide stronger evidence for the robustness of the theoretical claims.
- The effectiveness of GAN inversion falls short compared to the performance achieved with diffusion models, which are commonly employed in current practical applications. Some studies, such as [Nie et al.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.07460), have explored the use of Diffusion Models for purification, resulting in enhanced performance. It might be worthwhile to incorporate these models in this context, considering their potential for estimating clean data. Additionally, comparing the results against such approaches could provide valuable insights.

### Questions
1) Why was the testing limited to only 100 test examples for the CIFAR-10 dataset?
2) In practical applications, subgradient descent is typically not employed, as was done in your optimization for GAN inversion. Have you compared your GAN inversion results against those obtained using alternative methods?

### Summary
While previous research focused on defense strategies, recent work has explored reverse engineering the attack process to understand and classify threats. However, existing methods lack theoretical guarantees, as they assume data lies in linear subspaces, which may not hold for complex datasets. This paper introduces a framework that assumes clean data resides in the range of a GAN (Generative Adversarial Network). To classify signals and attacks, it jointly addresses a GAN inversion problem and a block-sparse recovery problem, offering deterministic linear convergence guarantees, a first in this context. Empirical results on nonlinear datasets show the effectiveness of this approach compared to existing methods.

### Strengths
1) Authors introduce a framework that combines GANs, which has connection with the clean data.

2) This paper conducts a thorough theoretical analysis to prove the effectiveness of the proposed method.

3) Authors meticulously designed experiments, thoroughly analyzed the experimental results, and demonstrated the effectiveness of the algorithm.

### Weaknesses
1） In the introduction section of this article, authors use too much space to introducing the background,  and takes too long to present the problem. The article lacks effective organization. Specifically, the transition from discussing defense strategies to reverse engineering attack processes could be made more concise. A clearer delineation of the problem statement earlier in the introduction would significantly improve the reader's understanding of the paper's focus.

2) The presentation of this article needs improvement, as there are many grammar issues, and it lacks readability. For example,  in the third sentence of second paragraph, citing the related works between two commas. More broadly, several sentences are convoluted and difficult to parse, hindering the overall clarity of the paper.

3) The experiment is not much convincing, since it uses small datasets. Specifically, the use of MNIST, CIFAR-10, and CelebA, while standard, may not fully capture the complexities of larger, more diverse datasets. This raises concerns about the generalizability of the proposed method to real-world scenarios.

4）The results of the experiment cannot strongly support the algorithm's advantages. While the results show some improvement, the margin of improvement is not substantial enough to definitively demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method over existing approaches. For instance, the improvement in classification accuracy is relatively minor, and the paper lacks a thorough comparison with a wider range of baseline methods.

### Questions
My mainly concern is with the writing of the article. The sentences are not easy to understand, there are grammar errors, and the readability is poor.

### Summary
In this paper, the authors present an approach to reverse engineering adversarial attacks. They leverage the generative priors of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and utilize block-sparse representations in attack dictionaries. This approach offers deterministic linear convergence guarantees for the problem. The authors provide results on MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, and CIFAR-10.

### Strengths
This paper works on Reverse Engineering of Deceptions (RED) problem. It tries to defend against attacks and figure out how those attacks work. The RED problem is a new and practical area of research with high importance.

### Weaknesses
1. One important contribution of this paper is that it has theoretical proof. However, the proof is based on the assumption that the activation functions in the described network are smooth and twice differentiable. However, it is not a very practical assumption. Specifically, many commonly used activation functions, such as ReLU, are not twice differentiable, and even smooth approximations may not hold in the context of complex GAN architectures. This limits the applicability of the theoretical results.

2. From the dataset aspect, the paper only shows results on simple datasets. There is no result validating the performance on a more complicated and widely adopted dataset such as ImageNet. The comparison baselines are also limited. The authors only compare with SBSAD. The authors mentioned other RED methods without theoretical guarantees such as [10] [11] [25], but not comparisons are included. Furthermore, the paper only have results on PGD attack. It's not sure if the method can be generalized to other more recent attack types such as AutoAttack. It's also meaning to consider the adaptive attack case. The lack of experiments on diverse datasets and attack types raises concerns about the generalizability of the proposed approach. Specifically, the method's reliance on a dictionary model derived from PGD attacks may not be effective against more sophisticated or adaptive attacks.

### Questions
1. Can this method generalize to more complicated dataset such as ImageNet?
2. How is the recovered clean signal look like? Is it close to the groundtruth clean example?
3. What will the performance be like if the attack is not PGD, such as AutoAttack and Feature attack?
