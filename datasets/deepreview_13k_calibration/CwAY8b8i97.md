## Abstract
In this article, we propose a new paradigm for training spiking neural networks (SNNs), {\it spike accumulation forwarding} ({\it SAF}). It is known that SNNs are energy-efficient but difficult to train. Consequently, many researchers have proposed various methods to solve this problem, among which online training through time (OTTT) is a method that allows inferring at each time step while suppressing the memory cost. However, to compute efficiently on GPUs, OTTT requires operations with spike trains and weighted summation of spike trains during forwarding. In addition, OTTT has shown a relationship with the Spike Representation, an alternative training method, though theoretical agreement with Spike Representation has yet to be proven. Our proposed method can solve these problems; namely, SAF can halve the number of operations during the forward process, and it can be theoretically proven that SAF is consistent with the Spike Representation and OTTT, respectively. Furthermore, we confirmed the above contents through experiments and showed that it is possible to reduce memory and training time while maintaining accuracy.

### Summary
The authors present “Spike Accumulation Forwarding (SAF)” for training spiking neural networks, an approach build on Online Training Through Time (OTTT) to utilize spike representations in form of accumulations through both the forward and the backward pass. This approach helps reduce the memory footprint of SNNs, since the membrane potential of the previous time step does not need to be tracked. In an extensive theoretical analysis, the authors prove the feasibility of their approach as well as its equivalence with the LIF neuron and the consistency with the existing approach OTTT. The theoretical findings are backed by a few pracitical examples.

### Strengths
- The approach is novel and useful, as memory footprint in SNN training is a major issue not only in the backward but also in the forward paths.
- The rigorous theoretical analysis proves the authors claims, and the brief experimental evaluation seems to confirm it.

### Weaknesses
 - The paper is in parts poorly written and very hard to follow. It would benefit from substantial language editing. Also, there are some Sentences and sections, e.g. 3rd paragraph of the introduction, whose meaning I do not understand at all.
- The experimental evaluation is kept rather short. While it does seem to confirm the theoretical findings, there is no clear description of the experiments (e.g. the utilized model architecture and training setup), and no source code, which prohibits reproduction of the results. 
- The prior work and related concepts upon which the contribution of the authors build is not explained very well. Half of the assumptions and derivations are to be found in other papers, making it almost impossible to fully grasp the paper as a stand alone. It appears to be follow-up work by the authors of previous work, hence the authors don’t seem to find it necessary to fully explain the background concepts
- It is not clear to me why the approach works for small time steps. As stated in section 3.2 Spike representation assumes a rather large latency (T -> inf) to work. Does that not also apply to SAF? In Fig. 5 you show that firing rates for OTTT and SAF are NOT Identical. Then why do your experiments assume T=6? Where does the averaged spike representation come from in practice? 
- In Section 3, Spike Representation, what is x for the weighted average input? Not mentioned before
- What model architecture and training setup was used for the experiments. As it, they are not reproducible by others.

### Summary
This paper improves the SNN representation of OTTT method. It simplifies the formulas used in SNN representation forward propagation, thereby reducing the memory and time required in the training phase. The proposed approach in this paper offers insights into SNN training. However, some weaknesses and limitations still remain within the content of this paper.

### Strengths
This article presents improvements to OTTT by further simplifying the forward propagation equations. Additionally, the authors demonstrate the consistency between the gradients of their SAF method and OTTT. They provide experimental evidence that their method outperforms OTTT in certain scenarios.

### Weaknesses
Weakness
1. There is numerous equations in this paper, and many parts lack detailed reasoning, making it challenging for readers to follow along. For instance, in the section Spike Representation, the intermediate steps of most equations are omitted. And $\mathbf{x}$ lacks explanation.
2. What is the purpose of section 2.4.3. The network structure that included in this paper and OTTT do not have feedback connection.
3. Merely validating the consistency between theoretical reasoning and the experimental results on CIFAR10 is insufficient for the author's purpose. It is evident that the author's approach, despite claiming consistency in the computation of reverse gradients with OTTT, yields different training outcomes (accuracy and fire rate). Moreover, based on the results presented by the author, it is clear that the SNN trained using the SAF method outperforms the OTTT method. Since the OTTT method involves more complex datasets, the author needs to demonstrate the superiority of SAF on those datasets as well.
4. The author mentions that Equation 2 holds true strictly when the network time step T tends to infinity. However, in practice, the author uses relatively small values of T, which introduces errors between the actual spike accumulation of the SNN and the weighted spike accumulation. These errors arise due to the uneven distribution of spikes[1]. Could the author provide insights on the differences between the training results (using representation) and the actual LIF forward results to address this issue?

### Summary
Spike accumulation forwarding (SAF) is a method that reduces memory requirements and training time for SNNs by accumulating spikes over multiple time steps. This approach is consistent with Spike Representation and online training through time methods. The authors tested SAF's effectiveness on the CIFAR-10 dataset.

### Strengths
The authors tried to solve an important challenge with training SNNs, namely the need for large amounts of memory and long training times. And the only small improvement I see is in memory and training times.

### Weaknesses
The authors didn’t compare SAF to BPTT and other successful training methods, requiring a comprehensive understanding.

They conducted experiments on a single set of hypermeters, which lacks further exploration of the robustness of the methods. Understanding the effects of various hyperparameters on SAF's performance and how to tune them for various applications would be improved by a more thorough analysis.

The authors have not provided a detailed analysis of the computational complexity of SAF. The authors have empirically demonstrated that SAF reduces memory needs and training time; however, they haven't done a thorough investigation of the computational complexity of the approach. The experiment is currently based on GPU architecture. It would be easier to comprehend the computational resources needed to execute SAF and its potential for real-world applications with a more thorough analysis.

The theoretical results only show that the proposed method has the same capabilities as OTTT and SpikeRepresentation, and no new guarantee of training is presented there. Hence, the contribution is reduced to find an efficient forward method that fits the training models of OTTT and SpikeRepresentation.

### Questions
Can you provide detailed explanations of how much computational overhead is needed when training? What kind of computation is included (float-point computation or spike computation)? I am interested in this because the training, unlike other online training, is based on float-point representation.

Regarding the robustness of the training algorithm, can you provide some results that have different settings of $\lambda$ and $T$.

Also, the current dataset setting is lacking. Only CIFAR-10 experiments are conducted. What about CIFAR-100 and ImageNet?

Overall, I am more inclined to reject this paper.

### Summary
This article introduces a new method for training Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) known as Spike Accumulation Forwarding (SAF). The authors conduct theoretical analysis and experimental comparisons to establish the equivalence of SAF with other methods, such as OTTT, while evaluating its performance and efficiency. Experimental data demonstrates that SAF can significantly reduce training time and memory usage with little to no loss in accuracy. Additionally, it is shown that SAF-trained parameters can be used for inference in SNNs composed of LIF neurons.

### Strengths
The article introduces an innovative method, SAF, for training SNNs, and its effectiveness is demonstrated through both theoretical analysis and experiments.

### Weaknesses
1. The relatively simple dataset used in the article (CIFAR-10) may limit the understanding of the method's applicability to more complex datasets.
2. The Figure 2 in the experimental section is relatively blurry.
3. The memory compression in Table 1 is also somewhat limited. Are there better results available to demonstrate the effectiveness of the method?
4. The experimental section lacks specific details about the SNN model, and it would be beneficial to test the method on different models.

### Questions
Do the authors have plans to apply the SAF method to other types of neural networks or larger datasets? Are there plans for more experiments to validate SAF's performance in different scenarios?
