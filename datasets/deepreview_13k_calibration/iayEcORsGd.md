## Abstract
Sparse training (ST) aims to ameliorate deep learning by replacing fully connected artificial neural networks (ANNs) with sparse or ultra-sparse ones, such as brain networks are, therefore it might benefit to borrow brain-inspired learning paradigms from complex network intelligence theory. Here, we launch the ultra-sparse advantage challenge, whose goal is to offer evidence on the extent to which ultra-sparse (around 1\% connection retained) topologies can achieve any leaning advantage against fully connected. Epitopological learning is a field of network science and complex network intelligence that studies how to implement learning on complex networks by changing the shape of their connectivity structure (epitopological plasticity). One way to implement Epitopological (epi- means new) Learning is via link prediction: predicting the likelihood of non-observed links to appear in the network. Cannistraci-Hebb learning theory inspired the CH3-L3 network automata rule for link prediction which is effective for general-purpose link prediction. Here, starting from CH3-L3 we propose Epitopological Sparse Meta-deep Learning (ESML) to apply Epitopological Learning to sparse training. In empirical experiments, we find that ESML learns ANNs with ultra-sparse hyperbolic (epi-)topology in which emerges a community layer organization that is meta-deep (meaning that each layer also has an internal depth due to power-law node hierarchy). Furthermore, we discover that ESML can in many cases automatically sparse the neurons during training (arriving even to 30\% neurons left in hidden layers), this process of node dynamic removal is called percolation. Starting from this network science evidence, we design Cannistraci-Hebb training (CHT), a 4-step training methodology that puts ESML at its heart. We conduct experiments on 7 datasets and 5 network structures comparing CHT to dynamic sparse training SOTA algorithms and the fully connected counterparts. The results indicate that, with a mere 1\% of links retained during training, CHT surpasses fully connected networks on VGG16, GoogLeNet, ResNet50, and ResNet152. This key finding is an evidence for ultra-sparse advantage and signs a milestone in deep learning. CHT acts akin to a gradient-free oracle that adopts CH3-L3-based epitopological learning to guide the placement of new links in the ultra-sparse network topology to facilitate sparse-weight gradient learning, and this in turn reduces the convergence time of ultra-sparse training. Finally, CHT offers the first examples of parsimony dynamic sparse training because, in many datasets, it can retain network performance by percolating and significantly reducing the node network size.

### Rating
8

### Rating Number
8

### Confidence
2: You are willing to defend your assessment, but it is quite likely that you did not understand the central parts of the submission or that you are unfamiliar with some pieces of related work. Math/other details were not carefully checked.

### Summary
The authors propose a new form of sparse network learning, which was brain-inspired. They compare to other methods in the field and evaluate on vision dataset.

### Strengths
Originality: I am not very familiar with the literature in this community, but from what I can tell the authors cite existing literature well and distinguish their approach adequately from other methods in the field.
Quality: the paper is well written, and the empirical results are well done: they are thorough, include meaningful baselines, and cover a nice variety of datasets.
Clarity: the paper was well written
Significance: I am not familiar enough with this sub-field to judge, but given the result, this appears to be a solid step in the right direction, and is likely relevant to the subcommunity.

### Weaknesses
While I understand the space constraints, having something like Table1 or Table2 in the main text (maybe in reduced form) would be nice.

### Summary
This paper is about a new training methodology for deep learning called Cannistraci-Hebb training (CHT). CHT is a training methodology that uses epitopological sparse meta-deep learning (ESML) to learn artificial neural networks (ANNs) with ultra-sparse hyperbolic topology.

### Strengths
1. The paper is well-written and all the methodological details are described clearly.
2. CHT is a new 4-step training methodology for deep learning that uses ESML to learn ANNs with ultra-sparse hyperbolic topology.
3. CHT has been shown to surpass fully connected networks on VGG16 and ResNet50.
4. CHT could be used in a wide range of real-world applications, such as image classification, natural language processing, speech recognition, recommender systems, and medical diagnosis.

### Weaknesses
1. For the node structure, this paper only compares CHT with fully connected graph, the author should take other graph structure into consideration, like ER, BA, WS graph. 
2. Compared with SOTA models, the performance of CHT is not competitive.

### Questions
1. What's the inspiration of current architecture? 
2. Did you do extra experience on other graph structure? 
3. In Table 2 on page15. Why some accuracy result is not the best but still highlighted?
