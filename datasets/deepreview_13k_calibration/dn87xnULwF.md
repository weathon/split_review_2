## Abstract
We propose a _linear time_ graph transformation that enables the Weisfeiler-Leman (WL) test and message passing graph neural networks (MPNNs) to be maximally expressive on _outerplanar_ graphs. Our approach is motivated by the fact that most pharmaceutical molecules correspond to outerplanar graphs. Existing research predominantly enhances the expressivity of graph neural networks without specific graph families in mind. This often leads to methods that are impractical due to their computational complexity. In contrast, the restriction to outerplanar graphs enables us to encode the Hamiltonian cycle of each biconnected component in linear time. As the main contribution of the paper we prove that our method achieves maximum expressivity on outerplanar graphs. Experiments confirm that our graph transformation improves the predictive performance of MPNNs on molecular benchmark datasets at negligible computational overhead.

### Summary
In this work, the authors studied the isomorphic problem of a special graph family, outerplanar graphs, by using GNNs. Compared to general graphs, most pharmaceutical molecular graphs correspond to this graph family. To this end, the authors proposed an efficient graph transformation approach to enhance the expressiveness of classical MPNNs. Additional theoretical analysis is provided to show that maximum expressivity on outerplanar graphs is achieved with the proposed approach. Empirical experiments are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

### Strengths
1. The targeted problem is of great practical significance. As pointed out in this paper, most pharmaceutical molecules correspond to outerplanar graphs, which play important roles in real-world applications in chemistry and biology.

2. The proposed CAT approach is both efficient (in linear time) and theoretically sound.

### Weaknesses
1. Lacking clarifications and discussions of related work. In [1], the authors developed a framework for the whole planar graphs class, which seems very relevant to this work. It is highly recommended to (1) clarify the novelty and originality of this work against [1]; (2) add discussions on the relations, scopes and any other aspects of these two works for improved quality.
 
2. The empirical evaluation needs to be further improved. Although the authors provided results on several benchmark datasets, I still think the evaluation does not meet the bar of this conference:
    - In Table 4, CAT+GAT consistently underperforms GAT on most datasets. Such a degrade performance brought by CAT is strange compared to that in GIN/GCN. Could you provide further explanation on this phenomenon?
    - The experimented baselines are limited. In Table 4, only GCN,GIN and GAT are tested. In recent years, there exist advanced GNN variants with linear complexity. To better verify the generality of the proposed approach, it is highly recommended to conduct more experiments on other GNNs.
    - The scale of chosen benchmarks is limited. From Table 1, we can see that there also exist large-scale molecule datasets (>100k) suitable to verify the approach for outplanar graphs. It is highly recommended to conduct more experiments on more large-scale datasets to see whether the proposed approach can consistently bring gains in this setting.

### Summary
This paper studies the problem of how to distinguish non-isomorphic *outer-planar* graphs using GNNs. The motivation is that: (1) distinguishing non-isomorphic in the general setting is intrinsically hard; (1) the restricted outer-planar graphs is common in various practical settings, so solving this simpler problem is always significant in real-world applications; (3) it is possible to design extremely efficient GNN models to solve outer-planar graph isomorphism, which only have a linear complexity.

The authors thus used theoretical results related to outer-planar graphs to design a *preprocessing step* so that the processed (directed) graphs can be distinguished by 1-WL. They also discussed the property of the processed graphs, such as diameter and resistance distance. The approach is efficient in that the graphs are a linear number of vertices and edges.

Finally, the authors conducted experiments to show the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

### Strengths
1. The paper is well-motivated. I appreciate the topic of studying GNN design for outer-planar graphs: although it is somehow restricted, it still covers important practical applications and sounds reasonable to me.
2. The paper is clearly written. Despite the sophisticated theoretical background, the presentation is generally easy to read and organizes well. The notations are consistent, and the presented figures is great and intuitive. I particularly appreciate the counterexamples in this paper, which gives insights into the proposed algorithm.
3. The proposed method is efficient. It has a linear (worst-case) complexity, not only due to using the standard MPNN, but even for the preprocessing step, which contrasts to prior work.

### Weaknesses
1. Discussions of related work could be more comprehensive. For example, I found that this paper is highly related to the recent paper [1]. Both works share a common foundation rooted in biconnectivity, specifically concerning biconnected components and block cut trees, as well as a focus on distance metrics, encompassing the shortest path distance and resistance distance. Since the motivation of the two papers is also similar (both pointing out the importance of planar graphs in practice and giving molecular graphs as counterexamples), I feel that giving an in-depth discussion (perhaps within the introductory section of your paper), could further justify the paper's significance and provide a more comprehensive context for the reader.

   Besides, I also found that another recent paper [2] studied a similar topic to your paper but this paper currently did not discuss it. Could you provide some discussions for the similarity and difference between the two works?

2. The proposed CAT transformation is somehow complicated, in particular for the general case (Definition 2). I think it may be beneficial to discuss more about the intuition of Definition 2 in Appendix. Moreover, it introduces a lot of additional nodes and edges and even changes an undirected graph to a directed one. While it has indeed shown that the separation power is improved, significantly changing the structure of the input graph may result in some drawbacks. As another problem, can the approach be extended to node classification?

3. The proposed approach only works for outer-planar graphs. Can the results be generalized to general planar graphs? I think Lemma 1 does not hold in the general setting. Since still about 5% of the graphs are not outer-planar as shown in Table 1, this is perhaps a limitation.

4. While the experimental results showed that an MPNN with CAT can outperform vanilla MPNN, such baselines are actually quite weak. I am not fully convinced to what extent the proposed approach is superior in practice.

Despite the weaknesses and questions, I still appreciate this paper and tend towards giving an acceptance. I will consider increasing the score if the concerns are well-addressed.

Miscellaneous minor issue: in the fourth line in page 8, there is a redundant word "and".

### Questions
Can you illustrate more about how your approach may/ may not be generalized to $k$-outerplanar graphs?


---

The authors addressed several of my concerns, but it seems that there is indeed a close relation between this paper and PlanE after seeing other reviews, and PlanE can solve the more general planar graph isomorphism with still linear complexity (if not considering the preprocessing step). Considering all these aspects, I thus decided to maintain my score.

### Summary
This paper investigates the expressive power of graph neural networks (GNNs) for outerplanar graphs. The authors prove that if the cyclic adjacency transform (CAT) of two outerplanar graphs cannot be distinguished by the Weisfeiler-Leman (WL) test, then the two graphs must be isomorphic, which implies that GNNs have enough expressive power to represent properties of outerplanar graphs. Some numerical results are reported and show that the proposed approach is promising.

### Strengths
1. This paper theoretically proves that two outerplanar graphs are isomorphic if and only if their CAT cannot be distinguished by the WL test. I think this is the right direction for studying the expressive power of GNNs and the WL test -- one should focus on some specific class of graphs since in general WL test cannot solve the graph isomorphism problem perfectly.
2. The authors give an explicit example of a pair of non-isomorphism outerplanar graphs that cannot be distinguished by the WL test, showing that CAT is necessary. The proposed approach is efficient, in the sense that the CAT of outerplanar graphs can be computed in linear time.
3. Outerplanar graphs are of practical interest in modeling molecules and the reported numerical results look nice.

### Weaknesses
1. The presentation can be improved. For example, maybe the authors can consider presenting two molecules in Figure 5 before at the beginning of Section 3. It might be better to explain the intuition of Theorem 1 and Theorem 2 using specific examples (like Figure 5).
2. It might be better if the authors can discuss more about the limitations and the potential of the mathematical techniques  -- For example, does Theorem 2 hold true for general planar graphs, why or why not?

### Summary
This paper proposes a graph transformation (CAT) that enhances the expressive power of standard graph neural networks (GNN) on outerplanar graphs: CAT-enhanced GNNs are capable of distinguishing all non-isomorphic outerplanar graphs. The authors rely on a specific property of outerplanar graphs: biconnected outerplanar graphs have a unique hamiltonian cycle which can be identified in linear time, and this by identifying this cycle, one can uniquely identify each biconnected outerplanar graph. The authors hence use a linear-time algorithm to identify the cycle, and then compute the hamiltonian adjacency list (HAL), which is then used to create an annotated transformation of the input graph. Since 1-WL-expressive GNNs can identify any labelled trees, the authors show that the presented algorithm combined with a 1-WL-expressive-GNN can identify outerplanar graphs. Experiments on two molecular datasets shows that the method yields meaningful improvements on the baseline GNN models.

### Strengths
**Natural idea**: The idea of enhancing GNNs with easy-to-compute structural context is natural, and in this instance, it has implications of a subset of planar graphs in that it leads to a complete algorithm on outerplanar graphs.

**Limited computational overhead**: The approach boils down to a simple pre-processing step, but once the pre-processing is done it can used with any GNN model.

### Weaknesses
 - **Scholarship**: The fundamental of this paper is to annotate graphs with labels to enhance the discriminative capacity of standard GNNs, which is widely studied under different node labelling approaches and a more thorough related work coverage is essential. Most importantly, there is a recent paper "Dimitrov et al, PlanE: Representation Learning on Planar Graphs, NeurIPS 2023"  which introduces a *complete algorithm on the class of all planar graphs*. This paper strictly subsumes the result presented in the current submission.

- **Technically incorrect statements**: There are many hand-wavy and sometimes incorrect statements. First of all, authors should cite the paper "Kiefer et al,  The Weisfeiler-Leman Dimension of Planar Graphs is at most 3, LICS 2017" or its journal version and present the result correctly: The result states that 3-WL is complete on planar graphs (and not just on outerplanar graphs). Moreover, authors also confuse the dimension counts of WL: "...any GNN which matches the expressivity of 3-WL, such as 3-IGN (Maron et al., 2019) or 3-GNN (Morris et al., 2019), is capable of solving our main goal of distinguishing all outerplanar graphs." This is incorrect since Kiefer et al's result uses the classical WL algorithm also referred as the folklore 3-WL, so neither 3-IGN nor 3-GNNs have folklore 3-WL power. It is also open whether folklore 2-WL would suffice for planar isomorphism testing.

- **Significance and novelty**: The paper's technical contribution is limited. Leveraging 1-WL result in combination with CAT is interesting but relatively straightforward. My biggest concern is that there are complete neural models on planar graphs, which are also very scalable. The other technical contributions amount to arguing about shortening the propagation distance in the graph for better information flow. I find this analysis somewhat weak, because this effect can be trivially achieved by adding a virtual node or alike. It appears tangential to the study. 

- **Baselines**: I understand that the authors would like to convey the idea of empowering existing GNN models with CAT, but I still think the comparison should be broader when it comes to baseline models.There are many models, including e.g. CIN which achieves very strong results on ZINC. There is also the question of whether this method is applicable to a broader class of models.

### Summary
This paper proposed a graph transformation method CAT for outerplanar graphs that can run in linear time. Authors show that graphs after transformation can be fully distinguished by 1-WL, resulting in a simple MPNN that can be maximally expressive for it. Since most real-world molecular graphs are outerplanar graphs, the proposed method has great potential for related downstream tasks, avoiding the high computational cost introduced by traditional high-expressive GNNs. Authors compare their transformation with the original one on several real-world datasets and demonstrate the improvement.

### Strengths
1. the proposed transformation is sound and its practical runtime is promising.
2. Authors theoretically prove the MPNN can be maximally expressive for the CAT-transformed outerplanar graphs.
3. The proposed method can reduce the diameter and effective resistance of graphs, which could bring performance improvement for tasks that require long-range information.
4. The comparison result between the datasets before and after the transformation is promising.

### Weaknesses
1. Authors only compare the CAT with the non-CAT version on MPNN. I believe more baseline models need to be included for completeness. It would be great to see pre-processing cost + training/inference cost + performance comparison on different baseline methods like subgraph-based GNNs and high-order GNNs.
2. Authors claim CAT can help alleviate the problem of over-squashing and improve the performance of long-range tasks. However, no evaluations are performed. I believe some experiments should be conducted, like datasets in Long-Range Benchmarks [1].

### Questions
1. Can the authors explain why the CAT achieved worse performance than the original one in MOLLIPO and MOLTOX21? Especially in MOLLIPO, the gap is significant.
