## Abstract
Due to the widespread application of reinforcement learning, research on its adversarial attacks is necessary for building secure reinforcement learning applications. However, most of the current security research focuses only on reinforcement learning with discrete states and actions, and these methods cannot be directly applied to reinforcement learning in continuous state and action spaces. In this paper, we investigate attacks on continuous reinforcement learning. Rather than manipulating observations or environments, our focus lies in action-manipulation attacks that impose more restrictions on the attacker. Our study investigates the action-manipulation attack in both white-box and black-box scenarios. We propose a black-box attack method called LCBT, which uses a layered binary tree structure-based refinement and segmentation method to handle continuous action spaces. Additionally, we prove that under the condition of a sublinear relationship between the dynamic regret and total step counts of the reinforcement learning agent, LCBT can force the agent to frequently take actions according to specified policies with only sublinear attack cost. We conduct experiments to evaluate the effectiveness of the LCBT attack on three widely-used reinforcement learning algorithms: DDPG, PPO, and TD3.

### Summary
This work investigates the vulnerability of reinforcement learning under action-manipulation attack in the continuous state and action space. In this setting, the goal of the attacker is forcing the learner to learn an approximation of the target policy by altering the learner's action in a continuous action space. The authors study the action-manipulation attack in both white-box and black-box settings. They first propose a white-box oracle attack strategy, which can achieve sublinear attack cost and loss under some assumptions. They propose a black-box attack method named LCBT, which is able to force the RL agent to choose actions according to the policies specified by the attacker with sublinear attack cost. The experimental results show the effectiveness of the proposed attack algorithms.

### Strengths
Originality: this is the first work that provides theoretical guarantees on the bound of the attack cost and loss of the action-manipulation attack against RL with continuous state and action spaces. The choice to utilize a binary tree structure is well-founded and effectively addresses the challenges derived from the continuous setting.

Quality: the authors of this paper have developed two attack algorithms for white-box and black-box settings respectively. They offer an in-depth theoretical analysis of these algorithms' attack cost and loss. Additionally, experimental results somewhat support the theoretical results.

Clarity: the main text of this paper conveys the idea and the proposed method well. The theoretical analyses seem to be solid although I do not check the proof in the appendix carefully.

Significance: The authors provide some theoretical guarantees of the proposed attack algorithms which show the attacker can mislead the agent by spending sublinear attack cost and achieve sublinear attack loss. The results are interesting and show that the action attack is also harmful in continuous reinforcement learning.

### Weaknesses
1.  If I am not wrong, this paper does not introduce the method of dividing the continuous subset of the action space when new leaves are generated. This part is also important for the practical application of the proposed attack method.

2. The binary tree method can deal with the low-dimensional continuous action space but may meet problems in high-dimensional space. In high-dimensional action space case, the tree method is not efficient and it may requires huge mount of rounds to explore the worst node.

3. The proposed black-box method needs to discretize the continuous state space. This paper partitions it into $M$ subintervals. How can a black-box attacker find a proper discretization of the state space? It seems unrealistic in the high-dimensional state space. As the attack cost and loss are linear dependent on $M$.

### Questions
1. What is the method of dividing the continuous subset of the action space when new leaves are generated?

2. Can the method be directly used in high-dimensional action space case?

3. See in Weaknesses 3.

### Summary
This paper presents a new attack algorithm for reinforcement learning agents in
the action-manipulation setting. First, a white-box attack is developed which
assumes access to the underlying MDP, with which an optimal attack action can be
computed. Theoretical bounds show that with high probability, the attacker can
force the agent to approximately learn a target policy with a number of
interventions roughly proportional to the regret of the policy. A black-box
approximation to the attack is then developed which relaxes the assumption of
full knowledge of the MDP. The black box attack uses an action-space
partitioning algorithm to approximate the worst-case action for a given state.
Theoretical bounds for the black box attack show similar results to the
white-box version. Finally, empirical experiments show that the proposed attack
is successful at forcing several common RL algorithms to learn the target
policies.

### Strengths
The theoretical results are interesting and (to the best of my knowledge) novel.
In particular, the cost bound for the practical algorithm (Theorem 2) is an
interesting result with important implications for robust RL.

Extending RL attacks to continuous state and action spaces is an important
problem, given how many realistic scenarios are continuous. The discretization
approach to this problem is interesting and the online abstraction refinement
approach is a reasonable way to trade off cost and precision.

### Weaknesses
I have some concerns about the experimental evaluation:

- The environments considered are extremely low-dimensional, even by the
  standards of formal methods research.
- There are no comparisons with existing RL attack methods, so it's hard to
  gauge the empirical effectiveness of this approach.
- There are only two environments.

There are a few places where the writing was not very clear to me, most notably
in Section 4.2. I think this section could do with some more intuition or an
example.


### Questions
Does the analysis hold for stochastic policies? I was a bit unclear on this
since the definitions of $Q$ and $V$ both use the notation introduced for
deterministic policies. Moreover it seems to me that some parts of the proofs
rely on the assumption that all policies are deterministic (including the
exploration policies of the RL algorithm), but most RL algorithms do not work by
evaluating deterministic policies.

### Summary
This paper investigates adversarial attacks in continuous reinforcement learning environments. The primary focus is on action manipulation attacks, where attackers intercept and modify the actions taken by the intelligent agent before they reach the environment. The paper makes the following key contributions:

1. The paper introduces a threat model for action manipulation attacks in continuous state and action spaces, defining the attacker's goals, knowledge, and capabilities with the help of a target policy. It also introduces the concept of a "target action space" to adapt to continuous environments.

2. The research covers both white-box and black-box scenarios. In the white-box scenario, the attacker has extensive knowledge of the underlying processes, allowing for intuitive attack methods. In the black-box scenario, a novel (as far as the reviewer concerned) attack method called "Lower Confidence Bound Tree" (LCBT) is introduced to approximate the effectiveness of white-box attacks.

3. In the white-box scenario, the paper proposes the "oracle attack" method, which can compel agents using sub-linear-regret reinforcement learning algorithms to select actions that follow target policies with sublinear attack costs.

4. The proposed attack methods are applied to popular RL algorithms, including DDPG, PPO, and TD3, and their effectiveness is demonstrated through experiments.

In summary, this paper addresses the crucial issue of security in continuous reinforcement learning environments, particularly focusing on action manipulation attacks. It provides a comprehensive understanding of these attacks, introduces new attack methods, and validates their effectiveness through experiments.

### Strengths
This paper possesses several notable strengths:

_Originality_:

1. The paper addresses a relatively uncharted issue within the field of reinforcement learning, concentrating on adversarial attacks within continuous action spaces. While adversarial attacks in RL have been explored to some extent, the particular focus on action manipulation attacks in continuous environments represents a good contribution.

2. The introduction of the "oracle attack" for white-box scenarios and the "Lower Confidence Bound Tree" (LCBT) for black-box scenarios presents new methods for action manipulation attacks. These approaches offer new viewpoints and solutions to the problem, enhancing the paper's originality.

_Quality_:

3. The paper establishes a solid theoretical foundation for its attack methods, discussing the conditions under which these attacks are effective. The analysis of sub-linear-regret reinforcement learning algorithms and the associated cost bounds adds to the quality of the research.

### Weaknesses
While the paper showcases numerous strengths, it also reveals specific limitations that, if addressed, could enhance its quality and influence:

1. The paper's efficacy could be improved through a more thorough examination of prior research in the realm of adversarial attacks on reinforcement learning. While the paper briefly references previous work, a more detailed comparison with existing attack techniques on continuous action spaces and their inherent limitations would serve to underscore the novelty and merits of the proposed methods. Specifically, the paper should discuss how its approach compares to methods that also consider the impact of adversarial perturbations on the agent's policy, not just the immediate action. A discussion of the trade-offs between the proposed methods and existing approaches in terms of attack success rate, stealth, and computational cost is needed.

2. Although the paper introduces inventive attack methodologies, the potential complexity of these methods could pose practical challenges for their implementation. Specifically, it would be beneficial to provide an in-depth analysis of the computational complexity associated with the oracle and tree-based attacks. The analysis should not only provide asymptotic bounds but also discuss the practical implications of these bounds, such as the memory requirements and the actual running time on typical hardware. Furthermore, the paper should discuss the sensitivity of the proposed methods to hyperparameter settings, such as the tree depth and branching factor in the LCBT algorithm, and how these parameters affect the attack performance and computational cost.

### Questions
1. Where can we get the target policy? How to specify a target policy in a complex task?

2. Could the authors provide more experiments on complex tasks?

### Summary
The paper presents a new threat model for targeted action space attacks on RL algorithms in continuous domains. The authors first developed the threat model in a white box setting, then proposed an algorithm for the black-box setting which performs similar to the white box setting. This method leverages the idea of recursively partitioning the continuous state and action spaces into a binary tree, where each node represents a continuous subset of actions and selecting the nodes from the tree during the attack. The authors also provided theoretical results which shows that the attack costs are bounded under specific conditions in the white box setting. Finally, numerical experiments were provided to three popular RL algorithms in two simple environments.

### Strengths
1. The idea of partitioning a continuous space into a binary tree is an interesting idea and original in the space of RL to the best of my knowledge.
2. The algorithm for LCBT is theoretically motivated with a bound on the cost of the attack
3. The numerical experiments seems promising and results supports the theory

### Weaknesses
1. Insufficient experimental results in terms of comparison with other action space manipulation threat models.
2. Insufficient experimental results in terms of comparison in more complex, realistic environments. 
3. Multiple generic statements which might not necessarily be true.

### Questions
I would like to preface my comments by stating that I think the algorithm proposed by this paper is an interesting idea, however, my concerns are as follows:

1. As stated above, one of my main concerns is the scalability of the algorithm as the numerical experiments were only shown for two extremely simple environments. Could the authors discuss the computational runtime for such the algorithm? It seemed to me that constructing the binary tree for environments which higher dimensional state spaces/action spaces would be prohibitively expensive. Furthermore, computation aside, the results would be more convincing and much stronger if the authors could show similar results on a much more conventional benchmark, like the MuJoCo environments.

2. The results shown are also lacking comparison with existing threat models, even in terms of white-box attacks, such as the work by Sun et al. 2020. 

3. There's also sentences in the introduction which I believe the authors should further clarify as they seem like blanket statements to me which might not necessarily be true. For example, "With the increasing complexity of scenarios, in many cases, reinforcement learning algorithms for discrete state-action environments are no longer applicable". This seems like a really harsh statement as there is a lot of real world problems where discrete actions are still applicable. Another statement is  "It is evident that compared to manipulating observations, rewards, or the environment, action-manipulation is not as direct and efficient". Could the authors elaborate why action space manipulation is more challenging than reward/state manipulation as this seem to be the core motivation for action space attacks over other forms of attack?
