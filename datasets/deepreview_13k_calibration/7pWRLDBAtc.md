## Abstract
Personalized federated learning (PFL) has emerged as a promising technique for addressing the challenge of data heterogeneity. While recent studies have made notable progress in mitigating heterogeneity associated with label distributions, the issue of effectively handling feature heterogeneity remains an open question. In this paper, we propose a personalization approach by Local-global updates Mixing (LG-Mix) via Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK)-based convergence. The core idea is to leverage the convergence rate induced by NTK to quantify the importance of local and global updates, and subsequently mix these updates based on their importance. Specifically, we find the trace of the NTK matrix can manifest the convergence rate, and propose an efficient and effective approximation to calculate the trace of a feature matrix instead of the NTK matrix. Such approximation significantly reduces the cost of computing NTK, and the feature matrix explicitly considers the heterogeneous features among samples. We have theoretically analyzed the convergence of our method in the over-parameterize regime, and experimentally evaluated our method on five datasets. These datasets present heterogeneous data features in natural and medical images. With comprehensive comparison to existing state-of-the-art approaches, our LG-Mix has consistently outperformed them across all datasets (largest accuracy improvement of 5.01\%), demonstrating the outstanding efficacy of our method for model personalization. Code is available at \url{https://github.com/med-air/HeteroPFL}.

### Summary
This paper proposes a novel approach to address the challenge of data heterogeneity in personalized federated learning. The proposed method leverages the convergence rate induced by Neural Tangent Kernel to quantify the importance of local and global updates, and subsequently mix these updates based on their importance. The authors have theoretically analyzed and experimentally evaluated their method on five datasets with heterogeneous data features in natural and medical images. The results show that the proposed method outperforms existing methods in terms of convergence rate and accuracy. Overall, this paper contributes to the development of more effective and efficient personalized federated learning methods.

### Strengths
The proposed Local-Global updates Mixing approach is original and innovative, leveraging the convergence rate induced by Neural Tangent Kernel to address the challenge of data heterogeneity in personalized federated learning. This approach is a creative combination of existing ideas and provides a new perspective on how to handle feature heterogeneity.

The clarity of the paper is excellent, with a clear and concise writing style, well-organized sections, and informative figures and tables.

### Weaknesses
the authors could discuss the scalability and robustness of their method to larger and more complex datasets, and explore potential applications in other domains beyond natural and medical images. The paper could benefit from a more detailed discussion of the limitations and potential extensions of the proposed method. Specifically, the current discussion lacks details on how the method would perform with significantly more clients or with highly imbalanced data distributions across clients, which are common challenges in real-world federated learning scenarios. Furthermore, the method's reliance on the Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) approximation, while theoretically grounded, may not hold in practice with very deep or complex neural network architectures, and this limitation should be explicitly addressed. The paper also lacks a discussion on the sensitivity of the method to the choice of hyperparameters, and how these parameters might need to be tuned for different datasets or network architectures.

### Questions
1. how is eq. 4 derived? please give more explanantion on it. y is label, w(t) is the local model weights, what's the mearning of y-w(t)?
2. What's the cost (e.g., GPU memory cost, computational time) of the proposed method, compared to the baseline methods?
3. The proposed method is intuitive and interesting. What are the possible limitations of the proposed method, and how can they be addressed in future work?

### Summary
This paper proposes a mixing local initialization in pFL studies via the ratio of traces of the local feature matrix and global feature matrix. The proposed method experimentally and efficiently improves the final performance. Ablation studies are also introduced to learn the efficiency of the mixing rate.

### Strengths
1. Writing is clear and easy to follow.
2. The motivation of local initialization is sound and efficient in the pFL community. I appreciate the author's comparative analysis of ablation studies to verify the details of the proposed algorithm in the training process.
3. A brief convergence analysis is provided.

### Weaknesses
1. In the Algorithm Line.6, how to calculate the $h(x_i)$? This feature seems to adopt the global feature extractor to generate the approximation of global convergence. While in the local client, this seems to be untenable without the access to the global model. Does it require storing a global model locally? If so, I think a storage comparison among baselines is required to comprehensively compare the efficiency.
2. The authors should provide the training wall-clock time required to compare the practical efficiency. 
3. The motivation is to select the faster convergence to match the local or global model. So I think it is necessary to introduce the loss curve or gradient norm to illustrate its improvements. This paper does not analyze the improvements in the test error and generalization performance. Under the specific convergence analysis, how does the proposed method match the convergence analysis? And does the training loss or gradient norm decrease faster?

### Questions
Thanks for the great submission but I still find there are some important issues to be resolved in the current version. My concerns are lined in the weaknesses.

### Summary
The paper addressed the issue of improving convergence of personalized federated learning using a mix of local and global model updates. The optimal mix is found through a measure related to the neural tangent kernel / trace of the Gram matrix. An approximation of the trace is introduced based on taking only the last layer into account. The method is demonstrated on several image problems.

### Strengths
The idea of mixing local and global model updates in a manner that optimizes the convergence in PFL is simple and intuitive. Making use of the Gram trace in this context makes good sense.

The proposed method is compared with many other relevant methods.

### Weaknesses
The problem setup could be more clearly defined from the beginning. The paper is motivated by a discussion of the challenges of data heterogeneity; however, it would be more clear if the authors in the beginning of the paper would include a clear definition of the type of heterogeneity that is addressed, and which personalized settings the developed methods apply to. Statements such as "To solve the data heterogeneity problem..." seem to indicate that heterogenous data is a kind of external obstacle, rather than an inherent property of the problem PFL is aiming to solve.

In the related works section, there is the following statement: "However, the existing approaches have primarily focused on addressing heterogeneity related to class distributions, system resources, and model architecture. The issue of feature distributional shifts in PFL remains under-explored." While it may be true that the issue is underexplored, it would be great with a clear delineage of which existing works address this issue, and which of the related methods could reasonably expected to work under covariate shift.

"In FL, each client will update the local model using the global update after each communication
round." While this is not wrong per se, there are many ways local and global updates are carried out in different algorithms, depending on the problem setup and assumptions behind the particular algorithm.

It is not clear if the results are a fair comparison, i.e. whether or not each algorithm is independently optimized sufficiently well.

The section on the convergence analysis seems a bit disintegrated with the rest of the paper.

Simple experiments that highlight the applicability of the method are not included. I would have appreciated a clear demonstration, e.g. in comparison with fixed local-global ratios.

An empirical demonstration of proposition 1 would have been a strong argument for the specific choices made for the mixing ratio.

Minor issues
paramters -> parameters
footnote -> subscript
tr should be roman in eq. 7

### Questions
Is this critique fair: "However, despite advancements, these methods aim to learn a common
global model, but it is challenging to ensure the consensus global model is best-for-all."? It is my understanding that the objective of these methods is to learn a global model, so they are designed for another purpose than PFL.

Are the methods described only applicable in the context of stochastic gradient descent? It would be beneficial to have a clear definition of the problem setup in which the proposed methods apply.

In sec. 3.1 both covariate shift and concept drift are mentioned. Is this method applicable to both scenarios? This should preferably be clear from the introduction.

Are there any previous papers that consider the update strategy in eq. 3, or is this an idea that has not yet been explored?

It is not always clear to me if w_c and u denote models or model weights?

Where does eq. 4 come from? There is no details regarding its derivation or any clear reference.

Is proposition 1 a novel result, and if so in which sense?

It is uncler to me if the mixing ratio in eq. 5 is optimal in some sense? Intuitively, the global and local model might both have different error and different convergence properties, so should the model error not also be taken into account?

Does it make a big difference that you only consider the last layer in the approximation of the Gram matrix? Can the arguments be supported empirically or theoretically?

What exactly is meant by this statement: "since the data is distributed and not directly accessible, we propose employing features from local data in conjunction with the global model u"? Do you employ the representation (first layers) of the local model?

Is it correctly understood that you use a fixed learning rate for all experiments, which is not optimized?

What are the practical implications of the convergence analysis in sec. 4? How is the theorem and proof different form exising convergence results?

I do not understand the arguments in the paragraph titled "Feature value distribution by our personalized model". What results is the statement "If a model learns confident representations, then the related neurons should be highly activated..." based on?

If instead we used a fixed (optimized) ratio of local and global updates, does your method have a clear advantage?
