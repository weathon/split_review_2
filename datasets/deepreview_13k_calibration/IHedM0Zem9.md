## Abstract
Event-based cameras are attracting significant interest as they provide event streams which contain rich edge information with high dynamic range and high temporal resolution. Many state-of-the-art event-based algorithms rely on splitting the events into several fixed groups, which are then aggregated into 2D frames by different event representations. However, the fixed slicing method can result in the omission of crucial temporal information, particularly when dealing with diverse motion scenarios (e.g., high-speed and low-speed). In this work, to build a BridgE from converting Event streams to Frames, we propose BEEF, a novel-designed event processing framework capable of splitting events stream to frames in an adaptive manner. In particular, BEEF integrates a low-energy spiking neural network (SNN) as an event trigger to determine the slicing time based on the spike generation. To guide the SNN in firing spikes at optimal time steps, we introduce the Spiking Position-aware Loss (SPA-Loss) function to modulate the neuron's spiking state. In addition, we develop a novel Feedback-Update training strategy that supervises the SNN to make precise event slicing decisions based on the feedback from the downstream artificial neural network (ANN). The newly sliced dataset by SNN is then used to fine-tune the ANN to improve the overall performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our BEEF achieves state-of-the-art performance in event-based object tracking and recognition.
Notably, BEEF provides a brand-new SNN-ANN cooperation paradigm, where the SNN acts as an efficient, low-energy data processor to assist the ANN in improving downstream performance, injecting new perspectives and potential avenues of exploration.

3: You are fairly confident in your assessment. It is possible that you did not understand some parts of the submission or that you are unfamiliar with some pieces of related work. Math/other details were not carefully checked.

### Summary
The paper studies to learn event splits by using SNN. The triggered spikes from SNN are treated as signals for splitting event streams and constructing event frames. The proposed architecture is evaluated with object recognition and single object tracking datasets.

### Strengths
* The motivation of the paper is well demonstrated. Fixed event stream fixed slicing methods potentially fail to generalize in different motion scenarios.
* How the paper finds optimal spike time, $n_{s}$, is interesting.
* The paper shows relative improvements over different baseline methods when using their proposed BEEF framework.

### Weaknesses
 * The paper claims a fixed event split method fails to generalize. However,  event cell $C[N]$ is a discrete 2D representation generated from a fixed event split, and is used as the input for SNN. 
* BEEF can be used in ANN-based 3D CNN/Transformer seamlessly. Event cameras and SNN are all bio-inspired but do not necessarily imply that SNN is a good fit to event data.
* Why not experiment with the latest event recognition/single object tracking framework? The latest methods in Tab. 1 and Tab. 3 were published in 2021?

### Summary
This paper is about the slicing step in the conversion from events to binned representations that can yield frames for classical image processing.
The goal of this paper is to make the event-slicing step adaptive instead of fixed over time as it is now in the majority of the approaches that use slicing/binning/bucketing where events are assigned to slices with slices being constant time length or containing equal numbers of events. 

The way it works is that events are fed to a spiking neural network with Leaky Integrate and Fire neurons. The SNN fires more sparsely than the original events.
A new slice is created containing all events between the timings of two output spikes. 

To control the desired time offset of the slice a membrane potential loss is introduced. Authors give a formal proof for the sufficient conditions. 
Moreover, a linear assuming loss resolves the dependence between neighboring membrane potentials.

Experiments are conducted on object tracking and gesture/object recognition with impressive results.

### Strengths
1. The dynamic slicing of events using the output spikes of an SNN.

2. The connection between slicing and downstream task expressed in the additional two loss terms determining the hyperparameters of the SNN.

3. The theoretical treatment of the sufficient condition of firing at a desired time (given in the appendix).

### Weaknesses
 1. Frame-like inputs to transformers or CNNs where frames have been derived from events may be sensitive to slicing. We need a toy experiment to study this hypothesis with a smaller network and different slicing techniques.

2. The exposition is really hard to follow. As stated directly after eq. 4, the slicing is done by grouping together events whose timestamps are between two output spikes of the SNN. Here, an experiment is needed on the statistics of this slicing and why such an approach makes sense.

3. 4.3.1 has to be elaborated. While the math derivations are sound, it is not clear to the reader why the starting point of the derivations is the desire for $S_{out}$ to spike at $n^{*}$. I tried to understand it also through the observations in 4.3.2 but could not.

4. The beginner's arena was meant to explain the above but is incomprehensible. What does it mean ``to slice at a specified time step $T^{*}'' ?

5. It is not clear what purpose the energy computations of the SNN serve when the task will be solved with ultra consuming GPUs. 

6. The experimental comparison should be with approaches that are asynchronous end to end like HOTS or HATS or Cannici'19, Perot'20 etc. or approaches like the Event Transformer.

7. Table 3: It is not discussed why the transformer tracker performs almost the same or better without BEEF. Why does BEEF not add anything significant when an attention mechanism is used?

8. The feedback strategy is learnt during training. I understand that in this sense it is adaptive to the task rather than during inference to the event stream when the hyperparameters will be fixed.

9. It is unclear whether events are treated differently according to their polarity.

10. There is some problem with the definition of ${\cal D}$ because $n_q$ is not defined anywhere but mentioned ``where $n_q$ denotes the time of the last spike''.

11. It would be worth listing the latency from event to GPU output for the particular architectures on tracking and recognition. This is much more critical here than the power consumption of the CNN.

### Summary
This paper proposes an efficient way for event representation. Specifically, they introduce SNN for adaptive event slicing, which can choose appropriate slicing times considering the events’ temporal feature and downstream task. The authors present several losses to further improve the adaptiveness, and a strategy to let SNN better assist the of ANN in an iterative and cooperative manner.

### Strengths
+ The overall writing of this work is clear and easy to follow.
+ The three observations and solutions seem to work well and improve the adaptation for slicing time.
+ Using SNN in event representation is rational considering the similar feature for SNN and event.

### Weaknesses
 - This paper fails to fully review the topic of this work: event representation. As suggested in [1][2], there are several existing event representation strategies including stacking based on time/event counts, voxel grid, histogram of time surfaces, event spike tensor, and a recent work introduces neural representation [3]. However, this paper only mentions two of them. In addition, the motivation to consider temporal information is similar with event counts integration, which is mentioned by the authors.
- The necessity of a very lightweight SNN is not clear. Since SNN works with ANN cooperatively, SNN has only very limited contribution to the overall computational cost. As implied in Table 2, considering the ANN is the major cost for the process, the contribution and necessity for low energy and fast speed of SNN is reduced.
- The compared methods in the experiment are not sufficient. More event representation/stacking methods should be considered to compare with the proposed methods, including the methods mentioned in [1-3].
- I wonder whether such iterative optimization of SNN and ANN work better than joint optimization, like we regard the whole process as an end-to-end task and optimize the SNN loss and downstream task loss together.
- More details about the experimental settings are required. The proposed methods use adaptive slicing time, how to create GT accordingly? And how to compare with fixed-sliced methods that have different timestamps for event frames?

### Summary
The authors propose BEEF, a novel-design event processing framework that can slice the event streams in an adaptive manner. To achieve this, BEEF employs an SNN as the event trigger to dynamically determine the time at which the event stream needs to be split, rather
than requiring hyper-parameter adjustment as in traditional methods.

### Strengths
S1: papers dealing with spiking related algorithms should be of interest to the subset of the machine learning community investigating on-the-edge computing algorithms.

S2: the paper is relatively well written

### Weaknesses
W1: I am aware that with event and spiking cameras it is quite popular to convert the event/spike streams into a sort of frame based representation. However I have a fundamental objection with this type of an approach (which is shared by quite a few of my colleagues around the world, in private conversations at least) as to why should these fundamentally asynchronous
event streams representations should be converted to a rather synchronous representation, simply to be able to map them into algorithms that were originally developed for synchronous frame like data. I think a more thorough discussion on this is needed in the paper to better motivate the work

W2: clarify better what are the alternative methods to which this is being compared? What exactly is meant by "fixed slice" approaches to which this is being compared? Many approaches for producing frame like representations (such as getting the max or union of all events in a time window) result in the introduction of significant amounts of noise. In contrast morphological operands like erosion and dilation can introduce much better quality frames. To what extent is the good performance of the algorithm attributable simply to noisy frame generation in competing approaches?

W3: unless i missed it, will source code be provided?

### Summary
This paper proposes a novel pre-processing framework (i.e., BEEF) to split continuous event streams into event slices in an adaptive manner. BEEF mainly adopt an energy-efficient SNN to trigger the slicing time. Technically, a new dataset is first split into event slices by SNN, which is robust to high-speed or low-speed scenarios. Then, event slices are used to finetune the ANN to verify the performance in downstream event-based vision tasks. The experiments show that the proposed BEEF achieves SOTA performance in event-based object tracking and event-based object recognition.

### Strengths
i) The topic of adaptively splitting event streams using SNN is very interesting and attractive.

ii) The authors sufficient experiments in the main paper and the supplemental material to help reader better understand the main contributions of this work.

iii) The writing is straightforward, clear, and easy to understand.

### Weaknesses
i) While fixed windows or a fixed event count may not offer optimal performance for event partitioning pre-processing, they do provide a quick processing option for collaboration with subsequent vision tasks. The authors also adapt the SNN for event stream division, but it's crucial to determine if this process is time-consuming across different platforms (CPU, GPU) and if it's suitable for downstream tasks, particularly those requiring low-latency responses for agile robots. Although the authors give the analysis of processing speed, it should be given the computational analysis in CPU.

ii) The authors have conducted a comparison experiment with a fixed number of times, as shown in Table 3. Nevertheless, it is advisable for the authors to include experiments with a fixed time window. Furthermore, the authors should investigate how various parameters for fixed events or fixed time windows compare to BEEF. Additionally, it would be beneficial for the authors to provide more visual comparison results of event representations.

iii) There are articles exploring adaptive event stream splitting strategies. The author should consider citing some relevant references [1, 2] that utilize hyperparameters for implementation.
