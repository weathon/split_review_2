## Abstract
Trees are convenient models for obtaining explainable predictions on relatively
small datasets. While many proposals exist for end-to-end construction of such
trees in supervised learning, learning a tree end-to-end for clustering without la-
bels remains an open challenge. As most works focus on interpreting with trees
the result of another clustering algorithm, we present here two novel end-to-end
trained unsupervised trees for clustering, respectively KAURI for datasets with a
large number of features using binary decision trees, and DOUGLAS for datasets
with a large number of samples using k-ary differentiable trees. Both methods are
composed of a learnable tree structure in which parameters are optimised accord-
ing to a generalised mutual information (GEMINI) and present results on par with
other existing methods while maintaining interpretability. We compare these two
models on multiple datasets with the most recent unsupervised trees and provide
guidelines for choosing the most suitable model.

### Summary
The submission presents two algorithms for learning clustering trees. Both algorithms are guided by generalized mutual information and find axis-parallel splits. Results on UCI datasets show that the proposed approaches yield performance comparable to that obtained by using an existing two-stage process for finding clustering trees (k-means for labeling the data followed by CART).

### Strengths
Learning clustering trees is an interesting problem, and the proposed approach has an interesting connection to kernel k-means.

### Weaknesses
The performance of the proposed algorithms is comparable to the performance of the simple two-stage approach based on k-means and standard decision trees.

### Summary
The paper proposes two algorithms to learn decision trees for clustering problems. Instead of using reference clustering algorithm such as k-means as some form of supervision for tree learning, the paper instead tries to learn the clustering tree directly without any reference supervision. By adapting the recent work on a generalised mutual information (GEMINI) objective for clustering, the paper first proposes the algorithm KAURI to learn axis-aligned clustering trees in a greedy top-down induction way. The second algorithm (DOUGLAS) adapts differentiable Deep neural decision trees to optimize a variation of GEMINI (Wasserstein-GEMINI). Experiments on smaller-scale datasets are conducted and compared with 4 k-means-based tree clustering methods.

### Strengths
1) The paper is well-written on the active area of research on interpretable clustering.
2) The paper uses novel clustering objective for learning clustering trees.

### Weaknesses
1) The paper does not provide sufficient motivation for the use of a generalised mutual information (GEMINI) objective for clustering. While the original paper (Ohl et al., 2022) shows good results on unsupervised neural network training, it is still not clear what makes this objective well-suited for clustering problems, particularly with trees. Specifically, the paper lacks a clear explanation of how GEMINI's properties align with the goals of clustering, such as separating distinct data groups or capturing underlying data structure. The connection to k-means is mentioned, but a deeper analysis of how GEMINI implicitly or explicitly encourages cluster formation is missing.
2) The paper has quite limited novelty. It adapts a recent clustering objective into the traditional CART-type greedy recursive partitioning algorithm to learn the axis-aligned tree (KAURI algorithm). And similarly with DOUGLAS algorithm, which just uses the existing differentiable deep neural decision trees. The adaptation of GEMINI to a tree structure, while not trivial, does not present a significant conceptual leap. The core algorithms remain largely incremental modifications of existing methods, lacking substantial innovation in either the objective function or the tree learning process.
3) The paper attempts to motivate for the end-to-end learning of clustering trees rather than using existing clustering algorithm such as k-means as reference. However, both theoretically and experimentally the advantage of end-to-end learning has not been clearly demonstrated. The paper does not provide a theoretical analysis of why end-to-end learning should be superior, and the experimental results do not show a clear advantage over using k-means as a reference. The lack of a clear performance benefit undermines the motivation for the proposed approach.
4) The datasets used in experiments seem to be quite small. The largest contains 20k points in 10 dimensions. Having a dataset of at least MNIST-level size can help to show its scalability. The limited scale of the datasets makes it difficult to assess the practical applicability of the proposed algorithms, particularly in real-world scenarios with larger and more complex datasets. The results may not generalize well to more challenging settings.
5) Adjusted rand index measure used to compare the clustering performance is questionable. As far as I understand, adjusted rand index uses ground-truth class labels but clustering is an unsupervised problem. Reporting both the k-means objective and GEMINI objective might help as they are the objective function being optimized. Using ARI to evaluate clustering performance is inappropriate because it relies on ground truth labels, which are not available in unsupervised clustering. The paper should instead focus on reporting the objective function values that are actually being optimized, such as the k-means objective or the GEMINI objective.

### Questions
1) Why is this particular neural decision tree used for the DOUGLAS algorithm? How interpretable are these trees? Why not just regular soft decision tree?

### Summary
The authors propose two methods for fitting tree models to unlabeled data to cluster the data. The first model uses binary splits while the second uses k-ary splits with a differentiable splitting function. The methods are compared against baseline methods on 10 data sets. Cluster quality is measure by adjusted rand index (ARI) and interpretability is measured using weighted average depth (WAD).

### Strengths
The authors methods connect KMeans directly with tree-based models. This simplifies the clustering process if one would like to use a tree for this purpose. The connection with mutual information is natural.

### Weaknesses
The authors methods connect KMeans directly with tree-based models. This simplifies the clustering process if one would like to use a tree for this purpose. The connection with mutual information is natural.

The authors results show some improvement over KMeans combined with a supervised tree. But the improvement is small and I'm not sure the improved interpretability is sufficient to strengthen the contribution enough. Interpretability is always a very thorny issue. It is ultimately and under-specified property and its value is in the eye of the beholder.

I agree that explain another clustering output using a decision tree leaves something to be desired in terms of elegance. But clusters are often used as a form of explanation, which raises the question why does one need to explain a clustering output to begin with?

Why are divisive or agglomerative methods not compared against? They can produce trees, albeit perhaps not with annotated internal nodes. Yet, WAD doesn't require such annotations, so they can be evaluated as the authors have done.

Section 2 strays into topics that are somewhat out-of-place in the document. Discussing the advantages and nuances of the method overly much before the method has been introduced on a technical level is premature. Can portions of section 2 be moved into the discussion?

### Summary
This paper introduces a framework for unsupervised tree-based end-to-end learning. This framework combines tree structures with generalized mutual information for clustering, resulting in two approaches: KAURI and DOUGLAS. KAURI focuses on maximizing a kernel-KMeans-like objective to iteratively create unsupervised splits by assigning tree leaves to either existing or new clusters. On the other hand, DOUGLAS harnesses the power of differential trees and the Wasserstein distance. KAURI is more suitable for small-scale datasets, while DOUGLAS excels with larger datasets that have fewer features.

### Strengths
The paper is readable and well-written. I found it practical to propose two algorithms that complement each other's weaknesses and can be mentioned for their respective suitable use cases. Furthermore, the paper takes into account not only the algorithms but also aspects such as fast implementation. It also includes considerations regarding computational cost estimation.

### Weaknesses
Several successful experimental cases are presented, yet the paper lacks theoretical backing. Although the proposed method is straightforward, it doesn't appear to offer a high degree of novelty. Consequently, the research's significance remains unclear.

The simplicity of the proposed method makes it particularly important to validate its effectiveness through numerical experiments. However, the descriptions of these experiments lack adequate detail. For instance:

- The DOUGLAS experiment is said to be limited by memory constraints, but there is no information about the specific memory requirements or the machine resources used.
- Performance metrics are mentioned, but the paper does not provide data on computational time and memory usage.
- The Appendix notes that the batch size for the DOUGLAS experiments varies depending on the dataset, but it does not explain the methodology behind this decision. A comparison of the amount of parameter tuning against a benchmark is also needed for further validation.
- In the Appendix, it's stated that the handling of categorical variables varies depending on the dataset. However, information is only provided for the US congressional votes dataset, affecting the experiment's reproducibility.

(Minor comment: The capitalization of "KAURI/Kauri" and "DOUGLAS/Douglas" is inconsistent, and there is a lack of consistency in notation.)

### Questions
1: The objective of KAURI is introduced as being equivalent to optimizing the K-means objective. In that case, what should we consider as the motivation behind this study? I would like to understand the rationale for using this research approach instead of traditional Kernel KMeans. While one example is provided in Appendix E, I also wondered if there might be cases where KAURI doesn't perform well conversely. I believe the clear difference lies in the fact that it is an end-to-end approach. What might be the motivation behind this choice?

2: How do the experimental results vary when the temperature parameter $\tau$ in Equation 9 is modified? Although the temperature is set to 0.1 throughout this paper, it is known that this parameter is crucial in the context of differentiable trees. (See Reference [1])

3: Please provide information on the machine resources used, computation time, memory usage, and the amount of parameter tuning (See Weakness part).
