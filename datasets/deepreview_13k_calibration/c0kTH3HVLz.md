## Abstract
Spike camera with high temporal resolution can fire continuous binary spike streams to record per-pixel light intensity. By using reconstruction methods, the scene details in high-speed scenes can be restored from spike streams. However, existing methods struggle to perform well in low-light environments due to insufficient information in spike streams. To this end, we propose a recurrent-based reconstruction framework to better handle such extreme condition. In more detail, a light-robust representation (LR-Rep) is designed to aggregate temporal information in spike streams. Moreover, a fusion module is used to extract temporal features. Besides, we synthesize a reconstruction benchmark for high-speed low-light scenes where light sources are carefully designed to be consistent with reality. The experiment shows the superiority of our method. Importantly, our method also generalizes well to real spike streams. All codes and constructed datasets will be released after publication.

### Summary
This paper proposed a novel frame reconstruction method for spike camera. It particularly emphasized its advantage for light robustness and has shown results compared to previous methods within the same category. There are two areas of contributions claimed. The first is that the paper proposed a benchmark for high speed low light scenes. The dataset LLR is built upon existing method SPCS [Hu et al. 2022] and dimmed the scene brightness to obtain a low light version. The second contribution is an algorithm, including a light-robust representation, that leverages neighbor binned spike features to perform frame reconstruction.

### Strengths
This paper covers both dataset simulation and architectural proposals for low light. The proposed architecture is a push-forward based on previous transforms. I think the key idea is to extend existing LISI (local inter-spike interval) transform to incorporate the release time of forward and backward spikes. The reasoning is that as light intensity decreases, the spike interval increases, and it is well likely that information is helpful from longer time steps and bidirectional.

### Weaknesses
There are key issues associated with the proposal.
- First, the paper has not established benchmarks for the light robustness. It is very unclear how low is the "low light" used in this paper. And it's also not touched how robust the algorithm functions comparing normal and low light. A better version is a quantification for performance vs light intensity.

- Second, as light decreases, the solution of this paper is to extract information from longer time range. In such a case, motion may play a significant role affecting the reconstruction results. Yet it was not demonstrated.

It looks like the LLR dataset has only two lighting conditions, i.e. normal and low? Is it enough for benchmarking? Are 5 motions enough? The paper mentioned "... the power of light source is consistent with the real world". How to achieve consistency? The dataset part lacked technical details and justification.

The overall idea is interesting but lacks significance. The bidirectional attentive approach has been well seen in video frame interpolation and event-based version.
The global inter-spike interval (GISI) is a small extension of previous LISI. It is also very confusing what LISI is referring to. The two references [Chen 2022] proposed TFI and [Zhao 2022b] proposed DSFT (differential of spike firing). Are the authors referring to TFI and DSFT as the same thing? And according to Table 2 the significance of GISI is so marginal and is hardly considered a contribution.

The figures are well-made but they hardly explained technical details. Figure 5 generated a lot of confusion as what's "LISI", "update" and "maintain". Mathematical formulation is needed. Figure 7 did not provide useful information and is quite redundant to present after Eq 5-9.

Please work on the presentation as there are a lot of grammar errors.

### Questions
From Figure 11, it seems that the method converges well at 5 frames and even has worse results comparing 21 to 13 for PSNR. Is this contradicting to the choices for frame numbers?

I couldn't find where exactly is noise being handled. I only see an I_{dark} on top of I as in current but is that all?

### Summary
This paper develops and trains a nueral network architecture that can recsontruct high-speed grayscale video frames from the sparse asynchronous data produced by a neuromorphic spiking camera (a camera where each pixel triggers asynchronously at a rate proportional to the intensity of the incident light). The proposed method consists of three steps: It first forms a learned light robust representation of the incoming datastream (pass the incoming data through some convolutional and attention layers). It then passes this representation (combined with features forward and back in time) through a res-net to extract higher-level features. It finally decodes this data into a grayscale video stream. 

The proposed algorithm was evaluated on real and experimental low-light spiking camear data. The proposed method slightly but noticeably outperforms the state-of-the-art (to my knowledge) WGSE algorithm.

An ablation study is performed to validate the architectural choices.

### Strengths
Lowlight imaging with neuromorphic cameras is an interesting and important problem.

The proposed method noticeably outperforms the state-of-the-art.

The paper includes extensive ablation studies and validation.

### Weaknesses
The forward model presented in the main paper doesn't model noise (except quantization). It's unclear how the proposed method would perform in a photon starved regime where a significant amount of Poisson noise would be present.

The paper doesn't link to any reconstructed videos. I can't evaluate if the proposed method introduced significant flickering artifacts.

Figure 5 isn't particularly informative.

Rather than stating, "The algorithm is in appendix", please state where in the appendix the algorithm can be found.

There are a number of typos (e.g., extra capitalizations) that a spell-checker should be able to catch and a few incomplete sentences (e.g., "A fusion module.").

### Questions
How would the algorithm behave in the presence of significant Poisson noise?

What were the intuitions behind selecting the chosen architecture? Why not leverage any of the wavelet structure from WGSE?

### Summary
The paper proposes a recurrent neural network based image reconstruction method for spike cameras.

### Strengths
The paper proposes a recurrent neural network based image reconstruction method for spike cameras. The authors generate a synthetic dataset for evaluation. The method is demonstrated to work on real as well as synthetic data.

### Weaknesses
1. In Fig. 2, the GT scenes seem to be RGB. How are they converted to gray scale?
2. Why is the PSNR value so high? For eg. the S2I image looks so noisy compared to GT in Fig.1, but according to table 1, the PSNR is > 40dB, which does not make sense.

### Summary
The authors present a novel reconstruction method for spike cameras specifically in low-light environments. They propose a recurrent-based reconstruction framework that utilizes a light-robust representation (LR-Rep) to aggregate temporal information in spike streams. Additionally, a fusion module is used to extract temporal features. Experimental results on both synthetic and real datasets demonstrate the superiority of their approach. The authors also provide a detailed analysis of low-light spike streams and discuss the efficiency and stability of their method.

### Strengths
- Sound logic for problem statement to pipeline development.
- Experiments are well designed, and the performance seems good.

### Weaknesses
Generally well written with sound pipeline, there are some points to make improvements. Please check questions.

- How does the delta T, which sets the length of temporal window affects the overall performance?
- Does the number of forward path of LR-Rep reduces if we increase delta T (i.e., the length of $S_t$ increases)?
- Current pipeline seems to occupy large memory. How much the training takes for the memory and time?

Related to display or Minor comments:

- Figure 1 Middle(b) is quite confusing. Does the temporal features for both blue and purple are same? If it is different, it should be illustrated differently. Also, the color difference blue and purple are too small, and also it does not looks as purple. Please make it more distinctive. Also, blue and purple arrows seems not an arrows, but justlines, so please improve it for better clarity. Same for the Fig. 3.
- Explanation of LISI transform is in the caption, not in the section. In section 4.3, GISI and LISI suddenly appears, which make readers bit confused. If these are also one of the new blocks proposed, they should be described well.
- In Figure 4, example image of GISI does not show anything. While the figure can be illustrative, suggest authors to use better image that can get the clue what the GISI output looks like.
- In Figure 5, notation is confusing. For example, if the (a) LISI ti=21 mean the LISI output at ti equals 21, "=21" need to be subscript along with ti. Currently it is $LISI_{ti} = 21$. Also suggest to use Latex outputs in the figures for math expressions.  
- In Figure 9, maybe the dynamic range are uniform for all reconstructions. The STP shows extremely different range, which makes other reconstruction methods totally not visible. (I expect STP images are totally saturated if we use dynamic range of other images.) How about using two different dynamic ranges, one only for STP and the other for other images. It would be okay with descriptions and specifying the min-max values. Anyway, currently the contrast is too low for reconstructed images.
