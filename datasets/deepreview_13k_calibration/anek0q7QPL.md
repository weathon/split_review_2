## Abstract
Covariance and Hessian matrices have been analyzed separately in the literature for classification problems. However, integrating these matrices has the potential to enhance their combined power in improving classification performance. We present a novel approach that combines the eigenanalysis of a covariance matrix evaluated on a training set with a Hessian matrix evaluated on a deep learning model to achieve optimal class separability in binary classification tasks. Our approach is substantiated by formal proofs that establish its capability to maximize between-class mean distance and minimize within-class variances. By projecting data into the combined space of the most relevant eigendirections from both matrices, we achieve optimal class separability as per the linear discriminant analysis (LDA) criteria. Empirical validation across neural and health datasets consistently supports our theoretical framework and demonstrates that our method outperforms traditional methods. Our method stands out by addressing both LDA criteria, unlike PCA and the Hessian method, which predominantly emphasize one criterion each. This comprehensive approach captures intricate patterns and relationships, enhancing classification performance. Furthermore, through the utilization of both LDA criteria, our method outperforms LDA itself by leveraging higher-dimensional feature spaces, in accordance with Cover's theorem, which favors linear separability in higher dimensions. Our approach sheds light on complex DNN decision-making, rendering them comprehensible within a 2D space.

### Summary
This paper presents a novel approach for improving binary classification. The authors propose integrating the eigenanalysis of the covariance and Hessian matrices to optimize class separability. The approach aims to maximize between-class mean distance and minimize within-class variances, following the principles of linear discriminant analysis (LDA). Empirical validation across various datasets supports the theoretical framework, demonstrating the method's superiority over traditional methods and LDA itself.

### Strengths
1. The paper presents compelling empirical evidence across various datasets, demonstrating the efficacy of the proposed method. The consistent positive results highlight the robustness of the approach in different contexts.

2. The experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms traditional methods, including principal component analysis and the Hessian method. This indicates that the combined use of covariance and Hessian matrices can better capture the intricacies of data for binary classification.

### Weaknesses
1. The paper does not clearly delineate its unique contributions. The authors should explicitly state what differentiates their work from existing literature, aiding readers in understanding the novelty and significance of the proposed method.

2. The theoretical results presented in Section 2.2 need a more formal presentation. The authors should use mathematical statements and rigorous proofs to enhance the credibility and clarity of these results.

3. The proposed approach, which integrates the eigenanalysis of the covariance and Hessian matrices based on binary cross-entropy loss, raises questions about its applicability to other loss functions. The authors should clarify this point or extend their methodology to include different loss functions.

4. The paper compares the proposed method primarily with traditional methods. Including comparisons with more contemporary techniques would offer a more comprehensive view of the method's performance in light of recent advancements in the field.

### Summary
This manuscript theoretically and numerically evaluates the projection matrices derived from both the Covariance and the Hessian, in terms  of how they impact classification performance.

### Strengths
Covariance and Hessian matrices of various kinds are indeed of critical importance in classification performance, and warrant further study.

### Weaknesses
1. I found the theory to be a weak.  For me to believe the relevance of this theory, it must operate within a multivariate context.  The question is about whether the top eigenvalues of either of these matrices contain the relevant signal. Theory operating on unidimensional data I think has relatively little to offer on this topic. 

2. As I read the paper, the authors talk about *the* Hessian matrix.  However, the paper is about a Hessian estimated using a specific deep net, which is of course *a* Hessian, but not *the* Hessian.  The discussion implied (to me) much more general claims than were warranted, imho, given the actual theoretical and empirical results. I would have expected a specific mention of Fisher's Information Matrix, which is closely related to the Hessian, as it includes it, and is a known bound of the variance for any random variable.

3. LDA is well known to find the projection that balances maximizing across-variance while minimizing within-variance.  It was never clear to me why we would want another method to do something like that?  What is missing in LDA that this method achieves? I can imagine a desire to embed in multiple dimensions, rather than just 1, but see my next point about that.

4.  Under the Gaussian model, the direction that captures the variance across classes is simply the difference of means vector (after 'whitening'), and the direction that maximizes the variance within is the class-centered covariance.  Reduced Rank LDA essentially combines those two: it projects the data onto the matrix which is the product of the difference of means with the low-rank estimate of the pooled covariance.  So, we already have a standard/classical approach to embedding into these two dimensions.  How is your approach better than this?

5. The defined Hessian is closely related to another standard thing called the Pointwise Mutual Information (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pointwise_mutual_information), which is very commonly used in language processing and embedding.  A discussion/comparison with this method would be desirable.

6. The numerical results indicate that embedding using the proposed approach is slightly better than the unsupervised approaches, or LDA, which is purely linear.  But your approach is nonlinear.  So, unless the data are strongly linear, a supervised nonlinear approach is likely to win.  And your proposed approach must lose in simulations where the data truly are linear. I'd think any reasonable kernel LDA approach would improve relative to PCA or LDA, assuming a large enough sample size.

### Questions
There are a few relevant papers that might be worthwhile reading for more background, including our paper, https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-23102-2, and one ours built on, https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047259X14001201?via%3Dihub.

### Summary
This paper proposes an efficient binary classification method based on integrating the covariance and Hessian matrices in improving classification performance. This method combines the eigenanalysis of a covariance matrix evaluated on a training set with a Hessian matrix evaluated on a deep learning model to achieve optimal class separability in binary classification tasks. Both theoretical proofs and experimental results are demonstrated to consolidate the theory.

### Strengths
proposes a method that combines covariance and Hessian matrices to perform classification analysis more effectively

### Weaknesses
 The part 3 of Methodologies session (Section 2.1) can be written more clearly.

### Questions
I wonder if the part 3 of Methodologies session (Section 2.1) can be written more clearly? In particular, why the result of the claimed process yields a 2D projection of the data?

### Summary
This paper proposes a data projection approach which combines the power of covariance and Hessian matrices in the binary classification task. Specifically, the method combines eigenanalysis of a covariance matrix evaluated on a training set with a Hessian matrix evaluated on a deep learning model to achieve optimal class separability. Benefiting from the linear discriminant analysis (LDA) criteria, the proposed method achieves better class separability in contrast to PCA and the Hessian method. Empirical results show its better performance in binary classification.

### Strengths
1)Combining the power of the covariance matrix and the Hessian matrix is interesting and novel, to my knowledge. And this work gives a new learning perspective for binary classification problems. 

2)The writing style is good and the motivation is clear.

### Weaknesses
1)The description of the key technique is unclear. How to integrate the covariance matrix and the Hessian matrix can be confusing. The authors only offer some description in the Section 2.1 and it lacks more detailed theoretical explanation.

2)The comparison methods are insufficient. To clarify the superiority of the proposed method, the authors compare the method with four data projection techniques including PCA, Hessian, UMAP and LDA. However, some other dimensionality reduction and data projection techniques should be included. For example, kernel based methods including kernel PCA and kernel LDA and manifold based methods like locally linear embedding (LLE) and t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) are also representative methods in this problem. 

3)The classification results in Figure 2 can be confusing. The performance of the proposed method is not obviously superior than other competing methods at times. For example, the performance of the proposed method is very close to the performance of Hessian in the WBCD database. Moreover, the performance of the proposed method is very close to the performance of UMAP in the Pima Indians diabetes database.

### Questions
1)As mentioned above, the authors should offer more details of the key technique about how to integrate the covariance matrix and the Hessian matrix. For better  readability, an interpretative figure to illustrate the key technique is needed.

2)The authors should provide a specific algorithm of the proposed method. The procedure of the algorithm remains highly unclear. 

3)The authors should offer more experimental results to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method, which are not limited to more comparison methods and more convincing classification results. As mentioned above, some other dimensionality reduction and data projection techniques should be included. Besides, the performance on the classification problem is not outstanding, 

4) This work is limited in the problem of binary classification. And it would be better if the authors could devise a multi-class classifier considering the real-world applications.
