## Abstract
We study the complexity of deterministic verifiers for nonsmooth nonconvex optimization when interacting with an omnipotent prover and we obtain the first exponential lower bounds for the problem. 
In the nonsmooth setting, Goldstein stationary points constitute the solution concept recent works have focused on. Lin, Zheng and Jordan (NeurIPS '22) show that 
even uniform Goldstein stationary points of a nonsmooth nonconvex function can be found efficiently via randomized zeroth order algorithms, under a Lipschitz condition.
As a first step, 
we show that verification of Goldstein stationarity via determistic algorithms is possible
under access to exact queries and first order oracles. This is done via a natural but novel connection with Carathéodory's theorem.
We next show that even verifying uniform Goldstein points 
is intractable for deterministic zeroth order algorithms. Therefore, randomization is necessary (and sufficient) for efficiently finding uniform Goldstein stationary points via zeroth order algorithms.
Moreover, for general (nonuniform) Goldstein stationary points, we prove that any deterministic zeroth order verifier that is restricted to queries in a lattice needs a number of queries that is exponential in the dimension.

### Summary
The notion of $(\delta, \epsilon)$-stationarity has emerged as a popular, tractable one for the minimization of nonconvex loss functions prominently featuring in deep learning these days. While several recent works have studied this notion from various angles, this paper explores a fresh question: how can we *verify* Goldstein stationarity? The paper uses connections with Caratheodory's theorem to study this question.

### Strengths
Numerous recent papers have studied various questions around $(\delta, \epsilon)$-stationarity: how fast can we get there, can we get there without randomness, how different is this notion from other notions like, e.g., being $\delta$-far from an $\epsilon$-stationary point, etc. This question of verification is **very** nice, in my opinion and definitely deserves to be studied. In my view, this paper's key contribution --- and a big one at that --- is identifying this nice question.

### Weaknesses
Please see Q1a and Q1b below. To summarize, I fear that, while formulating a very beautiful question, the paper may not quite satisfactorily be answering the questions.

Specifically, the validity of Theorem 4 is questionable. The assumption that the algorithm receives a gradient at the query point, rather than a subgradient, appears to be flawed. Given that the function $f$ is not assumed to be differentiable everywhere, it is unclear why this assumption is justified. This casts doubt on the correctness of the algorithm presented on Page 6.

Furthermore, if we were to modify the algorithm to accept a subgradient $g_i$ at each query point $y_i$, it is not immediately obvious that an output of $b=0$ would still guarantee $\delta$-Goldstein stationarity. The core issue is that a $\delta$-Goldstein subdifferential at a point $x$ is defined as the convex hull of the union of subdifferentials within a $\delta$-neighborhood of $x$. Therefore, the absence of a specific subgradient $g$ from the convex hull of the *currently* sampled subdifferentials does not preclude its existence within the subdifferentials of other points in the $\delta$-neighborhood. A rigorous proof would be required to establish whether the algorithm, as modified, could still reliably verify $\delta$-Goldstein stationarity. The apparent need to verify a potentially large number of sets to ensure this raises concerns about the computational feasibility of the approach.

### Questions
Thank you for the interesting and nicely written paper. I have the following main question. 

**Question 1a.** Why, in Theorem 4, is it valid to assume that we get a gradient at the query point instead of a subgradient? After all, the function $f$ is assumed to **not** be differentiable everywhere. 

**Question 1b.** Following Question 1a, if suppose we were to replace line 2 of the algorithm displayed on Page 6 with $g_i$ being some subgradient of $f$ at $y_i$, then would the algorithm's output of $b=0$ still be correct in all conditions? I fear that this may not be so because a $\delta$-Goldstein subdifferential at $x$ is the convex hull of the union of the subdifferentials in a $\delta$-neighbourhood of $x$, so just because $g$ isn't in the convex hull of the *current* subdifferentials doesn't necessarily mean it doesn't exist in any of the other possible subdifferentials; but then again, it looks like one would need to verify a large number of sets to check this, which seems too costly? I would of course be happy to see a proof showing otherwise! (Also, this question obviously depends on the validity of my Question 1a, so I'd also be happy if this question isn't even valid.)

### Summary
This paper studies the complexity of deterministic verifiers for nonsmooth nonconvex optimization when interacting with an omnipotent prover. The authors introduce the concept of “weakly verifying Goldstein points”. A lower bound for weak verification of Goldstein stationary points implies a lower bound of finding Goldstein stationary points. In this framework of proving lower bounds, this paper shows that: for deterministic zeroth-order algorithms, both the problem of (1) finding uniform Goldstein stationary points (2) finding (nonuniform) Goldstein stationary points with queries in a lattice are intractable, since the corresponding verification problems are.

### Strengths
1. The paper is well-writte. All the concepts and the intuition behind most of the proofs of theorems are clarified clearly. 
2. The result of this paper shows that "randomization is necessary (and sufficient) for efficiently finding uniform Goldstein stationary points via zeroth-order algorithms", which is interesting since it forms a sharp contrast with smooth optimization. 
3. The lower bounds proved in this article are theoretically solid, and the proofs also look elegant.

### Weaknesses
The authors are expected to discuss future work as it has enough space. I believe this could help the reader understand the paper's contributions and the potential impact in future.

The authors claim that they "prove that any deterministic zeroth-order verifier that is restricted to queries in a lattice needs a number of queries that is exponential in the dimension". I wonder what happens in the case of smooth nonconvex optimization. Are there any upper or lower bounds for the queries in a lattice to find an approximate stationary point of a smooth nonconvex function with Lipschitz gradients? It would be helpful to clarify the precise differences in complexity between smooth and nonsmooth settings when restricted to lattice queries, perhaps with a more detailed discussion of existing results in smooth optimization.

The authors say "The main idea behind Theorem 7 is to reduce the construction of f to a geometric question in two dimensions, taking advantage of the symmetry of the lattice". I don't quite understand what this "geometric question" is and what is the "advantage of the symmetry of the lattice". The explanation of the geometric construction is too high-level. It would be beneficial to elaborate on how the specific geometric properties of the 2D projection and the lattice symmetry are leveraged to create the hard instance for the verification problem. A more detailed explanation of the construction, perhaps with a visual aid, would be helpful.

### Summary
This paper studies the theoretical complexity of various problems in non-smooth, non-convex optimization. The basic setup is black-box access to a non-smooth, non-convex function $f$ via either a zeroth-order oracle (i.e. the ability to evaluate $f(x)$) or a first-order oracle (i.e. the ability to compute a generalized gradient $\partial f(x)$). The main tractable solution concept in this setup is a Goldstein stationary point, which is a point $x$ such that there exists a convex combination $g$ of generalized gradients $\partial f(y)$ for $y$ in a $\delta$ neighborhood of $x$, with $\lVert g \rVert < \epsilon$. Notably, from the definition it is not apriori obvious how to even verify whether a given point $x$ is a Goldstein stationary point, unlike in the smooth case where one gradient evaluation suffices. 

Prior work (Jordan et al. 2022) gives a randomized algorithm with dimension-independent runtime for approximating a Goldstein stationary point with access to a first-order oracle, and further shows that any deterministic algorithm cannot achieve any convergence without access to both a first and second-order oracle. The same prior work also gives a linear-in-the-dimension lower bound for deterministic algorithms with access to both a first and second order oracle.
The main result of this paper shows that any deterministic algorithm with access to only a zeroth order oracle requires a number of oracle queries that is exponential in the dimension. On the way to this result, the authors study the complexity of verifying that a given point is a Goldstein stationary point, and give an efficient deterministic first-order verification algorithm for this task, under the assumption of arbitrary accuracy of the first-order oracle. The main lower bound of the paper actually applies to the problem of deterministic zeroth-order verification of  Goldstein stationary points, which then straightforwardly implies the same lower bound for any algorithm that finds such a point.

### Strengths
Verification of Goldstein stationarity does not seem to have been studied before and it is interesting that one can actually get lower bounds for this problem, which then directly imply lower bounds for the problem of finding stationary points. Furthermore, it is natural to study the verification problem because the definition of Goldstein stationarity for non-smooth functions does not have as obvious of a witness as in the smooth case.

### Weaknesses
Given the prior work of Jordan et al, it is not entirely clear what new high-level take-away the theoretical results in this paper provide. The main improvement on problems that were previously studied is the exponential-in-the-dimension lower bound for deterministic algorithms when given access to only a zeroth order oracle. While achieving an exponential lower bound is great, it only holds when one severely limits the class of allowable algorithms (only function evaluation queries, no randomness). In terms of previously studied problems, it would have been more interesting to determine whether the linear-in-dimension lower-bound is tight for deterministic algorithms with access to both first and zeroth order oracles.

The problem of verification of Goldstein points is new to this work and interesting, but the main positive result in this case is a straightforward observation from Caratheodory's theorem, and further utilizes first-order queries of arbitrary accuracy. At this point the most critical open question about verification of Goldstein points appears to be whether one can achieve deterministic verification with finite accuracy. This would demonstrate a nice separation between the problem of verification and finding Goldstein stationary points. However, the main result on query accuracy in the paper is for deterministic zeroth-order algorithms, which demonstrates a dependence on $\delta$ in the accuracy required which is not present for smooth functions. This seems to me like a very minor technical difference, whereas settling the question of whether deterministic verification with finite-accuracy first-order queries is possible seems like it would make a qualitative difference in our understanding of this solution concept.

### Questions
Is the use of arbitrary precision necessary for verification of Goldstein stationary points? It is clear that the verification algorithm provided in the paper fails, and it seems plausible that there is some lower bound showing that this is necessary. If it is actually possible with finite precision queries that would also be quite interesting.

### Summary
This paper explores the concept of the verification complexity of Goldstein stationary points. To this end, the authors formulate several problems related to finding (Definition 5), strongly verifying (Definition 6), and weakly verifying (Definition 7) Goldstein stationary points. One direct consequence of these definitions is that the hardness of weak verification implies the hardness of strong verification and finding stationary points (as shown in Lemma 2). The authors demonstrate that efficient deterministic strong verification is achievable by simply applying Caratheodory's theorem. They also argue that weakly verifying a uniform Goldstein stationary point requires an exponential number of queries. Additionally, they claim that if the queries are restricted to a lattice with a width of 10$\epsilon\delta$, then no deterministic algorithm can weakly verify an ($\epsilon, \delta$)-Goldstein stationary point.

### Strengths
The perspective of "verification" in this work is interesting, which is fundamentally different from the existing work on "testing" notions of solutions, e.g., the work of Murty and Kabadi (1987), Tian and So (2023), and a missing reference (Yun et al., 2019).  If I understand correctly, an efficiently strongly verifiable function belongs, in some sense, to a function class similar to the complexity class NP. Of course, there are fundamental differences, but the similarity is apparent. From this perspective, the claim made in Lemma 2 is quite natural, suggesting that a problem is not in P if it is not in NP.

### Weaknesses
## Motivation

My primary concern lies with the motivation behind studying the complexity of the "verification" of Goldstein stationary points. As noted by the authors, an efficient strong "verifier" (as defined in Definition 6) cannot be an efficient "tester" in the conventional sense, as demonstrated by Yun et al. (2019). One possible consideration is to establish lower bounds on finding stationary points by proving the hardness of weak verification, as claimed in this paper. However, this raises several technical concerns.

## Major Technical Points

One such concern is the formal definition of an "omnipotent prover," which I found rather confusing, especially in its usage in Definitions 6 and 7.

- In the proof of Theorem 4, a "computationally unbounded" prover may be insufficient to provide the required vectors {y_i} without additional information about the underlying function f. In contrast, an "omniscient" prover is needed to expose such information. This prover should be able to communicate with the function f to extract the information of $\partial_\delta f$ and return the correct Caratheodory's decomposition {g_i}_i. This is not just a terminology issue but indeed a lack of rigor in the setup of the theoretical framework. This vagueness in definition might become fatal in the following comments.

- The most questionable aspect, in my opinion, is the proof of Corollary 1. As previously discussed, the prover needs to communicate with the underlying function f to facilitate strong verification in Theorem 4. In the proof of Corollary 1, while I understand that $f_0$ and $f_1$ are consistent on the queried points {$x^{(i)}$}, I don't comprehend why an "omniscient" prover would provide exactly the same sequence {$x^{(i)}$} for both functions $f_0$ and $f_1$. As mentioned earlier, a legitimate prover should communicate with both $f_0$ and $f_1$ to provide the most useful information. This raises concerns about the correctness of Corollary 1, which is the main result addressing Q2.

- A similar issue regarding correctness persists in the proof of Corollary 2, as the author states, "the proof is analogous to that of Corollary 1." Corollary 2 is the main result addressing Q3.

## Minor Technical Points

- On page 6, concerning the algorithm, why does the function $f$ need to be differentiable at points {y_i}? Consider the following example: let $\epsilon = 1/2$, $\delta = 1$, and f(x) = max{-1, min{ x, 1 }}. Consider $x=0$. In this case, $y_1 = -1$ and $y_2 = 1$ is the only correct choice, but the function is nondifferentiable at both points.

- A remedy could be replacing the gradients in the Algorithm with Clarke subdifferentials. But this brings a computational issue. How can you ensure the efficient solvability of the convex program in the algorithm? In the general case, even with convexity, this problem could be computationally intractable.

- Another issue is that, in Fact 2, the result is stated for polytopes. But a subdifferential could be far from a polytope. Consider $\partial (x \mapsto ||x||)(0)$.

## Other Comments

- I do not understand why, in Definition 7, completeness and soundness are stated separately and the verifier needs to return a boolean $b \in$ {0,1}. As well-noted by the authors, the "if" condition in the completeness part is always true, so the "verifier" will always return $b=1$, and the "if" condition in the soundness part is also always true.

- In Corollary 2, the required width of the lattice is of the order $\epsilon\delta$, which is too large to have practical implications.

### Summary
This paper focuses on the topic of nonsmooth nonconvex optimization, with a specific focus on the complexity of deterministically verifying whether a given point is a (uniform) Goldstein stationary point given a certificate and can interact with a computationally unbounded prover. The authors developed a query efficient deterministic verifier given access to an infinitely-precise first-order oracle, and showed that there is an exponential lower bound on query complexity if the verifier only have access to a zeroth-order oracle. Moreover, the authors showed that the bit precision of the verifier needs to be sufficiently high if they only have access to a zeroth-order oracle.

### Strengths
The authors provided an intriguing approach on investigating the complexity of nonsmooth nonconvex optimization. This perspective, which has not been widely discussed in prior works, offers a novel and potentially valuable insight both theoretically and in practical situations.

### Weaknesses
1. Some technical details of the paper are very confusing to me.

(1). In Definition 6 and 7, the author mentioned that the prover has unbounded computational power. This property, however, is never used in their proofs. The proofs seem to work just fine even if the prover has polynomial time computational power. The authors should clarify why this assumption is necessary, or if it is not, they should remove it to avoid unnecessary confusion.

(2). The interaction scheme between the verifier and the prover is confusing. Since the verifier is deterministic, any multi-round interaction protocol can be transformed into a single round interaction protocol with the same amount of communication complexity. Specifically, the prover can simulate the deterministic actions of the verifier and send all the necessary information to the verifier at the beginning of the protocol. This makes the multi-round interaction scheme seem artificial and not well-motivated.

2. This paper only discussed the deterministic verification complexity of (uniform) Goldstein stationary point. However, from my vantage point, it appears that a randomized protocol may be a more general and intuitive choice, given that randomness is not a scarce resource for machine learning algorithms. Also, in a randomized protocol, the interaction scheme described in Definition 6 and 7 makes more sense, since in this case a multi-round interaction is indeed much powerful than a one-round interaction. The authors should provide further clarification and justification for their choice to focus on the deterministic model. The lack of discussion on the randomized setting makes the scope of the paper seem limited.

3. (minor comment) The proof technique of this work is intuitive but also arguably, relatively straightforward.

### Questions
Corresponding to my comments above, I have the following two questions:

1. Why did the authors introduced an interactive protocol in their deterministic setting?

2. What is the randomized verification complexity, or what is the motivation of considering a deterministic setting instead of the randomized setting?
