- Decision: Reject
- Avg Score: 2.50
- Scores: 3, 3, 1, 3

## Abstract
We introduce \textit{ivrit.ai}, a comprehensive Hebrew speech dataset, addressing the distinct lack of extensive, high-quality resources for advancing Automated Speech Recognition (ASR) technology in Hebrew. With over \totalHours speech hours and a over a thousand diverse speakers, \textit{ivrit.ai} offers a substantial compilation of Hebrew speech across various contexts. It is delivered in three forms to cater to varying research needs: raw unprocessed audio; data post-Voice Activity Detection, and partially transcribed data. The dataset stands out for its legal accessibility, permitting use at no cost, thereby serving as a crucial resource for researchers, developers, and commercial entities. \textit{ivrit.ai} opens up numerous applications, offering vast potential to enhance AI capabilities in Hebrew. Future efforts aim to expand \textit{ivrit.ai} further, thereby advancing Hebrew's standing in AI research and technology.

### Rating
3

### Rating Number
3

### Confidence
5: You are absolutely certain about your assessment. You are very familiar with the related work and checked the math/other details carefully.

### Summary
This work introduces ivrit.ai, which is a large Hebrew speech corpus consisting of more than 10k hours. The authors apply several preprocessing approaches to clean and organize the dataset.

### Strengths
The corpus has more than 10k hours of Hebrew speech, which is likely to be very valuable for future research on Hebrew ASR.

The corpus also has CC-license, which makes it available to many use cases.

### Weaknesses
Although the corpus should be valuable to the community, this work does not implement any baseline models or provide any sufficient qualitative analysis of the collected speech. This makes it very difficult to assess the quality of this corpus and understand the underlying contents.

Establishing a good baseline of the corpus should be conducted, for example, adapting Whisper to this corpus.

### Questions
Can authors give more details about how this corpus is collected?

### Summary
The paper introduces ivrit.ai, which is a comprehensive Hebrew speech dataset designed to address the lack of extensive and high-quality resources for Automated Speech Recognition (ASR) technology in Hebrew. The dataset consists of over 10,000 speech hours from a diverse set of speakers, covering various contexts. It is provided in three different forms: raw unprocessed audio, data post-Voice Activity Detection, and partially transcribed data. What sets ivrit.ai apart is its legal accessibility, allowing free usage, making it a valuable resource for researchers, developers, and commercial entities. The dataset has the potential to enhance AI capabilities in Hebrew.

### Strengths
Language-specific datasets play a crucial role in advancing ASR technology for specific languages. Hebrew, as a complex and unique language, presents its own set of challenges and nuances in speech recognition. By addressing the distinct lack of extensive and high-quality resources for Hebrew ASR, the paper fills an important gap in the research landscape.

### Weaknesses
The primary concern with the paper is its narrow focus on Hebrew ASR dataset. Given the diverse range of topics covered at ICLR, which includes machine learning, representation learning, and various other areas, a paper solely dedicated to a specific language may struggle to attract a broad audience. The conference typically prioritizes research with broader applicability and impact across multiple domains. Although the paper addresses the need for extensive and high-quality resources for Hebrew ASR, the impact beyond the Hebrew language itself seems limited. While Hebrew is a unique language with its own complexities, the specific challenges faced in Hebrew ASR may not resonate with researchers working on other languages or broader speech recognition topics. This lack of broader impact may further diminish the paper's appeal to the ICLR audience. I suggest the authors submit the paper to specific workshop or speech conference.

 Another concern is the absence of baseline numbers with well-established open-source frameworks such as ESPnet, k2, and fairseq. Others could easily build their system and have a relatively fair comparision if these numbers are provided.

### Questions
Why not use Whisper large to generate transtriptions?

### Summary
The paper presents a new, open-source dataset consisting of Hebrew audio files, partially transcribed by an automatic speech recognition system (Whisper). The paper furthermore provides an overview of other Hebrews speech resources (most of the paper), and some details regarding data collection.

### Strengths
The authors provide a new resource to the speech research community - there has been a lack of publicly available corpora for Hebrew and the ivrit.ai corpus fills a gap.

### Weaknesses
The paper only describes a data collection effort; it does not present a research hypothesis or experimental study. As such it is not well suited to ICLR - a conference like Interspeech or LREC with a track for language resources would be more appropriate.
Even for a speech or language resources conference, it would be desirable to have more details on the actual corpus, such as quantitative information about language/accent distribution. 
Lastly, the corpus would be much more valuable if some amount of human annotation were included. Automatic transcription contains errors, and especially systems like Whisper are known to hallucinate. These errors will be propagated if users of this corpus use the transcripts for further model training. Automatic transcription is easy to generate, but manual transcription is difficult and costly -- it would have been a great service to the community to include even a few hours of manual transcripts.

### Questions
The paper states that "our possibility to provide precise information regarding the speakers is limited" and therefore, no distribution across speaker groups is provided. However, you do seem to know that speakers range between 20 and 90 years. If this information is available, why can't a distribution over age ranges be provided? It would be good to see the distribution over ages, accents, and other languages, even if based on automatic classifiers.

### Summary
This paper introduces a novel ASR dataset for Hebrew.  The dataset consists of 10k hours of audio with VAD and some automatic transcription.

### Strengths
The paper's claim that this dataset much larger and much more diverse than any previous Hebrew ASR dataset is to my knowledge correct.  I further agree with claim that the contribution of such a dataset is of profound importance to research in Hebrew ASR and to the development of strong speech products for Hebrew.  Specific strengths include:

- The dataset is indeed under a permissive license.
- The dataset includes speakers of many ages and include speakers with other first languages representing the diversity of Hebrew speakers as a whole.
- The settings from which the data is reported to have been gathered reflect realistic applications of Hebrew ASR.

### Weaknesses
The importance of the contributed dataset is clear, and I offer no challenge to it.  However, I believe that the write-up is missing a few things that users will need and will expect to find in a paper that introduces a dataset.

(1) Details on how the dataset is split across speakers and domains.  To whatever degree is possible, information on how much of the data came from speakers in different age groups, speakers with different first languages, and settings (podcasts, lectures, talmud lessons, ect.)

(2) Details on the automatic transcription.  How much of the 10k hours are transcribed?  How good is the transcription? Even a WER on a very small (maybe 30mins?), manually transcribed test split would be helpful as evidence that the transcriptions are strong enough to be usable.

(3) Baseline models.  How does a conventional RNN-T or LAS model perform when trained on the supervised subset?  How about when it is then finetuned using the untranscribed subset, or rescored with a language model?

For an example of a classic and very useful paper of this kind, I direct the authors to the original Librispeech write-up: https://www.danielpovey.com/files/2015_icassp_librispeech.pdf

### Questions
Please see the three points above.  I believe that after even partially addressing those missing pieces this write-up will be a substantial contribution.
