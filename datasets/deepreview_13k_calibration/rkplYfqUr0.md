## Abstract
Language model (LM) prompting---a popular paradigm for solving NLP tasks---has been shown to be susceptible to miscalibration and brittleness to slight prompt variations, %, particularly for complex tasks with longer output sequences
caused by its discriminative prompting approach, i.e., predicting the label given the input. To address these issues, we propose \ourmodel---a \textbf{gen}erative prompting framework for \textbf{z}ero-shot text classification. \ourmodel is generative, as it measures the LM likelihood of input text, conditioned on natural language descriptions of labels. The framework is multivariate, as label descriptions allow us to 
seamlessly integrate additional contextual information about the labels to improve task performance.
On various standard classification benchmarks, with six open-source LM families, we show that zero-shot classification with simple contextualization of the data source of the evaluation set consistently outperforms both zero-shot and few-shot baselines while improving robustness to prompt variations. Further, 
our approach enables personalizing classification in a zero-shot manner by incorporating author, subject, or reader information in the label descriptions. %We show that by incorporating information about readers' and writers' attributes in the prompts lead to significant improvements in politeness and hate speech classification.

### Summary
This paper introduces a generative prompting framework for zero-shot text classification. It proposes to make text classification based on the LMs' likelihood of input text conditioned on the description of each label, where the label description comes from human annotation and ChatGPT. Experiments show this proposed model achieves solid zero-shot text classification performance over baselines.

### Strengths
- This paper is well-written and easy to follow.
- The empirical analysis is comprehensive and solid regarding datasets and backbone models.
- The proposed method is simple yet effective, providing a solid and lightweight framework to solve zero-shot text classification problems.

### Weaknesses
The proposed method, presentation, and empirical analysis are well self-explained. I don't have much concern about it. 

My main concern is whether the problem of "zero-shot text classification with some human/ChatGPT labeled data" is meaningful. If one would like to do some annotation, either with human annotators or ChatGPT, why not directly annotate some labeled samples for few-shot text classification? Thus, in my opinion, to show that this problem setup and the proposed framework are meaningful, the authors need to somehow show that this zero-shot framework is more effective than a few-shot text classification framework given the same amount of annotation effort.

### Questions
Do you think the proposed framework can be used to amplify few-shot classification systems? I think it may make better sense in assisting a few-shot classification system since adding a few more training samples may not be as effective as providing these label descriptions given the same annotation efforts.

### Summary
This study suggests employing multivariate generative classification over discriminative approaches for zero-shot text classification tasks utilizing in-context learning. 
Building on Min et al. (2022), the paper demonstrates that through multiple iterations with varied contexts elucidating label information, generative classification coupled with in-context learning emerges as a more rational and stable solution.
Furthermore, users can enhance the context with additional information (e.g., the gender of a writer) to more effectively clarify the label space. 
It is evidenced that this supplementary context can significantly improve the performance of in-context learning in zero-shot classification tasks.

### Strengths
- The authors successfully derived the final form of the probability for generative text classification (i.e., $\sum_{z_i} p(\mathbf{x}|z_i)$), based on a series of reasonable assumptions.
- The paper outlines a well-considered experimental setup that demonstrates the efficacy of the proposed method in specific applications like domain-aware classification and personalized classification.

### Weaknesses
 - The method proposed is conceptually similar to Min et al.'s noisy channel method, with the primary distinction being the use of multiple "label descriptions". This similarity raises questions regarding the novelty of the proposed approach. The core mechanism of using a generative model conditioned on label descriptions to infer the most probable label is fundamentally the same, and the addition of multiple descriptions, while potentially beneficial, does not represent a significant departure in terms of methodology.
- The assumptions outlined in Section 2.3 may be overly simplistic, potentially detracting from the final performance of the proposed method. Specifically, assuming that $p(z|y_i, u,v,\dots)$ is uniform across different textual descriptions $z$ of the same label $y_i$ is a strong assumption that ignores the nuances of language models' probability distributions. Similarly, assuming $p(y_i|u,v,\dots)$ is independent of contextual factors and that all labels are equally likely is a simplification that may not hold in real-world scenarios, especially when dealing with imbalanced datasets or when contextual information strongly biases the label distribution. The paper would gain interest if the authors could suggest reasonable approximations for the omitted probabilities, namely i.e., $p(z|y_i, u,v,\dots)$ and $p(y_i|u,v,\dots)$.

### Questions
- What potential impacts could arise from the combination of the proposed method with few-shot learning scenarios? This consideration is crucial, especially given that while generative zero-shot classification yields reasonable results, it does not yet match the performance of few-shot-based methods, like ICL (DC) as depicted in Table 2.

### Summary
This work proposes GEN-Z, a generative prompting framework for zero-shot text classification. Specifically, GEN-Z measures the LM likelihood of input text, conditioned on natural language descriptions of labels, which can be extended to multivariate forms. This work conduct experiments on multiple classification tasks. Experimental results show that the proposed framework can achieve better performance compared with the baseline approaches.

### Strengths
1. The proposed framework is interesting and seems novel. Utilizing label description in the bayesian form can help to improve the overall classification performance as shown in the experiments in the paper.

2. This work conducts extensive experiments on a variety of datasets, including domain-aware classification and personalized classification. This is very encouraged in NLP research.

### Weaknesses
1. Though this work argues that utilizing label descriptions in a bayesian form benefits the performance, it relies heavily on the quality of the label description, e.g., how clear the context can present the task, domain the label. However, in text classification, sometimes the label is not natural language, but a less literally meaningful symbol. For such labels, it is not likely to encourage the model to generate text $x$ given $y$. Then it requires human beings to provide very good summaries or descriptions for such labels, which is sometimes challenging. Such a problem limits the application of the proposed GEN-Z framework. Instead, conventional in-context learning can provide examples and have the model to learn from simpler label descriptions and demonstrations, which is more flexible.

2. Since label descriptions directly decides how the model generates $x$, the quality of $z_i$ plays an important role on the performance. It is encouraged to explore how the performance is influenced if descriptions of different quality are given. For example, if the label can already express the meaning of the label, then descriptions may not be required. When the label meaning is more abstract, detailed descriptions may be better than abstract descriptions. Such influence is encouraged to be explored.

### Questions
1. For LMs, the context can influence the language model probability significantly. Combining multiple label descriptions may result in changed language model probability. So how is multiple label descriptions utilized in this work?

### Summary
This paper proposes a generative prompting framework for zero-shot text classification. Specifically, the proposed model takes on the text classification task by measuring the LM likelihood of the input text, conditioned on natural language descriptions of labels.GEN-Z leverages LM likelihood of generating the input text based on various label descriptions that reflect context, enabling more robust
predictions than discriminative approaches. Experiments show that GEN-Z consistently improves classification performance
over zero-shot baselines and performs on par with strong few-shot baselines

### Strengths
1) This generative in-context learning is natural due to the LLM being based on a generative model. This paper propose two novel module based on baseline models, including MULTIVARIATE GENERATIVE CLASSIFICATION and CONTEXTUALIZED LABEL DESCRIPTIONS. 

2) Compared with other in-context learning methods, this method can improve robustness effectively.

3) The paper is well written, and the figure is helpful for understanding.

4) The analysis of the Baysian equation is novel, simple, and clear.

### Weaknesses
This paper may take incremental work, which adds two new modules based on the generative classifier in [1].
In my opinion, the work doesn't show any new insight, maybe not enough for ICLR but more suitable for other conference , such as ACL. The core idea of using multiple label descriptions, while effective, feels like a straightforward extension of the generative approach, and the novelty is somewhat limited. The improvement in performance, while consistent, might not justify the complexity introduced by the additional modules, especially considering the computational overhead of evaluating multiple label descriptions. The paper lacks a thorough analysis of the computational cost associated with the proposed method compared to simpler baselines. Furthermore, the paper does not explore the sensitivity of the method to the quality and diversity of the generated label descriptions, which could be a significant factor in its performance.

### Questions
Do you add the label description to other baseline models, which are generated from ChatGPT? If not, the comparison may not be fair because you added more external knowledge. 

Can the generative classifier be used to other suan as multimodel, or image data?(CLIP)
