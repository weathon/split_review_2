## Abstract
Transformers, renowned for their self-attention mechanism, have achieved state-of-the-art performance across various tasks in natural language processing, computer vision, time-series modeling, etc. However, one of the challenges with deep Transformer models is the oversmoothing problem, where representations across layers converge to indistinguishable values, leading to significant performance degradation. We interpret the original self-attention as a simple graph filter and redesign it from a graph signal processing (GSP) perspective.} to learn a general yet effective one, whose complexity, however, is slightly larger than that of the original self-attention mechanism. We demonstrate that GFSA improves the performance of Transformers in various fields, including computer vision, natural language processing, graph-level tasks, speech recognition, and code classification.

### Summary
This paper proposes a novel graph filtering approach to enrich the self-attention in Transformer models. The authors show that this improves the performance on 6 different tasks with different types of data. The issue with standard self-attention is that it may oversmooth across different layers (tokens become too similar across layers). In the proposed formulation, the signal for each token is more rich and endowed with both lower and higher frequency information, which mitigates the risk of oversmoothing. The paper is very ambitious in terms of experiments, systematic in its scientific approach, and well-written.

### Strengths
* The problem the article addresses is clearly stated (the over-smoothing problem in Transformers.)
* Clear performance improvement is presented on multiple tasks.
* The idea is conceptually very appealing.
* Experiments to ensure that the frequency response is indeed inriched, and that the cosine similarity across layers can be mitigated with GFSA are included in the paper (e.g., Fig 2a-b)
* Runtime and FLOPS is measured and is thoroughly presented.
* The approach is well presented and easy-to-grasp, especially with the generous supplementary.

### Weaknesses
 * Table 5 is the only table to provide uncertainty on the estimates. If this is for computational reasons, it would be good to comment on, either in the main text or in the appendix. Generally, it's good to comment on how secure your estimates are. (I see in the appendix that you specify the fixed seed you run on for the other experiments -- great, but I still maintain my point.)

* What do you mean here? "$w_K$ is learned to negative value" (page 5, comparison to GCNs)
* It seems like you are citing Schwartz et al. here, but to me it seems a little strong to claim that "The computations required for machine learning research are doubling every few months". If this were true we would very quickly be in a very dangerous situation (if it's true doubling). If not, is it possible to tone down the statement to 'rapidly growing' or similar -- or adding 'currently doubling'.

* Did you mean V instead of U after Eq. 3 (page 3)?
* Page 3: missing capitalization of Equation in multiple places
* "latent representations tend to become similar to each other, leading to a loss of distinctiveness" (I propose to rephrase this sentence, perhaps deleting the second clause as it does not add any new information -- or add 'loss of distinctiveness in the representations'.)
* English: "due to the issues" should be "due to issues"
* "sometimes uniformity among patches or tokens" >> would be nice to be a bit more precise here. English-wise, maybe you could say 'sporadic' instead of sometimes if you want an adjective, or delete 'sometimes' entirely.
* Section 4.4, would it look nicer to write "graph transformers" in plural instead of 'graph transformer'? Both in section title and in text
* I would increase the column width a little bit in Table 3, and put #Layers in plural to be consistent across layers and params.

### Summary
The paper addresses the over-smoothing problem in deep Transformer models, where representations in different layers become too similar and lead to reduced performance. To tackle this, the authors propose graph-filter-based self-attention (GFSA) to preserve diverse features. GFSA is demonstrated to enhance Transformer model performance in various domains, including computer vision, natural language processing, graph pattern classification, speech recognition, and code classification.

### Strengths
1. The paper is easy to read.

2. The paper is well-motivated

### Weaknesses
1. In the paper, there is no theory that explains why transformers suffer from over-smoothing as well as how the proposed method mitigates the issue.

2. The derivation in the paper lacks cohesion, as seen in equation 5, where the authors do not provide an explanation for the first-order approximation of A-bar^K. I am doubtful about the correctness of this equation.

3. Theorem 3.1 establishes an error bound for the Taylor approximation in Eqn 5. However, the error bound presented in Equation 9 relies on ||A-bar^2 - A-bar||, making this error bound meaningless since it lacks any bound for ||A-bar^2 - A-bar||.

4. The authors’ argument on adding the term (A-bar^2 - A-bar) (see Eqn. 6) in Section 3.3 helps alleviate the over-smoothing problem is not sound. The claim that “(A-bar^2 − A-bar) captures the difference between 2-hop and 1-hop neighborhood information” and “acts as a filter that emphasizes changes or variations in a local structure” is evidenceless. Graph neural networks (GNNs) typically require multiple hops to aggregate non-local information from distant neighbors, whereas self-attention allows one to attend all tokens simultaneously. This raises the question of why self-attention would need (A-bar^2 - A-bar).

5. When explaining over-smoothing problem in transformers, the authors claim: “This problem is obvious to understand since Transformers’ aggregation methods for value vectors are simply weighted averages”. This argument is weak and vague.

6. The experimental results display inconsistencies. It is challenging to find the 3.3% improvement mentioned in the introduction for the image classification task, as it is not evident in Figure 1 and Table 3. Likewise, the claim of a 1.63% improvement for DeiT-S + GFSA over DeiT-S does not correspond with the results presented in Table 3. Furthermore, the alleged 6.23% improvement in the natural language understanding task cannot be observed when comparing Figure 1 and Table 5.

In summary, I recommend rejecting the paper for two primary reasons. First, the paper's novelty and contribution are lacking. The concept of self-attention as a weighted graph has already been discussed in prior works [1, 2, 3, 4]. Although the authors introduce the idea of viewing self-attention as a graph filter, they fail to provide a solid explanation for how this perspective addresses the issue of over-smoothing in Transformers. Second, the paper's theoretical foundation is weak, and it lacks evidence to explain why Transformers experience over-smoothing within their graph-based framework and how their proposed models effectively resolve this problem. Lastly, I find that the main arguments presented in the paper are not convincing.

### Summary
Transformer can be viewed as an attention-based graph neural networks over fully connected graph and thus suffer from over-smoothing problem, that the representations induced by deep layers converge to distinguishable values and further results in performance degradation. Inspired by graph representation learning, the paper introduces high-order neighbor information aggregation in Transformer’s attention layer to relieve over-smoothing. Experimental study demonstrated that the proposed method could improve the performance of Transformer over a variety tasks. The paper is well-written and easy to follow.

### Strengths
1.Transformer can be viewed a special case of attention based GNNs. Therefore, introducing graph-filter to enhance Transformer’s attention is promising and effective.
2.Experiments over variant tasks (CV, NLP and Graph, etc.) demonstrated the proposed method can significantly improve the performance of Transformers.

### Weaknesses
1.The bottleneck of standard Transformer in practice is its high time/space complexity O(N^2), the proposed method introduce high-order neighbor information aggregation introduces more computation/memory overheads, even with approximate computation.

### Questions
1.How to get the pre-trained large language models integrated with GFSA? Training from scratch or initializing with pre-trained language models and fine-tuning with added GFSA?

2.In section 4.6, the paper talked about the overhead of training time. It is better to add the comparison of inference time.

3.In Eq. (6), do we have any constraints over the coefficients w0, w1, wk? For example w0, w1, wk > 0? In standard Transformer, there is a residual connection in self-attention layer. What is the difference or connection between w0 and this residual connection? 

Are these learnable coefficients added to all layers? If yes, are they shared across different layers? Similar questions for multi-head attention, are they shared across different heads?

### Summary
Recent studies unveil that, much like GNNs, Transformers suffer from the over-smoothing issue, where an increase in depth does not consistently lead to enhanced performance. More disconcerting is the finding that a Transformer with a significantly deeper layer does not outperform a shallower one. Stemming from these observations, the authors interpret self-attention as a form of graph convolution. Viewing through the perspective of graph signal processing, they propose Graph Filter-based Self-Attention (GFSA), where the attention matrix is processed through a trinomial-based graph filter. The experimental results affirm that GFSA substantially elevates the performance of Transformers across various domains.

### Strengths
1. This paper encompasses extensive experiments covering a variety of domains including language models, vision Transformers, automatic speech recognition, graph Transformers, and code classifications.

### Weaknesses
1. The distinction between self-attention and (directed) graph convolution lies in the requirement for the graph shift operator in (directed) graph convolution to be diagonalizable, a constraint absent in the attention matrix in self-attention. In a directed graph, each signal space -- to which each column of input features belongs -- should remain invariant to filtering [1]. In other words, the signal space housing each column of output vectors should be the same as that of the corresponding input vectors. The sole condition fulfilling this scenario is that the graph shift operator has to be diagonalizable. Hence, unless the authors can demonstrate that the attention matrix in each GFSA is diagonalizable, employing graph signal processing as the theoretical underpinning for GFSA is inappropriate.
2. The elucidation provided on how GFSA mitigates the over-smoothing issue lacks adequacy. The authors need to furnish a more comprehensive illustration, accompanied by meticulous formulation derivations and rigorous proofs, to substantiate their claims. The current analysis does not sufficiently connect the proposed filter to established theories on over-smoothing in graph neural networks. Specifically, the paper lacks a clear explanation of how the proposed graph filter alters the spectral properties of the attention matrix to prevent low-frequency dominance, which is a key factor in over-smoothing.
3. The time complexity of GFSA exceeds that of both single-head and multi-head self-attention. Specifically, in scenarios with a large number of tokens, the computation of $\mathbf{A}^{2}$ will demand a substantial amount of computational resources. The paper does not adequately address the practical implications of this increased computational cost, especially in resource-constrained environments or when dealing with very long sequences. The authors should provide a more detailed analysis of the trade-off between performance gains and computational overhead.

### Questions
1. In (directed) graph convolution, the eigenvalues of the graph shift operator are filtered in accordance with the principles of graph signal processing. Assuming the graph filter can be directly applied to the attention matrix, which segment of the attention matrix is subjected to filtering?
