## Abstract
Stochastic Variance Reduced Gradient (SVRG), introduced by \citet{johnson2013accelerating}, is a theoretically compelling optimization method. However, as \citet{defazio2019ineffectiveness} highlights, its effectiveness in deep learning is yet to be proven. In this work, we demonstrate the potential of SVRG in optimizing real-world neural networks. Our analysis finds that, for deeper networks, the strength of the variance reduction term in SVRG should be smaller and decrease as training progresses. Inspired by this, we introduce a multiplicative coefficient $\alpha$ to control the strength and adjust it through a linear decay schedule. We name our method \approach. Our results show \approach\ better optimizes neural networks, consistently reducing training loss compared to both baseline and the standard SVRG across various architectures and image classification datasets. We hope our findings encourage further exploration into variance reduction techniques in deep learning.

### Summary
This paper reveals that the variance reduction strength in SVRG should be lower for deep networks and decrease as training progresses.
Thus, this paper introduce a multiplicative coefficient $\alpha$ to control its
strength and adjust it with a linear decay schedule. This paper proposes a novel method  named $\alpha$-SVRG.
Experiments are conducted to  demonstrate  that $\alpha$-SVRG better optimizes neural networks, consistently
lowering the training loss compared to both baseline and standard SVRG across
various architectures and datasets. This paper is the first to bring the benefit of
SVRG into training neural networks at a practical scale.

### Strengths
This paper is the first to bring the benefit of
SVRG into training neural networks at a practical scale.

### Weaknesses
The experiments show the potential of $\alpha$-SVRG. However, the experiment results and the comparisons does not consider the computation cost. It seems that $\alpha$-SVRG takes three times computation cost as much as AdamW since $\nabla f_i(\theta^{past})$ takes extra cost and $\nabla f(\theta^{past})$ is computed for each $39$-iterations.
If  the computation cost is considered, I doubt the effciency and effectiveness of $\alpha$-SVRG.

### Summary
The authors propose $\alpha$-SVRG, an improved version of SVRG designed to tackle the ineffectiveness of SVRG in training deep neural networks. The method involves decreasing the weight added to the variance estimated using the model snapshot. This method is obtained using

### Strengths
1. The paper is presented in a clear manner, especially the experiments.
2. The proposed method is effective according to the experiments.

### Weaknesses
1. The baseline is a bit unclear in some scenarios. See questions.
2. It seems that by saying that $\alpha_t$ decreases linearly, the authors mean that $\alpha_t=O(1/t)$. However, in some literature, a linearly decreasing sequence is a geometric sequence. The authors may want to be more clear about this.
3. Although it can be observed both intuitively and empirically that $\alpha_t$ should be decreased within an epoch, it could be a bit too arbitrary to conclude that $\alpha_t$ should be decreasing **linearly**. It's hard to see why it is preferred over other schedules, e.g., $\alpha_t=O(t^{-r})$ or $\alpha_t=O(q^{-t})$.
4. The part where the proposed method is applied to AdamW is a bit unclear. Could the authors guide me to previous works where SVRG is combined with adaptive momentum methods, if there is any? If there is, then the authors may want to refer to these works and build the proposed method based on the previous ones; otherwise it is worth discussing in greater detail how SVRG can be combined with AdamW, as the effect of the variance estimator could be more complicated due to the existence of moments.
5. The performance of the proposed method applied to ImageNet-1K is mixed compared to the baseline.

### Questions
1. Can the authors provide more details about the baseline? In some sections of this work, the baseline is AdamW, but I'm not sure whether this applies to all experiments.
2. Can the authors explain more about why even the  only seems to suppress variance more effectively in the early stages of training, but is less effective in later stages?

### Summary
This paper recalls the ineffectiveness of SVRG for deep neural networks and shows that the gradients variance even increase during late epochs when training deep networks with standard SVRG.
It then introduces a modified version of SVRG that involves an $\apha$ coefficient in front of the variance reduction term.
Authors define and derive an optimal coefficient that minimizes the coordinate-wise variance of mini-batch stochastic gradients. 
They show empirically that SVRG with optimal coefficient and its practical implementation $\alpha$-SVRG (linear decaying coefficient) do not suffer from increased variance.
Finally, the authors show the effectiveness of their methods compared to standard SVRG on a classification benchmark including multiple deep architectures, especially on Imagenet dataset.

### Strengths
- The paper clearly show the failure of SVRG for deep networks, especially at later stages of the training (confirming findings of [Defazio & Bottou, 2019])
- The motivation and derivation of section 3, the practical choice of the linear decay for alpha-SVRG emerges from clear experimental findings showing that the optimal $\alpha$ decreases in deep models
- the experiments of section 5 explore multiple scales ("smaller" and "larger" models) and families (CNN, ViT, Mixer) of deep models and show $\apha$-SVRG always lowers the training loss and often improves the test accuracy

### Weaknesses
 - Additional parametrization (initialization, linear decay) of the proposed $\apha$-SVRG
- Results of $\apha$-SVRG often very close to the baseline: no clear improvement in most cases (except on Pets, STL-10 and DTD datasets)
- No clear explanation on how $\apha$-SVRG scales to larger datasets: no explanations about the feasibility of taking full batch gradient every epoch (cf mega-batch size of [Defazio & Bottou, 2019])
- No discussion on the supposition than the noise of SGD might be an element for better generalization (cf [Jin et al, Towards Better Generalization: BP-SVRG in Training Deep Neural Networks, 2019])
- The necessity of knowing the total number of iterations to perform the linear decay of alpha to zero is a significant limitation, preventing the method's direct application to new problems without prior knowledge of the training schedule.
- The paper does not address the fact that SVRG, unlike SGD, can converge with a constant step size in convex settings. This difference is crucial and the use of a decaying step size and alpha coefficient makes the method very close to SGD, especially at the end of training.
- The general finding that alpha should go to zero at the end of training, effectively recovering SGD, seems contradictory to the findings of Defazio & Bottou [1] who state that SVRG only introduces a benefit late in training.

### Questions
**Comments**
1) $\theta^{past}$ is not a standard notation, I would recommend $\tilde{\theta}$ instead
2) An explanation of the three metrics in Table 1 is required. How are they different?
3) $g_i,k$ in metric 2 of Table 1 is not defined
4) The notations $\textbf{g}_{i \cdot}$ is unclear
5) Precising the baseline in the legends (SGD or AdamW) would be better
6) The "snapshot interval" is better known as "inner loop size"

**Questions**
1) Why are works related to alternative optimization cited page 2? No clear relevance.
2) How large are the mini-batches for $\alpha$-SVRG for the different experiments? 
3) Page 5, "This is likely because the gradient direction varies more and becomes less certain as models become better trained" -> are there other works confirming this statement?
4) Page 5, is the standard deviation ratio of equation (6) constant across iterations? 
5) Table 3, validation accuracy of SVRG, datasets Pets, STL-10 : have you double checked this results ? The accuracy gap is very important. How can this be explained ?
6) How does $\alpha$-SVRG behaves on Imagenet (not Imagenet-1K) ? In such a setting it is impossible to perform full gradient computations and not every epoch. cf [Defazio & Bottou, 2019]


**Suggestions**
1) Should be cited: works on optimal implementation and parameters for SVRG [Sebbouh et al. "Towards closing the gap between the theory and practice of SVRG.", 2019], [Babanezhad Harikandeh, et al. "Stopwasting my gradients: Practical svrg." 2015]
2) To enrich the bibliography, SVRG has also been extended to policy learning ([Papini et al. "Stochastic variance-reduced policy gradient." 2018] & [Du et al. "Stochastic variance reduction methods for policy evaluation." 2017]) other examples are given in [Gower, et al. "Variance-reduced methods for machine learning." 2020]

### Summary
This paper studies SVRG for training neural networks. The main idea is introducing an additional coefficient vector $\bf\alpha$ to control the variance at each iteration, which leads to a new algorithm called $\alpha$-SVRG. The experimental results show the proposed algorithm has lower gradient variance and training loss compared to baselines.

### Strengths
The topic of this paper is nice. How to fill the gap between the theory of variance reduction and training neural networks has not been well-studied. This paper attempt to address this important problem.

This paper is well-organized and easy to follow. The motivation and design of $\alpha$-SVRG is clear. The authors provide sufficient numerical experiments to support their ideas.

### Weaknesses
I think the main weakness of this paper is its theoretical contribution is not strong.

1. Section 3 introduces ``optimal coefficient’’ by minimizing the sum of variances for each component of $\bf g^t$. However, this formulation does not consider the potential correlation between different components of $\bf g^t$. In other words, it implicitly assumes the components of $\bf g^t$ are uncorrelated, which looks too strong. Specifically, the variance minimization is performed independently for each component of the gradient, ignoring the covariance terms that arise when considering the full gradient vector. This simplification could lead to suboptimal variance reduction in practice, especially when the gradient components are highly correlated.

2. The optimal coefficient only considers the current variable $\theta^t$, but it is unclear how it affects the convergence rate of the algorithm in theoretical. The existing analysis only provide a greedy view, while I am more interested in the global theoretical guarantees of proposed algorithms. The paper lacks a rigorous convergence analysis that demonstrates how the proposed coefficient impacts the overall convergence rate of the algorithm. The analysis should explore how the coefficient affects the error bounds and convergence speed, especially in non-convex settings.

3. It is well-known that stochastic recursive gradient methods has the optimal stochastic first-order oracle (SFO) complexity for nonconvex optimization. For example, SVRG can find $\epsilon$-stationary point within $n+n^{2/3}\epsilon^{-2}$ SFO calls (Allen-Zhu & Hazan, 2016; Reddi et al., 2016), while SPIDER only requires $n+n^{1/2}\epsilon^{-2}$ (Fang et al., 2018), where $n$ is the number of individual functions. Compared with SVRG, the study on SPIDER for training neural networks is more interesting. The paper does not adequately address the potential advantages of using SPIDER or other more efficient stochastic recursive gradient methods for training neural networks. The comparison with SVRG is not sufficient to justify the proposed method's practical relevance, given the availability of methods with better theoretical guarantees.

### Questions
1. Can you design some strategy to improve SVRG by considering the correlation  between the component of gradient estimator?
2. Can you provide convergence analysis to show the advantage of proposed method?
3. Is it possible to apply the idea of this paper to improve stochastic recursive gradient methods?
