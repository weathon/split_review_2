## Abstract
Autoregressive large language models (LLMs) have made remarkable progress in various natural language generation tasks. However, they incur high computation cost and latency resulting from the autoregressive token-by-token generation. To address this issue, several approaches have been proposed to reduce computational cost using early-exit strategies. These strategies enable faster text generation using reduced computation without applying the full computation graph to each token. While existing token-level early exit methods show promising results for online inference, {\em they cannot be readily applied for batch inferencing and Key-Value caching}. This is because they have to wait until the last token in a batch exits before they can stop computing. This severely limits the practical application of such techniques. 
In this paper, we propose a simple and effective token-level early exit method, {\sysname}, designed to work seamlessly with batch inferencing and KV caching. It overcomes prior constraints by setting up a singular exit point for every token in a batch at each sequence position. It also guarantees a monotonic decrease in exit points, thereby eliminating the need to recompute KV Caches for preceding tokens. Rather than terminating computation prematurely as in prior works, our approach bypasses lower to middle layers, devoting most of the computational resources to upper layers, allowing later tokens to  benefit from  the compute expenditure by earlier tokens.
Our experimental results show that {\sysname} can obtain 2x to 5x inference speedups with negligible regression across a variety of tasks. This is achieved using OPT models of 1.3 billion and 6.7 billion parameters, all the while being directly compatible with batching and KV caching optimization techniques.

### Summary
This work proposes SkipDecode, an early-exit method for speeding up the inference of autoregressive models. This method works by setting a fixed schedule for skipping earlier layers depending on the number of generated tokens. Authors validate the performance of SkipDecode by testing it on OPT models for several generative tasks, showing speedups over prior methods such as CALM.

Post-rebuttal update: thanks to the authors for their response! Since they have not followed up with the experiments they proposed to conduct, I am keeping my current score.

### Strengths
* The work proposes an original way to simplify early-exit adaptive generation techniques that addresses their shortcomings. The method is conceptually simple yet efficient in practice.
* Overall, the paper is well-written and the key contributions are clear.
* The empirical results for studied models and datasets appear promising: in some cases, there are negligible accuracy degradations even with a 5x speedup.

### Weaknesses
 * For a work that claims practical performance speedups of deep learning inference, it should be important to comprehensively evaluate the real-world increase in speed compared to the baselines. However, I have found that part of the experiments to be missing multiple crucial details, for example, the type of hardware used to run the experiments, the batch size during generation, and the metric that was used to obtain the numbers for true speedup (was it latency, throughput, or something else?). Also, apparently there is no real-world speedup comparison between SkipDecode and CALM-DEC.
* The choice of datasets could also be more comprehensive: currently, 2/3 problems are related to summarization with quite long prompts, and another is structure-to-text conversion. To give a broader view of whether SkipDecode performs reliably well across different problems, it would be useful to include tasks with different input-output relations and sequence length (for example, machine translation experiments from the CALM paper)
* There are quite a few typos in the submission: for example, "figure 2" -> "Figure 2" at the bottom of page 3, "e2e dataset" -> "E2E dataset" and "figure 3" -> "Figure 3" on page 6, "SkipDecodemodels" -> "SkipDecode models" on page 8.
* Lastly, I think that the OPT family of models is not fully representative of the architecture variations used today (for example, LLaMA models with multi-query attention), and the current findings about embedding saturation might not transfer to larger or more recent models.

### Questions
* If I understood correctly, each of the experiments you ran involved finetuning the model on a target dataset. However, in practice, model providers might often serve a single model for many different applications: for example, this means that the average prompt/response lengths can vary dramatically. Is it possible to extend SkipDecode to such a scenario?
* Which hardware did you use to run your experiments and how did you measure the true speedup?

### Summary
This work investigates token-level early exit for large language models. Existing approaches are an ill fit for batch inference and KV cache. To address these two challenges, the authors propose two designs: a shared exit point for every token in a batch at each sequence position for batching; a monotonic decrease in exit point for KV cache. The authors evaluate their method on three generation datasets using the OPT model.

### Strengths
This work investigates an important problem, and provides a practical design for the batching serving setting.

### Weaknesses
-> This work only considers the finetuning setting, whereas LLM is particular interesting for its in-context learning ability. 

-> The authors only discussed established direction such as distillation and quantization, but no recent works on compressing LLM nor efficient inference of LLM in Section 4.

### Summary
The authors claim that there is a problem with early exit methods like CALM as they create K,V cache issues. The authors propose a simple solution - predefine exit location for each token based on the sequence length. The strategy is based on the claim "later tokens are easier to generate than the first tokens".

### Strengths
1. The approch is simple. Directly applicable without a requiring a lot of low level implementation.
2. Is the loss per token a valid proxy for "hardness" ?

### Weaknesses
1. I am still a bit unconvinced that fixing a schedule for early exit is good approach for reducing the computation. To an extent won't a better approach be do it based on the context rather than forcing it.
2. The second is the validaty of the claim that"KV cache" generation is a massive bottleneck. Yes I agree it might makeup for unpredictable tail latencies, but can authors do an analysis of illustrating the problem.
3. I understand the authors perspective of performing fine-tuning. However, do authors think it is a viable approach in real world, especially as the model sizes keep increasing. How would authors go about creating a dataset which reperesent real world examples.

4. I am having a hard-time understanding Table-4. I have spent close to 15 minutes trying to understand the Table and reading text around. There are no lables, no descriptions what the numbers mean and how do you go about fixing speedup. Please improve the presentation.

### Summary
> **TL;DR:** The proposed SkipDecode algorithm achieves significant inference speedups (2x to 5x) across various tasks and LLM model sizes while maintaining negligible performance regression. However, the algorithm has limitations, which are clearly stated and helpful. Addressing my concerns and questions would improve my score.

The paper introduces SkipDecode, a novel token-level early exit strategy designed to enhance the efficiency of autoregressive large language models (LLMs) in natural language generation tasks. The existing token-level early exit methods have limitations when applied to batch inferencing and Key-Value caching, as they require waiting for the last token in a batch to exit, hindering practicality. SkipDecode overcomes these constraints by enabling each token in a batch to exit independently at each sequence position, ensuring a monotonically decreasing exit point. This approach prioritizes computational resources on upper layers, allowing later tokens to benefit from earlier token computations. Experimental results demonstrate that SkipDecode achieves significant inference speedups (2x to 5x) across various tasks and LLM model sizes while maintaining negligible performance regression. This approach not only supports batch processing and KV caching but also identifies the saturation point of hidden states, contributing to a more efficient and sustainable AI ecosystem.

### Strengths
* **S.1.** The paper is well written and the illustrations are informative.
* **S.2.** The SkipDecode algorithm is novel, effective and compatible with many existing inference optimization techniques.
* **S.3.** The SkipDecode algorithm outperforms previous algorithms and is evaluated on several datasets with two different LLM sizes.
* **S.4.** The SkipDecode algorithm shows promising speedups and the paper clearly states its limitations.

### Weaknesses
 * **W.1.** The experiments are conducted solely on a single neural architecture. Providing results on other neural architectures (such as ENcoder-Decoder) would help.
* **W.2.** The SkipDecode algorithm is compared to a single algorithm and the provided results are limited. While the SkipDecode algorithm was evaluated on three different datasets with three different evaluation metrics on each, the comparison evaluation includes only two different datasets with a single metric for each dataset. Adding more comparison results would help.
* **W.3.** The paper was easy to follow, however, I find some information missing. Addressing my questions would improve my score.

### Questions
* **Q.1.** How are the min_exit_layer and max_exit_layer chosen?
* **Q.2.** What is the degradation of quality of using batch-wise exit-point function instead of a per example-wise?
* **Q.3.** What is the gain of using Skipping instead of Early-Termination? If the function is monotonic decreasing wouldn't that solve the problem for Early-Termination?
* **Q.4.** How is the speed-up and quality affected by the sequence-length hyperparameter? Why was is chosen to be the median? How would this work in a general chat-bot fashion where the generated sequence length can largely vary?
* **Q.5.** Do the speedups include the prompt computation time?
