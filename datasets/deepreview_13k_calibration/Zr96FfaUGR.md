## Abstract
We introduce the task of automatically revising scientific papers based on peer feedback and release \dataset{}, a dataset of review comments and their corresponding paper edits.  The data is drawn from real reviewer-author interactions from computer science, and we provide labels linking each reviewer comment to the specific paper edits made by the author in response.
    We automatically create a high-precision silver training set, as well as an expert-labeled test set that shows high inter-annotator agreement.
In experiments with 10 models covering the state of the art, we find that they struggle even to identify which edits correspond to a comment—especially when the relationship between the edit and the comment is indirect and requires reasoning to uncover.  We also extensively analyze GPT-4’s ability to generate edits given a comment and the original paper.  We find that it often succeeds on a superficial level, but tends to rigidly follow the wording of the feedback rather than the underlying intent, and lacks technical details compared to human-written edits.

### Summary
This paper introduces a new data set named ARIES with scientific reviews, where each comment is matched to a paper edit. This data set could be used to detect which edits correspond to the request and for an edit generation from comment task. The data set consists of 196 human annotations across 42 reviews, judgements if statements are actionable and 3900 comments automatically matched with high precision and low recall. The paper present several approaches to align comments to edits and studies GPT-4 for generating the edits.

### Strengths
Good annotation task setup and agreement metrics obtained on these annotations.

### Weaknesses
The data set that is manually annotated is small (196 annotations across 42 reviews) and may not be diverse enough.

The generation task setup is very challenging and includes multiple aspect that would not be available to a predictive model: the context of research at that point, historical information that may be relevant or the goals of the authors which for example would not like to admit a weakness in their publication. Because of this, I think potential applications and extensions would be important to mention.

Experiments in Section 5 require more information about how the models were trained, especially how the negatives are selected. The results currently show better results on Macro F1 for the non fine-tuned model, and worse results when using cross-encoders as compared to bi-encoders, which is unintuitive and looks quite suspicious. Another detail that needs to be mentioned are how the units of text that are matched are computed (a sentence, a paragraph?)

There are several key assumption made in the data set construction that I think should be better highlighted or organized, such as that responses can be presented in the forum rather than in edits to the paper.

The experiments in section 6 are only performed using an off the shelf GPT model.

### Summary
The paper introduces the challenging task of revising scientific papers based on peer feedback. The authors present ARIES, a valuable dataset of review comments and corresponding paper edits, to facilitate training and evaluation of models. The study focuses on two subtasks: comment-edit alignment and edit generation. Experiments reveal that existing models, including GPT-4, struggle with these tasks. While GPT-4 can generate edits on a surface level, it rigidly follows the wording of feedback rather than capturing the underlying intent and tends to include fewer technical details than human-written edits. The findings suggest the need for further research in this area, emphasizing the complexities of reasoning about scientific text and addressing challenges in aligning feedback to edits and generating meaningful revisions.

### Strengths
+ Automatically revising scientific papers based on peer feedback is a meaningful task. Decomposing the task into comment-edit alignment and edit generation is well-motivated.

+ The constructed ARIES dataset has its great practical values in improving NLP systems for not only scientific paper revision tasks but also other tasks during the peer review process.

+ The empirical analyses are comprehensive, with meaningful case studies and error analyses. Different model architectures (BM25, BERT, GPT-4; bi-encoder, cross-encoder) are examined. In particular, the observations of GPT-4's performance on edit generation are inspiring.

### Weaknesses
- The technical novelty is somehow limited, although I understand that the main contribution of this submission is on the dataset and benchmark. All compared approaches are existing models. After the authors obtain meaningful observations from empirical studies, they do not further design an effective method based on their observations to achieve better performance.

- This may be a common criticism for any paper showing that LLMs do not perform well on a certain task: It is possible that the poor performance of GPT-4 is due to inappropriate instructions or prompts. More analyses are needed on the effect of instructions. For example, if chain-of-thoughts prompting is used, would GPT-4 generate "deeper" edits?

### Questions
- Could you try chain-of-thoughts prompting or other more advanced techniques to see whether the performance of GPT-4 can be improved?

- I would suggest directly writing "SPECTER2" rather than "SPECTER" in Table 1. Also, could you specify which adapter is used for SPECTER2?

- The following reference may be very relevant to this paper, considering using GPT-4 for writing peer reviews.

### Summary
This paper presents newly constructed data of review comments and their corresponding edit parts in the original and revised versions of scientific papers taken from OpenReview. They introduced two tasks related to this corpus data: The comment-edit alignment task is to identify the correspondence between a comment and an edit, and the edit generation task is to generate an edit given a reviewer's comment.
For the former task, they applied a number of binary classification models, evaluated the results, and discussed the causes of errors. For the latter task, they applied GPT-4 to generate edit responses given a comment, and evaluated and discussed the difference between human and GPT-4 generated edit responses.

### Strengths
- The paper provides unique data that includes reviewers' comments on scientific papers and their corresponding edits obtained from the original and revised versions of the papers.
- They applied a recent generative language model, GPT-4, to tackle two problems they defined, comment-edit alignment and edit generation tasks, and gave a detailed analysis of the results.

### Weaknesses
 - The motivation and the usefulness of the proposed tasks are not clear. For the first task, comment-edit alignment, there are a number of papers that require the authors' answer letter to the editors that describe how the authors have responded to each of the comments raised by the reviewers. For such journal papers, there is no need to find correspondence between the edited parts of the revision. The second task is more puzzling. As the authors claim, GPT-4 often addresses responses on a superficial level without including technical details. It is totally unclear why such superficial or pretending responses are necessary.
- Even though the comment-edit alignment task is a binary classification task, the overall results are very low, much lower than 50%, which may imply that this data or this task is an ill-formed one.
- The details of the data construction and the task description are not understandable without referring to appendices.

### Questions
- Why are the results of micro scores for the comment-edit alignment so low, even though it is a binary classification task? What is the proportion between the positive and negative pairs, and what scores will be obtained under random guess?
- In the macro evaluation, what is the reason that F1 scores are lower than both precision and recall? How are those F1 scores calculated?
- According to the precision and recall scores for the macro evaluation, the performance of BM25 looks better than or at least competitive with those of GPT-4 multi-edit. It would be better to discuss the differences between the results of those models.
- What is the motivation behind setting the edit generation task? This looks to be an unanswerable question by other than the authors. The motivation as well as the usefulness of the task should be described.

### Confidence
3: You are fairly confident in your assessment. It is possible that you did not understand some parts of the submission or that you are unfamiliar with some pieces of related work. Math/other details were not carefully checked.

### Summary
This presents a dataset of paper review comments aligned to paper edits. It extracts an "edits" set somewhat cleverly by just getting different paper versions from openreview, doing pdf-parsing, and looking at differences, and then compares those changes to comments in reviews of the paper to detect when changes seem to be entailed by a specific change in the paper.   They provided a small dataset of full manual alignment between those edits and the reviews and a larger low-recall high-precision automatically evaluated dataset using an additional signal from rebuttals. Models are then presented both for generating those edits in response to review comments and for locating them within a text.

### Strengths
- The biggest strength is that this paper provides an extensive analysis of the contours of their task and analysis of the underlying phenomena.   
-They treat the task with relevant amounts of delicacy, by being very explicit about models lacking the lab notes/data to make many of these edits and doing labeling of actionability to study the issue. This adds nuance to what might otherwise be a problematic task with factuality issues. 
- The model work on comment-edit alignment seems relatively rigorous, using domain-relevant models like SPECTRE2.

### Weaknesses
1) The core manual data is very tiny (196 alignments, 42 reviews total) and so some of the value of the dataset really rests on the quality of the synthetic alignment work detailed in A.5. It's unclear if the synthetic data captures the full complexity of the task, especially given the limited size of the manual dataset used to generate it.
2) It's hard to have a good intuition about the quality of their IAA with Jaccard overlap of 65% in the reviews, but it does call into question whether the segmentation/identification of relevant review comments is clear.  Insofar as there is the whole field of peer review segmentation and typing  (e.g. Xua et al. 2021, Cheng et al. 2021, Kennard et al. 2021, Dycke et al. 2023), it might be worth checking if any of that is relevant for use (some of those may also be relevant to the analysis types). The relatively low Jaccard overlap suggests there may be significant ambiguity in what constitutes a relevant comment, which could impact the reliability of both the manual and synthetic datasets.

### Questions
I appreciated the "action class" analysis the authors provided over the manual data, and am curious whether there is data (or even impressions) regarding whether that distribution of types is actually the same in the synthetic data. Wouldn't some types of actions be more likely to have their corresponding edits repeated in the rebuttal (e.g., explain) and some types very unlikely to be repeated in the rebuttal (e.g., remove)? 
If this is envisioned as part of a workflow, does it really make sense for the model to be freely determining in effect whether to comply, disagree, make promises, etc.?  Wouldn't those components ideally make sense as a starting assumption for an edit?
