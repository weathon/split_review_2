## Abstract
Proteins, central to biological systems, are complex due to interactions between sequences, structures, and functions shaped by physics and evolution, posing a challenge for accurate function prediction. Recent advancements in deep learning techniques demonstrate substantial potential for precise function prediction through learning representations from extensive protein sequences and structures. Nevertheless, practical function annotation heavily relies on modeling protein similarity using sequence or structure retrieval tools, given their accuracy and interpretability. To study the effect of inter-protein similarity modeling, in this paper, we comprehensively benchmark the retriever-based methods against predictors on protein function tasks, demonstrating the potency of retriever-based approaches. Inspired by these findings, we introduce an innovative variational pseudo-likelihood framework, ProtIR, designed to improve function prediction through iterative refinement between predictors and retrievers. ProtIR combines the strengths of both predictors and retrievers, showcasing an around 10% improvement over vanilla predictor-based methods. Furthermore, it achieves comparable performance to the state-of-the-art protein language model-based methods with significantly smaller training time, highlighting the efficacy of our approach.

### Summary
This paper proposes a new framework that can perform iterative refinement to improve the performance of predictor-based algorithm for annotating proteins' function. The main concept is to utilize EM algorithm to train both the predictor and the retriever. The authors have conducted experiments on four representative benchmarks and show that their framework is effective.

### Strengths
- The framework is equipped with mathematical foundation and its effectiveness can be theoretically understood. 
- Understanding the function of unseen proteins is a really important task in protein engineering and other biological aplications.

### Weaknesses
One significant drawback of this paper is that it doesn't compare its approach to recent standard methods. This makes it difficult to understand where this new method fits in the existing research. Although the paper is in the field of functional annotation, which has a lot of existing research, the authors did not discuss relevant works. Here is a list of some papers that focus on predicting EC numbers, just to give the authors an idea:

Enzyme function prediction using contrastive learning

Deep networks for protein functional inference

ECPred: a tool for the prediction of the enzymatic functions of protein sequences based on the EC nomenclature

Deep learning enables high-quality and high-throughput prediction of enzyme commission numbers

It is important for the authors to do a fair comparison with these existing methods so that people can understand how valuable their new technique is.

------

The title of Section 5.2 should be revised to accurately reflect its content, as it encompasses benchmarking of predictor-based methods alongside other topics.

------

The impression conveyed by Table 1 is that predictor-based methods are unquestionably the superior choice for functional prediction. I fail to see evidence to support the claim "retriever-based methods show promise, enabling accurate function prediction without massive pre-training". In all evaluated tasks, predictor-based approaches with pre-training consistently outperform retriever-based methods by substantial margins.

------

The subsection titled 'Predictors vs. Retrievers' in Section 5.2 lacks clarity and fairness in its comparison. The comparison is skewed because retriever-based models like GearNet and CDConv leverage structural information that is not utilized by their predictor-based counterparts.

------

It is a time-consuming process for me to correlate Table 2 with Table 1 in order to assess the effectiveness of the proposed technique. It appears that the ProtIR framework may enhance predictor-based performance; however, the authors have not opted to demonstrate this in comparison to the best predictor-based method. Is there a particular rationale behind this choice?

------

Although Section 5.4 is intriguing, it appears to have a somewhat weak connection to the primary focus of this research.

### Summary
Summary.

The paper is dedicated to developing approaches for protein function prediction. The authors first benchmark the retriever-based methods and predictors on protein function tasks. They further introduce EM algorithms to enable an iterative refinement between predictors and retrievers, which is called ProtIR. They show great improvements over vanilla predictor-based methods and comparable performance with protein language model-based methods.

### Strengths
Pros.

1. The paper is well-written and easy to follow.
2. The EM design is an interesting way to improve predictor and retriever.
3. Multiple levels of sequence similarity are considered during the empirical investigations.

### Weaknesses
Cons.

1. Missing important baseline and citation. "Enzyme function prediction using contrastive learning" is a recent Science paper about retrieval-based predictors for protein functions.
2. Missing the ensemble baseline. If a simple ensemble of predictor and retriever can achieve a good performance, then there is no need to do iterative refinement between predictor and retriever. 
3. Missing evaluations on realistic datasets, which are referred to paper "Enzyme function prediction using contrastive learning".
4. The key advantage of retriever-based methods is the capability to annotate unseen proteins or unseen functionality. Investigations are needed to support the effectiveness of the proposed methods.
5. Beyond existing protein encoders, there are no specific biological designs for protein function annotation problems. More problem-specific characteristics like the tree structure of go terms should be considered in the modeling.
6. For the experiments, multiple runs are needed to showcase the prediction stability.

### Summary
The paper studies protein function prediction, with a focus on the comparison between predictor-based and retriever-based methods. The authors introduce ProtIR, a transductive learning approach that iteratively refines an encoder and a predictor neural network. The experimental results first provide a comparison of a number of predictor-based and retriever-based approaches on EC and GO function prediction tasks. Then, they show that ProtIR results in an increased accuracy compared to the predictor-based baseline and three transductive learning baselines.

### Strengths
+ For the most part, the paper is well written and successful in motivating the research
+ The proposed approach is reasonable and mathematically described in sufficient detail
+ The results indicate that the proposed approach is beneficial
+ Benchmarking of numerous baseline approaches is a bonus in this paper

### Weaknesses
 - unfortunately, the paper becomes difficult to follow when it comes to technical details.
-- Other than mentioning in one sentence in section 2.3 that encoder are pre-trained on the fold classification task with 16,712 proteins with 1,195 different folds, data sets are not specified anywhere in the paper. What data set you had available for EC and GO training and testing?
-- ProtIR iterates between the encoder model and prediction model fine-tuning steps. But, without knowing on what data this happens and what is the relationship between training and test data, it is difficult to imagine what is happening in the experiments. For example, is are fold classification and protein function data sets coming from different distributions? If so, what is the consequence on the experimental results?
-- the paper is vague when it comes to what neural networks are used as encoder model and predictor model. Only deep into the experimental sections it becomes clear that the same neural network (GerNet or CDConv) is used for both. But, does that mean that there are two copies of the neural net -- one serving as an encoder and another as a predictor?
-- the paper is inconsistent when it comes to explaining hyperparameters for the experiments
- using the structure encoders is a major limitation of this approach because it is only applicable on proteins with known structure. Proteins with known structure are a highly biased sample of the protein space and are typically well studied with a good understanding of their functional properties. This, the usefulness of proposed approach is limited

### Questions
The main weakness of the paper is that technical details about the implementation of the proposed method and the details about the data set and the experimental design are unclear. Without this, the readers need to hope that the code that was promised (upon acceptance of the paper) will be documented well enough to explain the missing details.

### Summary
In this paper, the authors focus on protein function prediction problem, and propose a variational pseudo-likelihood framework ProtIR, which conducts iterative refinement between predictors and retrievers to improve protein function prediction performance. It utilizes EM algorithm to optimize the function predictors and retrievers to integrate the advantages of the two models. The experimental results prove the effectiveness of the proposed method.

### Strengths
1. This paper comprehensively discusses the performance of methods based on predictors and retrievers, and proposes a novel iterative refinement framework to integrate the two models.
2. The proposed method achieves better performance compared to predictor-based methods and
 improves efficiency compared to protein language model-based methods. 
3. This paper conducts comprehensive experiments to prove the performance and efficiency of the proposed method.

### Weaknesses
1. In the experimental section, the authors mainly present the experimental results, but the analysis is not sufficient. The discussion lacks a deeper dive into the implications of the results, particularly regarding the observed trends and any potential limitations of the proposed method under different conditions. For example, it would be beneficial to see an analysis of performance across different functional classes or a discussion of cases where the method performs poorly.
2. In the method section, the definitions of some symbols in this paper are not clear, and in the experiments section, the description of the datasets is not sufficient. Specifically, the representation of protein x and how sequence and structural information are integrated needs more clarity. Additionally, details about the datasets such as the number of proteins, class distributions, and the source of the data are missing, which makes it difficult to assess the generalizability of the results.
3. The authors emphasize the improvement of computational efficiency, but in the experiment, the authors only provided a rough explanation and did not provide specific improvement results. It would be beneficial to see a detailed comparison of the training and inference time with the baseline methods, including a breakdown of the computational cost for different components of the proposed method, such as the predictor and retriever.

### Questions
1. In the first paragraph of the section 2.1, how is the representation of protein x defined? How are the sequence and structural information of proteins integrated?
2. In the last paragraph of the section 2.3, there was no analysis of the setting of parameter τ. How the different settings of this parameter will affect performance?
3. In the section 3.3 on page 4, what is the meaning of const in the formula? The authors did not provide an explanation.
4. In the experiments section, have the results in Tables 1, 2, and 3 been verified for statistical significance?
5. The authors should improve the standardization of the paper. For example: (1) In the section 3.3, the label of the first formula is missing. (2) In Figure 2 of the section 5.3, the labels for the axes are missing.

### Summary
This paper begins by benchmarking various methods for protein function annotation (specifically, enzyme classification and GO term prediction).  The paper segregates methods into two categories, nearest-neighbor techniques ("retriever-based methods") and standard classification algorithms ("predictor-based methods").  It then introduces a new method, ProtIR, that uses an EM-like algorithm to alternate between retrieval and prediction.  Empirical results suggest that this approach improves upon the state of the art.

### Strengths
The paper addresses an important and longstanding problem, and it appears to provide a significant improvement in classification accuracy relative to the state of the art.

The ProtIR method is elegant and well described.

The ablation experiments help to convince me that the results are legitimate.

The proposed method is much cheaper than pretraining a large language model.

### Weaknesses
Please cite the original BLAST publication (Altschul 1990) rather than the 2004 paper cited here. It is not correct to say that BLAST operates "under the assumption that proteins with similar sequences likely posess similar functions." BLAST has nothing to do with functional inference, per se. It identifies evolutionary relationships.

I found retriever/predictor terminology confusing at first. Please define these terms explicitly.

I was concerned by the baseline method proposed in Section 2.2. BLAST is a fast heuristic approximation of the Smith-Waterman DP algorithm. But even SW is not as good at detecting homologies as more advanced methods that rely on profile-profile alignment (e.g., HHPred/HHSearch). Indeed, even PSI-BLAST (which is part of the BLAST package) is better than BLAST. So I can't help but wonder why BLAST is being used here. It's also not at all clear to me that Equation 2 represents a smart way to use BLAST. Indeed, one of BLAST's strengths is its statistical confidence estimation procedure. As such, treating the BLAST output as an uncalibrated score and then doing ad hoc normalization seems like a bad idea.

The related work is almost comically dense, as is unfortunately required by this conference format. But the upshot is that it's very difficult to get a sense for where you think ProtIR falls in terms of novelty relative to all of these prior methods. The final sentences of the second and third paragraphs are the only hints along these lines. Rather than a laundry list of existing methods, I'd prefer that you cite a couple of reviews and then use the space to explain how your method relates to the state of the art.

I found it striking that almost all of the related work is from the last few years. In fact, people have been working hard on this problem for decades. See, e.g., Melvin PLOS CB 2011 for a retriever-based method that operates on protein embeddings using sequence and structure. Or see work by JP Vert on kernels for protein sequence similarity. This review might be a good place to get a sense for the long history in this general area: https://academic.oup.com/bib/article/19/2/231/2562645

Minor: typo "orignial": "v.s." -> "vs."

### Questions
What are the two or three most closely related prior methods for solving this problem, and how does your method differ from them?

Have you explored using alternatives to BLAST as your retriever?

Why did you use the alignment score rather than the E-value from BLAST?

### Summary
The paper evaluates and compares sequence- and structure-based methods against predictors for protein function annotation. It demonstrates that retriever methods perform similarly to predictor-based methods. Next, it introduces an iterative training strategy that alternates between a retriever and a predictor to enhance predictive performance. This approach shows improvements in prediction accuracy and efficiency when compared to other methods

### Strengths
The paper is well written and easy to read.

The application of EM iterative algorithm to the problem of function prediction seems interesting and to have potential.
The same can be said of the framework proposed ProtIR

### Weaknesses
The paper is not self-contained.

The paper lacks a dataset section. While the paper mentions the use of some datasets, they are never adequately described. For example, how many proteins are included, and where were they obtained from? The description of the tasks is also lacking; they are only briefly covered in section 5.1.

The evaluation procedure is not adequately described in the paper. There is no explanation of how the training and test sets are obtained, or what kind of evaluation is performed.

The paper claims that their approach reduces computational requirements while needing less running time, yet this is not supported by experiments or any comparisons to other methods. Additionally, it is difficult to properly judge the reported performance without knowing the size of the dataset used.

The paper uses inter-protein similarity to model and predict function, but it does not compare this approach to important and state-of-the-art methods that model inter-protein similarity. For instance:

Minor comments:

It would also be interesting to see the performance in terms of s min, which is normally used to evaluate function prediction.

The authors assume that there is independence between the function labels. This assumption does not hold for protein function prediction using GO terms. The authors should better justify why they make this design decision.

### Questions
In section 2, authors claim that "A notable advantage of these neural retrievers over traditional methods is their flexibility in fine-tuning for specific functions, as will discuss in next section". Is not clear to me where this is discussed or pointed, could you please elaborate this further?

### Summary
This manuscript presents a comparative study between deep learning predictors and retriever-based methods for protein function prediction. The authors have conducted a comprehensive benchmark to analyze the performance of each approach. By focusing on the role of inter-protein similarity modeling, the paper sheds light on the nuances of protein function prediction and attempts to bridge the gap between modern deep learning techniques and traditional retrieval tools.

### Strengths
- Empirical Results: The study reports strong empirical results, showcasing the effectiveness of both predictors and retriever-based methods in protein function prediction tasks.
- Clarity of Writing: The manuscript is well-written, presenting a clear and structured narrative that effectively communicates the research and findings to the reader.

### Weaknesses
 - Lack of Innovation: The paper appears to be an incremental work that combines predictive models with retriever-based methods without introducing significant methodological advancements or innovations.

- Theoretical Contribution: The manuscript could be improved by providing a deeper theoretical understanding or insights into why certain methods perform better and under what conditions each approach is preferable.

### Questions
- Innovation Clarification: The authors should clearly articulate any novel contributions of their work, particularly if there are innovative aspects beyond the combination of predictive and retriever-based methods.

- Theoretical Insights: A section discussing the theoretical implications of the findings would enrich the paper. This could include a discussion on the conditions under which each method excels or fails.

- Broader Impact and Ethical Considerations: The manuscript would benefit from a dedicated section on the broader impact and ethical implications of the research, particularly in the context of bioinformatics and potential applications in drug discovery.

- Compared to structure prediction, what's the most significance of function prediction of proteins?

- Is it feasible to integrate the methodology proposed in the manuscript with AlphaFold 2 to create an end-to-end system for protein function prediction？ Such integration could potentially harness the strengths of AlphaFold 2 in structural prediction and the comparative insights from the manuscript to offer a comprehensive solution for predicting protein functions. This could pave the way for more accurate and holistic predictions, significantly benefiting fields such as drug discovery, disease understanding, and synthetic biology.

### Summary
This paper studies protein function prediction by combining 2 established methods. The first being "retriever based methods" which retrieve proteins similar to a query protein and infer similar protein function, the second is "preditcion" methods that learn to predict the protein function directly from labelled data.
Retriever based models produce a representation for each protein that can be used to generate a similarity score between two proteins.
Function prediction models output a binary vector where each dimension represents a particular functional property. Function prediction models are (initially) trained on limited labelled data.

They use a training scheme that refines both methods in an iterative EM process. In several rounds they first fix the retriever model and use it to predict labels to refine the function predictor model (their E step), then the fix the function predictor model and finetune the retriever model using labels from the predictor as "pseudo labels" (the M step).
Several rounds of the EM process produces both prediction and retriever models that have better accuracy that the original model by a significant margin in their evaluation.
It is the use of labels for function prediction that are expected to help finetune the similarity (retriever) model.

### Strengths
The iterative EM training approach is reasonable, a form of distillation (or label propagation between two models)
Using the strengths of both models to enhance each other works.
It is a well written and thorough read with a "good sized" evaluation.
The reported results are significant improvements.

### Weaknesses
I would worry about robustness to changes in hyperparameters for the EM finetuning process (eg. epoch size learning rate etc.).
The method does depend on the idea that both pretrained models are able to give sufficiently accurate supervision to the other not to misguide, and that they have complimentary and transferable abilities. But in this case it does work, and so one could say the method works.

### Questions
How much do you think this method (iterative refinement between similarity and classification models) do you think is general? What other kinds of data might it extend to? Are there similar examples in other domains?
