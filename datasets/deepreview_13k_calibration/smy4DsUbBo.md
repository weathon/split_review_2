## Abstract
Lattices are architected metamaterials whose properties strongly depend on their geometrical design.
The analogy between lattices and graphs enables the use of
graph neural networks (GNNs) as a faster surrogate model compared to traditional methods such as finite element modelling.
In this work, we generate a big dataset of structure-property relationships for strut-based lattices.
The dataset is made available to the community which can fuel the development 
of methods anchored in physical principles for the fitting of fourth-order tensors.
In addition, we present a higher-order GNN model trained on this dataset.
The key features of the model are 
\begin{enumerate*}[label=(\roman*)]
    \item \textit{SE(3) equivariance},
    and
    \item consistency with the thermodynamic law of \textit{conservation of energy}.
\end{enumerate*}
We compare the model to non-equivariant models based on a number of error metrics and demonstrate its benefits in terms of predictive performance and reduced training requirements.
Finally, we demonstrate an example application of the model to an architected material design task.
The methods which we developed are applicable to fourth-order tensors beyond elasticity such as piezo-optical tensor etc.

### Summary
This paper proposes an application of equivariant GNNs for predicting the stiffness tensor of architected lattice metamaterials. To ensure the validity of physical significance, a layer is proposed to preserve the positive semi-definiteness of the predicted stiffness.

### Strengths
1.	There is less work focused on studying higher-order tensors beyond first-order tensors, such as coordinates, velocity, and force. Research on a 4th-order tensor represents a new situation for application.
2.	This paper try to design a new module to ensure the validity of physical significance, which is inspiring. 
3.	The figures are pretty.

### Weaknesses
1.	This work chooses to predict a 4-th ordered tensor – “stiffness tensor”, whose symmetry has been maintain well with existing models like TFN, PAINN. This paper does not propose theoretical innovations in maintaining equivariance, so this methodology and the emphasis on “fourth-order” in abstract are not directly related (the Positive Semi-Definite Layer is based on physical meaning, regardless of whether it is a fourth-order tensor).
2.	Since the whole backbone is built with existing MACE layer, the main novelty is to propose the  “Positive Semi-Definite Layer”(let us call it “PSD-layer”). About this, here are some questions:
    - a) To maintain the equivariance of the total model, we must ensure each layer in such a model is equivariant. But for the PSD-layer, the PSD matrix $A$ is based on $M$, which is created by arrange $n(n+1)/2$ entries of the output of an equivariant model.
        - **i**. Is it an equivariant operator to arrange $n(n+1)/2$ entries to get $M$?  This requires a formal mathematical proof. The specific arrangement of these entries into the matrix $M$ is not clearly defined, and different arrangements could lead to different transformation properties under rotation. The lack of a formal proof makes it difficult to assess the equivariance of this step.
        - **ii**. Is it an equivalent operator of the function $ho$ to turn $M$ into $A$? In the end of Section A.2.2, “If the overall model had been equivariant with respect to vectors in $U$, it will remain equivariant after eigenvalues are made positive” is not trivail, it may also require a formal mathematical proof. The transformation $ho$ involves eigenvalue decomposition and subsequent manipulation. While the eigenvalues themselves are invariant under rotation, the eigenvectors are not. The process of making eigenvalues positive and reconstructing the matrix might not preserve equivariance, and this requires a rigorous proof.
         - **iii**. For now, we assume that the previous question (function $\rho$ is equivariant) has a good proof. It is necessary to discuss whether this design will reduce the representational capacity of the entire neural network. Assume that this neural network is a bijection (we consider an equivalence class divided based on different perspectives as an input. But the function $\rho$ may not a bijection, e.g. $(\pm \Lambda) ^2$ will get a same result. The Wigner-D based network build a faith representation of the group, but the induction of function $rho$ will lead to an unfaith representation, it requires more analysis. For example,  an analysis for the increased stiffness-based errors of CGC+ve, NNConv+ve, and MACE+ve in Table 1 may be a manifestation of the decline in the ability of network representation.
    - b) Let assume the PSD-layer is equivariant, there are some questions about the experiments:
        - **i**. In Section 3 (Related Work) and Section 5(Conclusion), Finite element (FE) modelling is mentioned, but the experiment could not find the data comparison (e.g. time cost or accuracy) between your model and FE. A direct comparison of computational cost and accuracy with FE methods is essential to demonstrate the practical advantages of the proposed approach. Without this, it is difficult to assess the real-world applicability of the method.
        - **ii**. More powerful baselines should be discussed, especially the geometric GNNs like TFN[1], NequIP [2], SCN[3], GMN[4], SE(3)-Transformer [5]. The current baselines are not sufficient to demonstrate the competitiveness of the proposed method. A comparison with state-of-the-art geometric GNNs is necessary to establish the novelty and performance of this work.
3.	Here are some possible typos and recommended symbol modifications:
    - a) Almost all the inline formulas in the article lack punctuation at the end.
    - b) In Section 2.1, the rotation of the stiffness tensor $R_{ia}R_{jb}C_{abcd}R_{kc}R_{ld}$ may be better to generalize to $n$-th order tensors with the format of changing bases of a tensor($ R_{ia}R_{jb} R_{kc}R_{ld} C_{abcd}$).
    - c) In Eq. (2),  the Wigner-D matrix generally written in the form $D_{m’,m}^{(l)}(R)$.
    - d) In Section 4, the third line in the paragraph “Positive Semi-Definite Layer”, “in line wih”, may be “in line with”.

### Summary
This paper introduces higher-order energy-conserving SE(3) equivariant GNNs which build upon the MACE architecture. These GNNs are applied to lattices, i.e. architected metamaterials. The new features of the model are conservation of energy and SE(3) equivariant predictions of the a 4th order stiffness tensor.  For the stiffness tensor positive-definiteness is ensured. Experiments compare against existing deep learning models of Crystal Graph Convolution (CGC) and NNConv.

### Strengths
- This paper introduces a novel and very interesting application of SE(3) equivariant GNNs.
- Positive semi-definiteness of stiffness tensor is a interesting new tool for physics-based machine learning.
- The paper contains all important information to follow (general physics background, no material-design expert).
- The evaluation scheme is quite solid and the different training methods are sound.

### Weaknesses
 - It seems that most of the important information which is novel to the deep learning community is put into the appendix. For example, definitions of stress and strain tensors, or their relation to the stiffness tensor. Even more importantly, only in the appendix one can read why the stiffness tensor can be represented as a matrix, and how the positive definiteness of a matrix can be ensured. 
- On the other hand, background and related work are a bit repetitive
- Code / or pseudocode would be pretty helpful to understand output layers and how the stiffness tensor is ensembled.
- There are no runtime comparisons in the paper, especially since e3nn based models are known to be slow this would be interesting to know.
- Related to runtime comparisons, comparisons to FE methods are needed to get a better understanding of the presented performances. I understand that FE models are used as ground truth and that this might be tricky to obtain, but for example one could estimate runtime comparisons (especially since it is stated the FE methods are very slow) and report performance differences for nodal perturbations to get a perspective for the reported loss values? The latter should give a feeling to what nodal perturbations the presented losses are comparable. 
- As far as I can see there is no OOD experiments although this is claimed to be one of the main reasons why such models built on physical principles are built.

### Questions
- When exactly is the positive semi-definite layer applied? after the readout?
- In Figure 2 validation loss of CGC+tr seems to be still dropping sharply, is it possible that training was stopped too early?

### Summary
This paper introduces a specially design graph neural network that well tackles the physical constraints in lattice architected metamaterials. To be specific, the model guarantees by design SE(3)-equivariance and energy conservation. The latter is fulfilled by the proposed positive semi-definite layer that overcomes the limits of previously proposed approaches using Cholesky factorization and eigenvalue decomposition. The model is examined on a dataset ``limp'' showcasing that MACE is superior when equipped with the proposed PSD layer.

Update: contribution raised from fair to good, overall score raised from 3 to 5 due to additional experiments on material design.

### Strengths
1. The motivation of the paper is clear: designing a GNN that fulfills the inductive biases for lattice architected metamaterials.

2. The proposed approach is clean and easy to follow.

### Weaknesses
1. The novelty is somewhat limited in the sense that the proposed model is a direct utilization of MACE, equipped with the proposed layer that satisfies PSD.

2. The dataset is a bit limited and the experiments lack of comparison with other methods. If there are no significant deep learning based (or even GNN-based) methods to compare, it would also help a lot if any FE-based method could be involved. The readers may be curious about how the proposed model can achieve better accuracy/efficiency tradeoff compared with traditional solvers.

3. The implication of the practical usage of the method is limited. Since this paper is developed purely based on practical considerations, it would be better if the paper could show how this model can help in other related/similar tasks or downstream tasks that could potentially benefit from this method., other than just predict the stiffness tensor.

### Questions
1. How does the method perform compared with other solvers, deep learning-based or even not?

2. Are there other tasks/datasets that can benefit from the development of such GNN-based method that is specifically designed to regress on the stiffness?

3. Even if the paper discusses the limitations of previous Cholesky/eigenvalue decomposition-based methods that permit PSD constraint, it would help a lot if this point is also verified by experimental results/ablation studies.

### Summary
## Summary

The paper presents an extension to the [MACE](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2022/file/4a36c3c51af11ed9f34615b81edb5bbc-Paper-Conference.pdf) model by adding a matrix power layer to ensure the positive semidefinite (PSD) nature of the output tensor. Although the idea of maintaining PSD properties might be of value, the paper's contributions are incremental at best. Most notably, the claim about "high-order rotational equivariance" is not an original contribution but belongs to the original MACE model. The paper severely suffers from a lack of organization and clarity in writing. Hence, I recommend a rejection of this submission.

## Detailed Comments

### 1. Lack of Definitions and Citations

a) The term "edge shifts" is used without a definition or reference.
b) The suffix 'lb' used in the context of training methods is not defined.
c) Clebsch–Gordan coefficients are mentioned without proper citation.
d) On page 17, there are numbers in parentheses next to "Young's modulus," "shear modulus," and "Poisson's ratio," without any explanation.

### 2. Unclear Illustrations and Descriptions

a) The paper claims that energy conservation equates to a PSD tensor, but this is tucked away in a footnote. This claim needs to be explained in the main text.
b) The choice of the optimal 've' method, which is squaring matrix A, is not mentioned until late in the results section. This should be mentioned in the methodology section.
c) Only absolute errors are presented without giving the context of ground truth magnitudes or relative errors. It's unclear for the readers to know if this method is accurate or not at all.
d) It's unclear if Figure 1b is a plot for ground truth or predictions.

### Flaws in Finite Element Method (FEM) Introduction

a) The paper mentions that FEM has "~10^9 elements" but does not state the computation time for such a scale. Furthermore, GNNs cannot handle such scales on a single GPU, making the comparison unfair. Instead, try to report a wall time comparison between your method and FEM for the same dataset.
b) The statement that FEM ensures force equilibrium is incorrect; it is the underlying PDE that ensures this.
c) Similarly, FEM itself does not ensure PSD properties; this is ensured by the constitutive model.
d) The paper incorrectly claims that FEM is rotationally equivariant. Special treatments are needed to achieve rotational equivariance in FEM.

## Conclusion

The paper presents an incremental extension to the MACE model with a focus on preserving the PSD properties of the output tensor. However, the paper lacks clarity in writing and organization, and its contributions are limited. As a result, I recommend a borderline reject for this submission.

The authors can also consider a workshop or journal submission that focuses on this area.
