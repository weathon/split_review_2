## Abstract
We address the challenge of structure learning from multivariate time series that are characterized by a sequence of different, unknown regimes. We introduce a new optimization-based method (CASTOR), that concurrently learns the Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) for each regime and determine the number of regimes along with their sequential arrangement. Through the optimization of a score function via an expectation maximization (EM) algorithm, CASTOR alternates between learning the regime indices (Expectation step) and inferring causal relationships in each regime (Maximization step). We further prove the identifiability of regimes and DAGs within the CASTOR framework. We conduct extensive experiments and show that our method consistently outperforms causal discovery models across various settings (linear and nonlinear causal relationships) and datasets (synthetic and real data).

### Summary
The paper presents a framework, called CASTOR, for causal discovery in heterogeneous time-series data across multiple regimes, each characterized by distinct causal graphs and functional relationships. The authors propose a combination of the EM algorithm with temporal structural equation models (SEMs) to simultaneously infer regime, causal graphs, and functional parameters. Theoretically, they demonstrate that by optimizing the proposed objective function, it is possible to recover the true regime and causal graphs, given certain assumptions hold. Empirically, the approach is validated through two synthetic experiments and application to two real-world datasets, showcasing the effectiveness of the proposed method.

### Strengths
This paper proposed a methodology that fuses the EM algorithm with SEMs to deduce regimes, causal graphs, and functional relationships from observational time-series data. There are precedents in the literature, such as Rhino, which employs an EM-like algorithm for inferring graph distributions and this paper's formulation bears a resemblance to both Rhino and DYNOTEARS. The introduction of multiple regimes in this context, however, does provide a new dimension to the existing frameworks. Although the degree of originality may not be profound, it is nonetheless a meaningful contribution to the domain. On the significance front, the paper targets a problem of practical relevance, potentially offering valuable insights and tools to the community engaged in causal discovery within time-series analysis. I have briefly checked the proof, which seems to be ok but there are some typos in the appendix.

### Weaknesses
The primary weakness of the paper is in its presentation, particularly regarding the explication of the key contribution: the introduction of multiple regimes. More textual emphasis and clarity on the parametrization of the time-series model to account for these multiple regimes would be advantageous. For instance, the ordering of time partitions denoted by $u_1$ and $u_2$ remains unclear – should the time in $u_1$ consistently precede that in $u_2$? Moreover, the role and interpretation of $\gamma_{t,u}$ are ambiguous. If $\gamma_{t,u}$ serves as an indicator for time $t$'s association with partition $u$, its continuous nature as presented in Equation 11 raises questions about how to understand the defined likelihood $\log p(X_{0:T})$ defined above Equation 8. Specifically, the likelihood function seems to assume a discrete assignment of time points to regimes, while $\gamma_{t,u}$ is a continuous variable, which creates a mismatch in the formulation. A presentation from the perspective of variational inference might provide a more systematic and clearer framework, which could naturally elucidate derivations such as that of Equation 11.

Concerning empirical evaluations, the paper's baselines, namely VARLiNGaM and DYNOTEARS, do not represent the stronger baselines. Including stronger method, such as Rhino, could significantly enhance the demonstration of CASTOR's efficacy in regime inference. Matching or exceeding strong baselines would underscore CASTOR's advantages; alternatively, any performance gap would still furnish useful insights into the framework's relative standing and potential areas for enhancement. Furthermore, the current experimental setup does not thoroughly explore the non-linear settings, which is a crucial aspect for evaluating the robustness of the proposed method. The experiments should include a more comprehensive set of benchmarks, especially for non-linear data generation processes, to fully demonstrate the capabilities of CASTOR.

### Questions
1. I wonder how should I interpret the generation mechanism for the time across the regime boundaries? For example, if we have two partitions: ${0,1,2,3}$ and ${4,5,6,7}$ with lag $1$ and $3$ respectively. Then, how should I interpret the data generation at $t=4$? What is the corresponding graph and lag I should use? 

2. Do we assume the time in each partition always be smaller than the time in the later partitions?

3. How do you obtain eq.11? Is this the analytic solution from the E-step? 

4. In appendix, Eq.22, what is $p^{(l)}$?

5. In appendix, is the $\pi$ introduced in Theorem 2 that same as the $\pi$ in the main text? If not, please use a different notation. 

6. Missing equation number below Eq.22.

### Summary
The paper presents CASTOR, a new framework for uncovering causal relationships in heterogeneous time series data. Unlike existing methods, CASTOR can identify different regimes within the data and learn the associated temporal causal graphs. This is achieved by leveraging the EM algorithm. The method is validated through synthetic experiments and real-world benchmarks.

### Strengths
1. The paper considers an important problem.

2. The framework is general to handle both linear and non-linear relationships.

### Weaknesses
1. The proposed method lacks novelty by comparing it with the NOTEARS method and the related extensions. See references below. For example, why not consider the nonparametric version of NOTEARS in the DYNOTEARS framework? Can you explain why combining EM is the most efficient way to solve the problem?

2. In addition, why consider or focus on the score-based method? One can not call the learned DAG a causal graph based on such type of method due to the absence of scale invariance.

3. I am very confused by the term "heterogeneous time series" in this paper. I cannot find any rigorous definition related to it. The "heterogeneous" in causal inference usually connects to heterogeneity among different individuals described by some variables say confounders. Anyway, without a clear statement, please do not claim such a contribution.

4. An analysis of computational complexity is needed or at least running time should be provided. 

5. Many benchmark methods are missing for temporal causal graph learning. Please consider including at least methods mentioned in your related works.

6. Last but not least! The presentation needs substantial improvement. For example, one can find numerous flaws in Section 1. Please carefully check the citation formation and please do CAPITALIZE the first word in the sentence.

### Summary
This paper proposes a framework named CASTOR, which is able to learn causal relationships from heterogeneous time series data composed of various regimes without prior knowledge of regimes.

### Strengths
- This method is designed to learn causal relationships from heterogeneous time series data.
- This work proposes a regime detection method.

### Weaknesses
 - Theorem 1 states that each regime is identifiable, and thus the causal structure is also identifiable by giving the correct regime. However, the claim that the regime is identifiable is skeptical. For example, consider a simple normal mixture distribution with two components N(0,1) and N(0,2) (a degenerate case with two regimes), and this theorem seems to suggest that each sample can be identified whether from N(0,1) or N(0,2) which is clearly not true.
- Can you verify the identification of regimes with some extensive simulation study, especially for those that have distribution overlap in different regimes? For example, to show how is the accuracy in identifying the border (changed point) between two regimes.
- Moreover, is the number of regimes identifiable? How to choose the number of regimes.
- The task of identifying the regimes should also be related to the field of change point detection in time series which have not been comprehensively reviewed and compared with them.

### Summary
This paper tackles the following problem: given time series data that is mixed from multiple regimes, where the regime partition is unknown, the data in each single regime is generated by stationary additive noise temporal causal process, and the causal graphs in different regimes are different, the task is to recover the regime partition, and to learn the temporal causal graphs of each single regime.

This paper utilizes an EM method to maximize the data likelihood. Different from the original EM methods like (Zheng et al. 2018), this paper 1) introduces and learns an additional variable to model regime participation, and 2) allows nonlinear relationships by using neural networks like that in (Brouillard et al. 2020, Liu & Kuang 2023). The performance is validated on simulated and real-world datasets.

### Strengths
1. The technical derivations by using EM optimization to show the structure identifiability looks correct, though I didn't check the detailed proofs. The introduction of the regime participation variable is interesting.

2. The proposed method can handle instantaneous relations.

3. In experiments, the proposed method outperforms VARLiNGAM on each single regimes.

### Weaknesses
1. **The significance of the problem setting is unclear:**
   - It seems unnatural to assume that the time series data is from several mixed unknown regimes while within each regime the temporal causal relations are stationary. Could the authors give some motivative or real-world examples of this kind of datasets?
   - Usually it's more natural to think of nonstationarity in time series data as changing constantly but gradually, i.e., in the context of this paper, the regime partition is as fine as each single time stamp, while the causal relations (densities, edges weights) change smoothly across different time stamps.
   - Specifically, in this paper, by "time partition" (Definition 2), did the authors assume that each partition is a continent time series block? If yes, it should be stated clearly, instead of a vague "time partition"; if no, why, and any motivations? Also, did the authors assume/constrain any "similarities" between the causal graphs of different regimes?

2. **Even under this setting, the problem can already be well solved by existing methods:**
   - This paper mentions CD-NOD (Huang et al. 2020) but claims that "CD-NOD cannot infer individual causal graphs and necessitates prior knowledge about the number of regimes." But based upon my understanding on CD-NOD, this statement is generally incorrect, and the regime partition is actually readily obtainable from CD-NOD's abstract output.
   - By using the time stamp IDs as the surrogate variable, CD-NOD's phases I and II can output the abstract causal graph where the parents of each variable is identified as the union of all its parents in graphs from different regimes. Then, note that there is a phase III, kernel non-stationary visualization (Fig 12), which generally estimates the variability of the conditional distribution $p(Xi | union.parents(Xi))$ over the time index surrogate. The different regime partition is then readily available, i.e., the locations/times where changes happen are detected. Finally, with regimes recovered, any methods like PCMCI can be used in each stationary regime to obtain the graphs of each.
   - So what's the benefit of using the authors' proposed method than just using CD-NOD as above? Or please correct me if I am wrong regarding my understanding on CD-NOD or the problem.

3. **The parametric assumption is quite limited:**
   - The authors categorize the proposed CASTOR as score-based methods. Just for the convention, I would suggest to specify it as optimization-based methods (e.g., NOTEARS), to be distinguished from those real score-based methods, like GES.
   - Just like many existing optimization-based methods, this paper assume that the exogenous noise in the additive noise model follows a standard Gaussian distribution (namely, the uni/equal-variance assumption). This, however, is generally untestable and highly impractical in real-world scenarios. When the equal-variance assumption is violated, these optimization-based methods can perform relatively bad.
   - In this paper, is there any way to relax the uni/equal-variance assumption?

4. **The experimental comparisons are incomplete:**
   - The authors only provide experimental comparisons with stationary temporal causal discovery methods PWGC, VARLiNGAM, and DYNOTEARS. Moreover, the VARLiNGAM method is also misspecified for the non-Gaussian distributions.
   - More comprehensive comparisons are needed with at least some non-stationary temporal causal discovery methods, as well as the CD-NOD one discussed above.

5. **The presentation somewhat lacks clarity.**
   - What is the mixing coefficients $\pi_{t,u}(\alpha)$ in Eq.5? What is such $\alpha$? The readers are not expecting a choice of parameters (like the mentioned Same ́ et al. (2011)), but more from a definition perspective with physical meanings. E.g., in Eq.5, the mixing coefficients should be defined as something related to the regimes partition. Further parameter approximations are then introduced.
   - Why did the authors choose to spell out $Pa(<t)$ and $Pa(t)$ separately in expressions like Eq.2?
   - Question: does the proposed method output specific DAGs or equivalent classes? Since with instantaneous relations, usually the exact DAG is unidentifiable non-parametrically. Which is the critical factor that helps the exact identification in this method?
