## Abstract
Action abstraction is critical for solving imperfect information extensive-form games (IIEFGs) with large action spaces. However, due to the large number of states and high computational complexity in IIEFGs, existing methods often focus on using a fixed abstraction, which can result in sub-optimal performance. To tackle this issue, we propose a novel Markov Decision Process (MDP) formulation for finding the optimal (and possibly state-dependent) action abstraction. Specifically, the state of the MDP is defined as the public information of the game, each action is a feature vector representing a particular action abstraction, and the reward is defined as the expected value difference between the selected action abstraction and a default fixed action abstraction. Based on this MDP, we build a game tree with the  action abstraction selected by reinforcement learning (RL), and  solve for the optimal strategy based on counterfactual regret minimization (CFR). This two-phase framework, named RL-CFR, effectively trades off computational complexity (due to CFR) and performance improvement (due to RL) for IIEFGs, and offers a novel RL-guided action abstraction selection in CFR. To demonstrate the effectiveness of RL-CFR, we apply the method to solve Heads-up No-limit (HUNL) Texas Hold'em, a popular representative benchmark for IIEFGs. Our results show that RL-CFR defeats ReBeL, one of the best fixed action abstraction-based HUNL algorithms, and a strong HUNL agent Slumbot by significant win-rate margins $64\pm 11$ and $84\pm 17$ mbb/hand, respectively.

### Summary
This paper proposes a reinforcement-learning-based method for picking action abstractions in imperfect-information extensive-form games (IIEFGs) like poker. (Action abstraction is mainly applied to the game of poker, where it means choosing the "discretization" of bet sizes into somewhere around 1 to 5 bet sizes.)

This paper extends the depth-limited search method ReBeL which uses self-play to train public belief state (PBS) value nets. In this paper, the novel algorithm RL-CFR takes in a pretrained PBS value net from running standard ReBeL self-play training. RL-CFR then does its own self-play training loop to train an action-abstracter RL agent. The self-play training loop is like the ReBeL self-play training loop, but the RL agent is being trained, not the PBS value function. On each move during the self-play training loop, the RL agent picks the action abstraction that will be used to do search for that move. Then ReBeL search is performed for the search tree. ReBeL search is also performed for the search tree that uses a default action abstraction. For each of the two solved search trees, we get some equilibrium value for the turn player. The reward to the RL agent is the difference between those two values. 

The RL agent is implemented with a deep neural net. Experiments are performed with head-to-heads against a replication of ReBeL and against Slumbot 2019. Experiments are also performed with exploitability calculations on river endgames, compared against the replication of ReBeL. RL-CFR beats the ReBeL replication on all experiments.

### Strengths
The research direction is interesting: using RL to find action abstractions for EFG solving, especially depth-limited EFG solving. There hasn't been much research lately in action abstractions and this direction is (to my knowledge) a novel one that intuitively seems like a great idea.

The engineering effort involved in the experiments must have been rather large, and time-consuming. The experiments ran are all useful. The head-to-head experiments ran (Table 1) are good and not easy to do. The river endgame exploitability experiments are also good to know. The comparisons in Table 2 are also good.

The empirical results are strong.

The descriptions and pseudocode of the algorithm are not bad and are fairly clearly communicated for the most part.

### Weaknesses
 Clearly a lot of work has been put into this paper. Replicating ReBeL on NLHE alone is a major endeavor. Much engineering effort must have gone into implementing and training RL-CFR and evaluating it against ReBeL and Slumbot. The idea is fresh and the direction seems good, and the results are good. This paper deserves to be published.

However, as it is I am giving this paper a 5 (marginally below the acceptance threshold). I think the paper needs to be cleaned up a lot: the explanations are sometimes confusing, underspecified, or incorrect. In addition, the lack of a clearly stated objective (much less any theory showing that this work achieves the objective) means that this may not meet the bar for ICLR acceptance.

- The paper does not address any theory or optimality. Surely the resulting policy's relation to a Nash equilibrium is, if not a goal, at least an important question. I'm not saying that there needs to be theory saying that this will converge to a Nash equilibrium, but it should at least be mentioned in the paper. The paper mentions that the method here will lead to "performance improvement" (and obviously it's implicit in this paper that the goal is to get a better policy), but it's not described anywhere what this means or why this method will lead to it.

- In lieu of any **theory** showing that this method should lead to a stronger or more optimal policy, there should be some **intuition** for why this method would lead to a stronger or more optimal policy. However, there is none given in the paper. *In particular, I have no intuition for why the given definition of reward (Section 4, page 6) will lead to a better policy in the game.* (Yes, it's intuitive that one way to increase the root PBS value is by picking an action abstraction that lets the turn player compute a less-exploitable strategy. But another way to increase the root PBS value would be by picking an action abstraction that prevents the other player from computing a less-exploitable strategy. It seems we should only care about the former, not the latter. But might maximizing the latter interfere with maximizing the former?)
  - This method clearly seems to perform better, as per the experiment results. Can you speculate on why RL-CFR seems to do so much better?

- The abstract and introduction state that "RL-CFR defeats ReBeL, one of the best fixed action abstraction-based HUNL algorithms". Unfortunately, I think it would be more accurate to clarify that these head-to-head experiments were performed against a replication of ReBeL, since Table 1 shows that the replication achieves a lower head-to-head winrate against Slumbot than the ReBeL from Brown et al., 2020.

- The motivation for wanting to use RL in the Introduction doesn't really make sense to me. The motivation for using RL seems to be hinting towards wanting to use RL for the sake of using RL, rather than for some well-defined reason. I suppose this calls back to my earlier point: it's not clear what the goal is. Is the goal to create an agent that plays a lower-exploitability strategy (i.e. closer to Nash equilibrium)? Then how does the motivation in the Introduction ("Reinforcement learning has been shown to be a revolutionary method in many games") connect to this goal?
  - Similarly, phrasing elsewhere seems to imply that we have as a presupposed goal the desire to implement Deep RL somehow for IIEFGs. But why do we have this goal in the first place? See: Section 5 "It is important to note that applying the DRL approach to IIEFGs is highly nontrivial. The key challenge comes from the fact that one has to decide the action probability distributions for all information sets..." -- I don't get the point of this sentence (also, the "key challenge" isn't super clear to me).

- Section 4 (State): This section should clarify that the PBS to PS reduction is lossy. Indeed, while I think that defining state as the PBS satisfies the Markov assumption, I'm not so sure if PS as state does. If convergence or optimality were touched upon in this paper (they should be!) then this choice of PS rather than PBS may introduce a problem.

- The paper would benefit greatly from qualitative results showing examples of action abstractions chosen by the RL agent.


Minor:

- Section 3 (Public Belief State): "In general, a PBS is described by the joint probability distribution of the possible infostates of the players", but "PBS $\beta$" seems to be defined as the marginal probability distributions for each player. In poker, you can go from the marginal distributions to the joint distribution, but this is not always the case, right? If so, this should be clarified.

- Section 4 (MDP definition): The state, actions, and rewards are defined for this MDP, but as far as I can see, the state transitions are not defined anywhere. I can read between the lines and infer from Algorithm 1, but it would be much clearer if it were defined here.

Nitpicks / typos:

- Introduction typo: "may depends on" should be "may depend on"
- Introduction: "To tackle the above challenge" -- should it be "To tackle the above challenges"? As-is, it implies that RL-CFR tackles the problem of finding a Nash equilibrium in a game. However, ReBeL alone already solves this problem. With the plural "challenges" it would mean that RL-CFR tackles both the problem of finding the Nash equilibrium in a game, and also the problem of picking an action abstraction. Perhaps it would also be clearer to clarify that ReBeL alone already "handles the aforementioned mixed-strategy and probability-dependent reward issues".
- Introduction: "by significantly win-rate margins" should be "by significant margins" or "by significant win-rates"?
- Section 2: The acronym "EGT" should be expanded.
- Section 2: RL with regularization-based payoff functions should also cite:
   - "A Unified Approach to Reinforcement Learning, Quantal Response Equilibria, and Two-Player Zero-Sum Games", Sokota et al (MMD)
   - Neurd and R-nad and stratego:

  - In Section 3, quotation marks around "player" are facing the same direction.
- Section 3 (PBS): "At the beginning of a subgame, a state is sampled..." -- should this be "a history is sampled"? Since "state" is ambiguous (being used in the previous sentence in a different sense), whereas a history is rigorously defined.
- Section 4: "... is used to select an action abstract" should be "... is used to select an action abstraction"
- Section 5: "non-chance and non-terminate" should be "non-chance and non-terminal". Same for Footnote 5.
- Section 5 "transform a high-dimensional PBS $\beta$ into a low-dimensional public state $s$": I think this should be more clear that the "transformation" is a lossy one. Maybe by using a more specific verb than "transform"?
- Section 6: "our conduct experiments" should be "we conduct experiments"
- Section 6: It would be helpful to clarify which CFR variation is used in the experiments here. (I see that it is clarified in the Appendix, but it would be useful to note here as well.)
- Section 6: typo: "We evaluate the performance of RL-CFR and ReBeL under the common knowledge in HUNL."
- Section 6: typo: "the agent know" should be "the agent knows"
- Section 6: "We evaluate the performance of RL-CFR and ReBeL" should clarify that this paragraph is regarding head-to-head evaluations of RL-CFR vs. ReBeL, not merely comparisons between them on some common metric. (That's what this paragraph is about, right?) And "RL-CFR achieves 64 mbb/hand win-rate compared to the replication of ReBeL" should be "versus the replication of ReBeL" instead of "compared to the replication of ReBeL".
- Section 6: typo: "We also comapre RL-CFR" should be "compare"
- Appendix D: "In fact, the origin" should be "original"

- Appendix E: typo: Footnote 19 in the main text is displayed as ". 19."

### Questions
- I think the river endgame experiments are interesting, and would like more details. Do you have 95% confidence intervals for the results? Can you expand on footnote 9: did you play each scenario twice: once as normal, and once where ReBeL and RL-CFR switch places? Could you do river endgames sampled from ReBeL vs. ReBeL preflop-through-turn, or RL-CFR vs. RL-CFR preflop-through-turn, instead of mixed?

- The abstract and Introduction say that "RL-CFR effectively trades off computational complexity (due to CFR) and performance improvement (due to RL)". What is this trade-off? Does RL-CFR have less computational complexity and more performance improvement? This seems like it might be excessively hand-wavy?

- In the introduction: "RL-CFR has a wider range of applicability and faster convergence". Where is this faster convergence experimentally demonstrated or proved? What convergence is being referred to here?

- In Introduction: RL-CFR achieves "a good balance between computation and optimism". Is this expanded upon in the paper? I would love to hear more about this. 

- Section 4: "Our design is inspired by (Brown et al., 2019), which transforms high-dimensional public belief states into low-dimensional public states." Can you expand on this? I couldn't find what you were referring to.

- Do we use a discount factor for the RL agent in experiments? Is it just 1?

- In the original ReBeL paper, they show that they can simplify the PBS from perfect recall (encoding the previous actions of the two players) to imperfect recall (only encoding the stack sizes of the two players). In this paper, footnote 3 implies that the public state used here does encode the previous actions of the two players. Is this true?

- It's said in Section 4 (State) that the PBS dimensionality is very large, so we reduce it to the PS for our MDP. However, in terms of deep RL, is the 2,500 dimensionality really a problem? Would it have caused the experiment time to increase by a lot if the PBS was used instead of PS? Also, the PBS value net which takes in a PBS is still trained during ReBeL replication self-training, and used for inference during RL-CFR, right? So doesn't that mean that a deep neural net which takes a PBS as input is tractable?

- In Section 4 (State): "The selection of public states has the additional advantage that the public states of the non-root nodes are fixed during the CFR iterations..." Why does this matter? If I understand correctly, the PS is only needed for the root node, in order to get the action abstraction *before* CFR is started.

- Will the code be open-sourced? It's difficult to evaluate whether everything was implemented without error because there are so many possible pitfalls with implementing a complex system like ReBeL.

- In fact, the head-to-head results versus Slumbot imply that the ReBeL replication does not match ReBeL from the original paper. Do you know or hypothesize why this is?

- Why do you let the action abstraction agent choose to have fewer than K additional action abstractions? Should it not always be "better" to have more bet sizes in your abstraction?

- Section 6: Paragraph 3 (PBS value network training) -- was this done via self-play as in ReBeL? If so, are the details of the training process exactly the same as ReBeL?
  - As just one example of a detail: are the depths of the subgames during self-play defined exactly as they are in the ReBeL paper?

- Section 6: "In addition, the PBS value networks used for all our experiments are trained based on the default action abstraction." Does this mean that randomly modifying bet sizes during self-play as in the original ReBeL paper was not performed?

- Section 5: (2): adding a Gaussian noise -- was this described earlier in the paper? Why is this done?

- Section 5: "... we can retrain the PBS value network according to the action abstraction selected by the action network." and "Theoretically, the PBS value network and action network can be repeatedly updated for training." Can you clarify whether these two sentences refer to the experiments in this paper, or to potential future experiments?

- Algorithm 1: Are the hyperparameters set to 0 during test-time?

- Algorithm 1 differs from ReBeL in that it samples an action at the root and then repeats (constructing the subgame, solving it, and then sampling an action), whereas ReBeL must play the strategy until the end of the subgame before constructing a new subgame. By re-performing search every iteration, the guaranteed convergence towards a Nash equilibrium strategy is lost. Was this considered when designing RL-CFR? Why not play the computed strategy until the end of the subgame like in ReBeL?

- Algorithm 1: What depth do we solve to?

- Section 6: Can you expand on the common knowledge in HUNL? What does it mean that they know each other's historical actions? As in the previous actions played during the hand? But that's always true. Why would we assume that the agents know each other's hand ranges?
  - "Hence, we can avoid actions that are not in the action abstraction." What does this mean? Whose action abstraction? Why can we avoid them?
  - What does it mean that the agents know each other's hand ranges? Concretely, what does this mean in terms of the ReBeL and RL-CFR algorithms used? Does it mean that the PBS used by ReBeL and RL-CFR are set to be the actual PBS based on the action probabilities of the opponent on the previous action? If so, why do this? If so, how do the three references (Burch et al. 2018, Li et al. 2020, Kovarik and Lisy 2019) support this? If this is simply referring to AIVAT, then wouldn't it be more accurate to say that the *evaluator* knows both player's hand ranges, not that the *agent(s?)* know each other's hand ranges?

- Section 6: "Since the opponent may select actions that deviate from the game tree, we perform nested subgame solving..." I don't see why this is the case in Slumbot vs. RL-CFR and not in ReBeL vs. RL-CFR. In the latter, couldn't ReBeL play some bet size that wasn't in RL-CFR's abstraction? Similarly, RL-CFR could play some bet-size that wasn't in ReBeL's abstraction, no?

- Can you clarify MUL-ACTION and FINE-GRAIN? Why only set the action abstractions for the root? Why not for the whole subtree?

- Appendix E: Algorithm 2: What is AAlimit?

### Summary
The authors present a method called RL-CFR for dynamic action abstraction that uses reinforcement learning to find action abstractions as a function of the PBS. States in the MDP formulation are public belief states, and actions are potential action abstractions in those public belief states. A subgame with the chosen action abstraction is then approximately solved via ReBel, and rewards are based on the difference between the value of the PBS under the policy learned with the selected abstraction compared to its value from the policy learned via a base abstraction. Experiments are conducted in HUNL poker and show improved performance against strategies learned via ReBel with the base abstraction and Slumbot.

### Strengths
The MDP construction and application of RL to dynamic action abstraction is interesting and insightful. I believe the direction of the research is promising. Action abstraction is required to scale many of the algorithms for approximately solving imperfect information games with strong theoretical guarantees, so the work is well-motivated.

### Weaknesses
My main issues with the paper can be summarized as:
1. Failure to adequately summarize prior work in action abstraction. Some of the most important concepts (e.g. imperfect recall, and its effect on theoretical guarantees, is not discussed at all).
2. Lack of evidence on central claims in the paper.

For 1:
* **Waugh, Kevin, et al. "Abstraction pathologies in extensive games." AAMAS (2) 2009 (2009): 781-8.**
I believe the reader should be informed that abstraction can affect solution quality in surprising ways. While the authors mention that using a smaller $\mathcal{AA}_{base}$ as in Moravc´ık et al., 2017, leads to a decrease in win rate, it is also known that using a larger abstraction does not necessarily lead to improved solution quality. Waugh et al. discuss these abstraction pathologies in-depth here.

* **Kroer, Christian, and Tuomas Sandholm. "Extensive-form game abstraction with bounds." Proceedings of the fifteenth ACM conference on Economics and computation. 2014.** and **Kroer, Christian, and Tuomas Sandholm. "A unified framework for extensive-form game abstraction with bounds." Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems 31 (2018).** On the other hand, these papers discuss computing abstractions with bounds on their solution quality. 

* ** Kroer, Christian, and Tuomas Sandholm. "Discretization of continuous action spaces in extensive-form games." Proceedings of the 2015 international conference on autonomous agents and multiagent systems. 2015.** The discretization of continuous action spaces may also be relevant to this line of work.

For 2:

The title of the paper including **Optimal** makes it seem like the paper will include theoretical guarantees on optimality of the learned abstraction, but it does not.

**"Compared to other methods for choosing action abstractions (Hawkin et al., 2011; 2012; Zarick et al., 2020), RL-CFR has a wider range of applicability and faster convergence."**
* I don't see evidence supporting either of these claims. The tested application in experiments is only poker, and no other abstraction algorithm is used.
* As an aside, the cost of running ReBel every time the action abstraction changes during RL seems enormous, and the result that the learned abstraction is better than a fixed one is not very surprising.

**"This two-phase framework, named RL-CFR, effectively trades off computational complexity (due to CFR) and performance improvement (due to RL) for IIEFGs"**
* Again, as far as I understand, there is evidence that RL-CFR increases performance at an increased cost, but I don't see evidence of the ability to trade off complexity for performance. The claim itself may be a bit unclear.

### Questions
The main question I have is regarding the cost of running RL-CFR. Is it possibly more efficient to run ReBel with a larger abstracted action set?

There were also some clarity issues in the paper.
* Public belief states and their importance could be explained better. I'm not sure what is meant by the following: "Public belief state (PBS) is an assumption(?) that treats players’ strategies as common knowledge for reducing the state of large IIEFGs significantly". I don't understand how a PBS reduces the size of the state space, and, as far as I understand, all variants of CFR treat strategies as common knowledge.
* In the last paragraph of section 3, it might help to explain *how* a PBS can be interpreted as a history in a perfect information "analogue" of some IIEFG.
* The claim "Which effectively combines DRL with CFR to achieve a good balance between computation and optimism" is difficult to interpret. I'm also not sure how it is supported.

General mistakes/typos I noticed:

* "so that CFR can still be solved efficiently"
* "A behaviour strategy" 
* "our conduct experiments on"

### Summary
This paper presents a system that uses actor-critic algorithms to learn an action abstraction used to reduce the size of imperfect-information extensive-form games to be solved with CFR. 

The system is evaluated on Heads-up No-limit Texas Hold'em Poker, where it is compared with Rebel using a fixed action abstraction. Results show that the learned action abstraction allows for a final stronger strategy of Poker.

### Strengths
The idea of learning an action abstraction is interesting and valuable. It is also interesting that this is done by interplaying learning the action abstraction and solving the game with such an abstraction with a variant of CFR. 

The quality of the action abstraction clearly plays a role in the quality of the strategy learned, so caring for the abstraction is a good research direction. If I understand it correctly, the key point in this work is to be able to solve the game with a small lookahead, to allow for a quick (but limited) evaluation of different action abstractions. 

The empirical results are strong against a good baseline algorithm.

### Weaknesses
One weakness of the paper is that it uses much more notation than what is actually needed. The idea of connecting RL for learning action abstractions and CFR could be explained in a more pedagogical way. For example, it is not clear to me whether the definitions in the last paragraph of "Imperfect Information Extensive-Form Games" (Section 3) are needed at all. The pseudocode is provided, but the reader has to walk it through by themselves. 

The experiments could be stronger if it considered a baseline that uses the abstraction by Hawkin et al. within the same Rebel framework. The paper hypothesizes that such a learning process would be slow because the abstraction changes in every iteration. To be honest, I don't see how this would be different with the proposed approach. Seeing learning curves of different versions of the system would dismiss any doubts about the contributions of the proposed method. 

The paper makes it sound that this system can be used end-to-end with little to no human intervention. However, the method critically depends on human knowledge to even define the possible action abstractions, the set of "must-have" actions, and the default action abstraction that guides the RL process of learning a better abstraction. For example, how would the method behave if we removed the default action abstraction, so in the beginning of learning the method would do what RL algorithms do, which is to randomly select action abstractions?

### Questions
Instead of relying on RL to find the action abstractions, would it be possible to incorporate the search for action abstractions as part of the search Rebel does for an equilibrium? This would be equivalent to extending the depth of the tree, where a four player (in addition to player 1, 2, and the chance player) would attempt to maximize the value of the game. The decisions of this fourth player would be the selection of the abstraction used. How different would this be from the RL formulation in the current approach? 

Instead of looking at the difference between the current action abstraction and the default abstraction, why not use a reward function that depends only on the value $v$ of the current abstraction?

### Summary
The authors propose a new approach for performing action abstraction for solving large imperfect-information extensive-form games. In particular, instead of using a fixed action abstraction, they formulate the problem as a Markov decision process, and they employ techniques from reinforcement learning to gradually improve the action abstraction in conjunction with CFR. The overall algorithmic scheme is referred to as RL-CFR. The authors demonstrate that this new algorithm outperforms existing techniques for solving heads-up no-limit Poker.

### Strengths
Action abstraction is one of the most important modules when it comes to equilibrium computation in very large games. It has received considerable interest in the literature, but--as this paper demonstrates--there is room for improvement in the current techniques. Indeed, the authors propose an interesting and natural approach for performing dynamically action abstraction in a way that is compatible with modern RL techniques. They also demonstrate that their approach is promising through experiments on heads-up no-limit Poker, a standard benchmark in game solving with an enormous game-tree size.

### Weaknesses
In terms of the experimental evaluation, which is the key contribution of the paper, there are a couple of significant drawbacks. First, the paper focuses on a benchmark--namely heads-up no-limit Poker--that has been essentially already solved, meaning that prior work has already come up with techniques to find superhuman strategies in that game. It would be much more meaningful if the authors used their new algorithm to make progress on a benchmark that has been otherwise elusive using prior techniques. The second issue is that the comparison is not made with the state of the art models (Libratus and Deepstack). If I am not mistaken those models are not publicly available, but it is a significant weakness if the new approach does not attain state of the art performance. Do the authors know how Libratus or Deepstack performs against either Rebel or Slumbot? That would given an indication of how the new approach performs against Libratus or Deepstack. Remaining on the comparison drawn in the paper, one issue here is that Rebel was not tailored to Poker; the point of ReBel was to have an agent that performs well across many different benchmarks, so a comparison with an agent designed specifically for Poker might not be appropriate. Furthermore, Slumbot is not a particularly strong agent compared to either Libratus or Deepstack.

### Questions
Some minor points:

1. The way citations are used is not syntactically sound. For example, "(Meng et al.) proposes" should instead be "Meng et al. (2023) propose"
2. In page 8, "our conduct" is a typo
3. There is unnecessary space before Footnote 6
4. Section 6 gives too much detail that is not necessary in the main body; I would recommend delegating that information to the Appendix.
