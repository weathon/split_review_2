## Abstract
Machine learning methods can be a valuable aid in the scientific process, but they need to face challenging settings where data come from inhomogeneous experimental conditions. Recently, meta-learning approaches have made significant progress in multi-task learning, but they rely on black-box neural networks, resulting in high computational costs and limited interpretability. Leveraging the structure of the learning problem, we argue that multi-environment generalization can be achieved using a simpler learning model, with an affine structure with respect to the learning task. Crucially, we prove that this architecture can identify the physical parameters of the system, enabling interpretable learning. We demonstrate the competitive generalization performance and the low computational cost of our method by comparing it to state-of-the-art algorithms on physical systems, ranging from toy models to complex, non-analytical systems. The interpretability of our method is illustrated with original applications to physical-parameter-induced adaptation and to adaptive control.

### Summary
This article presents a new meta-learning method, CAMEL, which uses affine task-specific parameters. It is motivated by the application of modelling physical systems, many of which are described in the article. CAMEL is demonstrated on these modelling examples and a robotic control task, with comparisons to state-of-the-art meta-learning methods MAML, ANIL, and CoDA. The interpretability of the method as a means of discover physical parameters is discussed.

### Strengths
The article is well-motivated and well-written. Both the motivation towards interpretable data-driven modelling of physical systems, and the motivation of simplifying meta-learning approaches like MAML, are well justified.

The proposed CAMEL method appears to be a simple but effective method for meta-learning. The overview of meta-learning approaches, comparing MAML, CoDA, and CAMEL, in section 2.2 provides a useful overview of the different methods. The use of different $w_t$ vectors for different environments is motivated in the text and suitable for physical applications, especially as $w_t$ can be learned used least squares.

The experimental evaluation of CAMEL is convincing, with a number of different physical modelling systems used for demonstration. CAMEL appears to match or outperform other meta-learning approaches on all tasks, although further details could improve the experimental evaluation (as detailed below). The code is provided and is simple to understand, using PyTorch for single-file implementations of CoDA, MAML/ANIL, and CAMEL.

### Weaknesses
The experimental results rely heavily on Table 2, however the experimental conditions for these results are not made clear. Specifically, the training details for MAML, ANIL, CoDA, and CAMEL are not fully detailed. The "Training" and "Adaptation" columns are not described, nor are their units present. The caption states that the table presents the "Average adaptation mean squared error and computational time," but the number of trials over which an average is taken, the standard deviation, the units of computational time, and how computational time was measured are not given. Statistical tests on the significance of values presented in Table 2 would be helpful.

The argument that CAMEL is an interpretable method relies on the idea that the weight vector $w_t$ learned on the training meta-dataset can correspond to physical parameters of a system. This is explained in Proposition 1, which assumes that the training loss is taken to 0. The authors do point out that identifying the meaning of each parameter, in other words, interpreting the parameters, is out of reach for black-box meta-learning architectures. However, the argument that CAMEL allows for such interpretation is not sufficiently demonstrated in my opinion. The example of learning an electric point charge system is given in section 5.1 and expanded in section B.5, however it relies heavily on the fact that CAMEL is able to learn the dynamics of the system, and not on the interpretability of the resultant parameters. Demonstrating how the learned physical parameters allow for an interpretation of the model and physical system, beyond the performance of CAMEL, would help make this argument. Physics informed neural networks (PINNs) share the same motivation and have been used to present interpretable results; their inclusion in this section and discussion would further improve the interpretability argument. 

Lastly, the authors appear to only study the case in which $c = c_* = 0$. This is a large simplification. If Equation 3.1 is valid, I believe this means that $h(x;\theta_0) = 0$, which is quite a departure from other meta-learning methods. If this is the case, the authors should further justify it and potentially explore the case where $c \neq 0$. If it is not the case, then clarification is needed in section 4.3 as to when this simplification is made.

While the article is well-written, it suffers from two minor presentation weaknesses. The first is a reliance on popularity as justification; the popularity of a method does not justify its use. The sentence "Given the popularity and expressiveness of neural networks, incorporating multi-task learning into their gradient descent training algorithms is a major challenge" (2.2) is an example. The challenge of multi-task learning is not dependent on the popularity of neural networks, so why is it used as an opening clause? The second formatting issue is minor: works are cited in text when they should be cited in parentheses (although there are also proper uses of in-text citations). See, for example, this paragraph in section 4, where the Ljung citation is correct but the Nelles citation isn't:
"System identification and model identifiability are key issues when learning a system (Ljung, 1998). Although deep neural networks are becoming increasingly popular for modeling physical systems, their complex structure makes them impractical for parameter identification in general Nelles (2001)."

### Questions
How many trials were used to compute the averages in Table 2?

What do the "Training" and "Adaptation" columns correspond to in Table 2?

How many gradient steps were used in the various benchmarks?

Were the hyperparameters of the Adam optimizer the same for all benchmarks?

Could common physical parameters be learned in $v_*(x)$? What guarantees that $v_*(x)$ is task-agnostic?

Do the authors consider that their experimental results validate the hypothesis of equation 3.1?

### Summary
The paper investigates meta-learning physical systems via
associating every task with a linear embedding/task weight
w that impacts the predictions: this is shown in equation 3.2
where the prediction involves a global prediction
followed by a modification from the linear part.
At test-time, the task weight of a new task is found
by gradient descent on the task loss.
Section 4 goes on to describe many settings where it is
reasonable to have this linear part of the model,
and prop 1 shows that the task weights can recover
the true dynamics of the system, which leads to the
an interpretability of what the task weights are.
The experimental result show a number of settings
from physics and reinforcement learning where
the method is able to learn better meta-dynamics models
than MAML, ANIL, and CoDA.

### Strengths
1. This is a reasonable model when there is some reason to believe
   the true model follows the formulation of equation 3.2.
   It could be interesting to further speculate about the
   representation capacity or universality of this model.
   (Section 4 is perhaps a good start to this)
2. The experimental results clearly demonstrate the
   capability of the model, especially in how well CAMEL
   is able to attain a low identification error in Fig 2.
3. CoDA is a great baseline method to compare against,
   in addition to MAML/ANIL, and Table 1 clearly summarizes
   the modeling differences.

### Weaknesses
 1. Every experimental meta-learning setting in this paper
   seems to be new.
   This would have been helpful to help better-ground the results
   in the community, as otherwise it is difficult
   to understand if the performance improvements are coming
   from improper implementations of other methods
   or from a fundamental modeling advancement.
   For example, MAML with a training step size of 30 and
   adaptation size of 10 in Table 2 is very arbitrary and
   unlikely to be the best MAML hyper-parameters here.

   The paper would be significantly more convincing
   if the CAMEL model was evaluated in the exact experimental settings
   from CoDA or [Wang et al., NeurIPS 2022](https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.10271),
   which also meta-learn physical systems with varying amounts of
   contextual information.
 2. There is a significant amount of omitted related work on
   meta-reinforcement learning that is also adapting controlled
   MDP dynamics and policies to multi-task RL settings,
   e.g., [Nagabandi et al., ICLR 2019](https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.11347)
   and the citation graph around it.
 3. The term "interpretable meta-learning" in the title and
   throughout the rest of the paper is a big statement without
   the right qualifications. The paper gets to defining what
   interpretability means here in proposition 1 of recovering
   true parameters when they exist and fit into the modeling
   structure they have set up, but I this is not what I had
   in mind when I first saw the term "interpretability".
   It also seems like there is still a large amount of
   uninterpretability in the system, as the model in
   equation 3.2 still has 2 neural networks.

### Questions
Overall I think this is a well-executed paper with some
good modeling ideas and experimental insights.
I gave the paper a weak reject due to the experimental settings
not being directly comparable to the related work and the
baselines not being tuned as much as they could have been,
and I am especially open to re-evaluating this assessment
after hearing the author's perspective on this.

### Summary
The paper proposes an approach CAMEL for the adaptation to new tasks by first learning a shared neural network feature extractor together with separate linear heads for each training task, then at test time perform least square regression to compute the linear head weights given a new task’s labelled data. The authors show this formulation can allow physical parameters identification for linearly parameterized systems under certain conditions. Experimentally, the authors show that their approach can outperform meta-learning baseline methods (MAML, ANIL, CODA) in terms of generalization, computational speed, and interpretability.

### Strengths
The interpretability and physical parameter identification aspects this paper focuses on are important and often overlooked by existing meta-learning methods.

### Weaknesses
 - **The proposed method lacks novelty and are not situated in the right context**. The authors claim to propose a novel “model agnostic meta-learning architecture.” However, the proposed approach is not model agnostic (because it requires specifying the width of the last layer dimension) and more importantly is not novel and not situated in the most relevant context.
    - **Novelty**: It could be argued that the proposed method is not meta-learning but applying multi-task representation learning in a learning-to-learn problem. A more general version of the authors’ proposed approach have been theoretically studied in terms of its generalization performance by Maurer et al in 2016 (page 7, section 2.2 Bounding the Excess Risk for Learning-to-learn). More recently, Wang et al 2021 have proposed almost exactly the same approach by first multi-task learning a shared feature extractor with linear heads and then performing last linear layer fine-tuning over a new task’s data at test time (section 3.4 Fine-tuning for Test Task Adaption). Besides, Wang et al has also studied the computational time savings of this MTL approach compared to last-layer MTL methods. Thus it is not correct for the authors to claim their methods as a novel approach. The authors should clarify that their approach is a specific instance of multi-task representation learning, and not a novel meta-learning architecture.
    - **Context**: In the background section, the authors situate their methods among Gradient-based Meta-learning methods. However as the authors have shown in Table 1, CAMEL doesn’t perform gradient adaptation, so it’s not a gradient-based method. Instead, because CAMEL adapts only the last layer of the learned model, a more appropriate way to situate the current method is to compare it among last-layer meta-learning methods, which includes not only ANIL (which the authors have compared against) but more importantly MetaOptNet (Lee et al 2019) and R2D2 (Bertinetto et al., 2019). Here both MetaOptNet and R2D2 solve the last linear layer exactly (using a convex solver or closed-form expression) and use implicit function theorem to propagate the gradients to the earlier feature extractors. Because this paper focuses on the regression task, the authors should compare additionally against R2D2 in the experiments. (One can think of R2D2 roughly as ANIL where the last layer adaptation are solved exactly instead of using a fixed number of gradient descent steps.) The authors should explicitly compare their approach against these methods, particularly R2D2, which also focuses on efficient last-layer adaptation.

- **Notation needs to be more consistent and clearer.** For example, both $f_t(x; \pi)$ (page 3) and $f_t(x)$ (page 4) are used. Besides, the ground truth function is denoted $v_{\star}$. However, it has $n$ output dimensions, while the function $v$ has $r$ output dimensions. The inconsistent use of notation makes the paper harder to follow and understand. The authors should ensure that all symbols are clearly defined and used consistently throughout the paper.

- **Proposition 1** are stated without all the assumptions of the relationships between $r$, $n$, $T$, and $N$ (some of these relationships are scattered in earlier parts of the paper), making the statement difficult to parse. Besides, the assumption that $c = c_{\star} = 0$ to me seems a bit restrictive as the ground truth $c_{\star}$ are inherent to the physical process and could be nonzero. However, I’m not sure if the authors can make the same type of guarantees for the cases when these values are non-zero (and possibly unequal). The authors should provide a complete statement of Proposition 1 with all necessary assumptions explicitly stated and discuss the implications of relaxing the assumption that $c = c_{\star} = 0$.
- In the computational benefit section, the authors mention “adaptation at test time … is guaranteed to converge if the number of samples is greater than $r$.” This statement is a bit confusing, as the optimization is an ordinary least square which can be solved analytically without a notion of convergence. Maybe the authors mean to say when the number of samples is greater than $r$, the ordinary least squares is likely to be fully specified, thus admitting one unique solution. If this is the case, the authors should also discuss how to pick the solution when the ordinary least squares is underspecified. The authors need to clarify the meaning of convergence in this context and discuss the implications of having an underspecified least squares problem.

### Questions
- How many steps of gradient adaption is used for ANIL? It is important to note that one can apply more steps of adaptation during evaluation than training as it can potentially improve ANIL's performance.
- Can the authors explain for example 1 and 4, what is the learning goal here? I saw the authors mention $x=(q, \dot q, \ddot q)$ and $y=u$, but can the authors explain why do we want to predict $u$ (which I'm assuming is a function of time) in the first place?
