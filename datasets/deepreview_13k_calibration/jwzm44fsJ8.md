## Abstract
We seek to overcome limitations to code retrieval quality posed by the scarcity of data containing pairs of code snippets and natural language queries in languages other than English. To do so, we introduce two new datasets. First, we make a new evaluation benchmark available, dubbed M$^2$CRB, containing pairs of text and code, for multiple natural and programming language pairs - namely: Spanish, Portuguese, German, and French, each paired with code snippets for: Python, Java, and JavaScript. The dataset is curated via an automated filtering pipeline from source files within GitHub followed by human verification to ensure accurate language classification. Additionally, in order be able to train models and evaluate on the proposed task, we pose the following hypothesis: if a model can map from English to code, and from other natural languages to English, then the model can directly map from those non-English languages into code. We thus build a training corpus made of a new paired English/Code dataset we curate, and further combine it with existing translation datasets given by pairs of English and other natural languages. Extensive evaluations on both our new tasks as well as on existing code-to-code search benchmarks confirm our hypothesis: models are able to generalize to unseen language pairs they indirectly observed during training. We examine a broad set of model classes and report the influence of different design choices on the observed generalization capabilities.

### Summary
The paper proposes a dataset called $M^2CRB$ where docstring and corresponding functions are used as paired data to construct a search dataset. The dataset includes docstrings in Spanish, Portuguese, German, and French. The paper proposes a training recipe that enables search over unseen language pairs. The paper reports the effects of different design choices and the performance of various fine-tuning schemes.

### Strengths
A new dataset for multilingual code retrieval task.

### Weaknesses
The paper proposed a dataset that is created automatically. The training and evaluations are not motivated well. In the whole paper, every experiment performed is not justified. The main questions addressed in the paper are somewhat known. In my opinion, the paper does not meet the bar of ICLR. There is no scientific or technical contribution. I couldn't perceive the value and need of the dataset.



### Questions
- If we need multilingual docstring, isn't it possible to use NMT models to translate the docstring available in English? Some experiments in the Appendix use Google translation API which should be part of the main body and discussion. This way the value of the dataset could be better demonstrated.
- "Moreover, the search setting is less compute-intensive relative to common language models, rendering experimentation more accessible" - Is it a good reason to study code search tasks?
- The research question related to unseen languages is not clear. From the literature, we know that multilingual LMs learn to map text or code in a shared embedding space that enables them to perform on unseen language pairs. What new this paper is trying to show or prove?
- "Contrary to what is usually observed in more standard evaluation conditions, in this multilingual setting, scaling up model size will not necessarily improve performance." - Why?
- Why does a retriever model need to be trained to generate? When we are in the era of large language models that are doing great in code generation, why do we want to train CodeBERT-like models for generation?
- In 2-3 lines, please outline what new findings this paper presents.

### Summary
The paper introduces two new datasets to address code retrieval limitations due to the scarcity of data containing pairs of code snippets and natural language queries in languages other than English. 
The first dataset, M²CRB, is an evaluation benchmark with text and code pairs for multiple natural and programming language pairs. The authors propose a training hypothesis that models can map from non-English languages into code if they can map from English to code and other natural languages to English. They create a training corpus combining a new paired English/Code dataset with existing translation datasets. Extensive evaluations confirm that models can generalize to unseen language pairs they indirectly observed during training. The paper contributes a new evaluation benchmark, additional training data, a training recipe for unseen language pairs, and an analysis of different design choices and fine-tuning schemes.

### Strengths
1. Introducing new datasets, M²CRB and the paired English/Code dataset, addressing the scarcity of multilingual code retrieval data.
2. Rigorous evaluation of various model classes and sizes on both new and existing datasets, confirming the proposed training hypothesis.
3. Clear presentation of the filtering pipeline, training methodology, and results, making it easy to follow and understand.
4. The study contributes to the understanding of multilingual code retrieval and offers a path for future work on more diverse language combinations.

### Weaknesses
1. While the M²CRB dataset covers multiple language pairs, it can be expanded to include more programming languages for better representation. Specifically, the current dataset seems to focus on a limited set of languages, potentially missing out on the nuances and challenges posed by languages with different paradigms (e.g., functional languages like Haskell, or logic-based languages like Prolog). This could limit the generalizability of models trained on this dataset to a broader range of programming contexts.
2. The study focuses on the code search/retrieval setting, but it would be helpful to investigate the applicability of the introduced data and training approaches in generative settings as well. The paper does not explore how the proposed training method would perform in tasks such as code generation or code summarization, which are also important aspects of code understanding and manipulation. This limits the scope of the findings and their potential impact on other related areas.
3. The evaluation focuses on models within the 60M-360M parameter range, and exploring larger-scale models could provide insights into the effect of model size on generalization capabilities in this domain. The current evaluation does not explore the performance of larger models, which could have different generalization properties and might be more suitable for complex multilingual code retrieval tasks. This leaves open the question of how the proposed approach would scale with increased model capacity.

### Questions
1. Can the training approach proposed in this paper be adapted for generative models, and if so, how would it affect their performance on text-to-code generation tasks?
2. Are there any potential biases in the dataset, such as the influence of specific programming language styles or the quality of non-English docstrings, that may affect the model's generalization capability?
3. How do the models perform when fine-tuned on different programming languages (e.g., C++, Rust, etc.) and less common natural languages? Would the performance be consistent with the results presented in the paper?
4. How would the results change when using larger-scale models, such as GPT-3 or the recent Megatron-LM? Would the generalization capabilities improve with increased model capacity?

### Summary
- This work introduces two datasets:
  - a Multilingual `(code snippet, NL queries)` paired data in 4 natural languages: Spanish, Portuguese, German, and French, and three programming languages: Java, JavaScript, and Python. The dataset is collected from GitHub data, with AST parsing and natural language identification, and then human validation to check for correct language identification. This dataset contains ~7700 data points and is used as a test dataset.
  - And, an `(English, code snippets)` paired data similar to the CodeSearchNet data
- This work then proposes a training setup to train code search models for languages for whom parallel data is not available. The training setup requires parallel data between one language ($S$) and code segments ($T$), and parallel data between all other languages ($S'$) and $S$. The model is then trained with a contrastive loss aimed at learning similar embeddings for similar code segments/natural languages and a standard autoregressive loss.
- This work then presents results for code search for the 4 languages introduced in the work, code search using English, and code-code search between Java and Python.

### Strengths
- The Code-NL Paired dataset between languages other than English has not been explored in prior works and could be useful for non-English speaking developers.
- From the statistics of the introduced data, it seems that, unlike English, data in these languages is not sufficiently available to train a model in the standard way. Thus, the authors propose to utilize available NL-paired datasets to indirectly learn code search for these new languages.
- This training setup, in future work, might also be explored to extend to code generation given NL descriptions in non-English languages. Additionally, the dataset proposed in this work could be used for evaluation in that setting as well.
- The paper is well-written and relatively easy to follow.

### Weaknesses
 - There are no baselines presented to understand how well the proposed technique actually works. While baselines might be difficult to get for non-English code search (Table 4), I would assume for Python-Java code search (Table 5) and English code search (Table 6) available model embeddings should work well. For instance, CodeBERT reports an average MRR of 0.7603. It is not immediately clear what the auMRRc would be for this model, and it would have been helpful to get these numbers. Similarly for the Python-Java code search, it would have been nice to get baselines from available multi-lingual pre-trained models.
- This work requires paired NL data (such as between Spanish and English), and it incorporates this paired data in the loss function. However, another way to utilize this data could be to learn a translation model from English to Spanish using the paired data and use this translation model to translate English queries in the CodeSearchNet data to create a much larger (Spanish, Code snippet) dataset, albeit with some noise. This has the advantage of creating larger synthetic training data that can be directly used to train the code search model, instead of the objective proposed in the paper. Do the authors have some assessment on why the proposed technique is a better approach than this one?

### Summary
The paper studies the problem of multi-language code search, from different natural languages to different coding languages, or between different coding languages. A main contribution is a new evaluation set M^2CRB, which consist of en/pt/es/fr/de queries to python/java/javascript code snippets, all from real world GitHub repositories. The paper also brings up a hypothesis that the model should be able to learn the relationship between a language and a code with no direct training pairs, but bridged by an anchor language. English is used in this study.  

Extensive experiments are done with different languages (natural and code), different sizes of CodeT5 models and different model architecture (CodeT5 with single/dual encoder, CodeBERT and CodeGen). Results show that the model can indeed learn to retrieve non-directly linked pairs of natural and coding languages. The effect of model architecture and sizes are also discussed.

### Strengths
- Introduced a new multilingual natural language to code evaluation. We need more realistic evaluation sets.
- Evaluated different models, sizes and languages extensively.
- Provided details of how the dataset is created.

### Weaknesses
Experiment about the effectiveness of data is not clearly setup.
- The purpose of adding TATOEBA and CodeXGlue is not clearly articulated. They also make the claim of learning through anchor languages weaker because another factor is added to the training mix.
- It's not sure if the pre-training data of various models already have multi-lingual exposure. The near-0 auMMR number could also be task alignment issues.
- Some ablation studies will help a lot to understand the role of each dataset.

Another weakness is in writing. It's common to find long or poorly written sentences that's hard to read, or not understandable at all to the Reviewer with moderate effort. See questions for some examples.

### Questions
- What's the purpose of the AST parsing phase?
- Table 2: "high scores are observed across all language combinations". It's better to have a baseline to help understand a relative assessment of "high".
- Section 3.1 last paragraph: "Note that any data realization x observed..." It's not clear why we need to discuss it here. Better to clarify the purpose.
- Table 3: Why do we need the TATOEBA/CodeXGlue set? What purpose do they serve in answering the research questions?
- Section 4.1 second paragraph: ".., models able to generate train ..." Reviewer couldn't understand what does this mean with moderate effort.
- Section 4.1 right after Equation 3: "... and define translation auxiliary tasks." What does this sentences mean?
- Section 4.3.2 last sentence: "Finally, the decoder-only model doesn't reach..." it's better to call out the model name (is it CodeGen?) to save the readers some back-n-forth work.
- Would you open source the data and evaluation code?
