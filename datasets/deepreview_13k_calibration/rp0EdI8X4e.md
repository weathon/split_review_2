## Abstract
The demand for transparency in healthcare and finance has led to interpretable machine learning (IML) models, notably the concept bottleneck models (CBMs), valued for their potential in performance and insights into deep neural networks. However, CBM's reliance on manually annotated data poses challenges. Label-free CBMs have emerged to address this, but they remain unstable, affecting their faithfulness as explanatory tools. To address this issue of inherent instability, we introduce a formal definition for an alternative concept called the Faithful Vision-Language Concept (FVLC) model. We present a methodology for constructing an FVLC that satisfies four critical properties. Our extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets using Label-free CBM model architectures demonstrate that our FVLC outperforms other baselines regarding stability against input and concept set perturbations. Our approach incurs minimal accuracy degradation compared to the vanilla CBM, making it a promising solution for reliable and faithful model interpretation.

### Confidence
4: You are confident in your assessment, but not absolutely certain. It is unlikely, but not impossible, that you did not understand some parts of the submission or that you are unfamiliar with some pieces of related work.

### Summary
In this paper, the authors have introduced a new approach to ensure the stability and robustness of label-free concept bottleneck models. The authors introduced stability conditions for the concepts, similar to those in (Sundararajan et al., 2017), and incorporated them into their training objective function to enhance the robustness of the concepts. They have also demonstrated the numerical improvement in stability.

### Strengths
1-I really liked the paper. The authors address a very important question of model interpretability, which pertains to the robustness of explanations, in this case, regarding concepts.

2-The authors not only discussed conditions for ensuring the robustness of concepts but also incorporated them into a well-defined objective function.

3-I also appreciated the numerical comparison of stability in the experiments, which many papers only illustrate with a few examples.

4- Finally, in my opinion, the authors conducted significant experiments to support their claims.

### Weaknesses
The quality of the explanations for some parts of the paper could be enhanced.

1- It took me a significant amount of time to follow the flow of data through the network. Perhaps adding concise explanations detailing how input images traverse the network during inference would make the explanation more accessible. Specifically, the interaction between the image encoder, concept layer, and the final classification layer needs more clarity. It's not immediately obvious how the extracted image features are transformed into concept representations and then used for classification. A more detailed walkthrough, perhaps with a concrete example, would be beneficial.

2- Likewise, when explaining the framework, the authors could introduce all the key terms at the beginning of the section so that readers do not need to continuously reference earlier sections to grasp the meanings of these terms. For instance, terms like 'concept bottleneck', 'stability conditions', and 'robustness of concepts' are used throughout the paper, but a consolidated definition at the start of the relevant sections would greatly improve readability. Furthermore, the specific mathematical formulations of the stability conditions could be better motivated and explained in relation to their impact on the concept representations.

### Questions
1- Can the authors explain the choice of architecture for the text and image encoder and its impact on the model's performance, particularly in terms of accuracy?

2- Also, which image model is used in "Standard (No interpretability)" in table 1.

### Summary
The concept bottleneck models(CBMs) and the subsequent label free CBMs offer the concept based explanation for a given prediction. However, their explanations are not faithful if the input image or the concept gets perturbed. The authors tried to fill this gap.

### Strengths
Concept based explanations are a hot topic at this time and the effect on explanations based on the input perturbations is fairly unexplored. So thats a major strength of the paper.

### Weaknesses
1. The writing is poor. It is hard to follow.
2. The related work is not complete. The following important papers should have been included in the related work:

3.  What is the difference b/w faithful and original concept in definition 1?
4. Label free cbm step 1, page 3. I think it will be "they propose" instead of "we propose" as label free cbm is proposed by Oikarinen et al., 2023. All the in step 1, 2, 3, 4 in sect 3 "we" should be replaced by "they"
5. I dont understand anything from fig 2. The caption should clearly state the objective of the figure.
6. The terms in the loss function is not at all clear (Page 6). What is D? is this somedistance? Also how will the two constraint \delta and \phro will be going to affect the loss and the optimization. And its connection with the Fig.2 is completely unresolved to me.
7. Can the authors use any difficult datasets like HAM10k or MIMIC-CXR to bolster their claims. Medical images will make the claims stronger because if the explanations are not stable, it will raise trust issue among the users.
8. I am confused with table 1. If the main message is to showcase that their method is more superior compared to the baselines, they should have the best cofiguration of their method and the baselines. Also they should have another table where they should conduct an ablation study to include different configurations of their method with various perturbations and compare the performance. Also, only PCBM and LCBM baselines are not enough. I would like to see the performances for LCBM and language in a bottle especially when the inputs and the concepts will be perturbed. Also thourough comparison is needed with basic CBM and some other methods for datasets where concepts are annotated. Also missing variances in table 1. 
9. Also, for table 2, nothing is highlighted or bolded. With so many numbers, it is diffcult for me to see which is higher and which is lower.

### Summary
In this paper, the author proposed a solution for constructing faithful vision-language concept models. To achieve this, the authors formalized four properties that faithful concepts should respect and designed a min-max object function by following these four properties. In addition, the authors also proposed an algorithm to solve this object function. Through extensive experiments over multiple vision-language dataset, the authors can demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed solution in maintaining good prediction performance while achieving faithfulness.

### Strengths
+ Label-free concept bottleneck model can be unstable and unfaithful. The authors provide a timely solution for tackling this problem
+ The authors provide a very clear formulation of the faithful concept bottleneck model and the overall techniques are sound and convincing
+ The authors also performed extensive experiments over various vision-language datasets to demonstrate the benefit of the proposed solution
+ The overall presentation is clear and easy to follow.

### Weaknesses
 + Label-free concept bottleneck model can be unstable and unfaithful. The authors provide a timely solution for tackling this problem
+ The authors provide a very clear formulation of the faithful concept bottleneck model and the overall techniques are sound and convincing
+ The authors also performed extensive experiments over various vision-language datasets to demonstrate the benefit of the proposed solution
+ The overall presentation is clear and easy to follow.

+ I have one concern for the generalizability of the proposed solution. Although the authors claimed that they proposed a solution to deal with the stability issue of the label-free concept bottleneck model, the authors only focused on the prediction task over the vision dataset. I am wondering whether the proposed solution could be generalized to other settings such as the classification tasks over NLP data or tabular data.
+ The metrics of evaluating the model stability are also concerning to me. I feel that this metric should be $\epsilon$-invariant, which means that ideally the perturbation $\epsilon$ should occur in the denominator of the metric. Otherwise, with larger epsilon, you can get larger stability, which seems to be counter-intuitive. Also, by looking at the other similar metrics in literature, such as the stability metric proposed in the model interpretability literature (Alvarez Melis, David, and Tommi Jaakkola. "Towards robust interpretability with self-explaining neural networks." Advances in neural information processing systems 31 (2018).), they are also calculated by putting the input perturbation in the denominator. So it would be better if the authors could justify why they didn't choose to design their stability metric in this manner and ideally reference some other papers.
+ The presentation could be further improved. For example, for Figure 3, the text in the figure is very tiny and it is very hard to tell what concepts they are. For Figure 2, I guess the box mixed with black and white dots should represent the noise but I cannot find any explanations for this. It would be better if the authors could clearly illustrate this figure in the caption.

### Summary
This paper introduces Faithful Vision-Language Concept (FVLC) models to overcome faithfulness and instability issues in Label-free Concept Bottleneck models (LCBMs). The authors also analyze the stability and the faithfulness of concepts introducing four desiderata, namely: (i) the degree of overlap with the ground-truth concepts, (ii) the robustness against random noise, (iii) the correctness of the predictions, and (iv) the stability of the output layer.
With a series of experiments, it is shown that the FVLC outperforms LCBMs both in accuracy and in stability of the concepts.

### Strengths
The authors address the important problem on interpretability in CBMs. Ensuring concepts are of good quality is central to applications of CBMs and LCBMs in real-world scenarios where perturbations are likely to happen. The presentation is clear and all parts can be easily understood, although it could be improved, see weaknesses. 
The analysis of the possible instability effects in the concepts is sound and motivated by examples where LCBMs effectively struggle to predict the correct concepts. The proposed method for concept refinement is simple and works well in a wide range of case studies. In addition, the ablation study reveals that all terms included in FVLC are needed to improve the stability and accuracy of the model.
Essentially, FVLC paves the use of language-based CBMs with faithfulness guarantees, which could be very helpful in applications.

### Weaknesses
One major concern about the analysis is the question of the interpretability. The claim that if a concept $\tilde c$ matches the top-k component of c leads to an equivalently interpretable concept depends on the assumption that c is already interpretable. This is implicit in the discussion and it seems to me that it is sidelined. Since the interpretability of the model is central in this paper, somehow this has to be verified, e.g., via concept accuracy, even for LCBMs. 

The authors consider the LCBM as the standard reference for improving the concepts, but the optimization could have been done even without it since the alignment loss has to be w.r.t. concepts extracted with CLIP, avoiding the noise in fitting first the LCBM and then the FVLC. 

I feel the contribution would also improve by comparing with other SotA models, like Post-hoc CBMs and LaBo:
[1] Yuksekgonul, Mert, Maggie Wang, and James Zou, "Post-hoc concept bottleneck models." ICLR 2023 
[2] Yang, Yue, et al. "Language in a bottle: Language model guided concept bottlenecks for interpretable image classification." CVPR 2023

About the presentation, it is somehow counterintuitive to mention $\Tilde c$ and $c$ while there is a clear reference to the maps $\Tilde g$ and $g$. Moreover, I am sure that all the extracted concepts are input-dependent, so it would be the case to indicate them with $g(x)$ or $c(x)$ to explicit their dependence.
One possible improvement of the presentation could be to comment on the definitions after their statements, indicating intuitive properties captured by them. Another point is the introduction of $ \tilde c$ which is clear from the text but it should be stated before that the authors refer to the faithful concepts obtained with $\TIlde g$.

One remark: the statement in section 5 that $\tilde c = c$ in the limit of $\alpha_1 \to 0$ is not always true since it depends on the loss that is considered. What loss is used? In principle, different choices of the loss function would to more stable or less stable concepts for conditions (iii) and (iv).
