## Abstract
Offline preference-based reinforcement learning (PbRL) offers an effective solution to overcome the challenges associated with designing rewards and the high costs of online interactions. In offline PbRL, agents are provided with a fixed dataset containing human preferences between pairs of trajectories. Previous studies mainly focus on recovering the rewards from the preferences, followed by policy optimization with an off-the-shelf offline RL algorithm. However, given that preference label in PbRL is inherently trajectory-based, accurately learning transition-wise rewards from such label can be challenging, potentially leading to misguidance during subsequent offline RL training. To address this issue, we introduce our method named $\textit{Flow-to-Better (FTB)}$, which leverages the pairwise preference relationship to guide a generative model in producing preferred trajectories, avoiding Temporal Difference (TD) learning with inaccurate rewards. Conditioning on a low-preference trajectory, $\textit{FTB}$ uses a diffusion model to generate a better one with a higher preference, achieving high-fidelity full-horizon trajectory improvement. During diffusion training, we propose a technique called $\textit{Preference Augmentation}$ to alleviate the problem of insufficient preference data. As a result, we surprisingly find that the model-generated trajectories not only exhibit increased preference and consistency with the real transition but also introduce elements of $\textit{novelty}$ and $\textit{diversity}$, from which we can derive a desirable policy through imitation learning. Experimental results on D4RL benchmarks demonstrate that FTB achieves a remarkable improvement compared to state-of-the-art offline PbRL methods. Furthermore, we show that FTB can also serve as an effective data augmentation method for offline RL.

### Summary
This paper introduces Flow-to-Better (FTB), a novel diffusion-based framework for offline preference-based reinforcement learning (PbRL). FTB optimizes policies at the trajectory level without Temporal Difference (TD) learning under inaccurate learned rewards. The method consists of three main components: Preference Augmentation, Generative Model Training, and Policy Extraction. Preference Augmentation is an innovative technique designed to alleviate the issue of insufficient preference labels in the approach. The generative model training employs a classifier-free diffusion model called Trajectory Diffuser to generate improved full-horizon trajectories conditioned on the less preferred ones. Finally, the policy extraction process applies imitation learning to derive a deployable policy from the generated trajectories.
Experimental results on three continuous control tasks from the D4RL benchmark demonstrate that FTB consistently outperforms previous offline PbRL methods. Furthermore, the authors show that the proposed trajectory diffuser in FTB can also be used as an effective data augmentation method for offline RL approaches.

### Strengths
1. The paper introduces a novel diffusion-based framework for offline preference-based reinforcement learning (PbRL) called Flow-to-Better (FTB), which optimizes policies at the trajectory level without Temporal Difference (TD) learning under inaccurate learned rewards. This approach is innovative and has the potential to improve the performance of offline PbRL methods.
2. The authors also show that the proposed trajectory diffuser in FTB can be used as an effective data augmentation method for offline RL approaches, further expanding the applicability of the method.

### Weaknesses
1. The paper focuses on just three continuous control tasks from the D4RL benchmark. Especially, these tasks are known to have simple reward functions [1,2,3], which makes reward learning trivial on these tasks. More specifically, the third dimension of the state ($v_x$) have a 0.99 correlation with the true reward regardless of the quality of the dataset. From the experiment, the simple baseline, IQL+$r_\psi$, performs well except for the Hopper task, which makes me doubt whether a fancy preference learning/augmentation module is necessary. I believe it would be beneficial to evaluate the method on other types of tasks or environments to demonstrate the proposed method's generalizability, including Antmaze, Maze2d and Meta-world [4] tasks.

2. The proposed method uses a diffusion model, which can be computationally heavy. It is unclear how much is the computation cost of the proposed method compared with previous ones. Also, it would be beneficial to ablate on the architecture and the hyperparameters (e.g., block numers $K$) to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed preference augmentation module.

### Questions
1. How does the proposed method perform on other tasks or environments like Antmaze, Maze2d and Meta-world?

2. How much is the computation overhead of the proposed method compared with baseline methods?

3. How do the architecture and hyperparameters of the preference augmentation module affect the final performance?

### Summary
This paper aims to solve the offline preference-based reinforcement learning issue. Different with prior works, this paper proposes a method named Flow-to-Better, which attempts to adopt the pairwise preference relationship to guide a generative model. Then, this work  introduces Preference Augmentation to alleviate the issue of insufficient preference labels. Further, this work explain how to derive a deployable policy and provide a full procedure. The authors conduct experiments in D4RL to verify the effectiveness of their method.

### Strengths
1. This paper written well and easy to follow. The structure of this paper is very clear.
2. This paper provide a new solution for OPBRL, that is use the less preferred trajectory to generate high preferred trajectory. Further, this work proposes two techinique to combine with the generative model method: (1) preference augmentation and (2) imitation-based policy extraction.

### Weaknesses
1. Although the authors tested their method, an important baseline is missing [1]. This work gives a ensemble-diversed-based OPBRL method. I ran this method on D4RL with IQL and was surprised to find that the effect was very good. It only required less than 5 queries to perform similarly to Oracle.

2. I have serious concerns about the author's experimental results. The correlation coefficient between the reward function in D4RL and the dimension of the observed speed in observation space is very high, so the OPBRL method only needs very few queries to perform very well on D4RL, and the method proposed by the author The superior performance of the method is difficult to measure on D4RL.

### Questions
Based on the above weakness, I have the following questions:

1. Can you compare with your method with [1] based on IQL in D4RL? 

2. Can you provide the correlation ratio between rewards and each dimension in observations in D4RL?

### Summary
The paper presents a method called Flow-to-Better (FTB) for offline preference-based reinforcement learning (PbRL). The main objective of offline PbRL is to address the challenges of designing rewards and the high costs of online interactions by providing agents with a fixed dataset containing human preferences between pairs of trajectories. Previous approaches in offline PbRL focus on recovering rewards from preferences and policy optimization using offline RL algorithms. However, accurately learning transition-wise rewards from trajectory-based preference labels can be challenging and lead to misguidance during training. To overcome this challenge, the FTB method leverages the pairwise preference relationship to generate higher-preference trajectories and improve trajectory-level policy behaviors. It uses a diffusion model in a conditional generation process to flow low-preference trajectories to high-preference trajectories. The method also incorporates Preference Augmentation to address the problem of insufficient preference data. The experimental results demonstrate that FTB outperforms previous offline PbRL methods and can serve as an effective data augmentation method for offline RL. The paper provides an introduction to reinforcement learning and discusses the challenges of crafting well-designed rewards. It explains the framework of offline PbRL, provides background information on diffusion models, and details the policy extraction and experimental procedure.

### Strengths
This paper introduces a novel method called Flow-to-Better (FTB) for offline preference-based reinforcement learning (PbRL). The paper addresses the problem of learning from preference feedback, where the goal is to learn a policy that maximizes a user's preferences. The key idea behind FTB is to iteratively refine a set of trajectories using a diffusion model, generating new trajectories that exhibit higher preferences. 

In terms of originality, FTB introduces a unique approach to offline PbRL by leveraging diffusion models. While previous work has explored the use of generative models for planning, FTB stands out by using the generative model to improve the quality of trajectories without the need for resource-intensive inference. This approach allows for end-to-end trajectory improvement and provides a new perspective on leveraging generative models in offline RL.

The quality of the paper is high, as it presents a well-defined problem formulation, a clear description of the proposed method, and thorough experimental evaluations. The authors provide detailed explanations of the different components of FTB, including the preference augmentation, trajectory diffuser, and policy extraction. The experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of FTB in various continuous control tasks, comparing it with state-of-the-art offline RL methods. The results show significant improvements in performance, highlighting the quality of the proposed approach.

The clarity of the paper is commendable. The authors provide clear definitions of key concepts and algorithms, making it easy to understand the proposed method. The paper is well-structured, with a logical flow of ideas and clear explanations of the experimental setup and results. The use of algorithms and figures further enhances the clarity of the presentation.

In terms of significance, the paper makes several contributions. Firstly, it introduces a new method, FTB, for offline PbRL that leverages diffusion models to improve the quality of trajectories. This provides a valuable approach for learning from preference feedback in RL settings. Secondly, the paper demonstrates the effectiveness of FTB through extensive experiments on continuous control tasks, showing significant improvements over state-of-the-art methods. This highlights the practical significance of the proposed approach.

### Weaknesses
One potential weakness of the paper is the lack of a detailed comparison with existing methods in the field of offline preference-based reinforcement learning (PbRL). While the paper provides comparisons with state-of-the-art offline RL methods, it would be beneficial to include a more comprehensive comparison with existing PbRL methods. This would help to establish the novelty and superiority of the proposed FTB method in the specific context of preference-based learning.

Additionally, the paper could benefit from a more thorough discussion of the limitations and potential drawbacks of the proposed method. While the experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of FTB in improving policy performance, it would be valuable to discuss scenarios or settings where FTB may not perform as well or potential challenges that may arise in its application. This would provide a more balanced perspective and help readers understand the practical limitations of the proposed approach.

Furthermore, the paper could provide more insights into the computational complexity and scalability of the FTB method. Since diffusion models can be computationally expensive, it would be helpful to discuss the computational requirements of the proposed method and any potential trade-offs between performance and computational efficiency. This would provide a clearer understanding of the practical feasibility of applying FTB to large-scale RL problems.

Lastly, the paper could benefit from a more detailed explanation of the hyperparameter choices and their impact on the results. While the paper mentions some hyperparameters, such as the number of flows and the BC constraint, it would be helpful to provide more insights into how these choices were made and their effects on the performance. This would allow readers to better understand the sensitivity of the method to different hyperparameter settings and potentially explore alternative choices in their own applications.

### Questions
1. Could you provide more insights into the computational complexity of FTB? 

2. Are there any specific scenarios or environments where FTB may not perform well? Providing a more comprehensive discussion on the limitations of FTB would help in understanding its practical applicability and potential areas for future improvement.

3. What are the key factors or design choices in FTB that contribute to its improved performance?
