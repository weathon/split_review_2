## Abstract
Training Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) on large-scale graphs is challenging. The main difficulty is to obtain accurate node embeddings while avoiding the neighbor explosion problem. Many of the existing solutions use historical embeddings to tackle this challenge. Specifically, by using historical embeddings for the out-of-batch nodes, these methods can approximate full-batch training without dropping any input data while keeping constant GPU memory consumption. However, it still remains nascent to specifically design a subgraph sampling method that can benefit these historical embedding-based methods. In this paper, we first analyze the approximation error of node embeddings caused by using historical embeddings for out-of-batch neighbors and prove that this approximation error can be minimized by minimizing the staleness of historical embeddings of out-of-batch nodes. Based on the theoretical analysis, we design a simple yet effective \underline{S}taleness score-based \underline{S}ubgraph \underline{S}ampling method (S3) to benefit these historical embedding-based methods. The key idea is to first define the edge weight as the sum of the staleness scores of the source and target nodes and then apply graph partitioning to minimize edge cuts, with each resulting partition as a mini-batch during training. In this way, we can explicitly minimize the approximation error of node embeddings. Furthermore, to deal with the dynamic changes of staleness scores during training and improve the efficiency of graph partitioning, we design a fast algorithm to generate mini-batches via a local refinement heuristic. Experimental results show that (1) our S3 sampling method can further improve historical embedding-based methods and set the new state-of-the-art, and (2) our fast algorithm is 3x faster than re-partitioning graph from scratch on the large-scale ogbn-products dataset with 2M nodes. In addition, the consistent improvements on all three historical embedding-based methods (GAS, GraphFM, and LMC) also show the generalizability of our subgraph sampling method.

### Summary
This paper presents S3, a sampling method for reducing approximation error incurred by stale embeddings. To do so, this work proposes re-partition paradigm so that a pair of neighbors are likely to be separated if their approximation errors are small. Experiments show that S3 can improve the accuracy of GAS, GraphFM, and LMC. S3 also theoretically proves that weighted aggregation can minimize the approximation error, but computing this set of weights is expensive.

### Strengths
1. The proposed approach is novel. Leveraging periodic graph partition to reduce staleness error is an interesting research direction.
2. Experimental results show that S3 consistently improves the accuracy of existing works.

### Weaknesses
1. Theorem 1 appears to be flawed. The proof in Appendix B establishes that the latter part is an upper bound of the former. However, minimizing the upper bound does not guarantee the minimization of the original expression. Therefore, the statement of Theorem 1 needs to be significantly weakened. Additionally, there's an inconsistency in the use of squared approximation error versus the approximation error itself in the expressions on pages 16 and 17. If this is not an error, a clear explanation of the derivation is required to justify the transition.

2. The performance gains are marginal. In most cases, the accuracy improvements are negligible, only appearing three digits after zero. For the method to have a practical impact, more substantial improvements are necessary.

3. The experimental evaluation needs improvement. (1) Table 1 lacks results for several cases, attributed to either non-reporting in the original papers or difficulty in reproduction. It is crucial to clarify which results fall into each category. For results difficult to reproduce, a detailed explanation of the encountered difficulties is needed. For unreported results, efforts should be made to conduct those experiments. At the very least, the results of the proposed method should be provided for these cases. (2) Despite claiming to support very large datasets, the datasets used are relatively small. The evaluation should include larger datasets like Papers-100M, MAG240, or IGB, which are commonly used in GNN training. However, it's worth considering the potential computational cost of graph partitioning on such large graphs. (3) To validate the necessity of partitioning adjustment, a more direct measure would be to quantify the portion of nodes that change their partition before and after the adjustment. (4) The influence of the number of partitions on the performance should be investigated and reported.

### Questions
1. For the first weakness, how is this step (line 16 in Algorithm 1) implemented? What's the processing time and memory requirement for computing this step? The draft only reports the overhead of graph partition but I feel that $L$ rounds of full-graph aggregation is more time-consuming than graph partition.

2. If periodical full-graph aggregation is required, please compare S3 with LLCG as it requires similar resources.

3. What's the performance of S3 on ogbn-papers100M?

4. What's the efficiency of S3+GAS and S3+GraphFM? Why S3 can improve the efficiency of LMC for some cases in Table 3?

5. Please show the convergence comparison between X with S3+X where X is any of the baselines you choose.

6. What is the underlying assumption about the aggregation function made in Theorem 1? I think it cannot be applied to Max and Min aggregations which are adopted in PNA.

7. How to determine $C$ in equation 3? If the expression is complex, please provide some high-level explanations so that the readers can better understand this theorem.

8. This is one minor question. I feel that Table 2 is not informative enough. Could you please compare the trend of the staleness score? You may refer to Figure 5 in [1].

### Summary
This paper proposes a novel Staleness score-based Subgraph Sampling method to benefit those historical embedding-based methods. The proposed method defines the edge weight as the sum of the staleness scores of the source and target nodes, and partitions the graph into mini-batches. Furthermore, to deal with the dynamic changes of staleness scores during training, the authors design a fast algorithm to generate mini-batch via a local refinement heuristic. Experiments demonstrated the efficiency of the proposed S3 method.

### Strengths
Strengths:
a)	The motivations of this work are clear.
b)	This paper has sufficient experiments, and the dataset used is relatively common.

### Weaknesses
Weaknesses:
a)	The backbone method GAS、GraphFM、LMC are all works done before, and the graph partitioning method is much like Minimum Cut algorithm which utilizes the weight of edges. And the refinement algorithm is also based on Kernighan-Lin algorithm.
b)	In Algorithm1, it computes full-neighborhood forward propagation, and calculates the staleness score for each node v in the graph. It will case exponential explosion problem as the author mentioned in the background section. So the paper is not technically sound.
c)	The improvement in model accuracy is limited.

### Questions
1. Are the hyperparameters setting optimal, and have you tried other hyperparameters settings?
2. Have you tested the time consumption and the memory consumption on your method? Is the computation time to compute full-neighborhood forward propagation and calculate the staleness score for each node v affordable? And will it occupy too much memory?
3. Have you compared the model accuracy your method get with the full-neighborhood model accuracy? Only applying full-neighborhood forward propagation will result in how much difference from the full-neighborhood model?
4. Is there a huge gap between the embedding h_v^l calculated by the model parameters θ updated from the staleness-based method and the node embedding  h_v^l calculated by the full-neighborhood model?

### Summary
This paper proposed a subgraph sampling method that can benefit historical embedding-based large-scale graph training method. This seems to be the first work considering what kind of subgraph sampling is better for historical embeddings. The authors design a staleness score for subgraph sampling and provide a simple heuristic algorithm for constructing mini-batches. Experimental results show that S3 improves the performance of three historical embedding-based methods.

### Strengths
s1.The motivation of the article is  reasonable, I agree with the authors' viewpoint that using simple methods like METIS to construct mini-batches is not suitable for historical embeddings.
s2.The analysis part about S3 sampling is reasonable, I believe it's a simple and effective method that can be applied to most historical embedding methods.
s3.From the experimental results, re-sampling does not require too much time, even without re-sampling, the performance of S3 sampling is acceptable.
s4.The ablation experiments have proven the effectiveness of S3 sampling.

### Weaknesses
w1.The improvement in accuracy of S3 sampling on some datasets, such as Reddit, is very small. This diminishes the necessity of S3 sampling.
w2.Section 3.3 about refinement is too briefly written, and its readability needs to be improved. I hope the authors can provide a more detailed explanation.

### Summary
This paper proposes S3, a staleness aware subgraph sampling method for GNN training on large graphs. It first shows that the final approximation error of node embedding is related to the error caused by stale embedding. Then, it uses the stale error of two nodes as the weight of an edge and conducts graph partitioning by minimizing the weight of the cross-partition edges. To reduce the overhead of graph partition, it proposes to adjust partition adjustment instead of running from scratch.

### Strengths
1.	The paper is well-written and easy to follow.
2.	The proposed method makes sense.

### Weaknesses
1.	Theorem 1 is wrong. First, Appendix B proves that the latter part is an upper bound of the former part. There is no guarantee that minimizing an upper bound for an expression (i.e., the latter part) will actually minimize the expression (the former part). Thus, Theorem 1 should be stated in much weaker form. Second, on the bottom of Page 16, the expressions use the squared approximation error, but on the top of page 17, it becomes the approximation error (without square for the Euclidean norm). If this is not a mistake, it should be made clear how the derivation works.
2.	The performance gain is very limited, and, in most cases, the improvements in accuracy happen only three digits after zero. To make a practical impact, much larger improvements are required.
3.	Experiment needs to be improved. (1) In Table 1, the results of many cases are missing, and the explanation is that these results are not reported in their original paper or difficult to reproduce. It should be made clear which results are not reported and which results are difficult to reproduce; for these difficult to reproduce, pls specify why; for these not reported, pls try the best to run the experiments, if you cannot, pls explain the specific reasons; at least provide the results of your method in these cases. (2) Although the paper claims to support very large datasets, the datasets used are actually quite small. Some large datasets are well-known for GNN training, e.g., Papers-100M, MAG240, and IGB. Pls consider using these datasets for the experiment. But I wonder if the many nodes in these graphs will make graph partitioning expensive. (3) To validate the necessity of partitioning adjustment, the authors make check the difference of a graph partition before and after the adjustment. This can be measured by the portion of nodes that change their partition. (4) The influence of the number of partitions.

### Questions
My primary concern of this paper is the limited accuracy gain, which makes the practical impact marginal.
