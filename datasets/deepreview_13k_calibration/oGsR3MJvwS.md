## Abstract
Recently, deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has shown promising results for learning fast heuristics to solve traveling salesman problems (TSP). Meanwhile, most existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) DRL methods yield solvers that do not generalize well on TSP instances larger than those seen during training. However, such generalization ability is crucial in practice since training on large instances is impractical. To tackle this issue, we propose a novel DRL method, called TS$^3$, which is designed to enforce a variety of (possibly approximate) invariances to promote the generalizability of the learned solver. More specifically, TS$^3$ applies a modified policy gradient algorithm enhanced with data augmentation to train a Transformer-based model to select the next city to visit among the k-nearest neighbors of the last visited city by integrating a local view and global view of a TSP instance. To further validate the capability of TS$^3$, we also propose its combination with Monte-Carlo Tree Search. Abundant experiments on random TSP and TSPLIB instances demonstrate that our propositions achieve a dominant performance when generalizing to large-sized TSPs.

### Confidence
3: You are fairly confident in your assessment. It is possible that you did not understand some parts of the submission or that you are unfamiliar with some pieces of related work. Math/other details were not carefully checked.

### Summary
The paper attempts to solve the generalization issue in TSP. Local and global policies are learned concurrently and the data augmentation is used to enhance the performance of TSP solver. In experiments, the proposed approaches show inferior to some compared approaches on small problem sizes and gain better generalization results on large problem sizes.

### Strengths
Generalization issue in TSP is a critical topic that relates to  large problem solving in real-world settings. This work solves TSP from the local and global views to enhance the generalization of TSP solver. At the same time, data augmentation is a commonly used approach to enhance the performance of neural networks and it is empirically effective to make the TSP solver more generalizable.

### Weaknesses
The related work is insufficient with too many highly related works not even mentioned. Many literature have applied different approaches to overcome the generalization issue for vehicle routing problems. Please refer to and discuss the highly related ones like
"Towards Generalizable Neural Solvers for Vehicle Routing Problems via Ensemble with Transferrable Local Policy" and "Towards Omni-generalizable Neural Methods for Vehicle Routing Problems".

The compared approaches are too old and can not represent the current best performance for TSP. More recent methods should ought to be compared to render the results more convincing. For instance, the aforementioned two papers already tackled large routing problems with thousands of nodes and achieved small gaps. A comparison to them is recommended to show the reliability of the approach here.

The data augmentation and different baseline functions have been widely studied in literature, degrading the significance of this work. The local and global policies are seen in aforementioned paper. The total novelty of this work is not noticeable. In this sense, more comparisons with recent approaches to fully validate the performance is important, which I think is inferior in this paper.

### Questions
1. What if POMO or PointerFormer are trained with data augmentation like rotations or scalings,  which are not special and may be easily applied for these baselines?
2. Since different techniques are added to enhance the generalization. Would these extra techniques obviously raise the training time? How long would it take to train a TS3 model?
3. I don't see any simple ways to extend the approaches to other vehicle routing problems. The authors may explain a bit how the data augmentation and neural network are to be applied to CVRP.

### Summary
The authors present an attention-based approach that solves the TSP using RL based on a well-known existing approach that can improve generalization to larger problem sizes than the ones trained on. They extend the architecture by including additional encodings of the nearest neighbors of the current last node during the generation of the tour. Additionally, they use data augmentation and exploiting invariance and MCTS. However, these techniques are not novel and have been applied to TSP.

### Strengths
S1 The approach can achieve SOTA performance in a specific setting.

### Weaknesses
W1 Two of the three primary contributions in this paper have been previously explored and are not considered novel (augmentation/invariance, MCTS). The remaining contribution, the encoding of the nearest neighbors, seems relatively straightforward.

W2 The experimental evaluation has several shortcomings. First, the generalization is only evaluated with instances trained on the TSP of size 50. It would be valuable to explore the model's performance across a broader range of problem sizes to gain a more comprehensive understanding of its capabilities.

W3 The paper imposes time limits on several close competitors, which raises questions about whether the proposed method is genuinely superior or simply optimized for a specific time constraint. A more thorough examination without the time limit would be valuable.

W4 Most of the ablation study is done with ts3, but it should be done with ts4 (the complete approach including MCTS).

* Furthermore, the ability of the method to achieve SOTA performance in the tsplib evaluation remains less clear (see appendix), especially since the closest competitor in the random tsp (AttGRCN+MCTS) is missing from the comparison.

### Questions
Q1. How would be the generalization look like if the approach is not only trained on size 50?

Q2. How would the competitors perform without the time limit?

5: You are absolutely certain about your assessment. You are very familiar with the related work and checked the math/other details carefully.

### Summary
In this paper, the authors extended the construction type of Transformer-based TSP solver for tackling large instances unseen during training, by coupling the original global view with a kNN based local view. They also extend such Transformer into the Heatmap based solver, which couples with the Monte-Carlo Tree Search. The proposed methods are evaluated on both synthetic instances and benchmark instances (TSPLib).

### Strengths
1- The method itself looks reasonable.
2- The paper is easy to follow.

### Weaknesses
While the paper is well motivated, its literature review and experimental comparison are extremely poor, which significantly diminishes the novelty and contribution.

Particularly, the main ideas of this submission is quite similar to some of them. Moreover, it seems the proposed approach is limited to TSP, especially when it is further converted to the heatmap based paradigm, which considerably harmed its applicability to different VRPs. Overall, I think this submission is far away from the standard of an ICLR publication.

### Summary
This paper studies the generalization of neural TSP solvers. The authors propose a Transformer Structured TSP Solver, which reduces the space of decision-making to the K-nearest neighbors of the current node. By further combining with data augmentation and MCTS, the proposed method (i.e., $TS^4$) could achieve superior generalization performance on large-scale TSP instances when only trained on TSP50.

### Strengths
* The motivation is clear. The studied topic (i.e., generalization) is important.
* The proposed method is sound to me. The authors claim three contributions, including (1) the local KNN view, (2) the modified training algorithm with data augmentations, and (3) the combination with MCTS.
* The empirical results look good. The source code is provided.

### Weaknesses
 * The scope of this paper is limited to TSP. Popular attention-based models (e.g., [1, 2]) could solve a wide range of VRP variants. It is suggested to (at least) include CVRP.

* Novelty:

  * I like the third contribution. Typically, MCTS mainly works with heat-map-based methods [3]. This paper demonstrates the potential of attention-based solvers [1, 2] with MCTS.
  * While the first two seem to be incremental since previous works have already explored them (e.g., [4]).

* The related work and baselines are too limited. This paper studies the generalization issue of DRL-based TSP solvers. Based on the ICLR policy, a comprehensive review and experimental comparison of the recent generalization studies (before June, 2023) is expected. Moreover, Concorde should be added in Table 1, and the gap should be computed w.r.t. its result.

* The justification for Figure 1 is weak.

  * Are you using instances following the uniform distribution? Does the conclusion or empirical observation still hold for other cases, e.g., instances with several clusters of customer nodes?

  * I somewhat don't agree with the conclusion of the right panel of Figure 1 (see below). Recent studies find that the adversarial perturbations [5, 6] may significantly change the optimal solutions of TSP instances. What if the added random perturbation coincides with the adversarial one?

    > "Small perturbations introduce small gaps, which can be regarded as exploiting approximate invariance."

* The problem formulation of TSP (with DRL) should be simple and concise, while the notations of this paper are wordy, making it unclear to the readers.

* Minor:

  * P3 of Introduction: "how (exact) invariance" -> should be approximate?
  * Report the total inference time on a test dataset is better.

### Questions
* The model does not have a normalization layer after the MHA and FF layers. Any explanations?
* For the baseline function, why not just use a simple average over the objective values of all augmented instances, as done in [2]?
* Is the proposed method empirically effective for cross-distribution generalization setting?
* What is the training complexity (e.g., time and GPU memory) of the proposed method, compared with baselines?
