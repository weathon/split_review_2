## Abstract
In this paper, we study neural network architectures that are robust to model inversion attacks. It is well-known that standard network architectures are vulnerable to model inversion, where an adversary can reconstruct images or data used to train the network by inspecting the network's output or the intermediate outputs from a single hidden network layer. Surprisingly, very little is known about how a network's architecture contributes to its robustness (or vulnerability). Instead, recent work on mitigating such attacks has focused on injecting random noise into the network layers or augmenting the training dataset with synthetic data. 

Our main result is a novel sparse coding-based network architecture, $Sparse$-$Guard$, that is robust to model inversion attacks. Three decades of computer science research has studied sparse coding in the context of image denoising, object recognition, and adversarial misclassification settings, but to the best of our knowledge, its connection to state-of-the-art privacy vulnerabilities remains unstudied. However, sparse coding architectures suggest an advantageous means to prevent privacy attacks because they allow us to control the amount of irrelevant private information encoded in a model's intermediate representations in a manner that can be computed efficiently during training, that adds little to the trained model's overall parameter complexity, and that is known to have little effect on classification accuracy. Specifically, we demonstrate that compared to networks trained with state-of-the-art noise-based or data augmentation-based defenses, $Sparse$-$Guard$ networks maintain comparable or higher classification accuracy while degrading state-of-the-art training data reconstructions by a factor of $1.2$ to $16.2$ across a variety of reconstruction quality metrics (PSNR, SSIM, FID) on standard datasets. We also show that $Sparse$-$Guard$ is equally robust to attacks regardless of whether the leaked layer is earlier or later, suggesting it is also an effective defense under novel security paradigms such as Federated Learning.

### Confidence
3: You are fairly confident in your assessment. It is possible that you did not understand some parts of the submission or that you are unfamiliar with some pieces of related work. Math/other details were not carefully checked.

### Summary
This paper proposes to defend against model inversion attacks by inducing sparse coding into DNNs. The key design is an alternating sparse coded and dense layers that discards private information. Experiments show effective defenses on MNIST and Fashion MNIST.

### Strengths
1. The method maintains great privacy with little training computation overhead and accuracy loss
2. A cluster-ready PyTorch codebase is provided for future study
3. The paper is well motivated and easy to follow

### Weaknesses
The major drawback is that the experiments are only conducted on simple, low-resolution datasets. I do not think the results in small datasets convincingly validate the effectiveness of the proposed method. There exist lots of model inversion attacks that are capable of extracting high-resolution data, from CIFAR-10, CelebA, to ImageNet. Since high-resolution images are much more valuable as training data, it is the high-resolution model inversion attacks that post private threats. And an effective defense would be significant in that case.

### Questions
Response to rebuttal: Thanks for the strong rebuttal with great efforts! I raised my score to 5 based on experiments on CIFAR10 and Plug-and-play advantage.

### Summary
The paper presents a novel architecture (Sparse-Guard) for defense against black-box model inversion attacks. It is demonstrated to be superior against state-of-the-art data augmentation and noise-injection-based defenses.

### Strengths
The paper, overall, is well-written and organized. The idea of interweaving sparse coding layers as a means of model-inversion attack is a novelty yet to be explored. Empirical analyses have also been provided to understand the mechanism behind the Sparse-Guard defense through UMAP 2D projections of output. Having openly accessible codebase is also a plus

### Weaknesses
The paper does not do a good job at the exposition of how sparse coding is implemented. This is especially important as the implementation here seems to be *convolutional* sparse coding and differs from traditional sparse coding where matrix multiplication rather than a convolution is applied. e.g. (Bristow, Hilton, Anders Eriksson, and Simon Lucey. "Fast convolutional sparse coding." Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition. 2013.)

Rozell et al. 2008 were cited for the update rule. However, in that paper, the update rule was not given for convolutional sparse coding. Either a more explicit derivation for the update rule can be given or a different citation would be relevant.

The sentence "The learned spatiotemporal representation closest to input image X is represented by this sparse presentation R_X" is confusing.
Why is it a spatiotemporal representation? Where is the temporal element, all of the inputs are static images. Should 'sparse presentation' also be sparse representation?

Multiple claims in the paper is made about sparse coding “removing unnecessary private information”. This claim is not really supported by any study. In fact, the empirical study concluded that the effect of sparse coding layers is an "unclustering effect". How the conclusion of jettisoning unnecessary information is unclear. What is considered unnecessary information in the first place? In fact, it would be interesting to see if any other algorithm that produces the same unclustering effect will provide a similar effectiveness in defense against model inversion attacks.

### Summary
The paper proposes SPARSE-GUARD, a neural network architecture that leverages sparse coding to defend against model inversion attacks. It inserts sparse coding layers between dense layers which help remove unnecessary private information about the training data. Through extensive experiments on MNIST and Fashion MNIST datasets, the paper shows SPARSE-GUARD provides superior defense compared to state-of-the-art techniques like data augmentation, noise injection and standard sparse coding, while maintaining high classification accuracy.

### Strengths
The key strengths are the novel approach of using sparse coding for privacy protection, and code is available for reproducibility.

### Weaknesses
1. The attacks used in this study do not represent state-of-the-art techniques [1, 2, 3], and the baseline defense methods employed also fall short of the current state-of-the-art [4]. Specifically, the model inversion attacks primarily focus on reconstructing images from intermediate feature representations, which differs substantially from typical model inversion attacks (MIAs) that aim to infer private training data from model outputs (soft or hard labels). This distinction is critical because the threat model and attack methodology are fundamentally different. The paper does not adequately address the applicability of their approach to the more common MIA scenarios. Furthermore, the defense baselines, such as simple data augmentation and noise injection, are not competitive with more advanced techniques that leverage adversarial training or information-theoretic principles.
2. The study relies solely on synthetic datasets like MNIST and FMNIST, lacking the inclusion of real-world datasets, such as facial recognition data, which could enhance the practical relevance of the findings. Evaluating the proposed method on datasets like CelebA, which are commonly used in the model inversion literature, would provide a more robust assessment of its effectiveness against realistic threats.

### Summary
The paper investigates the effectiveness of sparse coding-based network architectures as a defense against model inversion attacks (MIAs). More specifically, the approach uses sparse-coded layers in the beginning of a network to control and limit the amount of private information contained in those layers' output features. As a consequence, black-box model inversion attacks in a split-network setting should no longer be able to reconstruct the original (private) input features based on the intermediate outputs of the model. When compared to existing defense strategies (adding Gaussian noise to intermediate activations and augmenting training data with GAN-generated images), the proposed defense outperforms those strategies on the MNIST and Fashion MNIST datasets.

### Strengths
- Applying sparse coding-based networks to limit the information contained in the features of later layers in a network is an interesting and novel research direction, not only in the model inversion setting. I think the same approach might even be used in other privacy settings, e.g., membership inference attacks. I do not expect the paper to investigate these settings, just want to highlight possible extensions.
- The results on MNIST and Fashion MNIST state a clear improvement above existing methods and promise better training-time efficiency. This is also underlined by the qualitative samples depicted in the paper.
- The approach is well motivated, and the paper is overall well written.

### Weaknesses
 - The evaluation is rather limited since it only conducts experiments on MNIST and Fashion MNIST, both datasets which are easy to fit by a network due to the overall low sample variance. Finding meaningful shared features in the sparse code layers is rather easy for the model. Also, the samples contain no private information at all. The evaluation should also contain more complex dataset evaluations, e.g., the common CelebA dataset, to prove that the approach is also usable within more complex tasks. Also, repeating the experiments with different seeds to provide a standard deviation of the results would make the evaluation more reliable.
- The overall evaluation setting seems a bit strange. I understand the split-network setting and that reconstructing inputs given only the intermediate activations indeed can be a privacy breach. But why should the adversary have access to the activations of the training samples? I think a more realistic evaluation should consider unseen (test) samples and then try to reconstruct those given the intermediate activations.
- Moreover, I think the approach should also be evaluated on common MIAs that utilize GANs to reconstruct training samples based only on the network's weights, e.g., [1, 2, 3]. Otherwise, the defense mechanisms should be positioned only for split-network (and federated learning) settings. Also, the approach should be compared to related information bottleneck defense approaches [4,5].
- I think the overall technical contribution is rather low since the approach seems to be simply re-using the sparse coding layer framework of Rozell et al. (2008) and demonstrating that such networks can also act as a defense against MIAs. I still think the direction of the paper is interesting but the technical novelty seems limited.
- The related work is comprehensive but mixes up different model inversion settings and approaches. For example, the [1] proposes MIAs that try to reconstruct features from specific classes by optimizing the latent vectors of a GAN. It uses the target model for guidance (and there exist much more works in this line of research, e.g., [2,3]). This is a completely different setting from the one investigated by the paper, which uses the intermediate activations of training samples to train a decoder-like model. I think a clearer separation between different types of MIAs would make the related work part stronger. Also, mixing works investigating the memorization of training samples in LLMs with vision-based inversion attacks might be confusing to the reader.

Small remarks:
- Table captions should be above the table (Table 1)
- The space after Table 2 should be increased (and manipulating the spaces might even run counter to the official guideline!)

### Questions
- How much longer does it take to train a network using the Sparse-Guard architecture compared to a model without it?
- Why is the FID metric valid to evaluate the privacy leakage? Generally, we are interested in how well a single sample can be reconstructed and less about recovering the overall feature distribution.
