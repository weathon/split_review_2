## Abstract
In reinforcement learning, Transformers have been shown to be powerful models for multi-task policy distillation and, to a lesser extent, policy improvement via return interventions within frameworks such as Decision Transformers. These recent results are somewhat atypical for reinforcement learning, as they do not rely on the learning of a value function, which is usually at the heart of most traditional approaches. In this paper, we explore a principled approach to purely generative value function approximation with Transformers, opening the way for existing techniques to be applied for policy improvement. Importantly, unlike other RL methods, this generative approach allows us to kickstart the learning process by fine-tuning strong pretrained state predictors, such as foundation models, substantially shortening the training time. We showcase the potential of our approach by constructing an action-value function for chess that can play at the level of an expert human and over 400 Elo stronger than direct behavioural cloning.

### Summary
The paper aims to study the potential of transformers to estimate value function. This is done via a generative approach to distributional reinforcement learning (RL). The approach is evaluated on chess and gridworld environments.

### Strengths
* The paper aims to develop a value-based RL method by blending a generative decomposition of distributional RL, which is interesting.
* The paper claims that the proposed method allows the use of pre-trained (foundation) models for value-based RL.
* The method is tested on chess and gridworld environments.

### Weaknesses
 * The paper feels like a proof-of-concept:
	* The proposed method does not conclusively answer the question asked in the paper (about the Value Function Hypothesis).
	* The proposed method does not beat a baseline (a superiority of discriminative methods was observed).
* Section 3
	* The paragraph "connecting value function to the logarithmic loss" is unclear. 
		* The promised connection is not very transparent.
		* A statement claiming that a set of augmented states converges to a stationary distribution is confusing (it seems like a "type mismatch" problem).
	* Section 3, paragraph "discriminative and generative decompositions" 
		* The decomposition approach is confusing
			* The main components are $\xi(s|a,z)$ and $\xi(z|a)$. Both are rather unorthodox when it comes to RL: the former requires the knowledge of future returns ($z$), and the latter gives the distribution over returns only given an action (without knowledge of the state $s$).
			* How are such objects used for inference? A pseudo-code could improve the clarity here.
		* Discussion following eq 3 is unclear (e.g., why is $\hat{\xi}(s|a,z)$ good and $\hat{\xi}(z|s,a)$ bad?)
		* There should be an assumption that $|\mathcal Z|<\infty$.
* Experiments:
	* Section 5.1:
		* The evaluation protocol is confusing:
			* Is the computation of ELO metric and early stopping rule described in the "main result" standard? Is there a citation that one can refer to?
			* In the last sentence of paragraph "dataset", it is written that models are evaluated on ~24K boards. Where is it reflected in the paper (Table 1 says about 800 games, roughly 50 for each pair of agents, or computing metrics on 28K boards)
		* Table 1 implies that the generative approach has ELO roughly smaller than 100 when compared to the discriminative approach.  According to the table's caption, the latter is twice as likely to win. This seems to conflict with the statement that "the two main decompositions are close in performance".
		* The results of the ablation part are not very informative (what is the main conclusion? are the conclusions for smaller models also valid for larger ones?). It seems more like content for the Appendix.
	* Section 5.2 (gridworlds). 
		* Experiments do not seem very informative, showing that it is impossible to discriminate between the methods significantly.
		* The (online) training protocol could be better explained (e.g., in the form of a pseudo-code).
		* It is curious that using a constant uniform return model does not impact the learning dynamics. It would be interesting to see the results in similar environments where this is not the case.
	* Other:
		* The paper often first describes what did not work and then what was done. For example, eq (3) or the second paragraph in Section 4 "return-action conditioning". While the information about what did not work is very valuable in machine learning, it could be gathered in a separate place and could possibly be put in the Appendix.

### Summary
This work shows how to estimate the action value function through both discriminative decomposition and Bayesian generative decomposition with the transformer architecture. The generative approach enables fine-tuning of pre-trained foundational models, resulting in enhancement of learning speed and performance. The study conducted comprehensive empirical experiments in chess for policy evaluation and in gridworlds for policy improvements, showcasing the potential of using the generative approach for value estimation.

### Strengths
- Since decision transformer is a goal-conditional offline RL algorithm and the transformer itself acts as a policy. It's natural to question whether value function estimation still has value. This is a pilot work for action value estimation using transformer. It provides insights into the validity of the value function hypothesis given the powerful transformer architecture and the feasibility of finetuning a pretrained foundation model to enhance the learning process and performance. 
- Although the generative decomposition idea is not new, previous work only applied to simplified environments. This work demonstrates the efficacy of the discriminative & generative decomposition of the return function (for value estimation) together with the training of transformer in the complex chess environment. It showed an expert-level chess agent can be learned. This work could inspire readers to explore new research in this direction.
- There are several technical details and ablation studies I found to be valuable for practitioners.  Such as the tradeoff of number of return buckets and the way to condition return and action for state. I wish the authors could release the code upon publication.

### Weaknesses
1. There is lack of summary of distributional RL in the related work.
2. Page 4, MDP M = (S, A, \mu),  \mu is the transition probability kernel in the CNC paper, should use \mathcal{P} here.
3. The paper focuses on comparing discriminative and generative decomposition of \xi (z | s, a) for estimating the value function. Yet it's not clear how well the value-based approach compared to the decision transformer approach which directly updates the policy.  I suggest adding these experiments for a more comprehensive comparison.
4. The major limitation of this paper is, although it provides some evidence and insights, showing the potential of estimating value function using RL, it's not conclusive whether the value function hypothesis is true. The behavior cloning baseline is too weak to reach a conclusion. Also, the generative approach has not shown advantage over discriminative decomposition, even that it was finetuned on a strong foundation model. This work brings more questions than answers and I do wish there are more answers resolved in this paper.

### Questions
1. Figure 3 shows training from scratch does take more training boards to reach the same level of return log loss, but it's not straightforward quantitively how finetuning "substantially shorting the training time". Can you elaborate?
2. In Figure 4, it's said that a constant uniform return model \xi (z | a) does not have a big impact on the learning dynamics. But it seems it causes more oscillation in the Key-Door and Grass-Sand environments and it does have a big impact on dynamics. Could you provide more explanations?
3. Could you run experiments on decision transformers and show how the value-based approach compares to the policy-based approach? If we want to validate the value function hypothesis, shouldn't we collect evidence that the value-based discriminative / generative decomposition is better than policy-based approach?
4. I might miss it, but how does the finetuned generated decomposition approach compared to discriminative decomposition in the experiments?

### Summary
This paper tries to compute value functions using transformers (rather than a purely policy-based method as it is the main approach in the recent literature of using transformers for RL). A secondary claim is that the presented method enables using pre-trained models to speed up and improve performance of value learning.

### Strengths
Using Bayes rule and learning the components seems to be novel in the context of training transformers for value estimation.

### Weaknesses
 - The paper spends a lot of space discussing basics (more than 4 pages), then a tiny section on the methods, which is supposed to be the main part. In particular, the section on "Objective Functions" is unclear. The authors have used statements like "X is better than Y" at times with little reasoning. I would strongly suggest to shorten introduction and basics, and add discussions to support such statements, either formal or at least through toy examples with reasonable explanations. 

- The chess player agents using supervised learning are still quite important benchmarks to compare against (the authors named them in the second last paragraph of the related work section). Indeed, this is the only way to prove RL is a requirement and rebuttal recent voices that supervised learning reins supreme. Once you learn the value function, its corresponding updated policy (greedy or Boltzmann) can be compared against such agents. Or at the very least, their Elo scores can be compared.

- Page 4 --> Is it required to have only one communicating class for this discussion to be true? If yes, it needs to be set as an assumption (with a discussion on resultant limitations as most practical domains violate this).

- The counting method used to train the action-conditioned model seems to work only because the MDP is not discounted, otherwise it could be unlikely to have a $n_{za}$ more than 2. 

- Page 5, the first paragraph of Return-Action Conditioning --> it is said that all the information in $\xi(s)$ is completely irrelevant to estimating the $Q$ function. It then follows that all such information is also irrelevant to $\xi(s|a,z)$ as well (as it is part of $Q$). Why?? 

- Then, in the Pretraining paragraph, the authors say: training $\hat{\xi}(s|a,z)$ is related to $\hat{\xi}(s)$ (which is what I expected in the first place). This is contrary to their previous claim.

4: You are confident in your assessment, but not absolutely certain. It is unlikely, but not impossible, that you did not understand some parts of the submission or that you are unfamiliar with some pieces of related work.

### Summary
The authors apply the idea of a *generative value function decomposition* (from Veness et al, 2015): Instead of learning the *discriminative* $p(z|s,a)$ for return $z$ directly, they apply the Bayes formula for $p(z|s,a) = p(s|z, a)p(z|a) / \sum\limits_{z'}p(s|z', a)p(z'|a)$ and represent $p(s|z, a)$ by a transformer, and $p(z|a)$ by a simple statistical model.

They claim that this brings the benefit of using pretrained models for $p(s)$ which can be fine-tuned towards $p(s|z,a)$.  

Evaluation is done on both policy evaluation and policy improvement on chess.

### Strengths
Given the huge success of foundation models, the motivation of being able to use a pre-trained foundation model that can effectively be fine-tuned towards value-estimation is very strong.

### Weaknesses
I have several open questions (please see below).

Additionally, the experimental results are interesting, but not convincing w.r.t the strength of the generative model and in particular fine-tuning only seems to provide very marginal gains.

Furthermore, the authors claim that "Our results support the Value Function Hypothesis, in the sense that the generative value function approximation techniques produce far better policies than behavioral cloning". 
I don't think BC is the right comparison as it does not make use of the reward at all. In my opinion, a more suitable comparison would e.g. be the decision transformer which still makes use of rewards, but without using a value function as an intermediate step.

### questions:
 ### Clarification

You write that "The key advantage of generative methods for RL is the generality and flexibility that comes with using auto-regressive sequence modeling techniques to deal with both multi-modal, high dimensional, and potentially messy state spaces with atypical structures that make feature-based learning techniques difficult to apply." 

I'm not sure I understand what you mean and it seems to be an important part of the motivation for your work; could you please expand on this?

### Architecture

Could you please give a more precise (mathematical?) description of the architecture you are using, in particular how you implement return- and action conditioning as I'm unsure how to understand the explanation given in the text.

### Use of Transformers

Why is the use of transformers in your work necessary? As I understand it, you are learning simply a return-action conditioned density model over states, which could be represented by any network (including e.g. an MLP or a CNN for a suitably encoded state $s$). On the other hand, transformers shine especially for sequence modeling - but as far as I understand the work, you are only modeling individual states, not sequences of states? Please correct me if I misunderstood this.

### On the loss

You claim that if the state model is tabular, the two losses are equivalent. While I'm not sure which two losses you mean, I don't see how it would be equivalent to either of them. Could you please expand on your explanation?

### Summary
The paper present a method that uses transformers for generative value function approximation in reinforcement learning. The method relies on generative decomposition of the RL objective and on using pre-trained transformers to accelerate the learning process. The authors show experimental results of their method on both policy evaluation and policy improvement.

### Strengths
The paper is well written, well presented and the authors have made substantial effort on the experiment side. The contributions appear to be somewhat original although they do built upon the work of Veness et al. 2015. The experimental results are well-presented and conveincing.

### Weaknesses
I do not think that the paper has suffecient contributions for ICLR. There are not foundemental contributions on the theory side. The only contribution appears to be on the method side. The authors seem to use foundation models to approximate the state distribution. I am not sure how novel or impactful that is.

On the practical side, it appears that the authors have made quite some effort in the experiments. However, they do not compare their method/results with any similar methods which makes is hard to assess whether there is any improvements compared to the state of the art. Also, for a paper that's such heavilly application-oriented, I'd expect to see clean, well-documented source code in the supplementary material.

### Questions
You claim that the objective in eq. 3 does not lead to good results. Is this your finding or known from the literature? Please explain and provide a citation if needed. 

At the end of page 4, you say that part of the contribution is to revisit the hypothesis that the generative decomposition is superior to the discriminative one, from Veness et al. 2015. Based on the results shown on Table 1, this hypothesis is not true, right? Please discuss and explain in more detail why that is. 

At the end of page 1, you mention that the transformer based architecture accelerates the value function approximation. I did not see any results to backup this claim.
