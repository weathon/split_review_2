## Abstract
This paper contributes a new approach for distributional reinforcement learning which 
elucidates a clean separation of transition structure and reward in the learning process. Analogous to how the successor representation (SR) describes the expected consequences of behaving according to a given policy, our distributional successor measure (SM) describes the distributional consequences of this behaviour.
We formulate the distributional SM as a distribution over distributions and provide theory connecting it with distributional and model-based reinforcement learning.
Moreover, we propose an algorithm that learns the \absobj from data by minimizing a two-level maximum mean discrepancy. Key to our method are a number of algorithmic techniques that are independently valuable for learning generative models of state.
As an illustration of the usefulness of the \absobj, we show that it
enables zero-shot risk-sensitive policy evaluation in a way that was not previously possible.

### Summary
They investigate the distributional counterpart of discounted occupancy measures, which they refer to as the distributional success measure (DSM). Leveraging the forward Bellman equation for DSM, they introduce a novel approach for approximating DSM. Their approach entails modeling DSM as a collection of generative models, referred to as $\delta$-models, and employing a maximum mean discrepancy as a loss function to quantify the dissimilarity between "distributions over distributions" stemming from the Bellman equation.

### Strengths
Their research problem is both intriguing and relatively novel within the RL community. Their approach to estimating DSM appears to be innovative, although I do have some fundamental concerns that I will address later.

### Weaknesses
I have some reservations regarding the current proposed methods.  
* Firstly, it remains unclear why equal weights are utilized in equation (10). It seems plausible that we should consider learning these weights. Specifically, the representation of the distributional success measure (DSM) as an equally weighted particle set may be overly restrictive. The choice of equal weights implicitly assumes that each particle contributes equally to the overall distribution, which may not accurately capture the underlying structure of the DSM. A more flexible approach would involve learning the weights associated with each particle, allowing the model to adapt to the varying importance of different regions in the space of occupancy measures. This could potentially lead to a more accurate and efficient representation of the DSM.
* Secondly, there is a lack of guidance on selecting the value of  $m$ in equation (10), or determining how many $m$ values are required. The number of particles, $m$, directly impacts the approximation quality of the DSM. However, the paper does not provide a clear methodology for determining an appropriate value for $m$. A small value of $m$ may lead to a poor approximation of the true DSM, while a large value of $m$ could result in increased computational cost and potential overfitting. The absence of a principled approach for selecting $m$ makes it difficult to apply the proposed method effectively in practice. Furthermore, it is unclear whether a single value of $m$ is sufficient or if multiple values should be considered, and if so, how these values should be chosen.
* Thirdly, there appears to be a dearth of theoretical justification for the effectiveness of this modeling and approximation approach. While equation (10) may seem suitable if it exactly represents the true SDM, practical implementation would not align with this ideal scenario. The authors propose modeling the DSM as a collection of generative models and using a maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) loss. However, there is no theoretical analysis to support the convergence or optimality of this approach. It is unclear whether the MMD loss is an appropriate measure of dissimilarity for distributions over distributions, and whether the proposed training procedure will converge to a meaningful solution. The lack of theoretical guarantees raises concerns about the reliability and robustness of the method.

### Questions
* Questions are written in a previous paragraph. 

* Let's say we have X = {0,1} (binary). Then, a set of $P(X)$ is parametrized by just one parameter $\mu \in [0,1]$. Sp, $P(P(X))$ is a set of distributions over $[0,1]$. So, if I understand correctly, learning SDM is equivalent to estimating a distribution over  $[0,1]$. Even in this simple case, does the author's approach have any theoretical guarantee? (finite $m$ and equal weights look restrictive?)


### Suggestion for presentation 

* Equation (4) may appear somewhat elementary to researcher within the RL community. The current phrasing, such as "Blier et al. 2021 derived this equation...," seems inaccurate and should be revised. I believe that this equation had already gained widespread recognition prior to the work of Blier et al. (2021), as it is commonly featured in numerous standard RL texts and papers.

* As a related point, I generally believe the author should not emphasize whether the definition pertains to discrete or continuous spaces to such an extent. The transformation from a discrete space (when a base measure is the counting measure) to a continuous space (when the base measure is a Lebsgue measure)  is typically straightforward for individuals with a basic understanding of probability. Therefore, in Section 3.2, the statement "though this result is novel in the case of more general state spaces" may be somewhat misleading. I suggest that this aspect should not be categorized as "novel." Instead, I recommend that the author simply highlight the distinctions between the two contexts (SDM and standard distribution RL with rewards).

* It is somewhat unclear which parameters are precisely optimized throughout the entire algorithm. As I understand it, the author optimizes parameters for all generative models simultaneously in equation (16). It would be beneficial to present the algorithm using an algorithmic environment for clarity.

### Summary
This paper introduces a novel distributional RL algorithm that learns the distributional successor measure from training samples. This method allows a clean separation of transition structure, i.e., state occupancy measure, and reward, enabling zero-shot risk-sensitive policy evaluation.

### Strengths
1. The proposed method cast the problem of learning the return distribution into learning the distribution of random occupancy measure, decoupling the transition structure and reward functions and thus enabling zero-shot risk-sensitive policy evaluation. In this sense, the proposed method is novel.

2. This paper presented a practical algorithm for training the $\delta$-models, adopting diverse generative models to approximate the distribution of random occupancy measure. The training procedure itself has merit and can be potentially beneficial to the other distribution estimation tasks.

### Weaknesses
1. Similar to the conventional successor feature and successor measure, the decoupling of the transition structure and reward functions still assumes a fixed policy and transition dynamic, limiting the usefulness of the proposed method.

2. The usefulness of the distributional SM is quite limited at this point. I would recommend discussing more about the potential applications of the learned distributional SM other than the zero-shot distributional policy evaluation.

### Questions
Will the setting of $\gamma = 0.95$ limit the usefulness of the proposed method in practice when we care about the return of a long episode?

### Summary
This paper extends the successor representation to distributional RL, and proposes the $\delta$-model that learns the distributional successor measure.

### Strengths
The idea of combining distribution RL with successor representation is interesting, which combines the merits of both SR and distributional RL. I think this is a promising and important direction. The theoretical analysis is sound.

### Weaknesses
The experiment benchmark (windy grid world) is somehow toy compared with other distributional RL papers.

### Questions
1. As for Eq.7, are there any requirements for the reward function $r$ besides deterministic? For instance, does it require $r$ to be linear? BTW, is $r$ assumed to be known in experiments?

2. Can you further discuss the relationship between previous work like Zhang et al 2021b, which also learn multi-dimensional return distribution via MMD?

3. For distributional RL papers, a common benchmark is visual input environments like Atari. I think current benchmark (windy gridworld) is somehow toy. It will be helpful to see experiments with larger scale. What’s more, besides zero-shot policy evaluation, another advantage of SR is multitask training. Can the proposed method be combined with the multitask training?

### Summary
The paper proposes a distribution version of success feature, coined as the successor measure. The successor measure is defined as, conditioned on an initial state $x$, the Dirac distribution conditioned on a random trajectory induced by the policy. The paper proposes the Bellman backup of such successor measure, and proposes a recipe to estimate such successor measure using the proposed $\delta$-model. Finally the paper evaluates the proposed method on some simple environments.

### Strengths
1. The paper proposes a new method for distributional RL by estimating the occupancy measure of the policy, instead of its expectation, which seems like a natural way for the problem (vs. measuring the distribution of the value function.)

2. The paper includes good explanations for the new mathematical definitions which help the reviewer to understand the new concepts.

### Weaknesses
1. A few concepts are quite confusing along the paper. First, why is it necessary to redefine the occupancy measure/state(-action) distribution as successor representation or successor measure? The paper does not adequately motivate this redefinition, especially given the existing literature on occupancy measures. The connection to the discounted occupancy measure is mentioned, but the specific advantages of framing it as a 'successor' measure, particularly in a distributional context, are not made clear. This makes the theoretical contribution seem incremental rather than novel.

Second, the introduction of the "random occupancy measure" is not well-justified. While it is presented as a distribution over distributions, the inner distribution being a Dirac distribution determined by the outer distribution's sample seems unnecessarily complex. The paper does not clearly explain why a distribution over the value function cannot be directly derived from the standard occupancy measure by projecting onto the reward vector, as suggested by prop. 1. The use of the random occupancy measure adds an extra layer of abstraction that is not sufficiently motivated, and the theoretical results appear to be a straightforward extension of existing occupancy measure results.

Overall, the theory results are rather limited. Most results seem like straight forward extension from the occupancy measure results to the random occupancy measure version. 

2. The significance of section 5.2 is unclear to me. The discussion on tuning MMD parameters, especially the detailed explanation of the median trick, feels tangential to the core contribution of the paper. While kernel optimization is important, its detailed treatment here does not directly enhance the understanding of the proposed distributional successor measure. The section lacks a clear explanation of why these specific MMD tuning details are crucial for the proposed method, and how they differ from standard MMD optimization techniques.

3. Since the theory contribution is rather limited, the experiment of the paper should be greatly improved. First, the paper should compare with other distribution RL methods, and the current benchmarks are also pretty easy. The lack of comparison with established distributional RL algorithms makes it difficult to assess the practical advantages of the proposed method. The current experiments on simple environments do not provide sufficient evidence to support the effectiveness and scalability of the approach.
