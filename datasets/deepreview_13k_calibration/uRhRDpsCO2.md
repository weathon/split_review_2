- Decision: Reject
- Avg Score: 4.75

## Abstract
Black-box query-based attacks constitute significant threats to Machine Learning as a Service (MLaaS) systems since they can generate adversarial examples without accessing the target model's architecture and parameters. Traditional defense mechanisms, such as adversarial training, gradient masking, and input transformations, either impose substantial computational costs or compromise the test accuracy of non-adversarial inputs. To address these challenges, we propose an efficient defense mechanism, MATT, that employs random patch-wise purifications with an ensemble of lightweight purification models. These models leverage the local implicit function and rebuild the natural image manifold with low inference latency. Our theoretical analysis suggests that this approach slows down the convergence of query-based attacks while preserving the average robustness improvement by combining randomness and purifications. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet validate the effectiveness of our proposed purifier-based defense mechanism, demonstrating significant improvements in classifier robustness against query-based attacks.

### Confidence
4: You are confident in your assessment, but not absolutely certain. It is unlikely, but not impossible, that you did not understand some parts of the submission or that you are unfamiliar with some pieces of related work.

### Summary
The paper proposes to defend black-box attacks by input purification. The key design is a random patch-wise strategy with an ensemble of lightweight purification models. The authors theoretically explain the effectiveness of the method. Results on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet show the usefulness of the method.

### Strengths
1.	It is the first work, to my knowledge, to induce purification for black-box defense
2.	The paper makes some modifications to purification compared to existing methods
3.	The organization is good and it gives a good survey of this task

### Weaknesses
1. I cannot see a clear motivation from the design to the goal. The existing purification defense is for white-box attacks, and to do black-box attacks, why do the authors design a random patch-wise image purification mechanism using the local implicit function? The method seems to be a lot of improvements in purification and the design enables theoretical analysis of query-based attacks. But the technical contribution does not directly serve the goal: you can also use it to increase the robustness against white-box attacks. In 4.1, the motivation is claimed to be an ensemble multiple purifier & adversarial examples are in low-D manifold, which is about the general defense for all attacks, not motivated for query-based attacks.

2. The method also hurts accuracy. It would be helpful to study the trade-off between accuracy and defense performance in (5)

3. The presentation of the method details is not very clear.

### Questions
Response to rebuttal: Thanks for providing a strong rebuttal with good modifications. The motivation is clear now: For a defense without hurting accuracy, purification is induced with theoretical analysis that multiple purifiers are needed. To address the efficiency issue of ensembling multiple purifiers, the proposed method is presented. But my concerns remain because the method does NOT hurt the minimum accuracy as claimed, especially for low-res images when the purification blurs the input. According to the new results, 86% accuracy for CIFAR-10 is obtained, which is lower than adversarial training. The reported "random noise input" clean accuracy (78%) is also significantly lower than the original paper (93.6%). Therefore, I keep my score.

### Summary
The paper proposes a defense mechanism called MATT to address the threat of query-based black-box attacks. MATT employs random patch-wise purification and an ensemble of purification models. It slows down the convergence of query-based attacks and enhances the robustness of classifiers by combining randomness and purification. Extensive experiments confirm the effectiveness of the proposed method.

### Strengths
- The paper is skillfully composed, and I grasped its content effortlessly.
- The theoretical analysis is solid. The analysis of the Single Deterministic Purifier and the Pool of Deterministic Purifiers in Section 4.3 is brilliant.
- The experimental results show improvements compared to the competing algorithm

### Weaknesses
 - Local implicit functions have already been employed to defend against adversarial attacks, and the proposed method of using local implicit functions to randomly purify patches in images lacks novelty.
- Randomness can disrupt gradient estimation and, as a result, interfere with gradient-based attacks, which is expected and didn't provide me with significant insights.
- The paper does not adequately address the computational overhead associated with the ensemble of purification models. While random patch-wise purification may reduce the cost, the need to maintain and apply multiple purification models still introduces a significant computational burden, especially for high-resolution images or real-time applications. This aspect requires more detailed analysis and discussion.
- The theoretical analysis, while solid, primarily focuses on the convergence of attacks. It lacks a deeper exploration of the trade-offs between robustness and accuracy. It is unclear how the proposed method affects the classifier's performance on clean data, and this aspect should be investigated more thoroughly.

### Questions
- In the second paragraph of Section 1, should "extremely low" be changed to "extremely high"?
- In Section 4.3, "the robustness of the system is averaged across different purifiers" implies what? It lacks explanation.

### Confidence
3: You are fairly confident in your assessment. It is possible that you did not understand some parts of the submission or that you are unfamiliar with some pieces of related work. Math/other details were not carefully checked.

### Summary
This paper introduces MATT, an efficient defense method that uses random patch-wise purifications with lightweight purification models, able to slow down query-based attacks' convergence and enhance classifier robustness. The approach is better than traditional defenses like adversarial training and gradient masking which are either computationally expensive or reduce the accuracy of non-adversarial inputs. Through theoretical verification and empirical experiments on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet, the paper confirm its effectiveness.

### Strengths
+ The paper is well written and easy to follow.
+ The theoretical contribution is effectively supports the claims made in the paper.
+ The empirical results are promising and indicate the potential effectiveness of the proposed defense mechanism.

### Weaknesses
 - Some figures in the paper are unclear and difficult to understand, which can hinder readers' comprehension of the research.
- The defense mechanism and its components appear to be incremental improvements on existing methods rather than introducing a truly novel approach. It could benefit from a more innovative perspective.

- Figure 3 lacks a clear explanation for the small batch of examples shown in (II). It would greatly benefit the readers if this could be clarified in the Figure.
- In Figure 4, there is a reference to "Attack during Training" phase, but it's not clear whether adversarial training is conducted. Could you please provide more details on this matter?
Generally, the figures used in the paper do not effectively convey the ideas or methods, and they need improvement to enhance the paper's accessibility.

- In Section 4.2, most of the design elements mentioned do not appear to offer significant contributions. They seem more like incremental improvements built upon the DISCO paper. For instance, the removal of positional encoding and local ensemble inference does not constitute a major innovative contribution, and some modifications in the "Random Patch-wise Purification" section seem more like workarounds than novel contributions.

Some typos: 
  - there is no $\gamma$ in Eq (5) but the following description mentioned, I think it should be $\lambda$
  - CICAR-10 ==> CIFAR-10

### Summary
It proposes MATT, that employs random patch-wise purifications with an ensemble of lightweight purification models. These models leverage
the local implicit function and rebuild the natural image manifold with low inference latency.

### Strengths
It provides a theoretical analysis on the effectiveness of the proposed purifier-based defense mechanism based on the convergence of black-box attacks. The theoretical analysis points out the potential vulnerabilities of deterministic transformation functions and suggests
the robustness of the system increase with the number of purifiers.

### Weaknesses
The presentation can be improved. There are some typos, such as 'CICAR-10 and ImageNet' above the conclusion section. It introduces the  PRELIMINARIES in section 3 with some equations. But it seems that section 3 is not necessary as the equations are not used and the attacks are easy to follow. Since it puts many information to the appendix, maybe it is better to move some important information such as experimental results to the main paper instead of section 3.

There may be some problems with the experimental setting. In table 2, without defense (the 'None' row),  some attacks does not achieve high successful attack rate with low robust accuracy. For example, the robust accuracy of NES for unprotected model is 80%, similarly, Boundary with 84.8%, HopSkipJump with 86.3% on Imagenet. It means that without any defenses, the attacks are quite weak. The setting may have some problems so that the attacks does not perform well. Comparing with these weak attacks due to inappropriate setting, its better performance does not mean that the proposed method is really better. And sometimes the proposed method is not the best compared the baselines. The experiments do not seem to be solid. 

For black-box models, transfer attack is often adopted an attack method, to generate adversarial examples with white-box substitute model and transfer the examples to attack the black-box model. It is better to test the performance under transfer attack. 

It mainly discusses the black-box model. But the method is general and it can be applied for white-box models. What is its performance if the model is white-box? It is better to provide more insights for the proposed method.

It mentions that the proposed method is more efficient and can achieve some speedup. Maybe it is better to provide some detailed complexity computation or discussion to help better understanding why it is more efficient. Besides, it seems that it needs to train multiple purifiers. It may add some additional training efforts and make the training more complex. It is better to discuss the training complexity. 

It is better to experiment with more architectures. Currently it only shows the results of WideResNet-28-10 for CIFAR and ResNet-50 for ImageNet. More results on other architectures can help better demonstrate the generalization of the proposed method.
