## Abstract
Tabular data prediction is a fundamental machine learning task for many applications. Existing methods predominantly employ discriminative modeling and operate under the assumption of a fixed target column, necessitating re-training for every new predictive task.  Inspired by the generative power of large language models (LLMs), this paper exploits the idea of building universal tabular data predictors based on generative modeling, namely UniPredict. Here, we show that scaling up an LLM to extensive tabular datasets with the capability of comprehending diverse tabular inputs and predicting for target variables following the input instructions. Specifically, we train a single LLM on an aggregation of 169 tabular datasets with diverse targets and compare its performance against baselines that are trained on each dataset separately. We observe this versatile UniPredict model demonstrates an advantage over other models, ranging from 5.4% to 13.4%, when compared with the best tree-boosting baseline and the best neural network baseline, respectively. We further test UniPredict in few-shot learning settings on another 62 tabular datasets. Our method achieves strong performance in quickly adapting to new tasks, where our method outperforms XGBoost over 100\% on the low-resource setup and shows a significant margin over all baselines. We envision that UniPredict sheds light on developing a universal tabular data prediction system that learns from data at scale and serves a wide range of prediction tasks.

### Summary
The paper proposes UniPredict, a model for analytical predictions in tabular data. The work incorporates LLM to multiple tabular datasets, in which a single LLM is trained on an aggregation of 169 tabular datasets with diverse targets. The work compares its performance to other neural-network based and tree-based baselines, and show improvements in prediction performances, especially in in few-shot regimes.

### Strengths
- The major strength of the paper lies in that the paper presents an elegant method of constructing prompts, feature serialization of tabular data, targets in which LLMs (the generative model presented in the paper) can take in as the input.
- Incorporating multiple tabular data to build a type of a pretrained LLM is another strength that that paper exhibits. Moreover, strength in few-shot learning scheme may also provide a hint for extending the work for a more robust pretrained model for prediction in tabular datasets.

### Weaknesses
The major weakness of the paper lies in the experiments:
- A decent hyperparameter tuning of comparing baselines should be conducted.
- The results should also show some statistical measures on performance comparisons (e.g., critical plots)
- There may be some form of leakage of labels in the experiments. For instance the example "Listing 7, A.3" shows an example with "Unnamed: 0 is 2346". This comes from the way of saving a csv file, in which it lists the index of datasets. In some cases, if the data is ordered by the magnitude of the target, this serves as a rank of the target, which might indicate a leakage of labels (target variables).
- It would be good to observe how the proposed model performs on datasets with more samples in the few-shot settings.
- Encoding categorical variables with ordinal encoder (for comparing methods) might not be the best option in handling categorical variables. It would also be good to have some comparison with models that handle categorical variables well (e.g., catboost).

It is unclear to interpret class probability as confidence. There should be a distinct definition of the terms for readers understanding.

### Questions
- How are the hyperparameters for the comparing baseline selected?
- What are some statistical testing results on the performance comparisons? Can we really say that the proposed method outperform other comparing baselines?
-  How does the model do in the few-shot regime where the number of samples is greater than the reported datasets?
- Can we interpret the class probability (in the target augmenting step) as the confidence?
- Are there better approaches in handling numerical values in the prompts? How does the model perform without using the numerical features?

### Summary
1. The paper presents a pretraining methodology for tabular data prediction. Concretely, the authors propose training on a large collection of tabular datasets (169 datasets). 

2. In order to do so, the authors standardize samples across datasets: i.e given a sample, they serialize the sample as a description of the metadata (describing the dataset schema), serializing the column and values as a natural language string, a description of the target labels and finally the target label(s) along with an associated confidence measure (where the confidence measure is derived from an external classifier trained on the dataset). In order for the metadata to be described as a natural language string, the authors propose prompts for rewriting the available metadata information leveraging GPT-3.5. 

3. By leveraging the aforementioned formulation, the authors demonstrate being able to train a single model across numerous datasets as well as a diverse set of target columns

4. The proposed model is evaluated on both the 169 datasets used for training, as well as on 69 datasets in a low resource setup to demonstrate transferability. It achieves substantial improvement over baseline methods on the aggregated 169 datasets. Moreover, it also achieves strong performance on the 69 datasets used for studying the transfer learning setup, especially in the low data setup; substantially outperforming the XG-Boost baseline.

### Strengths
1. The paper presents a novel method for serializing data-samples from tables for generative pre-training that allows not only the colum value information from tables, but also the associated metadata. 
2. The proposed methodology of leveraging not just the target labels, but also the confidence associated with each class label in the generative modeling setup is quite novel. The ablation studies demonstrate the benefits of modeling the confidence estimates
3. The proposed methodology achieves strong performance, especially considering that it is a single model for a diverse number of tasks, when compared to the per dataset baselines.

### Weaknesses
1. The authors do not mention any details about the actual model backbone used for the UniPredict training: for example what (if any) pre-trained model is used for the backbone.
2. While the authors do evaluate over a suite of Table tasks, it is very hard to position the model's performance compared to other proposed methods. It might be better to demonstrate the performance of the model on datasets that have been used previously, just to get a sense of the model's performance compared to prior literature (eg the Blood, Bank, Calhousing, Car, Credit-g, Diabetes, Heart, Income and Jungle datasets as used in [1])
3. Regarding baseline methods: some of the stronger baselines like TabPFN ([2]) would also be helpful in trying to understand the utility of the proposed method. In addition to that, the TabLLM baseline implemented is considerably weaker compared to what was proposed in the original paper. Concretely, the original paper uses T0, fine-tuned with T0-Few recipe [3]; which inherently has better instruction following capabilities compared to the GPT-2 backbone used in this paper. This makes the baseline somewhat artificially weak. It would be good to compare against the actual proposed methodology in [1] or (as mentioned above) evaluate on the datasets for which TabLLM reported the results, just to ensure a fair comparison.




### Questions
1. Given that model confidence is a part of the autoregressive prediction objective, how calibrated are the generations from the model during evaluation ? Concretely, (1) do the confidence estimates produced during generation form a valid probability distribution and (2) would it be possible to compute the calibration score for the produced probabilities (maybe something like the Expected Calibration Error, eg as done in [1])? LLMs have been shown to verbalize well calibrated outputs [2], but in my opinion, the degree of calibration observed would probably be a function of the compute used for training the model. 

2. The authors of TabLLM observed hallucinations to be a source of errors while using LLMs for reformatting purposes. Was this something that was also observed while generating the reformatted metadata ?

3. Given that Unipredict-light does comparably / better than Unipredict-heavy, I am not entirely sure if including the metadata actually helps improve the model performance. The ablation study presented on page 8 argues that Unipredict-heavy is more robust because the loss in performance is less when not using the label confidence estimates during training. But I am not sure why having metadata (or lack thereof) should impact how the model handles confidence estimates.

2. Abstract: "our method outperforms XGBoost over 100% on the low-resource setup" -> not very clear what this means, maybe needs some rewording ?
3. Page 1, para 2: "most previous methods fall short of assuming a fixed target" ->  most previous methods fall short by assuming a fixed target
4. Page 5: Learning: "update the model based on the discrepancies with augmented target sequences" -> this is a bit unclear. It would be good to specify if this is log-likelihood based training, or something else (eg: say RL training based on the BLEU / Rouge score between the model prediction and the ground truth).

### Summary
The paper proposes UniPredict, a framework for training large language models (LLMs) to serve as universal tabular data predictors. The key ideas and contributions are:

•	Most prior tabular data prediction methods are discriminative and make predictions only for a fixed, pre-specified target column. In contrast, UniPredict is a generative model that can accept arbitrary tabular data as input and make predictions for any target column specified at query time.

•	The authors aggregate 169 diverse tabular datasets into a large training corpus to train the UniPredict LLM. This exposes it to the diversity needed to handle new datasets and prediction tasks.

•	Novel prompt engineering strategies are used to transform tabular data into natural language inputs consumable by the LLM. Reformatted metadata and instructions for specifying the target variable are incorporated into the prompts.

•	Target augmentation and training procedures are designed to produce probabilistic predictions from the LLM with reliable confidence estimates.

•	Experiments show UniPredict outperforms prior specialized models, with especially strong generalization under low-data regimes. It achieves higher accuracy than the best neural baselines and boosting methods across the aggregated test sets.

In summary, UniPredict demonstrates how scaling up training data and prompt engineering enables LLMs to learn universal tabular prediction capabilities not seen in prior specialized models. The proposed system and training framework enable handling diverse datasets and prediction tasks within a single model.

### Strengths
1.	For the first time, this paper introduces a novel approach of outputting confidence scores for predictions made by large language models (LLMs) on tabular data. Specifically, the authors employ XGBoost to first generate confidence scores for the training tabular data. The large language model is then trained to mimic these confidence estimates for its own predictions on tabular data. Applying LLMs to tabular prediction and producing probabilistic outputs is an innovative contribution in the field of using LLMs for tabular prediction.

2.	The paper provides extensive prompt engineering techniques that enable the LLM to accept arbitrary tabular inputs and make predictions. Substantial research has been conducted on designing effective prompts that allow the LLM to comprehend diverse tabular data samples and generate outputs. This represents significant effort and advancement in prompt engineering for applying LLMs to tabular data.

### Weaknesses
1.	This paper does not clearly specify which large language model architecture was used for the fine-tuning experiments. Was it a model like LLAMa, Falcon, or GPT-3.5? This omission of key information is a major limitation. Based on the logo in Figure 2, I infer that OpenAI's fine-tuning API was likely used. It is reasonable to hypothesize that the models in the experiments (e.g. UniPredict-light and UniPredict-heavy) were potentially GPT-3.5 or GPT-4.

2.	The previous point raises the concern that the paper seems to conflate the notion that "Only OpenAI's ChatGPT constitutes a large language model." The title reads "LARGE LANGUAGE MODELS ARE UNIVERSAL TABULAR PREDICTORS," but large language models include more than just ChatGPT, such as LLAMa and Falcon. It is well known that ChatGPT has strong generalization abilities, but the authors did not discuss whether their methods would still be effective on other large language models. The experimental results make it difficult to ascertain the validity of the authors' methods, as the results could simply stem from the power of the chosen foundation model rather than the methods themselves. Therefore, the conclusion stated in the title is not convincingly demonstrated.

3.	The authors appear to have limited tabular prediction tasks to only classification problems, which is unreasonable. Tabular prediction also encompasses regression tasks. The authors should clarify which validation datasets involve classification versus regression to properly support the title conclusion of "UNIVERSAL TABULAR PREDICTORS."

4.	Potential data leakage. The tabular data used for testing was sourced from the public Kaggle website. Due to the blackbox nature of the large language models used (not knowing what training data they have seen), we cannot be certain that the experimental results stem from the authors' fine-tuning rather than the LLMs having previously encountered related data from Kaggle.

5.	Poor reproducibility. The authors did not release or provide any materials or code to support reproducibility of their work.

### Summary
This work curated tabular data and trained a single LLM on an aggregation of 169 tabular
datasets with diverse targets. It improves the prediction accuracy by 5.4% to 13.4% compared with the SOTA tree-boosting baseline and neural network baseline, respectively. Besides, the trained LLM outperforms others by a large margin in few-shot settings.

### Strengths
It's good to see a Tabular LLM, and it could benefit the community if the code and data will be released. 

The experiment is solid, and the performance improvement is solid.

### Weaknesses
Only minor things:
For the experiment setting, the baseline setup needs to be clarified in the main text. I read the appendix and found that the setting of TabLLM is different from its original paper. Why do we need to change their backbone and prompts, at least for the few-shot setting? The author said, "we streamlined the process by instructing the model to predict the class name
directly. This approach simplifies the training procedure and conserves computational resources." But is there any performance drop of doing so?

For the metadata reformatting process that leverages ChatGPT, can we measure the impact of hallucination since feeding column names to LLM may get some weird explanation or irrelevant content? Is there any post-processing to control the quality of reformatted meta information?  

According to the ablation study using the augmented teaching signal from XGBoost, I saw the performance gap is significant. Does it mean the distillation from XGBoost is a key to success? If so, what's the performance of other baselines if we also take the XGBoost as the teacher?

Typos in Sec-3.5, the table number is wrong, and there are two Abl-h.

### Summary
This paper proposes a novel method for tabular data prediction based on generative modeling using large language models (LLMs), UniPredict. It can handle various prediction tasks without re-training by following the input instructions. The paper shows that UniPredict outperforms existing methods that use discriminative modeling and require re-training for each task. The paper also demonstrates that UniPredict can adapt to new tasks in few-shot learning settings with minimal data. The paper aims to develop a universal tabular data prediction system that can leverage the generative power of LLMs and serve diverse applications.

### Strengths
* This paper proposes a novel idea of using a large language model (LLM) to perform tabular data prediction for any target variable, based on generative modeling and prompt engineering. 
* This work introduces the concept of target augmentation, which is a technique to enhance the LLM’s ability to handle diverse and complex targets.
* It demonstrates the effectiveness of UniPredict on 169 tabular datasets with diverse targets, and compares its performance with several baselines, including tree-boosting and neural network models.
* Well-written and organized, with clear problem formulation and framework description.

### Weaknesses
 * The Implementation section is not clear enough, what model did you use in the experiment during your model learning process, and what are the specific training parameters?
* I found that most of the data in the experiment are discrete (the dataset’s targets are not continuous), I wonder how the results of different target types are? 
* Do you do any special processing for continuous target types? 
* In the ablation experiment, you did not ablate whether to use target augmentation or not
* Using different classifiers for target augmentation
* From the experimental results, UniPredict's results are not significantly better than XGBoost, and it gives me a feeling that it is distilling XGBoost.
* These datasets are from Kaggle, can you list the gap between the current results and the Kaggle top results?
