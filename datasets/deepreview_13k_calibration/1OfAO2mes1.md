## Abstract
Modern machine learning (ML) systems demand substantial training data, often resorting to external sources. Nevertheless, this practice renders them vulnerable to backdoor poisoning attacks. Prior backdoor defense strategies have primarily focused on the identification of backdoored models or poisoned data characteristics, typically operating under the assumption of access to clean data. In this work, we delve into a relatively underexplored challenge: the automatic identification of backdoor data within a poisoned dataset, all under realistic conditions, \textit{i.e.},  without the need for additional clean data or {without} manually defining a threshold for backdoor detection. We draw an inspiration from the {scaled prediction consistency} (SPC) technique, which {exploits}  the prediction invariance of poisoned data to an input scaling factor. Based on this, we {pose}  the backdoor data identification problem as a hierarchical data splitting optimization problem, leveraging a novel SPC-based loss function as the primary optimization objective. Our innovation unfolds in several key aspects. First, we revisit the vanilla SPC method, unveiling its limitations in addressing the proposed backdoor identification problem. Subsequently, we develop a bi-level optimization-based approach to precisely identify backdoor data by minimizing the advanced SPC loss. Finally, we demonstrate the efficacy of our proposal against a spectrum of backdoor attacks, encompassing basic label-corrupted attacks as well as more sophisticated clean-label attacks, evaluated across various benchmark datasets. Experiment results show that our approach often surpasses the performance of current baselines in identifying backdoor data points, resulting in {about 4\%-36\% improvement in average AUROC.} %\st{about an average 4\%-20\% improvement in AUROC}.

### Summary
This study focuses on automatically detecting backdoor data in poisoned machine learning datasets, without requiring clean data or predefined thresholds. It leverages the scaled prediction consistency (SPC) technique, introducing a unique SPC-based loss function for precise identification. This research addresses limitations in the traditional SPC method and develops a bi-level optimization approach for accurate backdoor data detection. The proposed method is evaluated on several datasets.

### Strengths
1. The problem of backdoor sample identification is of sufficient interests for the community.
2. The paper is well-written and easy to follow.

### Weaknesses
1. Regarding the AUROC performance, where a comprehensive threshold iteration is conducted, the proposed method exhibits only marginal improvements over the STRIP method. Notably, in the case of CIFAR-10, the proposed method significantly outperforms the STRIP method solely under the AdapBlend (γ = 0.3%) condition. Surprisingly, in the context of Tiny ImageNet, the STRIP method even surpasses the proposed method.
2. Could you provide a runtime analysis of the algorithms employed to solve the bi-level optimization problem? Additionally, it would be valuable to understand the optimization process for the discrete variable w?
3. While it is acknowledged that running the STRIP method on ImageNet 200 presents time complexity challenges, I would like to point out that this method does not appear to encounter runtime issues comparable to your proposed methods, which require solving a discrete bi-level optimization problem. In the STRIP method, the procedure only involves *superimposing two images and forwarding them to the backdoored model to obtain the outputs*.

In light of the aforementioned observations, it appears that the proposed method does not introduce significant advantages, either in terms of computational complexity or performance enhancement, when compared to the STRIP method. Consequently, I recommend rejection.

### Summary
The paper presents a method for backdoor detection that identifies poisoned samples based on prediction invariance after scaling. The method designed a new bi-level optimization-based approach to improve the performance of the existing SPC method.

### Strengths
- The manuscript is well-organized and straightforward, facilitating easy comprehension.
- The empirical results are compelling and substantiate the paper's claims effectively.
- I had previously reviewed this work for an earlier conference. Given the improvements the authors have made—specifically, the expansion of datasets and attack baselines—I am inclined to give it a “marginally above the acceptance threshold”.

### Weaknesses
 - Despite some improvements in this submission, my primary concern remains: the core idea behind the proposed method is still closely aligned with the existing Scaled Prediction Consistency (SPC) approach, limiting the paper's technical novelty and contribution. The method essentially refines the SPC approach through a bi-level optimization, but the fundamental principle of leveraging prediction invariance after scaling remains the same. This raises questions about the originality of the approach, as it appears to be an incremental improvement rather than a fundamentally new concept.
- Extending the experiments to include more diverse model architectures, such as attention-based ViT, would bolster the robustness of the findings. Currently, only one model architecture (ResNet-18) is used for experimental evaluation. This limits the generalizability of the results, as the effectiveness of the method might be architecture-dependent. It is crucial to evaluate the method on a wider range of architectures to ensure its applicability across different model types. For instance, the behavior of attention mechanisms in ViT might interact differently with the proposed method compared to convolutional layers in ResNet-18, potentially impacting the detection performance.

### Summary
This paper proposes an optimization framework to improve an existing backdoor sample detecting method Scaled Prediction Consistency (SPC). It identifies two limitations of SPC, in terms of the unusual SPC values of backdoor vs. clean samples. It addresses the limitations of SPC by introducing a pre-shift and a learnable mask into SPC, and proposes to use a bilevel optimization framework to first find a small mask and then only scale up the masked region of the image. The new loss function is named Mask-aware SPC (MSPC).  The way to find the minimal mask is similar to the Cognitive Distillation method introduced in (Huang et al. 2023), which should be able to accurately locate the backdoor trigger position. With the learned mask and scaling factor $n$, the authors further propose to automatically identify the backdoored samples from a training dataset with the help of binary variable $w_i$ ($w=1$ for backdoored sample whilst $w=0$  for clean sample). Eventually, if the MSPC loss is >0, then $w_i$ should be 1 to minimize the overall loss $(1-w_i)\cdot L_{MSPC}$. I.e., counting samples with non-negative MSPC loss or $w_i=1$ yields the final backdoor samples. Experiments with 8 backdoor attacks on three datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

### Strengths
1. The proposed method addresses the limitations of an existing work SPC;

2. The experimental results are promising;

3. The method can automatically differentiate backdoor from clean samples via the bilevel optimization framework.

### Weaknesses
1. The paper is poorly written, it takes the reviewer to read many times to get the core idea. The relationship to existing works SPC and Cognitive Distillation (CD) should be accurately summarized and discussed. The fundamental/technical difference should be clearly explained.

2. At the beginning of Section 4, it explains why SPC fails the two cases. Yet this was not systematically or quantitatively analyzed. Those are just conjectures.

3. The key technical novelty is the introduction of a learnable mask into the MSPC loss, however, the technique is very similar to an existing backdoor detection method proposed by (Huang et al. 2023).

4. The automatic filtering variable $w_i$ seems unnecessary, as at the end of Section 4, the authors stated that "backdoor samples will simply be the ones with MSPC loss greater than 0".

5. The two proposed practical conditions: 1) free of clean data; and 2) free of detection threshold, look both ok to me. Many defense works assume the availability of a small subset of clean samples, which is quite practical in real-world scenarios. The reviewer understands it is nice to satisfy both conditions but does not think this makes the proposed method fundamentally superior to other detection methods. For condition 2, if all training samples with MSPC loss greater than 0 should be removed, the detector will remove many clean samples when the dataset is extremely clean or dirty (extremely low/high poisoning rates).

6. Strong adaptive attacks should know the mask, it then can adapt itself to have low MSPC loss with multiple surrogate models rather than one, in case to overfit the current model as it did in the "Resistance against Potential Adaptive Attacks." experiments. In other words, generating strong poisons should also be done in a bilevel manner.

7. In Table 1, the detection performance shown on CIFAR-10 is worse than that reported in the Cognitive Distillation (CD) paper (Huang et al. 2023) (their AUC is above 90%), and the results on test (and poisoned) samples should also be reported.   This means the use of CD in the proposed way actually hurts the detection performance, which may be caused by the automatic search process with $w_i$ and the SPC loss.

### Summary
MSPCThis paper proposed a backdoor data detection method called Mask-aware SPC (MSPC). It is inspired by existing work scaled prediction consistency (SPC). Based on the observation that SPC is not robust to the extreme pixel values (near 0 and 1), the proposed method uses a mask and hyperparameter to dynamically adjust the range. Based on the mask, MSPC proposes a bi-level optimization that can detect backdoor samples without the need to specify a threshold. The experiment results show the proposed method is effective in detecting several existing backdoor attacks.

### Strengths
- The motivation for adding masks and the linear shift $\tau$ is well explained. It is an interesting observation for applying SPC on images. 
- Experiments are comprehensive and include most of the existing attacks; results demonstrated the proposed MSPC is effective in detecting them.

### Weaknesses
 - For condition P2: Free of Detection Threshold, MSPC is an optimized threshold selection method. The "Free" detection threshold seems ill-defined for the backdoor data detection method, which is essentially a binary classification. Essentially, MSPC still needs to use loss value as the score, except the threshold is optimized through Eq 5. 
- After relaxing the mask to continue values, Eq.4 is very similar to CD (Huang et al., 2023). It seems the difference is to replace the absolute difference with the KL divergence. It would be great to include the CD in the experiments for comparison, as well as recent works Meta-SIFT (Zeng et al., 2022) and ASSET (Pan et al., 2023).
- The motivations based on insight 1/2 are constrained by the input bounded from 0 to 1. What happens to SPC if the input is not constrained to 0 to 1 or the input is normalized? 
- It has been observed in existing works such as SPECTRE (Hayase et al., 2021) that the detection method is sensitive towards the poisoning rate. It would be more comprehensive to include experiments with lower poisoning rates.

### Questions
- Is it possible to incorporate Eq 5 with other detection methods, such as STRIP or ABL?
- What if there are no backdoor samples? What is the FPR in this situation?
