## Abstract
Self-attention is an essential component of GPT-style models and a significant cause of LLM inference latency for long sequences. In multi-tenant LLM inference servers, the compute and memory operation cost of self-attention can be amortized by making use of the probability that sequences from users may share long prompt prefixes. This paper introduces ChunkAttention, a unique self-attention kernel built on chunking, sharing the KV cache, and batching the attention computation. ChunkAttention recognizes matching prompt prefixes across several sequences and shares their KV cache in memory by chunking the KV cache and structuring it into the auxiliary prefix tree. To significantly improve the memory reuse of KV cache and consequently the speed of self-attention for long shared prompts, we design an efficient computation kernel on this new storage structure, where two-phased partitioning is implemented to reduce memory operations on shared KV cache during self-attention. Experiments show that ChunkAttention can speed up self-attention of long shared prompts 1.6-3 times, with lengths ranging from 1024 to 8192.

### Summary
The paper aims to tackle the problem of redundant Key-Value (KV) cache in Large Language Models (LLMs) when shared prompt tokens are used. The proposed solution involves the use of a prefix-tree-based data structure for memory management, which can potentially speed up self-attention algorithms.

### Strengths
- The paper introduces the concept of using prefix trees for managing KV cache, which is a novel approach in the context of LLMs.
  
- The problem of addressing redundant KV cache with shared prompt tokens is both relevant and interesting, particularly as LLMs continue to evolve and find application in various fields.

### Weaknesses
 - The paper lacks support for the need for reducing redundant KV cache through shared prompts. It seems to rely heavily on the assumption that a significant amount of KV cache can be shared, but no data to back this up.
  
- The paper, particularly Section 3, is difficult to follow. Complex ideas are not explained well, and the method implementation could be better explained to improve the readability.

- In Section 3.1, the term $n_s$ is used prior to its explanation in later sections, creating a disconnect in the logical flow.
  
- The paper does not provide any references or empirical evidence to support the concept of sharable KV cache in the context of prompt engineering. This makes it challenging to gauge the validity and impact of the proposed method.
  
- There is insufficient rationale behind the choice of shared prompt tokens in the experiments. The representativeness of these settings is questionable, and more clarity is needed to assess the paper's contributions effectively.

While the paper tackles an interesting problem and introduces a novel approach via prefix trees, it has substantial limitations. The primary concerns are the lack of empirical data to support the motivation behind reducing redundant KV cache and the complexity in readability, especially in Section 3. These issues, taken together, place the paper below the acceptance threshold for publication in its current form. Revision and additional supporting data are highly recommended.

### Summary
This paper proposes ChunkAttention, a system optimization to enhance memory reuse within the KV cache in large language model inference workload. In order to boost the efficiency of self-attention for lengthy shared prompts, an efficient computational kernel based on a new tree-based organization of KV cache chunks, which involves the implementation of a two-phase partitioning approach to minimize memory operations on the shared KV cache during self-attention.

### Strengths
- Comprehensively, this paper discusses an important system optimization problem in LLM inference, which can introduce significant impact from both academia and industry. 

- The design and implementation of the advanced system optimization, especially the tree-based organization of KV-cache chunks is solid and reasonable.  

- Most of the technique parts are well written, and easy to follow although it could be further polished.

### Weaknesses
 - My main concern about the paper is about its evaluation, which can be summarized as below:
  - The organization of this section is unclear; concretely, there is a lack of formal description of the central hypothesis about the experiment design.
  - The setup of the experiments is not clearly stated, I was expecting the experiments would be conducted on some real LLM e.g., Llama2; however, there is no such description.
  - As I stated above, this is a lack of description of the experiment setting; I checked the source code provided in the supplementary materials. Surprisingly, I realized that all the experiments were based on some micro-benchmark on a single transformer layer. (Please correct me if this interpretation is wrong; I am open to discussion, and I can spend more time double-checking the implementation). This makes the experimental results very problematic -- there is no evidence that the IO behavior would be the same when serving a single layer or an end-to-end model. The system should be evaluated for some real workflow instead of this micro-benchmark. 

- There is a lack of technique discussion about how this technique can be integrated to parallel inference workflows such as tensor model parallelism or pipeline parallelism.

### Questions
The essential question I want to raise is about if it is possible to provide some end-to-end evaluation for some real model over some real LLM inference traces?

### Summary
This paper proposes a new attention kernel design, ChunkAttention, that can chunk, share the KV cache, and batch the attention computation for a multi-tenant LLM inference setting where the sequences from users may share long prompt prefixes. ChunkAttention identifies the matching prompt prefixes across several sequences and reuses their KV cache by chunking the KV cache and embedding it into the auxillary prefix tree.  A 2-phase partitioning technique is also proposed to reduce the memory accesses on the KV cache during self-attention. Experimental results show ChunkAttention improves the self-attention speed by up to 3x.

### Strengths
1. The paper works on an important problem, i.e., accelerating self-attention kernels in LLMs.
2. The paper flows well.

### Weaknesses
1. The tehniques proposed by this paper work for only the multi-tenant LLM inference setting where the sequences from users may share long prompt prefixes. However, how frequent can this case happen? How to identify the same prompts between different users is still a problem.

2. This authors did NOT compare ChunkAttention agasint prior token pruning techniques, e.g.,

### Summary
For auto-regressive large language models (LLMs), efficient attention contributes to cost-efficient serving. Inspired by the "prompt engineering" of LLM inference, this paper proposes a novel attention mechanism, named ChunkAttention. Since all requests to an LLM model may share the predefined prompt prefix, the authors build a prefix tree and match the common prefix. The common prefix can be computed only once, and all requests can share the computed key-value tensors. This results in saving both computation (no duplicate computation) and memory (no duplicate saving) thus enhancing the efficiency of online serving.

### Strengths
- The authors found a good optimization point from practical LLM serving scenarios.
- The authors adopted a plausible abstraction--prefix tree--to realize their idea.
- Figure 5 shows their contribution well, showing we can dramatically decrease the prompt encoding time.

### Weaknesses
 - The authors said that in their experiment workloads, "all sequences within the same batch start and finish simultaneously". However, I think the workload is overfitted to ChunkAttention. It seems more natural to send a trace of requests through a fixed time duration.
    - For example, it would be helpful to understand ChunkAttention's contribution if I could compare under a similar workload to Figure 16 of the vLLM paper
- Gathering that many batches (>= 32) is unlikely in practice. Even for a super high load scenario, requests would suffer from queueing delay, failing to meet SLA.
- It would be more informative if a study about the chunk size existed.

### Questions
- In Figure 4, why does the throughput decrease when the batch size becomes 128?
- Although 1) naive, 2) xformers, and 3) FlashAttention do not support sharing, why does the naive version outperform the others?
- When the model size grows on the same hardware (e.g., Lllama 13B in A100 80G), how does the result change? I think ChunkAttention can achieve more performance gain because it efficiently utilizes key-value cache memory compared to the baselines.
- How long does it take to build the first prefix tree? For example, when $n_{s} = 8192$, I think it might take a non-negligible time.
