## Abstract
Spatial integration is essential for a number of scientific computing applications, such as solving Partial Differential Equations.
Numerically computing a spatial integration is usually done via Monte Carlo methods, which produce accurate and unbiased results.
However, they can be slow since it require evaluating the integration many times to achieve accurate low-variance results.
Recently, researchers have proposed to use neural networks to approximate integration results.
While networks are very fast to infer in test-time, they can only approximate the integration results and thus produce biased estimations.
In this paper, we propose to combine these two complementary classes of methods to create a fast and unbiased estimator.
The key idea is instead of relying on the neural network's approximate output directly, we use the network as a control variate for the Monte Carlo estimator.
We propose a principal way to construct such estimators and derive a training object that can minimize its variance.
We also provide preliminary results showing our proposed estimator can both reduce the variance of Monte Carlo PDE solvers and produce unbiased results in solving Laplace and Poisson equations.

### Summary
This paper focuses on using a combination of neural networks and Monte Carlo to estimate spatial integrals, with the neural network estimate serving as a control variate for Monte Carlo estimation. The paper briefly reviews Monte Carlo integration and the control variate technique, and then introduces their proposed method. The key idea of the method is to use a fairly flexible analytically tractable "neural" integral (with a tractable integrand corresponding to it) to create a control variate for a Monte Carlo estimate of the spatial integral. The method is successfully tested on the Poisson and Laplace equations both of which require fairly low-dimensional spatial integration. The paper builds on the AutoInt technique and improves it in a substantive way, convincingly demonstrating that the proposed technique removes more bias.

### Strengths
The main idea of the paper is solid and I think points in the right direction. Previous works have taken the neural estimate as the "primary" (and only) one, whereas the authors suggest to improve a Monte Carlo estimate with a control variate that is backed out of the neural estimate. This is a direction well-worth pursuing, and represents a methodological novelty, and (at least in my view) provides a good context for development of similar techniques. The paper, for the most part, is clearly written.

### Weaknesses
For a novice, the exposition can be improved, especially in 4.1 and 4.2. It would be nice to add an algorithm to the paper. I also think more details on the experiments can be provided. To the non-PDE audience, the experiments on solving a 2D Poisson equation and 3D Laplace equation seem somewhat out of context, so it would be good to explain, even if briefly, why this is an important problem. The description of the neural network architecture and training procedure is lacking, making it difficult to reproduce the results. Specifically, the activation functions, number of layers, and optimization algorithm are not specified. Furthermore, the method's performance sensitivity to the choice of neural network architecture is not discussed. The paper also lacks a discussion on the computational cost of the method, especially the training of the neural network, which could be a significant overhead compared to standard Monte Carlo integration.

### Questions
I appreciate the authors' statement on the limitation of the proposed method. Have the authors considered how to make the method more scalable? There is some related literature on control variates that may be relevant, e.g., https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.07487, https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.04756. 

Follow-up question to the above. Can other parametric functions be used instead of the neural network? 

Can the method be applied to other machine learning problems, e.g., problems of Bayesian inference? Have the authors considered this?

How sensitive is the estimator to sample size? Have you tried to run the method with different values of N?

### Summary
This paper is devoted to the task of computing an integral $\int_{\Omega} f(p)dp$ over a known parameterized domain, where one has access to samples from a distribution over $\Omega$. The authors propose to combine monte-carlo integration methods with neural integration techniques; where neural integration techniques are used to reduce the variance of monte-carlo sampling. 

More formally, the authors approximate the integral, by parameterizing a neural network $G_\theta:\mathbb{R}^d\to \mathbb{R}$. The authors assume the existence of a change of variable form a box constraint $\prod [l_i, u_i]$ to $\Omega$, $\Phi$. The authors extend auto-int to the multivariate case, by finding $\theta$ that such that $\frac{\partial^d G}{\partial x_1\dots\partial x_d}$ approximates well $f(p)$, by minimization of the MSE $\mathbb{E}\_p\|\frac{\partial^d G}{\partial x\_1\dots\partial x\_d}(\Phi(p))|D \Phi(p)|^{-1} - f(p)\|^2$.

The main idea of the authors is to then use this estimation of the antiderivative as a control variate to then do Monte-Carlo sampling rather than using it directly. 
Indeed, assuming that the bounds $u$ are well-chosen, we have $\int f(p)dp  = G_\theta(u_1, \dots, u_d) + \int[ f(p) - \frac{\partial^d G}{\partial x\_1\dots\partial x\_d}(\Phi(p))|D \Phi(p)|^{-1} ]dp$. The authors then propose to approximate the last integral with monte-carlo sampling, and, therefore minimize as a loss its variance.

The authors then demonstrate that the proposed method works better than vanilla auto-int for solving 2-d poisson equations and 3-d laplace equation.

### Strengths
First, I want to mention that I have very little knowledge of numerical integration and Monte Carlo methods.

The main strength of the paper is that the proposed method seems sound and novel. It combines two well-known methods into a new one and demonstrates that it improves over both.

### Weaknesses
 The principal weakness of this paper is that it is exceptionally unclear. There are many typos, the notations constantly change, some important concepts are not defined, some concepts are introduced twice, and some notations are confusing. This makes the full paper very hard to read. In this current state, this is clearly not fit for publication and requires a major rework before it becomes readable.

In my view, the amount of edits required to make the paper readable is too large to make it acceptable, even if the authors promise to fix all the errors. 

In terms of methods, the authors do not really discuss the computational complexity of the method: what if the dimension d is large? For instance, the extension of auto-int requires computing a d-th derivative; the corresponding computational costs should be discussed. 

Here is a list of typos + misc remarks.
-In eq.1 , f has two variables z, p . Then the authors write f(p) at the end of hte paragraph. This confusion is present many times in the paper.
- vectors are randomly written with either in bold font or with arrows on top: in eq.1 we have bold, in eq.2 we have arrows 
- Top of page 2: G is a function of (a, b), then the authors write G'(x). There is also a constant change of notation between G_\theta and F_\theta.
- In the intro the authors write G as a function of p while later it will only act on the boxes [l_i, u_i] with variable x. 
- "as takes"
- Page 3, the paragraph "Neural Network Integration Methods" contains many redundant citations
- Eq.4: yet another notation, this is redundant with eq1
- $\Phi$ should be one-to-one, not only invertible.
- "a region of R^d" -> the region should be a box constraint.
- $\Phi$ becomes $\Phi^{-1}$ later in the paper. The authors write $\Phi(x)$ in eq.5 but $\Phi(p)$ in e.g. eq11, 12
- "with Jacobian being r." It is the determinant of the Jacobian
- "once can see"
- around eq.8 : why all the notations "a, b , T, T_min, T_max"...
- below eq.8 $F'_	heta$.
- "(i.e. for all pairs of" missing closing parenthesis.
- The notion of anti derivative should be recalled precisely in the context  of multi-dimensional functions
- The notation $\frac{\partial^d G}{\partial x}$ should be explained clearly
- The authors write $\Phi(dp)$ in many places, dp should just be p.
- In the big eq. above eq. 16, $I_\theta$ should be $G_\theta$.
- $F_\theta$ in eq. 16.

### Questions
- The authors write "preliminary results show that our proposed method is unbiased": how is it not axiomatic? Can the authors discuss this more?

### Summary
This paper proposes a method to approximate a family of spatial integration by combining neural integration and Monte Carlo techniques.

### Strengths
Using neural networks for integral estimation appears to be new in the literature, although it is a natural extension of the existing methods that use neural networks to estimate parameters for complex models.

### Weaknesses
1. It lacks theoretical guarantees for the performance of the proposed method. For example, the variance and bias of the estimator are hard to be assessed since the structure of the neural network used for estimation is undetermined.  

2, The numerical experiments in the paper are limited.

### Questions
1. The author(s) mentioned that the variance of the Monte Carlo estimator decays at the rate of O(1/N) and thus a large number of independent samples are needed for accurate estimation. What is the rate for the proposed method? 

2. Given the limited numerical experiments, it is hard to conclude that the proposed method can generally produce more accurate estimation than Monte Carlo. What are the main application scenarios of the proposed method?

### Summary
The paper constructs an estimator for the value of a multivariate integral.
More specifically, it constructs a multivariate version of ``AutoInt'' (Lindell et al.), a method of numerical integration using neural networks, and proposes to use it as a control variate in a Monte Carlo estimator.

### Strengths
In general, this is a decent paper.
I assess its biggest strength to be its readability:
The proposed ideas are reasonable and presented clearly. The exposition is easy to follow for anyone with prior exposure to the basics of Monte Carlo methods and neural networks (which should include almost everyone at ICLR).


However, I believe that the weaknesses (discussed next) do outweigh the strengths:

### Weaknesses
Even though this is a nice submission, I recommend rejection because I think that the contributions are, overall, too small.

For reference, I identify the following contributions:
- Deriving a multivariate version of ``AutoInt'' (Lindell et al.) via applying a multivariate fundamental theorem of calculus instead of a univariate one
- Using the resulting estimator as a control variate for Monte Carlo
- Training the ``AutoInt'' estimator by minimising the Monte Carlo variance instead of the loss used by Lindell et al.

The simulation results are okay, but the experiments lack a wall-time evaluation.
An improvement in error-per-steps compared to plain Monte Carlo and plain AutoInt alone is insufficient because the proposed estimator heavily relies on gradient information (whose computational costs are only unveiled by wall-time measurements).

My assessment would have been more positive if the contributions were more general or the simulation results were more convincing. 
As is, I recommend rejection.

### Questions
1.  From reading the manuscript, it is unclear why using the estimator's variance as a target would be superior to the more common approach in the control-variate literature: constructing an approximation $g$, then estimating 
$\int (f(x) -  c g(x)) dx + c \int g(x) dx$ while choosing $c$ such that the variance is minimal.
2. The curves in the "MSE per Steps" diagrams in Figures 2 and 4 look extremely straight/smooth. Is this an issue with the figure resolution, have they been smoothed/averaged before plotting, or is it simply a coincidence?
3. There is a typo at the bottom of page 6: " (...) applications. One interesting Specifically, for most (...)"
