## Abstract
As deep learning models become larger and more expensive, many practitioners turn to fine-tuning APIs. 
These web services allow fine-tuning a model between two parties: the client that provides the data, and the server that hosts the model. 
While convenient, the fine-tuning APIs raise a new concern: the data of the client is at risk of privacy breach during the training procedure.
This challenge presents an important practical case of vertical federated learning, where the two parties perform parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) of a large pre-trained model.
In this study, we systematically search for a way to fine-tune models over an API  *while keeping the labels private*.
We analyze the privacy of popular algorithms for parameter-efficient fine-tuning when training over an API.
Using this analysis, we propose P$^3$EFT, a two-party split learning algorithm that takes advantage of existing PEFT properties to maintain privacy at a lower performance overhead.
To validate our algorithm, we fine-tune DeBERTa-v2-XXLarge and Flan-T5 using LoRA adapters on a range of common NLP tasks. We find that P$^3$EFT is competitive with existing privacy-preserving methods in a two-party setup while having higher accuracy.

### Summary
This paper focuses on the problem of preserving the privacy of client’s training labels while using fine-tuning APIs.  This paper proposes a fine-tuning protocol that performs Low-Rank Adaptation (i.e., a parameter-efficient fine-tuning) in a setting where clients hold private labels and aim to finetune a model owned by a server without disclosing the labels of examples. The server provides forward and backward passes on their model. The proposed method and its description are very confusing, please see my understanding and comments in the weakness box.

### Strengths
The problem of preserving privacy while using fine-tuning APIs is an important problem particularly for large language models given that 1) many recent models are not released, but instead made available as proprietary services; 2) the local resources of clients are limited for fine-tuning.

### Weaknesses
My main concern is that the description of the proposed method is confusing and missing lots of information. Figure 2 (which is supposed to be a visualisation of the proposed framework) makes it even more confusing by introducing new variables that were never used in the description. I have spent some time trying to understand and guess the missing information. See below my understanding of the proposed method:
1) a client has local adapters and initializes them locally. How this initialization is done? I can think of two scenarios: 1) the initialization is done randomly; or 2) the initialization is done by copying the weights of adapters owned by the server. Scenario 2 does not make sense because this paper discusses that servers do not want to send their model to clients. Scenario 1 does not make sense either as in step 5 clients use the gradients w.r.t. the server adapter parameters.
2) a client calls forward API call to compute features on each mini-batch of their data. It is not clear how these features are computed. I can think of three different scenarios: 1) the server has both pre-trained model and adapters so the server computes these features as the summation of the output of both of these modules' 2) the server uses only the pre-trained model to compute these features; or 3) the server uses only the adapters to compute these features.
2) a client passes these features to the local “head” and computes task-specific loss function. What is this task-specific loss function?
3) a client computes gradients of the task-specific loss function w.r.t. local head inputs
4) a client passes those gradients to a server via backward API call to compute gradients w.r.t. adapter parameters.
5) a client updates both local adapter parameters and local head parameters. How and which adapters parameters are updated? Please see my points in step 1.

Apart from the above main concern, I have other concerns:

1- Overclaims:
1) This paper claims "privacy guarantees" by saying that "designing a two-party fine-tuning protocol that performs standard parameter-efficient fine-tuning with privacy guarantees". However, there are no privacy guarantees provided, the privacy promise of this paper is ad-hoc and it is just based on increasing the number of servers, assuming they do not collude but assuming that they have the same model.
2) The title of this paper "PRIVACY-PRESERVING LLM FINE-TUNING OVER API" is too generic, oversell and does not represent this work that only considers the privacy of labels.
3) Where "lower performance overhead" is demonstrated "This paper proposes P3EFT, a two-party split learning algorithm that takes advantage of existing PEFT properties to maintain privacy at a lower performance overhead".

2- The observation listed as one of the main contributions at the end of the introduction section ("We observe that, despite fine-tuning less than 0.1% of model parameters, modern PEFT algorithms leak client’s training labels against simple attacks that work for modern pretrained transformers")  and its corresponding Figure 1, has been already demonstrated in existing works such as  Li et al. (2022) even in a more generic way as opposed to simple binary classification tasks that considered in this submission.

3- Not self-contained. For example, a clear description of LoRA which is the main building block of the proposed framework is missing.

4- Not clear what would be the novelty of the proposed privacy-preserving backpropagation in comparison to secret sharing in 2 party computation that have been heavily studied in the literature.

### Summary
This paper proposed to fine-tune models over an API with privacy requirement on labels. Under a parameter-efficient fine-tuning framework, the paper analysed the possible ways the label information can be leaked, i.e., from gradients or intermediate activations. Experiments justified that the proposed method can defend against recent attack studies.

### Strengths
This paper is well presented and the targeted privacy-preserving in tuning/training is an interesting research topic. The authors have reviewed some recent advanced works, especially the ones related LLMs. The methodology is clearly stated, and the experimental results are basically convincing.

### Weaknesses
My major concerns are two folds; one is the practical significance of the problem setting and connection to some related topics, and the other concern is novelty of methodology. Please see my detailed comments under Questions.

1.	From my understanding, the connection of the problem setting with vertical federation learning is contrived in terms of predictive tasks. But I agree that in some scenarios, labels are valuable and privacy preserving might be necessary. In this sense, how about local differential privacy on labels or noisy label learning? Because they are also regarded as solutions to preserving labels. There should be at least some discussion on telling the readers what the advantages of the proposed method are over these existing strategies.
2.	Following 1, with access to the full features of target domain, this work is also related to source-free domain adaptation. I understand the applied loss takes label in this work and thus should be more informative than UDA. It would be better if the necessity of using labels could be clarified.
3.	There is not much referring to the “local layers” in Fig. 1. Are these layers learnable or fixed? Can you explain why it is rational to be learnable/fixed for clients in real scenarios?
4.	When taking about fine-tuning APIs in the paragraph 3-4, I think some recent works are missing, especially from the privacy preserving motivation.

5.	From my understanding, the technique on gradient privacy preserving is based on zero-order optimization and the random weights for activation is like a code book maintained locally. Can you explain what the differences/novelties are compared to previous work in terms of the two techniques?
6.	If an adversary knows how $ z$ is sampled and $g_h$ could be exposed via sum even the norm of $z$ is large. Noticed n parallel calls has been used as a workaround, it would be better if the cost and benefits trade-off is provided.
7.	Presentation issues. The last paragraph of page 3, $h$ is not well presented. $h’$ is used in Fig. 1 while it is $h^*$ in the main text.

### Summary
The authors search for a way to fine-tune models over an API while keeping the labels private. The authors analyze the privacy of popular algorithms for parameter-efficient fine-tuning when training over an API.

### Strengths
- The topic of privacy-preserving LLM is timing and essential.

### Weaknesses
 - No clear security model.
- The idea seems to be wrong.

- In Section 3, the authors claimed that "formulate a protocol for two-party" in the 1st sentence. In the abstract, "the client ..., and the server ...." A client and a server constitute "two-party" already. However, Equation 2 in Section 3.2 contains "two identical independent servers that offer backprop API." The number of parties is not corresponding. 

- As for the formulation, it looks like an application of the $n$-out-of-$n$ secret-sharing scheme. In particular, Equation 2 is essentially similar to Part 2 in [REF1]. Additionally, secret-shared backpropagation has already been solved in the early work [REF2].

Could the authors explicitly formulate the security model?
Could the authors explain the difference between the proposed formulation and secret sharing?

### Summary
Fine-tuning LLMs via API is a new trend in which users send their data to a server and let the server do the fine-tuning. This paper assumes the samples are pairs of features and labels \{(x, y)\}, and studies how to protect the privacy of the labels. The server is assumed to provide two API functions. The first is a forward function that returns activations ($h$). After receiving the activations, users compute the loss ($l$) by themselves and send $\partial l/\partial h$ to the server. The server then use the second backward API function that uses $\partial l/\partial h$ to do backpropagation to compute the gradients. The authors propose two empirical ways to prevent the server from inferring the labels from activations and gradients. Unfortunately, I have several concerns regarding the protection effectiveness.

### Strengths
1.Privacy-preserving API fine-tuning is an important problem and is very challenging due to the two-party learning nature. This paper provides some preliminary exploration towards solving this problem.

2.The ideas borrow some insights from the secure multi-party aggregation literature and are intriguing.

### Weaknesses
1.Regarding the privacy-preserving backpropagation. Although $\partial l/\partial h$ is protected, the server still has clean $\partial h/\partial \theta$. This still leaks information about the label. The concern is that the server could potentially reconstruct a representation similar to $\partial l/\partial \theta$ by leveraging its knowledge of $\partial h/\partial \theta$. While multiplying by $\partial l/\partial h$ introduces a linear transformation, this transformation might not be sufficient to fully obfuscate the label information, especially since the transformation is applied consistently across samples. A more rigorous analysis, potentially involving differential privacy or information-theoretic bounds, would be beneficial to quantify the leakage.

2.Regarding the privacy-preserving forward. The claim that the unaggregated \{h_i\} leaks a lot of information about the label if the label can be predicted via only linear transformations of $h_i$ is valid. However, the statement that the server can simply run some clustering algorithms needs further clarification. Even if \{h_i\} are linearly separable with respect to the labels, standard clustering algorithms like k-means might not be directly applicable or effective without modifications. This is because the inherent structure of \{h_i\} might not form well-defined clusters in the absence of label information. The authors should elaborate on the specific clustering algorithms they envision the server employing and provide a more detailed justification for their effectiveness in this context. For instance, they could analyze the performance of k-means or spectral clustering on the \{h_i\} and demonstrate how the cluster assignments correlate with the true labels.
