## Abstract
Markov processes are widely used mathematical models for describing dynamic systems in various fields. However, accurately simulating large-scale systems at long time scales is computationally expensive due to the short time steps required for accurate integration. In this paper, we introduce an inference process that maps complex systems into a simplified representational space and models large jumps in time. To achieve this, we propose Time-lagged Information Bottleneck (T-IB), a principled objective rooted in information theory, which aims to capture relevant temporal features while discarding high-frequency information to simplify the simulation task and minimize the inference error. Our experiments demonstrate that T-IB learns information-optimal representations for accurately modeling the statistical properties and dynamics of the original process at a selected time lag, outperforming existing time-lagged dimensionality reduction methods.

### Summary
Markov processes can require computing many intermediate steps before reaching the final state which may be expensive. This paper proposes modeling state in latent space and computing large steps in time directly. The transition and emission distributions are approximated using variational inference. The optimization scheme is two step: first the encoding distribution $q(z | x)$ is learned and then the rest is learned. The approach ensures that the latent space contains information about the original state through the mutual information and "autoinformation". They introduce a loss T-InfoMax that maximizes mutual information on latent state across some resolution gap. Finally, they introduce an information bottleneck to discard unnecessary information such as time dependent information, resulting in a loss T-IB. All the mutual information terms are approximated, some are learned with neural contrastive estimation.

### Strengths
The paper is nicely written and the method is explained well.

The information theoretic approach is a good motivator for what follows in the paper. The method itself is going through a couple of departures from the pure mutual information and get increasingly complex and further approximated.

The theoretical results in 2.2 are nice and follow the story, although I did not check the proofs in detail.

The results look good although some additional discussion is missing.

### Weaknesses
The method has many moving parts and some choices are not well motivated. For example, different choices of architectures for different distributions, training with contrastive estimation. A study that sees which part is contributing to the performance would be nice.

The training requires two step procedure.

As far I can see the authors do not provide actual run times. What should be compared is the total time to obtain the training data, train the model and perform the simulation.

There are two experiments, one with synthetic data which is a toy example and one with molecular simulation which again seems small in scale.

### Questions
- How to choose $\tau$ and once chosen, does this parameter remain fixed and the model has to be retrained for different choice?

- Can you provide run times?

- How does the model scale with the amount of data available for training?

### Summary
The paper addresses the challenge of accurately simulating large-scale Markov processes over extended time scales, a computationally expensive task. To overcome this, the authors introduce an inference scheme based on the Time-lagged Information Bottleneck (T-IB) framework. T-IB seeks to simplify the simulation process by mapping complex systems into a reduced representational space that captures relevant temporal features while discarding high-frequency information. Through experiments, the paper demonstrates the efficacy of T-IB in creating information-optimal representations for modeling the statistical properties and dynamics of the original process at a selected time lag.

### Strengths
The introduction of the Time-lagged Information Bottleneck (T-IB) framework, rooted in information theory, offers a novel perspective on data-driven model reduction of complex stochastic systems. This framework is developed based on Tiwary et al.'s past-future Information Bottleneck (IB) theory and leverages recent advancements in machine learning to achieve improved estimation of time-lagged mutual information. The experiments showcases the robustness and effectiveness of T-IB in learning information-optimal representations for Markov process simulation.

### Weaknesses
1. Comparison with Past-Future IB Method: The paper builds upon the past-future IB method proposed by Tiwary et al., but it introduces an optimization objective for I(z_t, z_t+tau) instead of I(z_t, x_t+tau). While theoretically, optimizing I(z_t, z_t+tau) is expected to yield a lower bound on I(z_t, x_t+tau), the paper lacks a comprehensive discussion of the differences between the two approaches. A deeper exploration of the distinctions and the implications of this choice is needed to provide a clearer understanding.

2. Choice of Estimation Method: In the machine learning domain, there are various methods for estimating lower bounds on mutual information. The paper selects a specific method, but it would benefit from a more thorough justification for this choice. Providing a comparative analysis of the selected method against other available options would enhance the paper's robustness.

3. Complexity of Additional Terms in Formula (8): The introduction of two additional terms in Formula (8) may appear somewhat perplexing. From an information bottleneck theory perspective, the goal is to discard as much irrelevant information as possible. However, dimensionality reduction inherently leads to information loss. The rationale and impact of introducing these terms need further clarification. Moreover, the experimental results suggest that the inclusion of these terms does not significantly affect the dimensionality reduction outcome, requiring a more detailed explanation.

4. Quantitative Evaluation of Dimensionality Reduction: The paper lacks a robust quantitative evaluation of the dimensionality reduction results. While the field may lack a general method for quantitatively assessing dimensionality reduction outcomes, the authors could consider exploring quantitative evaluation approaches, such as measuring mutual information under different tau conditions, to provide a more concrete assessment of the method's performance.

5. Comparison with VAMPnet: VAMPnet, as mentioned in the weaknesses, primarily serves the purpose of extracting dominant or slow components and estimating kinematic properties. It may not be a direct dimensionality reduction method. Comparing VAMPnet with the proposed approach for dimensionality reduction may not be entirely fair or informative.

### Summary
The paper aims to solve the problem of accurately and efficiently sampling large-scale systems at long time scales. The solution is based on information theory where the aim is to learn latent representations that capture the dynamical properties of the original process at at a selected time-lag by capturing relevant temporal features and discarding irrelevant high frequency information. The final objective is a trade-off between sufficiency (how informative is the learned representation of the dynamic properties of interest) and minimality of irrelevant information.

### Strengths
To the best of my knowledge the paper is original and presents novel ideas. The quality and clarity of the paper overall is also commendable, with well explained notations and good structuring of the paper. The idea is significant since efficiently and accurately simulating large scale systems on long time scales is a critical problem in various fields. The experiments seem to largely support the claims made in the paper.

### Weaknesses
This is a thorough work on its own but a few things can be improved, These are detailed in the "Questions" below. Generally this pertains to the way related works section is written and also a few claims that don't seem to be backed up.

1: The related works section currently reads like a list of related works. It will be far better to re-write this section as a discussion of how current literature relates to this proposed work and how this proposed work builds on top of this existing literature, and how it is better than its closest related works.

2: Can the authors comment on "Since $z_t$ is derived from $x_t$, the autoinformation for $x_t$ sets an upper-bound for the autoinformation for $z_t$. Given that the encoder is time-independent, how can we expect the autoinformation between $x_t$ to be related in any way to the autoinformation in $z_t$?

3: The paper sets up the reader to expect a solution that is faster than current available methods for simulation. I was expecting experiments measuring how long it takes for the simulations to be run compared to existing methods. Can the authors provide that?
