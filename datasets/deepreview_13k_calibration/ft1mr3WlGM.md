## Abstract
Image-Text Matching (ITM) task, a fundamental vision-language (VL) task, suffers from the inherent ambiguity arising from multiplicity and imperfect annotations. Deterministic functions are not sufficiently powerful to capture ambiguity, prompting the exploration of probabilistic embeddings to tackle the challenge. However, the existing probabilistic ITM approach encounters two key shortcomings; the burden of heavy computations due to the Monte Carlo approximation, and the loss saturation issue in the face of abundant false negatives. To overcome the issues, this paper presents an improved Probabilistic Cross-Modal Embeddings (named PCME\texttt{++}) by introducing a new probabilistic distance with a closed-form solution. In addition, two optimization techniques are proposed to enhance PCME\texttt{++} further: first, the incorporation of pseudo-positives to prevent the negative effect under massive false negatives; second, mixed sample data augmentation for probabilistic matching. Experimental results on MS-COCO Caption and two extended benchmarks, CxC and ECCV Caption, demonstrate the effectiveness of PCME\texttt{++} compared to state-of-the-art ITM methods. The robustness of PCME\texttt{++} is also evaluated under noisy image-text correspondences. In addition, the potential applicability of PCME\texttt{++} in automatic prompt-filtering for zero-shot classification is shown.

### Confidence
3: You are fairly confident in your assessment. It is possible that you did not understand some parts of the submission or that you are unfamiliar with some pieces of related work. Math/other details were not carefully checked.

### Summary
This paper presents an improved Probabilistic Cross-Modal Embeddings (named PCME++) by introducing a new probabilistic distance, incorporates of pseudo-positives to prevent the loss saturation problem, and introduce the data augmentation technique. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model.

### Strengths
1. The representation is good and easy to follow.

2. The robustness of PCME++ is evaluated under noisy image-text correspondences.

3. The most of the figures in this paper is informative, especially Figure1 and Figure5.

### Weaknesses
1. This work is deeply coupled with PCME( Chun et al. (2021)), which might limiting the inspiration and extensibility for other work.

2. As shown in Figure 5, the visualization could show the uncertainty of learned embeddings of visual features and textual features. However, the proposed closed-form sampled distance (CSD) could only simply measure the uncertainty but not the area of the overlap between two modality. I hope the authors could make more analysis.

3. Some techniques such as Mixup (Zhang et al., 2018) or CutMix (Yun et al., 2019) are proposed in the previous works, and the loss functions are shared with PCME( Chun et al. (2021)). Please clarify your contribution and improvements.

### Questions
1. Figure 2 is not easy-understood. Please make interpretations about it and formulate the comparison losses.

2. The motivation of this paper is "PCME suffers from expensive computations due to Monte Carlo approximation and fast loss saturation". However, the comparison or analysis about computation costs is not presented in the experiments.

### Summary
- This paper discusses some inherent issues with existing Image-Text Matching (ITM) methods and datasets, and provides analysis from the probabilistic perspective,

 - To solve the aforementioned issues, the authors propose Improved Probabilistic Image-Text Representations (PCME++) by introducing a closed-form probability distance to reduce the sampling costs of PCME and adopting two training techniques including pseudo-positive matches and mixed sample data augmentation. 

 - Extensive experiments across abundant VL datasets show the effectiveness of PCME++. Moreover, primitive results on extending PCME++ to other scenarios are shown.

### Strengths
- Serving as its major motivation, this paper analyzes the many-to-many nature and other inherent issues in the Image-Text Matching task. Focusing on this fundamental Vision Language (VL) downstream task, this work addresses shortcomings of previous uncertainty-based methods such as PCME. 

 - This presentation of this work is clear and easy to follow. In particular, the figures, such as Figure 2, are informative in illustrating important contexts.

 - The authors provide solid experimental results to support the effectiveness of PCME++. In addition to the evaluations on MS-COCO, CxC, and ECCV Caption with sota ITM methods, extensions to noisy correspondence and uncertainty-based prompt-tuning are conducted, which further demonstrate the advantage of PCME++.

### Weaknesses
 - About the advantage of PCME++, the authors mentioned the advantage of PCME++ when scaling-up backbones, which might be lacking further discussions. (See Questions)

### Questions
- In Table 1, experimental results on different backbones are provided. While methods like VSE and InfoNCE show performance degradation, PCME and PCME++ show consistent improvements. Does this phenomenon relate to specific advantages of probabilistic modeling? (and How)

5: You are absolutely certain about your assessment. You are very familiar with the related work and checked the math/other details carefully.

### Summary
This paper presents an improved probabilistic representation to address issues including the presence of false negatives and sparse annotations in image-text matching. 
Specifically, authors introduce two optimization techniques to enhance many-to-many matching, including pseudo-positives to prevent the loss saturation and mixed sample data augmentation for probabilistic matching

### Strengths
- well organized and easy to follow. 
- the paper focuses on two important issues in image text matching: many-to-many matching and sparse annotations.

### Weaknesses
 - Presented as Table 1 and 2, when ViT-B/32 was chosen as the backbone, the performance of PCME++ is inferior to VSE\infnite. 
Additionally, the performances of P2RM and DAA published in the original paper actually won PCME with a large margin, while their performances presented here are lower than PCME. 
The authors should make necessary explanations on these issues. 
Most importantly, could the proposed PP and MSDA be applied to P2RM and DAA to enhance the many-to-many performance? If not, please make the necessary explanations; if yes, pls make comparisons. 

- The datasets used in this submission including CxC and ECCV both come from MSCOCO, and thus the proposed method needs further verification on larger datasets like vision-language pretraining methods (CC3M dataset). 
The authors are also recommended to make comparisons against several recent works focusing on uncertainty modeling [A] and noisy correspondence[B].
