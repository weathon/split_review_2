## Abstract
Optimal Transport (OT) problem aims to find a transport plan that bridges two distributions while minimizing a given cost function. OT theory has been widely utilized in generative modeling. In the beginning, OT distance has been used as a measure for assessing the distance between data and generated distributions. Recently, OT transport map between data and prior distributions has been utilized as a generative model. These OT-based generative models share a similar adversarial training objective.
In this paper, we begin by unifying these OT-based adversarial methods within a single framework. 
Then, we elucidate the role of each component in training dynamics through a comprehensive analysis of this unified framework. 
Moreover, we suggest a simple but novel method that improves the previously best-performing OT-based model.
Intuitively, our approach conducts a gradual refinement of the generated distribution, progressively aligning it with the data distribution.
Our approach achieves a FID score of 2.51 on CIFAR-10 and 5.99 on CelebA-HQ-256, outperforming unified OT-based adversarial approaches.

### Summary
OT has been widely explored in generative modeling from diverse perspectives (e.g., OT loss and OT map). However, interpretation and understanding of the pros and cons of OT are underexplored.  In this paper, the authors are proposing a framework generalizing the existing OT-based generative models and additionally propose a scheduling method to mitigate the drawback of the cost function derived from OT. Both quantitative and qualitative analyses and experiments are reported.

### Strengths
- Background knowledge is contained well in the paper.
- Existing OT-based methods are analyzed well under the proposed generalizing framework.
- An additional scheduling method is proposed for mitigating a drawback of the cost function while boosting the benefit.

### Weaknesses
 - It is not easy to understand without expertise in OT. It would be much easier to read if one or two lines of descriptions comparing each term and notation with those of the regular GAN setup were provided.
- The analysis is good, but the benefit of the proposed method (UOTM-SD) is not clearly shown. The paper claims improved robustness to hyperparameters, but this is not sufficiently demonstrated through the experiments. The FID score differences are not large enough to strongly support the claim of improved generative performance.
- Experiments are limited to low-dimensional datasets which is not practical enough.
- Some parts are not clear which are described in the Questions below.

### Questions
1. Is the analysis valid in relatively higher-dimensional data (e.g., 128^2 or 256^2) such as  CelebA or FFHQ, CUB, or ImageNet?
2. (Alg. 1) What is $X$ in line 3? I would assume $Y$ is from real data and $z$ is from the prior known distribution, e.g., Gaussian. Similarly, $T_\theta$ is consistently taking $x$ as input throughout Equations in the paper while $x$ and $z$ are taken as input in the algorithm (line 4). For example, in Eq. 5, I can see that $x$ is a prior distribution $y$ is a real distribution and the OT term $c$ is applied in between the Gaussian and the generated samples, which I believe is different from the Algorithm.
3. (page 6, “Effect of Cost in Mode Collapse”) It is not straightforward how the cost function actually helps the mode coverage. 
4. Why the results in Fig. 1 and Fig. 5 are different?
5. Performance of UOTM-SD in the toy dataset? and Qualitative comparison results in Cifar10 (UOTM-SD v.s. UOTM)?

### Summary
This paper frames together two similar adversarial generative models: GANs involving a generator that learns to minimize an OT distance, and models whose objective is to directly learn the OT map from a prior distribution to the data distribution. The authors evaluate the stability and mode collapse of these models and conclude on the advantage of OT map models. In this category, one (based on unbalanced OT) is more performant than the other (based on standard OT), but less robust to hyperparameter choices. To alleviate this issue, the authors propose an interpolation strategy between both models to be scheduled during training.

### Strengths
By studying the considered adversarial models through a unified framework, this paper provides **interesting comparative insights** on their experimental performance. These insights might be valuable for future research in this area, highlighting the value of OT map models. These insights are **well illustrated** thanks to toy experiments, and the paper is overall **clear and easy to read**. The resulting proposed model refinements provide **improvements in generative performance and robustness to hyperparameter choices**, which is a substantial contribution in this domain.

### Weaknesses
The paper suffers from three main weaknesses that, together, make me believe that it remains under the acceptance threshold. I look forward to discussing with the authors and other reviewers on this topic.

### Significance of the Proposed Framework

As it is described in Algorithm 1, the proposed framework is a useful framework for exposition and experimental design, but the significance of this contribution is limited.
- It is a straightforward generalization of the already established lookalike adversarial objectives of Equations 4 and 5. This kind of framework is common in the GAN literature, e.g. in Nagarajan et al. (2017).
- The unified algorithm is not by itself the source of novel insights, or novel models. The proposed UOTM-SD does not necessitate this unified algorithm as it only interpolates between two OT map models using Equation (12).

Nagarajan et al. Gradient descent GAN optimization is locally stable. NIPS 2017.

### Weak Experiments

The experiments only weakly support the claims of the paper.
- The convergence and mode collapse properties are mainly studied in Section 3.2 on a toy dataset. Yet, the difference between low and high dimensions can be large when dealing with neural networks. Considering a higher-dimensional structured dataset could strengthen the experimental conclusions. Additionally, I would also suggest including another low-dimensional dataset to avoid any bias linked to having a data distribution evenly distributed around the prior distribution.
- Still on Section 3.2, the experiments lack a vanilla GAN baseline, especially to conclude on advantage of the SP function. Similarly, experiments of Figures 5 and 6 miss the WGAN-GP baseline.
- As a standalone model and with the available information, the comparative advantage of UOTM-SD is not significant enough. The gain in FID is minor and would thus require confidence intervals to be validated. The FID being computed on the training set, there is also a risk of overfitting to be taken into account. Furthermore, other datasets might be considered to test the robustness of the methods to other modalities and data dimensions.

### Possible Bias against OT Loss Models (GANs)

Generators in GANs do not require their latent space to be of the same dimension as their output. Yet, it seems to be the case for OT map models, given that they learn a transport map between two distributions living in the same space. I would suggest the authors to explicitly explain how this affects their experiments and their results. Are the provided comparisons fair between the two types of models, in terms of dimensionality and neural network architectures? Both operation modes seem hard to articulate with each other, as Algorithm 1 features the sampling of both a random variable from the same space as the data and another latent variable to accommodate the two types of models.

Moreover, the authors should further the comment why the Lipschitzness result of Theorem 3.1 is an advantage over GANs. WGAN(-GP) also requires Lipschitz solutions, and the Lipschitzness constraint is even applied to other GAN models nowadays.

### Remarks on the Form

- The references of Fan et al. and Rout et al. miss a year.
- Some notations are not defined, like $\Pi(\mu, \nu)$ and $D_{\psi_i}$ in Section 2.
- Differentials $d$ in integrals should be upright for better readability.
- Abbreviations of "Equation" should end with a point: "Eq.".
- Equations 4 and 5 are not learning objectives but optima of learning objective. The correct way to present them is in Algorithm 1.
- The color scheme of Figure 5 should be adjusted for a better readability in grayscale.
- Some space should be added between images and captions in Figure 4.

### Summary
In this paper, the authors propose novel theoretical results on varies aspects of the recently proposed Unbalanced Optimal Transport Model (UOTM), which is an optimal transport (OT) based generative model. In particular, in section 3, the authors provide an insight of how different choice of g_1 and g_2 and cost function could help stabilize training. In theorem 3.1, the authors prove the existence and uniqueness of the UOTM model. Moreover in section 4, the authors propose a novel alpha-scheduling method to stabilize training as well as mitigating the mode collapse/mixture problem. Theorem 4.1 shows that under this schema, the solutions of the UOT problems converge to the OT solution when alpha goes to infinity. This provides a new approach of solving the OT problem in the context of generative models.

### Strengths
The originality of the paper mainly comes from theorems 3.1 and 4.1, which consolidate the recently proposed UOTM method. These theorems pave the way of the proposed method that addresses the tau-sensitivity problem. Clarity of the paper looks good to me overall, but there are some places I'm confused about.

### Weaknesses
The experiment results look promising as well. It would be great if the proposed method is applied on higher solution image dataset to showcase the image generation quality.

For WGAN explanation in section 3.1, the authors categorize this case as c = 0. I don't think this is the case because the in the original paper, this cost is the L1 Euclidean distance, i.e. c(x, y) = |x-y|. Also, it seems the Lipschitz constraint is missing in this case. It would be great if this part is further clarified.

Same comment for the italic sentence after Eq. 5.

More of a suggestion: in the experiment part (E.g. Fig. 1, Fig. 5 etc.), it would be great if the authors also include non-DNN based OT maps like the one proposed in An et. al 2019, as their solution is unique and can be found by a convex optimization.

### Summary
In this paper, the authors trying to unify various descriptions of OT-based adversarial networks, and  compare known frameworks under the proposed unified framework. In their unified framework, i.e. Algorithm 1, there are some degrees of freedom:
- functions $g_{1,2,3}$, that measure each term of the adversarial loss:
    - $g_1$ is for discriminator's loss from c-transform,
    - $g_2$ is for discriminator's loss from dual potential in OT,
    - $g_3$ is for generator's loss from c-transform,
- cost function $c(x,y)$ in the context of OT:
    - $\tau$: coefficient of squared transport cost $c(x,y) = \tau \|x-y\|^2_2$,
- regularization term $\mathcal{R}$.

The choice of each component corresponds a certain generative model training protocol.

They prove some theoretical guarantees on the training protocols (Thm 3.1 and Thm 4.1) and verify the assumptions for the theorems, i.e. strictly convexity and finiteness of $\Psi$s do improve the training procedure.

In addition, they clarify the limitations on their method in 5 CONCLUSION.

### Strengths
- The paper is well written, and there are some theoretical results (Thm 3.1 and Thm 4.1). 
- They conducted various experiments and show the results on UOTM(-SD), which is the proposed unified framework, can achieve the best performance on CIFAR-10 generation except for SOTA diffusion model (Table 3). In particular, they proposed a concrete method for preventing mode collapse problem in Section 4, by considering scheduled scaling of the objectives, i.e. UOTM-SD.

### Weaknesses
 - I think it is slightly misleading that using $\Psi$s in eq.(8) that would correspond to $g$s in Algorithm 1.
> After discussion to the authors, I concluded that this issue will appear to be less of a problem, and I raised Soundness a little.
- On the experiments for Lipschitz continuity, Fig 6, the experiments seem to be conducted only with 2d data, and I prefer counterparts of them in training for image generations also.
- UOTM-SD look working very good in CIFAR-10, but it is not evident that is also good for other domains.

### Questions
Question
- Do $g_{1,2}$ in Algorithm 1 correspond $\Psi_{1,2}$ in eq.(8)? If so, why the authors change its notation?
> It has been answered by authors
- The author achieved best performance of UOTM-SD on CIFAR-10, it would be good. But how about different image data? Does the scheduling strategy also improve stability using other image data?

### Summary
This paper introduced a unified framework that encompasses previous OT-based GANs, which is derived from the semi-dual form of unbalanced OT.  The authors presented a comprehensive analysis of different OT-based frameworks, as well as other well-researched generative models such as diffusion and VAEs.  In the end, the authors demonstrated a tradeoff between perception quality and mode collapsing, which was affected by the effect of the cost term in the loss function, and proposed a new training scheme by controlling this term during training.

### Strengths
This is an extremely well-written paper.  The presentation is easy to follow and technical details are clear and sound.  

The findings in the paper are interesting.  Although the newly proposed scheduling scheme isn't the most impressive, but I trust the insight of this unified view will deepen the understanding on this topic.  

The experiments are well set up to prove the hypothesis.  In general, I enjoyed reading the paper very much.

### Weaknesses
The main weakness of this paper is the proposed scheduling scheme is a very simple idea which proved to be useful for a basic experiment in an extremely low dimensional setting.  I'm not sure whether this method can be scaled to high dimensional setting easily.

I'm surprised that WGAN didn't even work at all for the first toy problem.  How many hyperparameter settings did you try?  What would be the reason you think that it just won't work?
