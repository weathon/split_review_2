## Abstract
Large language models display remarkable capabilities in logical and mathematical reasoning, allowing them to solve complex tasks. Interestingly, these abilities emerge in networks trained on the simple task of next-token prediction. In this work, we present a theoretical framework for studying auto-regressive next-token predictors. We demonstrate that even simple models such as linear next-token predictors, trained on Chain-of-Thought (CoT) data, can approximate any function efficiently computed by a Turing machine. We introduce a new complexity measure---length complexity---which measures the number of intermediate tokens in a CoT sequence required to approximate some target function, and analyze the interplay between length complexity and other notions of complexity. Finally, we show experimentally that simple next-token predictors, such as linear networks and shallow Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs), display non-trivial performance on text generation and arithmetic tasks. Our results demonstrate that the power of today's LLMs can be attributed, to a great extent, to the auto-regressive next-token training scheme, and not necessarily to a particular choice of architecture

### Summary
This paper attempts to provide a theoretical explanation of how auto-regressive prediction in LLMs can enable them to perform nontrivial tasks.

The theoretical idea is that a dataset including intermediate steps can enable simple (in fact, linear) next-token predictors to learn to perform arbitrary computable functions.

The paper develops a theory formalizing these ideas.
It first presents a notion of autoregressive learnability modeled on PAC learnability.
It then derives results on the approximability of problems with autoregressive predictors -- that is, in the presence of intermediate steps. Indeed, for any Turing-computable function, a linear autoregressive model can compute this function, with a number of intermediate steps polynomial in the Turing machine's runtime.
It finally investigates the number of required intermediate steps, at the example of k-th order parities in length-n strings. This "length complexity" can trade off with the computational complexity, as a shorter sequence may require more complex individual steps.

It then presents two experiments showing that simple autoregressive predictors can perform nontrivial tasks.

The first experiment qualitatively shows that a linear autoregressive model trained on TinyStories can produce mostly-reasonable-looking text.
The second experiment shows that, with appropriate intermediate steps and an adapted input formatting, an MLP-based autoregressive model can multiply 4-digit numbers.

### Strengths
- Provides an interesting angle on the success of chain-of-thought in enabling LMs to perform more complex tasks

- provides both theoretical analysis and empirical evidence

### Weaknesses
 - The TinyStories experiment (Section 3.1) lacks quantitative evaluation. It is unclear if the examples shown are representative.

- Multiplication experiment: unlike the TinyStories experiment, the model is not linear -- is this important? Why not use the same model for both experiments?

- There appears to be a potential mismatch with realistic chain-of-thought prompting in that the learnability theory developed here assumes that the tasks are available together with their full sequences of intermediate steps in the training set, whereas in reality prompts containing chain-of-thought demonstrations may be quite unnatural, and are quite likely not to have appeared in that form in the training set. In this sense, the learnability theory, if understood as applying to unsupervised LLM training, does not explain why LMs would be able to deal with unnatural prompt formats.

- In the multiplication experiment, the calculations are decomposed into "more intermediate steps than in Liu&Low". Furthermore, they involve padding to get all strings to have the same length, apparently unlike Liu&Low. Both of these steps may impact the comparison with the results from Liu&Low. Furthermore, unlike the MLP, GPT-3.5 is (judging by Figure 2) not prompted to output intermediate steps. Thus, it is unclear what one can learn from the comparison between the models in Figure 2 (right), and the statement "outperforms GPT-4" in the introduction may not be fully supported.

### Questions
- Section 3.1: what is the objective function -- is it cross-entropy? Is softmax applied on the linear output? 

- Section 2.1, first paragraph: Why is \mathcal{D} a distribution -- given that its support is finite and that the only probabilistic statement made then holds with probability 1 (next line), could \mathcal{D} just as well be a subset of X \times Z_T?

- Definition 2: when encountering this, I wondered: is T a global free variable (i.e., AR-Learnability is defined w.r.t. T), or is T dependent on \mathcal{D}? This is resolved in Footnote 2. Maybe disambiguate this at the beginning of Section 2.1?

- minor: "Multi-Linear Perceptron (MLP)" (page 2, third paragraph) --> the standard reading of "MLP" appears to be Multi-Layer Perceptron, and indeed the model appears to be of this type

### Summary
The paper introduces a theoretical framework for studying auto-regressive next-token prediction models. The key idea is that auto-regressive learning, where the model is trained to predict the next token given previous tokens, allows the model to utilize intermediate "chain-of-thought" computations. This gives the model more information compared to standard supervised learning where only input-output pairs are provided.

The authors show theoretically that even simple auto-regressive models like linear next-token predictors can approximate any efficiently Turing-computable function, if provided with appropriate intermediate chain-of-thought supervision. They also introduce a new notion of "length complexity" which measures the number of intermediate tokens needed to learn a target function. Length complexity allows trading off sample/computational complexity and length complexity.

Experiments on text generation and arithmetic tasks demonstrate that simple models like linear networks and small MLPs can perform well when trained with next-token prediction and chain-of-thought supervision.

### Strengths
(1) Provides an elegant theoretical framework for studying auto-regressive next-token prediction models, an important class of models in NLP.

(2) Establishes strong learnability and approximation guarantees for simple models like linear predictors when trained auto-regressively.

(3) Introduces the novel concept of "length complexity" to capture chain-of-thought requirements. Relates length complexity to sample and computational complexity.

### Weaknesses
 (1) The theoretical results rely on very strong assumptions about availability of chain-of-thought training data, which may be unrealistic. Specifically, the assumption that arbitrary chain-of-thought demonstrations are available for any input-output pair is a significant limitation. The paper does not address how the model would perform if only a limited set of CoT examples were available, or if the CoT data was noisy or suboptimal.

(2) More analysis would be useful on how length complexity scales with problem complexity for different hypothesis classes. The paper introduces length complexity but does not provide a comprehensive analysis of how this measure changes with different problem types or model architectures. For example, it would be beneficial to see how length complexity scales for problems with varying degrees of non-linearity or for different types of reasoning tasks.

(3) Additional validation on more complex architectures like Transformers would strengthen the conclusions about training scheme vs architecture. The experiments are limited to linear networks and small MLPs. It is unclear if the findings generalize to more complex architectures like Transformers, which are widely used in NLP. The paper should investigate how the proposed training scheme interacts with the architectural choices in larger models.

(4) The proposed linear models are not exactly equivalent to the classical linear models analyzed. Some parameters are shared across time steps. This weight sharing introduces a form of recurrence that is not present in standard linear models, making the analysis less directly comparable to classical linear regression or classification.

(5) Non autoregressive models are not discussed, tested and compared. It will be to know if given large amount of training data, non-autoregressive models can perform on par with autoregressive models. The paper lacks a comparative analysis of non-autoregressive models, which could provide insights into the specific benefits of the autoregressive approach. It is important to understand if the observed performance gains are solely due to the autoregressive nature of the model or if other factors are at play.

(6) On MULTIPLICATION experiments, models are trained and tested on 4-digit numbers. The model is likely to memorize the patterns instead of generalizations, especially this paper use special tokenization for digits and signs. The use of 4-digit numbers in the multiplication experiments raises concerns about the model's ability to generalize. The special tokenization could further encourage memorization rather than learning the underlying arithmetic operations. It would be beneficial to test the model on larger numbers or different arithmetic operations to assess its true generalization capabilities.

### Questions
This paper misses some critical references:

(1) Training of smaller student models on CoT data has been investigated in several earlier papers [1, 2]. 
(2) Language Models for Arithmetic Tasks have been extensively discussed and studied in [3].

### Summary
This paper introduces a theoretical framework for analyzing autoregressive learners. At its core is a formal definition of autoregressive learnability (AR Learnability), analogous to PAC Learnability.

AR Learnability is defined with respect to distributions over strings over a finite set of tokens $\mathbb{D}$. More specifically, these are distributions $\mathcal{D}$ over contexts $\mathcal{X} = \mathbb{D}^n$ and continuations $\mathcal{Z} = \mathbb{D}^T$ for some integers $n$ and $T$.
Briefly stated, a hypothesis class $\mathcal{H}$ is AR Learnable if there is an algorithm that, for any realizable distribution $\mathcal{D}$, takes as input samples from $\mathcal{D}$ and outputs (w.h.p.) a hypothesis $h \in \mathcal{H}$ such that $h(x,z_{\<t}) = z_t$ for most $t \leq T$. That is, a hypothesis that can (mostly) correctly generate the continuation of the context $x$ as in the distribution $\mathcal{D}$.

This definition is rigorously analyzed. The first batch of theoretical findings (theorems) are concerned with the universality of AR learners:
1. The product of $T$ PAC-learnable hypothesis classes AR-learable [Theorem 3].
2. A generalization of AR-learability to the setting of computing/approximating functions; AR-learnable classes are approximable [Theorem 5]
3. Linear AR models ($\mathcal{H}^{\mathrm{lin}}$) can approximate any $f \in \mathrm{TIME}(T(n))$ w.r.t any distribution $\mathcal{D}$ given access to a dataset of $\mathrm{poly}(\mathrm{T(n)})$-length strings [Corollary 8].

The last item above is particularly significant because, in the supervised (i.e., "standard") setting, the analogous class to $\mathcal{H}^{\mathrm{lin}}$ are known to be so weak that they cannot learn the XOR function. To my understanding, Corollary 8 is proven by representing the function $f$ as a linear threshold circuit $C_f$; the dataset is populated by sampling an $x \gets \mathcal{D}$ and adding a row that represents the outputs of intermediate gates of $C_f(x)$.

Considering the above proof, it is perhaps not surprising that AR learners are universal learners; the "heavy-lifting" is done by the dataset, which verbosely represents the computed function. Thus, the authors define and analyze a new complexity measure for AR learners, called the _length complexity_: For a given hypothesis class $\mathcal{H}$ and a target function class $\mathcal{F}$, the length complexity is the [minimal? see Weaknesses] number of autoregressive steps $T$ such that each $f \in \mathcal{F}$ can be computed  by some $h \in \mathcal{H}$ within $T$ autoregressive steps. Intuitively, length complexity should capture the length of a chain-of-thought used when training the model.

Finally, the authors show that parities over $n$ bits can be computed by $\mathcal{H}^{\mathrm{lin}}$ with length complexity $O(\log n)$. Additionally, they prove a theorem depicting a trade-off between the richness of the hypothesis class and the length complexity, by showing that parities over $n$ bits can be learned by $k$-order parities over $\geq n$ bits, with length complexity $\Theta(n / k)$.

The authors supplement the theoretical framework and findings with experimental evaluation. First, they show that an adaptation of $\mathcal{H}^{\mathrm{lin}}$ with 162M parameters exhibits non-trivial learning on TinyStories; it is often able to generate coherent text. Second, they show that a 4-layer MLP with 775M parameters can learn to multiply 4 digit numbers as well as Goat 7B, provided sufficiently long chain-of-thought (i.e., length complexity) and a custom tokenization scheme.

### Strengths
- This paper provides a theoretical foundation for an increasingly important topic, namely, understanding the emergent abilities of autoregressive learners.
- Several theoretical works have already tackled the questions of autoregressive learning. However, to my knowledge, this is the first paper to propose a generic defintion analogous to PAC-learning. This is significant because it may inspire learning theorists to search for analogous results to what is known in the rich literature of PAC. For example, as the authors suggest, it would be interesting to find an intrinsic dimension of hypothesis classes that governs AR-learnability (cf. VC-dimension).
- The theoretical framework presented in this paper is an appropriate operationalization of autoregressive learning: the definitions stay close to autoregressive learning as it is implemented in practice (at least conceptually).
- I find the framework itself appealing. It is not easy to come up with a clean definition based on an existing phenomenon, as they real world is often "messy". The definitions strike a good balance between intuitiveness/simplicitly, to being non-trivial ("mysterious") enough to invite further analysis.
- Overall, the paper is clearly written. Reading it was an enjoyable experience!
- I particularly appreciate how well-organized this paper is. It first presents a fairly intuitive definition, and then provides a sequence of theorems and refinements of this definition to interesting settings. That is to say, the paper "tells a convincing story" about autoregressive learning.
- This "story" that the theory suggests is then supported by experimental results fairly adequetly. While the experimental setup is somewhat simplistic as compared to more empirical works, I do not think that a grander setup is needed for this type of paper.
- While I did not verify the proofs of all theorems, I have read some of them (especially Theorem 7) and they seem correct. I would also like to emphasize that the simplicity of the proofs should not be viewed as a weakness of this paper. Coming up with the right definition (from which intuitive theorems are easy to prove) is a challenging part of many theoretical works; in this case, the authors did well in carefully designing their framework.

### Weaknesses
Listed in decreasing order of significance.

## TinyStories experiment is anecdotal, compares to wrong model?
I am not sure what are the actual results being reported with the TinyStories experiment: What I found is a footnote on a 1.2 difference in perplexity between the linear predictor and GPT-2 Small---but I'm not sure what to make of this quantity. And there is a statement that the linear predictor "often does produce coherent text". But how often? And how do you measure coherence? While I lack the expertise to suggest a concrete experiment, I expect a higher level of rigour for a paper at ICLR. Perhaps the authors could refer to the TinyStories paper and reproduce some of the experiments there with their model.

Relatedly, it seems that in the TinyStories paper there is a 28M-parameter model that achieves performance comparable to GPT2-XL. Therefore, the comparison of the linear predictor to GPT2-Small seems inappropriate---much better performance can be attained with 5x less parameters. Perhaps the authors should compare the linear predictor to [that model](https://huggingface.co/papers/2305.07759) instead. Discovering that a linear predictor requires significantly more parameters than a (good) transformer model to achieve comparable performance would undermine the main message of the paper (that the power of LLMs can be attributed to AR rather than architecture). Please correct me if you disagree that comparing to the TinyStories transformer is a more fair comparison towards this end.

## Linear Decoders should be defined more slowly
- Given the significance of linear ARs (linear decoders) throughout the paper, I suggest defining them more slowly and in their own Definition environment---rather than presenting them as an "Example". A Definition environment is more easy to refer back to, and encourages more formal writing.
- A figure depicting the construction would be welcome: I had to work it out with pen and paper on the margin.
- "Under some margin conditions and using a convex surrogate loss function, this class is in fact learnable using SGD." This sentence must be supported by either a citation or a proof. As it is currently phrased it is too vague and not well-enough argued for to be used as a true statement (the current level of rigour is more appropriate for a tangential side-note).
- Observe that this class is learnable in polynomial time: Say PAC-learnable, becuase this paper uses multiple notions of learnability.

## Length complexity is not well-defined
As length complexity is currently defined in Definition 9, a class $\mathcal{H}$ has infinitely many length complexities for computing a given $\mathcal{F}$. This is because if $T$ is a length complexity of $\mathcal{H}$ for computing $\mathcal{F}$, then so is any $T' \geq T$. Instead, you should define the length complexity of $\mathcal{H}$ computing $\mathcal{F}$ to be _the minimal $T$ for which the conditions stated in the definition hold.

On that note, it would be illuminating (and add to the cohesion of the paper) if the authors spell-out the length complexity of the construction from Theorem 7.

## Missing citations
- Towards Revealing the Mystery behind Chain of Thought: A Theoretical Perspective by Feng et al. (2023): This work gives a complexity-theoretic explanation to the success of chain-of-thought, especially in mathematical reasoning. The techniques seem entirely different, and it is focused on transformer architectures (rather than focusing on the autoregressive aspect of LLMs, as in the paper currently under review). Still, it clearly fits in three of the four topics covered by the related work (all save for "Beyond Transfomers").
- Fast Learning Requires Good Memory: A Time-Space Lower Bound for Parity Learning by Raz (2016): This prominent result (FOCS best paper, JACM) should probably be mentioned in the first paragraph of Section 2.3.1 that discusses hardness results for parities.

## Other minor writing comments
- Page 4 above Definition 2: "...for all **sub-sequences** $z_{<t}$" should be **prefixes** (sub-sequences is correct but less accurate).
- Definition 2: Should say "for every $\epsilon, \delta \in (0,1)".
- Definition 2: Should say "If there exists $m \colon (0,1)^2 \to \mathbb{N}$" such that... Otherwise, the order of quantifiers / role of $m$ is unclear.
- Definition 2: Should say "returns w.p. $\geq 1-\delta$ a function $h \in \mathcal{H}$. Also, the first use of w.p. should be explicitly defined ("with probability (w.p.)") so that the paper is accessible to a broad audience.
- Theorem 3: It would be nice to write "then \mathcal{H} = \mathcal{H}_1 \times \dots \times \mathcal{H}_T". Ideally, theorem statmenets should be as self-contained as possible as they are often used for quick reference.
- Definition 4: I would say that "$h$ computes $f$ w.r.t \mathcal{D}". That is, explicitly include $\mathcal{D}$ in the definition, since it is crucial. Likewise for the definition of _approximates_.
- Theorem 5: If the previous comment is accepted, this statement should be updated.
- Theorem 6: If my understanding of the proof is correct (see Summary of this review, above), it is worth adding a sentence explaining what the dataset is to the body of the paper---rather than just saying the main fact the proof relies on, explain how it is used.
- Theorem 7 and Corollary 8: use the notation $\mathcal{H}^{\mathrm{lin}}$ here when referring to linear AR functions/models. Otherwise, the notation surprisingly re-appears on the next page.
- Section 2.3.1: This is a matter of taste, but I would find it more informative to use $\mathcal{P}_n$ to denote the class of parities on $n$ bits. This is because $\mathcal{F}$ was previously used to refer to a generic class of functions.
- Section 2.3.1, second paragraph after Theorem 10: when defining $\mathcal{F}_{n,k}$, it should be $A \in \binom{[n]}{\leq k}$. Note the square brackets around $n$.
- Section 2.3.1, above Theorem 11: It would be much better to avoid using $\approx$ notation in favor of notation with more well-defined meaning, such as $O(\cdot)$.
- Section 2.3.1, above Theorem 11: Should be "and a sample complexity of $\approx k \log n$" (not "the sample complexity").

### Questions
Many of the suggestions/qualms I listen in Weaknesses above can be rephrased as a question. I am open to discussing any of these, and would consider updating my score based on these being addressed in a revision. My only remaining question is whether the authors intend to release the code used for their experiments so that the reader may reproduce them.
