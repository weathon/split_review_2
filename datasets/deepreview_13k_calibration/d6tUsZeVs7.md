## Abstract
Energy-based models (EBMs) are known in the Machine Learning community for decades. Since the seminal works devoted to EBMs dating back to the noughties, there have been a lot of efficient methods which solve the generative modelling problem by means of energy potentials (unnormalized likelihood functions). In contrast, the realm of Optimal Transport (OT) and, in particular, neural OT solvers is much less explored and limited by few recent works (excluding WGAN-based approaches which utilize OT as a loss function and do not model OT maps themselves). In our work, we bridge the gap between EBMs and Entropy-regularized OT. We present a novel methodology which allows utilizing the recent developments and technical improvements of the former in order to enrich the latter. From the theoretical perspective, we prove generalization bounds for our technique. In practice, we validate its applicability in toy 2D and image domains. To showcase the scalability, we empower our method with a pre-trained StyleGAN and apply it to high-res AFHQ $512\times512$ unpaired I2I translation. For simplicity, we choose simple short- and long-run EBMs as a backbone of our Energy-guided Entropic OT approach, leaving the application of more sophisticated EBMs for future research

### Summary
The paper proposes a novel method for computing entropic optimal transport problem (EOT), utilizing techniques from energy-based models (EBM). Specifically, the paper uses the weak dual form to reformulate the EOT problem into an optimization task over space of functions, where the objective takes form similar to the EBM, i.e. in exponential form. The paper then proceeds to parametrize the function space by neural networks, and applies the algorithm to various tasks. Theoretical results are provided regarding why the proposed method approximates the optimal EOT coupling, and how the estimation and approximation contributes to generalization. Experiments are implemented, where various technical subtleties are also addressed.

### Strengths
The paper is overall well written and presented, and the the ideas are original to the knowledge of the reviewer. The discussion of all results seem plenty and extensive. Some strengths:
1. The paper points out that the semi dual form of EOT works well for approximation of optimal coupling. The reviewer finds it interesting, as in semi dual form, essentially only one of the two equations of the Schrödinger system is satisfied, thus the other marginal usually lacks control. However, as shown in the theorem 2, even if only one potential is parametrized, constructing a joint distribution by taking conditionals to be normalized exponential models gives clean approximation of the optimal coupling, with bounds on approximation gap. As the construction naturally extrapolates, the proposed method not only computes EOT, but also helps generative sampling.
2. The proposed usage of EBM seems principled, as EOT semi dual form admits exponential form, which enables application of well-studied sampling methods, and the corresponding gradients all have simple feasible forms.
3. The experiments seem plenty and sufficient, and various training techniques for EBM are also discussed.

### Weaknesses
Some weaknesses:
1. One major concern is the bound in Theorem 4, where a classical bound of error illustrating the balance between approximation and estimation is provided, using Rademacher complexity and optimality gap. However, it is unclear what is expected as the overall rate from this bound, as the choice of parametric class remains heuristic. This can be important, as generative tasks usually operates in high dimensions, and the dependence in dimensionality seems crucial to justify the applicability. There are plenty of works, for example, please see [1,2] for approximation and estimation using neural networks. Clarifying the proper choice of the parametric class and giving an explicit balancing characterization would give a clearer picture. Specifically, the bound in Theorem 4 involves the Rademacher complexity of the function class after a weak $C_{EOT}$ transformation. It is not immediately clear how this complexity relates to the complexity of the original function class, such as a neural network, and how it scales with the dimensionality of the input space. This makes it difficult to assess the practical implications of the theoretical result.
2. The paper seems to focus more on applicability of EBM, though this class of methods usually requires sampling, which creates major computational burden and additional estimating error. A full computational and space-time complexity analysis seems needed, as even regardless of the NN optimization, the construction of the loss function requires significant computation to obtain an oracle. Furthermore, it would be interesting to also see how sampling error enters the bound in Theorem 4. The computational cost of generating samples from the EBM, especially in high dimensions, can be significant. The paper does not provide a detailed analysis of how the number of samples affects the accuracy of the EOT computation, nor does it discuss the computational cost of the MCMC sampling procedure itself. This is a crucial point, as the practical applicability of the method hinges on its computational feasibility.

### Questions
Please see above (section Weaknesses) for details. An additional question: is it possible to give a characterization of $\epsilon$ dependence of computation/estimation/approximation? The reviewer understands that this is additional work, so simple answers such as exponential/polynomial dependence would be also good.

### Confidence
3: You are fairly confident in your assessment. It is possible that you did not understand some parts of the submission or that you are unfamiliar with some pieces of related work. Math/other details were not carefully checked.

### Summary
The paper reformulates the weak dual of the energy-optimal transport problem to identify an expectation inside the loss function that results in their loss function being trained in a similar way to energy-based models. This allows energy-based training procedures to be used to solve optimal transport problems.

### Strengths
The arguments in the paper are clear and straightforward. The paper is well structured with the contributions highlighted clearly. The background is well-presented and I don't see typos. Figure 2 is well-made and shows the efficacy of their method.

### Weaknesses
The biggest weakness of their proposed method uses energy-based training which involves MCMC. I am unclear if this is ideal as MCMC can be tricky. It would be interesting to see if the unpaired image-to-image task can be done with other OT methods to better see how useful this particular formulation and method is.

### Questions
Is there a relationship between $(c, \epsilon)$-transform and the Cole–Hopf transformation in PDEs ? They do seem very similar. It would also be very interesting to apply this to more than just continuous distribution but discrete distribution like languages so doing task like language translation would be interesting to see.

### Summary
This work bridges the gap between Energy-Based Models (EBMs) and Entropy-regularized Optimal Transport (EOT). In particular, it demonstrates that solving EOT is, to some extent, equivalent to EBM training. Thus, a novel methodology is introduced that leverages recent EBM developments to enhance the EOT solver. The approach is theoretically underpinned by generalization bounds and validated through practical applications in 2D and image domains.

### Strengths
This research uncovers the connection between energy-based models and entropy-regularized optimal transport, opening up new applications for EBMs, including unpaired data-to-data translation.

### Weaknesses
My primary concern centres around the scalability of the proposed approach. The training process hinges on simulating MCMC, which poses significant challenges when dealing with high-dimensional datasets. While promising results have been demonstrated in experiments on high-dimensional unpaired image-to-image translation, it is worth noting that this approach couples with a pretrained GAN model and conducts training in latent spaces. I hold reservations about its direct applicability to image spaces. The reliance on MCMC sampling for training the energy-based model, which is core to this approach, introduces computational bottlenecks that are particularly pronounced in high-dimensional settings. Furthermore, the method's dependence on a pre-trained GAN for image-to-image translation limits its applicability in scenarios where such pre-trained models are unavailable or unsuitable. The experiments, while showcasing potential, do not fully address the challenges of applying the method directly in high-dimensional image spaces without the intermediate latent space representation.

### Questions
- It appears that equation 18 is akin to the maximum likelihood training of the EBM defined in equation 13. Could you offer a more intuitive explanation of why maximizing the likelihood of equation 13 is valid and how it equates to entropy-regularized optimal transport?
- Can equation 17 be optimised using alternative EBM training techniques, such as noise contrastive estimate, and score matching?
