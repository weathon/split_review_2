## Abstract
Realistic graphs contain both (1) rich self-features of nodes and  (2) informative structures of neighborhoods, jointly handled by a Graph Neural Network (GNN) in the typical setup. We propose to decouple the two modalities by **M**ixture **o**f **w**eak and **st**rong experts (**Mowst**), where the weak expert is a light-weight Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP), and the strong expert is an off-the-shelf GNN. To adapt the experts' collaboration to different target nodes, we propose a "confidence" mechanism based on the dispersion of the weak expert's prediction logits. The strong expert is conditionally activated in the low-confidence region when either the node's classification relies on neighborhood information, or the weak expert has low model quality. We reveal interesting training dynamics by analyzing the influence of the confidence function on loss: our training algorithm encourages the specialization of each expert by effectively generating soft splitting of the graph. In addition, our "confidence" design imposes a desirable bias toward the strong expert to benefit from GNN's better generalization capability. Mowst is easy to optimize and achieves strong expressive power, with a computation cost comparable to a single GNN. Empirically, Mowst on 4 backbone GNN architectures show significant accuracy improvement on 6 standard node classification benchmarks, including both homophilous and heterophilous graphs (https://github.com/facebookresearch/mowst-gnn).

### Summary
The heterogeneity of node classes raise unique challenges to message passing graph neural networks. Iterative aggregating neighbors can magnify the negative impact of dissimilar nodes on the representation quality. This work tries to deal with this problem by decoupling node presentation into MLP and GNN. MLP mainly captures node-self property and receives much more less impact from neighbor than GNNs. With the help of confidence value calculated based on the output logits of MLP, the proposed approach tends to obtain a better balance on the predictions between homophilous and heterophilous nodes.

### Strengths
Strengths:
1. This work proposes to combine MLP and GNN for balancing the predictions for homophilous and heterophilous nodes.
2. Authors add theoretical analysis that are trying to fold out more insight to show the superiority of the proposed loss.
3. Experiments are conducted on various scale of datasets to demonstrate the performance of the proposed method.

### Weaknesses
Weaknesses:
1. The presentation quality still has lots of space to improve. That's also the main drawback of this work. The motivation is not clear enough. I guess that the main motivation of this work is about how to overcome the challenges raised by heterophily since most of GNNs work well on homophily network. But there is no literature overview on overcoming heterohpily in the related work section. Moreover, no baselines for dealing with heterophily are included in the experimental section. It's better to illustrate the diagram of learning objective to show how the MLP and GNN collaborate to each other, since they are not applied to mode layers.

Apart from the missing literature, many claims in this work are not clear. Here a incomplete list. 
  - "GNNs are both expensive to compute and hard to optimize". By far, many efficient way to run GNNs are already proposed and applied to solve industrial problems. It should not be the main drawback of advanced GNN layer or model. Comparing with MLP, GNN indeed requires more computation cost, but we still have solutions to make it applicable to deal with large scale data. With the claim, what is it relation to the proposed method? It's difficult see that the proposed method has dominated advantage in terms of time complexity since it still relies on the GNN. 
   - "a cluster of high homophily, the neighbors are similar, and thus aggregating their features via a GNN layer may not be more advantageous". The "similar neighbors" should be more clear. Assume that this work mainly focuses on node classification according to the experimental tasks, similar neighbors tend to have the same class, but not mean that they should have close similar feature distributions. In this case, aggregating neighbors could bring missing information to the target node for better classification performance.
  - "The MLP can help “clean up” the dataset for the GNN, enabling the strong expert to focus on the more complicated nodes whose neighborhood structure provides useful information for the learning task. " Could you please explain why a weak classifier can provide high-quality dataset for GNNs? From the information presented in this work, I guess it's just use the classification confidence distribution. Suppose that the cleaned nodes by MLP are those the low-quality nodes that have heterophilous neighbors, can the GNNs still distinguish them?
  -  "since the confidence score solely depends on MLP’s output, the system is biased and inherently favors the GNN’s prediction. However, such bias is desirable since under the same training loss". It's difficult to follow the statement. Could you please explain the system is biased by what? why it favors the GNN prediction and the bias is desirable?
  -  "Second, our model-level (rather than layer-level) mixture makes the optimization easier and more explainable." What is the difference between model- and layer-level mixture, and why the optimization is more easier and explainable?
  - "During training, the system dynamically creates a soft splitting of the graph based on not only the nodes’ characteristics but also the two experts’ relative model quality." The splitting of graph is difficult to follow, is the graph divided by nodes or edges?

2. The theoretical analysis can be further improved. For me, it's difficult to follow the conclusion from the series of theorems. It comes with weak connections to the proposed learning objective. It's better to make the point stand out with a clear statement, such as the convergence, stability of confidence value, insight about how to select probable confidence value function. By the way, the exact definition of the confidence value function seems to be missed.

3. The experimental results are incrementally improved comparing to previous methods. Typical baselines for overcoming heterophilous issue are ignored, such as but limited to $H_2$$GCN [1].

### Summary
The Mowst approach is a novel way of handling self-features and neighborhood structures in GNNs, using a mixture of weak and strong experts with a confidence mechanism to activate the strong expert in low-confidence regions. The authors demonstrate Mowst's effectiveness on multiple benchmark datasets and provide an analysis of its expressive power and computational efficiency. The contributions of the paper encompass an innovative mechanism for expert collaboration, a variant of Mowst designed for directed graphs, and insights into the training dynamics that foster expert specialization and the gradual partitioning of the graph.

### Strengths
- The paper is well-written and organized, with clear explanations of the Mowst approach and its variants.
- The experiments are comprehensive, with ablation studies on several design choices

### Weaknesses
 **Failure cases**: MLPs can exhibit both incorrect predictions and high confidence levels. This is particularly common when dealing with graph datasets featuring imbalanced classes or containing a small number of outlier nodes that may not be sufficiently representative. The authors didn't discuss the limitations of such cases and how mowest may or may not solve them. Specifically, the paper does not address scenarios where both the MLP and GNN are biased, but in different directions, leading to potential incorrect predictions even with the confidence mechanism. For example, if the MLP is correct on a low-confidence instance while the GNN is wrong, the confidence mechanism might incorrectly favor the GNN's prediction.

**Clarity:** There are several different design choices other than the proposed version. For instance, the authors do not provide a justification for positioning the weak expert at a lower order while placing the strong expert at a higher order. An alternative approach could involve computing confidence using the GNN and then determining the weight for further combining the MLP results. Another version might not involve confidence computation but instead rely on a learnable module to decide which expert is more suitable. Supervision can be obtained through self-supervision, i.e., comparing with a previously trained MLP and a GNN in terms of predictive accuracy on each instance. The paper lacks a clear explanation of why the current design is superior to these alternatives, particularly regarding the order of experts and the specific form of the confidence mechanism.

**Experimental justification:** The paper lacks results for Mowst*-GIN in Table 1. Including these results would be valuable for assessing whether Mowst can further enhance performance, especially since GIN is the top-performing model on Penn94. Moreover, demonstrating how Mowst can complement different GNN architectures would strengthen the assessment of its utility.

**Experimental comparison:** It may not be fair to compare Mowst with either MLP or GNN in isolation. A more informative comparison could be made between Mowst and a GNN with an MLP skip connection since both have similar expressiveness (theoretically, when the strong expert is activated) and the same number of model parameters. The current comparison does not adequately isolate the benefits of the proposed approach from those of simply adding more parameters or skip connections.

**Minor:**

In the abstract, the authors mentioned "GNN" before "... the strong expert is an off-the-shelf Graph Neural Network (GNN)."

### Questions
- How does mowest solve the scenarios where MLPs can exhibit both incorrect predictions and high confidence levels?
- How do the alternative design choices  (in Weakness 2) compare to mowest?
- What are the performances of Mowst*-GIN and GNN+MLP sc on Table 2?

### Summary
This paper introduces a new method named Mowst for processing graphs, which decouples node features and neighborhood structures by employing a mixture of MLP and GNN. These two models are coordinated through a "confidence" mechanism that activates the GNN when MLP is uncertain, indicated by the spread of prediction logits.  Empirically, Mowst has proven to enhance accuracy on various node classification benchmarks and operates with a computational cost on par with a single GNN model.

### Strengths
This authors introduced a new method named Mowst that structures by employing a mixture of MLP and GNN. 

The proposed method outperform existing methods in the experiments.

### Weaknesses
The manuscript would be improved if the authors could more clearly explain the reasons behind the superior performance of their proposed method compared to existing ones. They attribute their success to the integration of weak and strong experts; yet, it appears that the true advantage may lie in the combination of Multilayer Perceptrons (MLPs) and Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). The distinction is that while MLPs leverage features of individual nodes, GNNs also capitalize on information transmitted across edges. This, I believe, might be the actual contributing factor to their method's effectiveness. To substantiate their claims, the authors should consider conducting additional experiments. Specifically, they could compare the performance of a combination of shallow and deep MLPs, as well as  a combination of shallow and deep GNNs. Such experiments would provide a more convincing validation of their results.

Additionally, the introduction to the datasets used in the study requires enhancement. The authors should provide a detailed description of how each network dataset is constructed and clarify the specific features attributed to the nodes within these datasets.

### Questions
1. Are there experimental results show that the superior performance was due to the integration of weak and strong experts?

2. How is the network in each dataset constructed? What are the features attributed to the nodes within these datasets.?

### Summary
The paper introduced a mixture-of-experts design to combine a weak MLP expert with a strong GNN. The proposed method relies on a confidence mechanism for controlling the contribution of each expert. The idea is to leverage the MLP for learning from nodes with self-expressive features that do not gain much from its connections and largely resort to the GNN for other cases. Their experiments show the superior performance of their method which is also well supported by several theoretical proofs.

### Strengths
1. The paper tackles an interesting problem and proposes a relatively simple solution of mixing a weak model like MLP with a strong expert like GNN. 
2. The method is fairly intuitive and the paper is easy to follow. 
3. The proposed method is very effective as shown by the experiments. The experimental setup is extensive and shows the effectiveness of the method in several aspects including ablation study, visualization of learned embeddings and training dynamics.
4. The paper is theoretically well-supported through theorems and propositions.

### Weaknesses
1. Although it has been briefly mentioned in supplementary section C2, it would be interesting to study the effect of the number of experts on the performance. This leads to further questions regarding the choice of multiple weak experts vs multiple strong experts. Is this even helpful in the given task? I think these are interesting follow up questions one could ask.
2. The github page with code base is private and not accessible via the provided link.
3. Minor grammatical and spelling errors which need to be improved.
4. See questions.

### Questions
1. Is there any correlation/relationships between the edge density of the graph dataset and performance of the MLP part of the method? Intuitively, if the graph is sparsely connected, one may assume that the MLP contributes more in that case compared to when the graph is densely connected. 
2. What is the $\circ$ symbol in Proposition 2.2? It has not been defined. 
3. The task for the experiments mentions "node prediction". Do the authors mean it's a node classification task?

### Summary
This paper introduces a novel prediction strategy designed for scenarios where the model inputs are graphs.  The authors try to improve the model's capacity in graph neural networks (GNN) without raising the computational costs. For making predictions, they introduce two experts: a basic Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) and an off-the-shelf GNN. The collaboration between these experts follows a system known as the mixture of experts (MoE), which is referred to as the confidence mechanism.  This gating scheme determines which expert's prediction should be chosen. The proposed solution employs two algorithms for both inference and training. During inference, a prediction is generated for each node, while during training, the MLP and GNN models are updated. The authors demonstrate the superiority of their proposed solution on node classification benchmarks for both homophilous and heterophilous graphs.

### Strengths
The paper addresses a significant and challenging problem in graph neural networks: model capacity. It demonstrates good quality, offering clear explanations for mathematical aspects, and the appendix provides helpful content. The technical details of the proposed solution are well-explained. The idea of converting the prediction task into an ensemble technique (here mixture of experts, MoE) is impressive. Although the conventional MoE is not a novel method, model ensemble on graphs has received much attention in recent years.

### Weaknesses
The paper, in its current state, exhibits several deficiencies that require attention from the authors. The most significant issue with the paper is the absence of a clear presentation of the details of the proposed solution.

- A Minor Issue: A minor issue I've observed in the paper is that on two pages, a significant portion of the content is dedicated to citations and references rather than the core content. On page 1, approximately 40 percent of the introduction is occupied by references, and a similar issue is present on page 6, where content presentation heavily relies on citations. While I understand that this issue may be related to the template used, it can inconvenience readers who may not wish to review all the references. It would greatly benefit the paper if the authors could pay attention to this issue to enhance the reader's understanding.

- An important source of ambiguity arises in Algorithms 1 and 2. Algorithm 1 is responsible for generating predictions using the MLP or GNN, whereas Algorithm 2 focuses on estimating the parameters of the networks. The paper lacks clarity regarding the process when the MLP and GNN have not been trained, and Algorithm 1 does not contain an initialization step for their parameters or hyperparameters. It is imperative that the paper defines the interaction and collaboration between these two algorithms to address this issue. In particular, it is crucial to explain how Algorithm 1 can produce predictions when the experts have not yet been trained.

- The loss functions in (Eq.1) and (Eq.3) play a crucial role in the training process, as they are meant to be minimized. However, an issue arises in these loss functions because all elements within them are known. Specifically, the confidence, and predictions of both experts and the true labels are all given. Algorithm 1 is responsible for generating confidence and predictions, while the true labels are known. This results in the loss function having a fixed value, and it remains unclear with respect to which parameters the minimization task is intended. As a result, the loss function appears to be independent of the experts' parameters. The paper should address and clarify this issue to ensure a proper understanding of the optimization process.

- Confidence mechanism C: The paper introduces a novel gating variable, referred to as confidence, which holds promise for providing appropriate weightings in the Mixture of Experts (MoE) framework. However, a significant concern arises with the use of the random value q. The strategy resembles sampling techniques such as Metropolis-Hastings, where an acceptance ratio is compared with a generated uniform random number. Nevertheless, the fundamental problem here differs as the model's goal is to choose between experts. While the paper presents an innovative confidence mechanism, it ultimately compares it with a completely random value. This approach may not be a precise method for selecting one of the experts, as the confidence mechanism is inherently tied to the experts' predictions, while the ratio q is an independent value. The paper should address this issue to ensure a more reliable method for expert selection.

- Limitations of the proposed solution based on MLP and GNN: It's important to note that available baselines often face challenges when dealing with graph inputs and have their own limitations. The paper introduces two experts, MLP and GNN. However, the use of MLP as an expert should be explored more thoroughly in the paper, particularly due to its potentially weak prediction quality. For example, if Algorithm 1 consistently generates small values for q, resulting in MLP being selected in most cases, questions arise about the guarantee for the prediction quality of the $M_{owst}$ method. Additionally, the paper should delve into the main advantages of using MLP compared to other potential candidates. The current discussion in the paper does not adequately address this scenario. On the other hand, the limitations of using an off-the-shelf GNN have not been sufficiently discussed. The paper should elaborate on how employing GNN as an expert can effectively address its known limitations. A more comprehensive discussion in these areas is necessary to provide a well-rounded understanding of the model's capabilities and potential challenges.

- Computational complexity: While the paper briefly touches upon the complexity of the proposed model, it is imperative to provide a more comprehensive analysis of its computational efficiency, especially within the experimental context. The Abstract highlights the efficiency of the $M_{owst}$ method, making it essential for the authors to include sensitivity analyses related to the model's complexity in the experiments. This would help in quantifying the trade-offs between model performance and computational resources. Furthermore, the cost associated with the confidence mechanism, even if estimated using a simple MLP, should be clearly explained in the paper. Precise details on the computational cost will aid readers in understanding the practical implications of implementing this mechanism. Providing a more in-depth discussion and analysis of these aspects will enhance the paper's completeness and help readers assess the practical feasibility of the proposed approach.

### Summary
In this paper, the authors leverage the idea of using mixture-of-experts models to improve the model capacity for graph neural networks (GNNs). Since the GNNs are both expensive and hard to optimize, the authors propose mixing a light-weight multi-layer perceptron (MLP), with an off-the-shelf GNN rather than modeling each expert as a GNN. Here, the MLP specializes in extracting the rich self-features of nodes and it is referred to a weak expert, while the GNN exploits the structure of neighborhood and is called a strong expert. To aggregate these two models, the authors introduce a biased gating function towards the GNN predictions based on a novel "confidence" mechanism, and name this model "Mowst"

For inference, the authors run the weak expert first and obtain a prediction. If the confidence score of that prediction exceeds some random threshold, then it is selected as the final prediction. Otherwise, they continue to run the strong expert, and use the prediction of that expert.

For training, they propose the loss function $L_{Mowst}$ by firstly computing the losses of two experts separately, and then combining them via the confidence function $C$.

In addition, the authors also introduce a variant of the Mowst model in which they use the confidence function $C$ to combine the predictions of the two experts, and then calculate a single loss.

The authors demonstrate that both models are at least as expressive as the MLP or GNN alone but with a comparable computional cost. Finally, they empirically show that these models have significant accuracy improvement on 6 standard node classification benchmarks.

### Strengths
1. Originality: the idea of using mixture of weak and strong experts with the confidence mechanism is novel.
2. Quality: the authors provide both theoretical and empirical results to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model "Mowst".

### Weaknesses
1. Clarity: the paper is not well-written. 
- The authors should emphasize the problem they would like to solve more clearly in the introduction section. Specifically, the introduction lacks a clear statement of the limitations of existing GNN models that the proposed method aims to address. The motivation for using a mixture-of-experts approach is not sufficiently justified in the context of graph neural networks. It is unclear what specific challenges in GNNs this approach is designed to overcome, and why a simple ensemble method would not suffice.
- The presentation of all propositions and theorems is informal. Additionally, the statements of Propositions 2.5, 2.6, 2.7 are so confusing (see Question section). For example, the notion of 'expressiveness' is used without a clear mathematical definition, making it difficult to assess the theoretical claims. The conditions under which these propositions hold are not clearly stated, and the implications of these results are not well explained.
- The notations used in this paper are difficult to digest (see Theorem 2.4 and Corollary 2.4.1). The use of symbols is inconsistent and not always defined before use, making it hard to follow the mathematical arguments. The lack of clear definitions for key terms and variables hinders the understanding of the theoretical framework.

2. As far as I understand, with the confidence gating function, we can only leverage two experts in the Mowst without being able to use multiple experts as in previous work. Therefore, the ability to scale up the model capacity is quite limited. The paper does not adequately address how the proposed method would scale to scenarios requiring more than two experts, which is a common requirement in complex real-world applications. The limitation to two experts restricts the model's ability to capture diverse patterns in the data.

3. The experiments in Section 4 do not show the ability to scale up the model capacity of the Mowst model and its variant. The experimental evaluation is limited to a two-expert setup, and it does not demonstrate the potential of the proposed method to handle more complex scenarios with a larger number of experts. The lack of experiments with more than two experts makes it difficult to assess the scalability and effectiveness of the approach in practical settings.

### Questions
1. Below Proposition 2.2, the authors should either present formal formutions of variance and negative entropy functions or give references for these functions.

2. In Section 2.3, are indistinguishable self-features are necessarily the same? The authors should explain more about the term 'indistinguishable'.

3. In Proposition 2.5, does the loss function $L_{Mowst}$ upper bound its counterpart $L^*_{Mowst}$ for any choice of confidence function $C$?

4. In Proposition 2.6 and Theoremm 2.7, the authors should illustrate the concept of expressiveness mathematically. 

5. At the end of page 1, the authors claim that the sparse gating function may make the optimization harder due to its discontinuity. I would like to emphasize that not all sparse gating functions are discontinuous. For instance, a temperature softmax gating function in [1] is a sparse yet continuous gating function.

6. Could the authors please explain more clearly why the MLP denoises for the GNN during training?

7. In Algorithm 2, what methods do the authors use to learn the MLP weights and the GNN weights? And what are the convergence rates of those parameters?

8. Why do the authors need the confidence $C$ to be quasiconvex? What happens if $C$ is not quasiconvex?

9. What are the main challenges of using the Mowst model?

10. In Section 3, the authors should cite more relevant papers regarding symmetric gating functions in mixture-of-experts models, namely [1], [2], [3], [4]. 

**Minor issues**:

1. The abbreviation 'GCN' in page 6 has not been introduced.
2. Grammatical errors: 'the number graph convolution' (Section 1).
3. After the statement of each result, the authors should give references to location (within the paper) of the corresponding proofs.
