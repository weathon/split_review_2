## Abstract
This paper presents a groundbreaking technique for approximating the upper limit of Bayes error in various classification tasks, including binary and multi-class problems. Utilizing f-divergence bounds to gauge the dissimilarity between distinct distributions, we establish an upper bound for Bayes error. This bound serves as a criterion for neural network training and test data classification. We showcase this technique's applicability to both binary and multi-class cases, examining the network output against a specific threshold for classification. Experimental results substantiate the method's effectiveness in approximating Bayes error. These experiments focus on Gaussian distributions with disparate means but identical variance, comparing the outcomes with theoretical Bayes error. Finally, the paper explores the potential applications of this approach in Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), offering a promising avenue for future research.

4: You are confident in your assessment, but not absolutely certain. It is unlikely, but not impossible, that you did not understand some parts of the submission or that you are unfamiliar with some pieces of related work.

### Summary
The paper considers bounding the Bayes error via f-divergence. The paper is incomplete and merely a draft.

### Strengths
The problem of upper bounding Bayes error is somewhat interesting, though I am not sure how important it is. The paper does not present sufficient evidence in handling it.

### Weaknesses
The math in the paper is very unclear.
Bayes error is the minimum achievable error. What is the usage of characterizing Bayes error, for model selection? 
Upper bounding generalization error via f-divergence has been previously well-studied.

### Questions
See the weakness.

### Confidence
2: You are willing to defend your assessment, but it is quite likely that you did not understand the central parts of the submission or that you are unfamiliar with some pieces of related work. Math/other details were not carefully checked.

### Summary
In the context of binary and multi-class classification, this paper derives an upper bound onthe Bayes risk in terms of an $f$-divergence (unfortunately, I couldn't quite understand the inputs to the $f$-divergence). The paper then proposes to train neural networks for classification, and GANs for generative modeling, using this $f$-divergence. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed methods work (a) for classifying two Gaussian classes, (b) for the MNIST digit classification task, and (c) for generating novel MNIST samples.

### Strengths
The overall approach seems like an interesting idea, as it suggests a new objective for optimizing complex classifiers, such as neural networks.

### Weaknesses
Overall, the paper was insufficiently detailed for me to understand either its technical content or its high-level goals.

Many quantities are used without being defined (e.g., in Eq. (1), what are $P$, $Q$, and $X$, what conditions is $f$ assumed to satisfy, etc.).

At a higher level, it is not clear to me what the goal of this paper is, in relation to the larger literature on machine learning (e.g., what gap or limitation of existing methods does this seek to fill?). Providing some quantitative evaluation comparing the proposed method and existing state-of-the-art methods might be one way to help address this.

Some suggestions on improving the presentation:
1) In the first sentence of the abstract, "groundbreaking" is probably too strong of a word; "novel" would be more appropriate.
2) Typically, square brackets (e.g., "[7]") are used for numerical literature citations, while parentheses are reserved for referencing equations (e.g., "Eq. (7)").
3) I suggest adding an "Organization" paragraph at the end of the Introduction Section explaining the content and goals of each of the subsequent sections of the paper.
4) The key novel theoretical results (e.g., new upper bounds such as Eqs. (15) or (23)) should be presented as a self-contained "theorem" (e.g., using ```\begin{theorem} ... \end{theorem}```), including the precise assumptions made and conclusions drawn.

### Questions
In Eq. (7), what is $f_i$?
