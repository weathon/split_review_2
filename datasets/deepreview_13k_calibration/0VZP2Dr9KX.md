## Abstract
As Large Language Models quickly become ubiquitous, it becomes critical to understand their security vulnerabilities.
Recent work shows that text optimizers can produce jailbreaking prompts that bypass moderation and alignment. 
Drawing from the rich body of work on adversarial machine learning, we approach these attacks with three questions: 
What threat models are practically useful in this domain?  How do baseline defense techniques perform in this new domain? How does LLM security differ from computer vision?

We evaluate several baseline defense strategies against leading adversarial attacks on LLMs, discussing the various settings in which each is feasible and effective. 
Particularly, we look at three types of defenses: detection (perplexity based), input preprocessing (paraphrase and retokenization), and  adversarial training. 
We discuss white-box and gray-box settings and discuss the robustness-performance trade-off for each of the defenses considered. %Surprisingly, we find much more success with filtering and preprocessing than we would expect from other domains, such as vision, providing a first indication that the relative strengths of these defenses may be weighed differently in these domains.
We find that the weakness of existing discrete optimizers for text, combined with the relatively high costs of optimization, makes standard adaptive attacks more challenging for LLMs. Future research will be needed to uncover whether more powerful optimizers can be developed, or whether the strength of filtering and preprocessing defenses is greater in the LLMs domain than it has been in computer vision.

### Summary
The paper discusses simple baseline defenses against a single gradient-based adversarial attacks against Large Language Models (LLMs). These include perplexity based filtering, paraphrasing via another LLM, and an attempt at adversarial training.

### Strengths
Some of the results (in particular, regarding perplexity filtering) are interesting.

### Weaknesses
I find the motivation, ideas, and conclusions derived in this paper to be problematic for many reasons. I will also provide individual issues for each of the defenses studied, below.

- (Overview) **Lack of Proper Motivation and Significance**: The paper raises many questions (such as in the abstract: *"What threat models are practically useful in this domain?"* and *"How do baseline defense techniques perform in this new domain?"*) but fails to provide concrete answers for these to the reader. The paper ends on more unanswered questions (Section 5.1). This is due to a lack of proper motivation: the paper from the start is set up to only study the proposed baseline defenses which are either incompletely or trivially designed (I will discuss this later). Although the authors attempt to draw general conclusions, since there is only one attack proposed by Zou et al [1] for LLMs, the results cannot be interpreted generally (I discuss this next). Finally, the evaluation setups are inconsistent and keep varying between experiments, and smaller LLMs are mostly considered (discussed below). In sum, the paper feels incomplete and in my opinion does not provide substantial evidence for the initial claims made by the authors which is why I am leaning towards rejection.

- **Single-Attack Study Cannot Generalize**: The paper draws many *general* conclusions from the derived results, such as indicating the strengths or weaknesses of a particular baseline defense (e.g. end of Section 4.1: *"However, perplexity filtering is potentially valuable in a system where high perplexity prompts are not discarded, but rather treated with other defenses, or as part of a larger moderation campaign to identify malicious users"*). However, this is an untenable claim, as all the baseline defense experiments are conducted on a single optimization attack proposed by Zou et al [1] and we do not know the space of adversarial LLM samples that exist to a clear extent. Clearly, the scope of the work is fairly limited given this fact. Owing to these reasons, the paper seems incomplete and almost *too early* as there should be more attacks proposed first by the community to derive a general trend for baseline defenses. As an analogue, Carlini et al's [2] seminal paper on guidelines for defenses in deep neural networks was written after a number of attacks had been proposed.

- **Inconsistent Experimental Setups**: The paper has multiple experiments, but all of these are conducted on a different set of LLMs. For Section 4.1 the authors use Falcon-7B, Vicuna-7B, Guanaco-7B, ChatGLM-6B, and MPT-7B. For experiments in Section 4.2, Alpaca-7B is also introduced; why wasn't this used in 4.1 experiments? For Section 4.3 Llama1-7B and Alpaca are considered, and the other models are dropped. This inconsistency in experimental setup and evaluation is a major issue and hinders readers from getting a clear picture of the results. This issue also extends to other evaluation aspect of the work, such as in Section 4.1, nowhere do the authors mention what the actual value of the threshold $T$ for the perplexity filter is for most of the experiments. They just mention that it is the upper bound of perplexity on the AdvBench dataset which makes it hard to contextualize other results with respect to those of Figure 2 (when the threshold is varied).

- **Evaluation Only on Weaker Models**: Even though the original attack approach of Zou et al [1] was evaluated on multiple black-box LLMs such as GPT-3.5-Turbo, PaLM-2, and GPT-4, the authors never consider these powerful models in experiments. In fact, most of the experiments are only localized to smaller LLMs roughly around the 7B parameter size. If the issue is API or black-box access, in my view, the defense approaches can still be applied as a preprocessing step. Even then, as Llama-2-13B and Llama-2-70B models are available open-source, this issue can actually be bypassed. A lack of evaluation on powerful and more relevant models is also a major drawback of the work.

- **Issues with Each Defense Baseline**:
    - **Perplexity Filter**: Regarding the perplexity filter, the description by the authors of its efficacy (last paragraph Section 4.1: *"the defense succeeds.."* and others) is in contrast with the results obtained. As Figure 1 shows, the Attack Success Rate (ASR) is greater than 50% for the Guanaco and Falcon LLMs even as $\alpha_{ppl}$ is increased. Also, ChatGLM and MPT LLMs are the only ones for which ASR tends to 0, but their performance initially is close to 0 to begin with. More importantly, even after the filter, if 20% of the prompts bypass the windowed perplexity filter, why can the attacker not just reproduce prompts similar to these (e.g. via paraphrasing) and attack the LLM with a large volume of such prompts? It also excessively targets benign prompts and I am not convinced that there is a good approach for choosing the threshold $T$. Due to these reasons, I believe this baseline is too trivial and does not convery any useful information about efficacy and complexity of optimizer attacks for LLMs.

    - **Paraphrasing Prompts**: The issue with this defense is that if the defender can utilize a more powerful LLM for paraphrasing (such as GPT-3.5-Turbo as the authors have done), why can they not directly use that model for their LLM related tasks? It would make more sense to directly use ChatGPT instead of filtering responses using ChatGPT and then using Vicuna. What would be interesting and more viable, would be to use a more traditional paraphrasing approach for the adversarial prompt and then assessing whether ASR can be lowered. In its current form, the defense does not seem tenable as a baseline.


    - **Attempting Adversarial Training**: The approach employed by the authors in Section 4.3 is an approximate attempt at adversarial training. It is evident why it doesn't work well, as the inner adversarial optimization step can only use human generated adversarial prompts instead of optimizer generated ones, due to computational issues. In this manner, this approach is incomplete and already unsatisfactory as a baseline. In my opinion, it cannot even constitute a negative result because the approach is not sufficiently close to true adversarial training. This also relates to my earlier point on the work being *premature*. In this case, it would actually be beneficial to improve the optimization approach used for attack samples to enable adversarial training of LLMs.

### Questions
- Is there a reason the authors did not study more powerful models such as GPT-3.5-Turbo, BARD (PaLM-2), Llama-2 and GPT-4? The biggest strength/finding of the paper by Zou et al [1] is that the attack transfers (in a black-box fashion) to these other models.
- Please feel free to reply to any of the weaknesses listed in the previous section.

### Summary
Extending the studies in standard adversarial machine learning domains, this paper explores the effectiveness of three different mainstream defense methods against jailbreak attacks for LLM, including perplexity detection, input reprocessing via paraphrasing/retokenization, and adversarial training (more precisely, data augmentation with red-teaming prompts, instead of minmax-based training). Detailed experiments and discussions on the robustness-utility tradeoffs for each case are provided.

### Strengths
1. This is a good and timely study to help researchers understand how many lessons learned form computer vision domains for adversarial robustness can be transferred to LLMs.
2. The paper is easy to follow and provides abundant empirical results

### Weaknesses
The major concern that prevents me from giving a straight recommendation for acceptance is that the evaluation is based on the GCG attack proposed (Zou et al., 2023), which is a universal attack that learns to append the same adversarial suffix to every prompt for jailbreak attempts. However, from the computer vision domain, it is also known that universal attacks are easier to detect/defense than individually optimized adversarial examples (Finding a universal adversarial perturbation is mathematically more difficult than finding a specific adversarial perturbation for one image). Therefore, the conclusion made by this paper may be different if one considers the GCG attack on every prompt separately, instead of learning to do a universal attack. 

Here are my suggestions:
1. I hope the authors can come up with new experiments that evaluate individual GCG attacks, and check if the conclusion holds or not. If also seems to me that the attacker may break the perplexity detection in the adaptive attack setting if the goal is to find a low-perplexity adversarial suffix for only one prompt, instead of many prompts simultaneously.
2. On adaptive attack against paraphrasing, can the authors check if appending the same adversarial suffix to the paraphrased prompt can regain the attack effectiveness or not?
3. On Sec. 4.3 - I hesitate to agree the studied method is "robust optimization". While it is true that the terminology of adversarial training (via augmenting with some (non-optimized) adversarial examples in the training loss) is consistent with what is proposed by Goodfellow et al. in 2013/2014, the evaluated scheme is different from the more popular minimax-based adversarial training method proposed by Madry et al., following the practice of robust optimization. It also seems that the studied method only augments with the human-crafted adversarial prompts to fine-tune an LLM, instead of iteratively generating new adversarial prompts during training. Therefore, I suggest removing the use of "robust optimization" in that paragraph, and making the message clear that this observation does not imply the result of minimax-based adversarial training method (which is unclear what is the best way to define and execute, as the authors pointed out). Otherwise, this section may give the incorrect message that "robust optimization" does not give strong robustness of LLMs against jailbreak attacks.
4. [Minor] There are some recent papers (after the ICLR submission deadline) that propose improved (automated) jailbreak prompt generations with high influence to bypass perplexity-based detections, so perplexity-based detections may not be as strong as the paper claimed (aka the defense can be already broken). However, I understand those results are concurrent to this study, and I won't take this point into my final rating.

### Questions
1. Will the same conclusion hold if one considers non-universal GCG attacks? That is, run GCG attack separately for each tested jailbreak prompt.
2. If appending the same adversarial suffix to the paraphrased prompt, can the attack remain effective?

3: You are fairly confident in your assessment. It is possible that you did not understand some parts of the submission or that you are unfamiliar with some pieces of related work. Math/other details were not carefully checked.

### Summary
This paper studied jailbreaking prompts generated by text optimizers that bypass alignment, discussed the effectiveness of threat models, performance of baseline defense techniques, and the differences between LLM security and computer vision. This paper studied detection based on perplexity, input preprocessing through paraphrasing and retokenization, and adversarial training. The effectiveness and limitations of each baseline defense were studied through extensive experiments. This paper pointed out that the weakness of existing text optimizers and the high cost of optimization make standard adaptive attacks more challenging for LLMs. The paper discussed the future research directions.

### Strengths
I think this work well analyzed three defense methods against jailbreak attacks that bypass moderation and alignment. This paper presented numerous experimental results to support these points and further discussed both the potential for attack methods to bypass the defense methods and the effectiveness of defense methods in detecting attacks.

### Weaknesses
The threat model is limited to only one type. It's advisable to incorporate additional models to validate the effectiveness of the three defense methods.

The paper did not propose a comprehensive method to address the shortcomings of the three defense methods. While the paper suggested that combining preprocessing defenses with detection defenses might be better , no specific approach or experimental result was provided.

Mixing existing datasets for adversarial training did not provide a rigorous defense across the entire search space.

### Summary
This paper presents a study of the vulnerabilities associated with large language models (LLMs), specifically focusing on jailbreaking attacks that aim to bypass alignment and moderation mechanisms. The work mainly adopts an empirical approach, evaluating several baseline defenses under different threat models and settings, and shows the difference between the attacks/defenses in the domain of LLMs and that in conventional domains (e.g., computer vision).

### Strengths
- The paper considers three categories of defenses: detection via perplexity filtering, input preprocessing (including paraphrasing and re-tokenization), and adversarial training. 
- Using the computational cost (rather than the perturbation magnitude) as a constraint for the adversary seems interesting.
- It discusses the robustness-performance trade-off in each defense strategy, providing insights into their feasibility and effectiveness.

### Weaknesses
 - The main findings of the paper seem to be the difference between the attacks/defenses in LLMs and other domains (e.g., computer vision). This is not news. There are many studies in the literature that have pointed out such difference.
- The evaluation mainly focuses on a single attack (Zou et al. 2023). It is unclear whether the findings are biased by this setting. It is suggested to consider more diverse jailbreaking attacks. 
- While the paper sets a good foundation for understanding baseline defenses, it could benefit from a clearer roadmap or suggestions for future research directions.
- The presentation could also be improved. It is suggested to summarize the findings in each part of the evaluation, which right now are scattered around.

### Questions
- How do the findings generalize to attacks other than Zou et al. 2023?
