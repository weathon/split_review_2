## Abstract
In recent years, reinforcement learning (RL) has been increasingly applied to systems that interact with individuals in various domains, such as healthcare, education, and e-commerce. When an RL agent interacts with individuals, individual-specific factors, ranging from personal preferences to physiological nuances, may causally influence state transitions, such as health conditions, learning progress, or user selections. Consequently, different individuals may exhibit different state transition processes. Understanding these individualized state-transition processes is crucial for making individualized policies. In practice, however, identifying these state-transition processes is challenging, especially since individual-specific factors often remain latent. In this paper, we present a practical method that effectively learns these processes from observed state-action trajectories, backed by theoretical guarantees. To our knowledge, this is the first work to provide a theoretical guarantee for identifying the state-transition processes involving latent individual-specific factors. Our experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that our method can effectively identify the latent state-transition processes and help learn individualized RL policies.

### Summary
The paper examines the application of reinforcement learning (RL) in personalized settings such as healthcare and education, where individual differences significantly impact the outcomes of RL agents. It addresses the challenge of identifying individual-specific factors that influence state transitions, which are often hidden (latent). The authors propose a novel method for learning these unique state-transition processes from observed interactions, with the significant advantage of theoretical support for its effectiveness. This approach is touted as the first to offer such guarantees. The paper validates the method with both synthetic and real-world data, showing its potential in crafting tailored RL policies. This contribution is particularly relevant for developing RL applications that must adapt to individual user characteristics, a common scenario in personalized services.

### Strengths
The paper addresses a critical research question in personalized reinforcement learning (RL) by focusing on the identification of latent state-transition processes. This is a significant contribution to the field, as it tackles the complexities of individual differences that are pivotal in RL outcomes but are often not directly observable.

### Weaknesses
The paper presents a methodological approach to personalized reinforcement learning, yet there are several areas where clarity and depth are lacking. Specifically, Section 4 would benefit from a citation on methods used to enhance user experience on multimedia platforms, which is currently missing. In Section 3, the description of the reward function \( R \) is incomplete; it is essential to clarify its form and relationship with other variables, which is not currently addressed.

Remark 1 appears verbose and could be made more succinct to help readers grasp the core concept more rapidly. Additionally, Section 4's text is overly descriptive and lacks the necessary equations or algorithmic details to clearly understand the proposed processes, such as noise estimation and its application within the model architecture.

The paper's novelty is also a point of concern; the work appears incremental and relies heavily on established frameworks and methods without offering new insights or innovative approaches. The rationale behind the use of a noise module following discrete encoding is not clear, and the similarity to continuous VAE processes needs to be justified.

Overall, the manuscript would benefit from a thorough polish to enhance readability and flow. The current state may present difficulties for readers in following the progression of ideas and fully understanding the proposed methods.

===

I appreciate the author's clarification. I have increased my score from 5 to 6, given the significance of this research. I hope the later revision can improve the writing quality and acknowledge these limitations, which would be valuable for future work.

### Strengths
- The paper is basically well-written and contains no significant grammatical errors
- The proposed method appears to be simple yet effective

### Weaknesses
 - The novelty is somewhat overclaimed.

There are many works, such as [1-5], on learning latent/factored MDPs, which are very similar to the so-called individualized MDPs. However, the paper does not clearly clarify the difference and contribution.

- There are other possible solutions 

This paper seems to claim that there is no prior art in this field; however, the reviewer believes that MARL (Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning) methods and latent MDP (Markov Decision Process) methods could also be applied to the setting described in this paper.

- The theoretical result requires unrealistic assumptions.

The group determinacy, sample sufficiency, and sequential dependency assumptions are too strong to be realistic. Thus, the obtained theoretical results, though seemingly novel, have no significant implications. The reviewer cannot derive insights from this theorem.

### Questions
Some terminologies are confusing:

- What is the difference between individualized MDPs, partially observed MDPs and multi-agent MDPs?
- What exactly does the identifiability property of the individualized latent factor in Theorem 1 mean?
- The optimal policy appears to be non-stationary in individualized MDPs. How can this difficulty be addressed?

### Confidence
3: You are fairly confident in your assessment. It is possible that you did not understand some parts of the submission or that you are unfamiliar with some pieces of related work. Math/other details were not carefully checked.

### Summary
The authors propose an approach for individualized RL where policies can be tailored to individual people/agents. Their approach is built on the idea of learning latent state-transition processes using a VAE. They demonstrate the empirical performance of their approach on a series of synthetic and real-world envirnoments.

### Strengths
- The authors motivate the work with a wide range of applications, from medical applications to educational applications.
- Some of the diagrams demonstrating the workflow/algorithm are quite nice, although the font is hard to read in some places.

### Weaknesses
 - The communication is unclear in some parts. It would perhaps be helpful to motivate the work with a single running example rather than jumping around between applications.
- The font size in the plots is too small to read.
- I'm not sure that pendulum control counts as a real-world application.
- The contribution of the paper is quite small. Much of the contribution is simply incorporating a VAE into an RL system.

### Questions
If you had to choose one application where you think your method would truly shine, what would it be?

### Summary
The paper aims to develop individualized policy learning and adapt a policy to an upcoming individual, by considering individualized state-transition processes. The identification of individualized latent factor can be theoretically grounded. The experimental results indicate the proposed method could achieve superior performance under some conditions.

### Strengths
1.	The paper is well structured and easy to follow.

2.	In practice, many individual-specific factors are unobservable, which is a great challenge to accurately learn individual latence. Thus, the work investigates an important problem, from my perspective.

3.	Some assumptions to achieve theoretical guarantees are clearly provided and described.  

4.	Codes are provided via GitHub link.

### Weaknesses
1. Lack warranty in some major claims. Though without references, I can understand some reasons described by the authors why only considering discrete representations, since some underlying latence of humans could be discrete such as gender, and continuous representations can be translated into discrete. However, the authors state that the discrete formulation allows for a more nuanced representation of individualized latent, which is lack theoretical and empirical evidence. If that is an assumption, I would also recommend such strong assumption to be clearly formulated and described in main content, given it plays a key role in the methodology.

2. Design of methodology is not well motivated, and some parts lack details. For example, (a) The motivation of choosing VAE to estimate individual-specific factors, and the motivation of state reconstruction are not clear. The part of feature extraction is not introduced in overview, and the definition of features, and the reason of utilizing feature extraction, are not clear. (b) The proposed method relies on subgrouping of individuals to obtain embedding dictionary, while the part of subgrouping is highly vague in paper and lack thorough motivation and details. For example, (a). There is no reference regarding the motivation of such design, and reasons of choosing the specific subgrouping measure. (b) q is not included in pseudocode. Specific measures to obtain q and how q is determined in experiments are not clear.

3. Design and details of experimental are not clear, which hinders the evaluation of proposed method and reproducibility. Some important details, such as: for synthetic experiments, the goal of the task, how the synthetic datasets are conducted, definitions of states, actions, and rewards, why only 100 samples are generated, how the unobserved latent L and noise are simulated, as well as the reasons of design such synthetic environment without considering existing broadly used environments (e.g., Adroit, Mujoco), especially human-involved ones. For persuasion for good environment, objectives, states, actions, and rewards are not formally defined. Definition of relevant information from the dialogues using the BERT is not provided. 

4. Gaps exist across motivation, methodology, and experimental design. (a) The major work is motivated by complex human-related scenarios, and it is comprehensive that the paper described a lot of educational and healthcare scenarios in major content. But the experimental environments are mainly simple without well-designed human factors as described in motivation. There is one human-related environment used in experiment, i.e., persuasion for social good in the dialogue system. But details of experiments are missing too much for me to thoroughly evaluate the proposed method. (b) For compared methods, it would be more persuasive if they contain: (i) Population level component with the framework, e.g., learning population level embeddings and reconstructing states, so that the effectiveness of learning individualized factors can be isolated to evaluate; (ii) Different state reconstruction methods such as trajectory transformer, GAN, etc. Otherwise, a clear motivation of current baseline selection and choices of utilized techniques in methodology need to be justified. (c) As what I described in (2), motivations are lack in each step of methodology, hinders a thorough evaluation regarding the proposed method.


Minor:
- Caption of Figure 3(a): “XX” looks like a placeholder.

- Limitation should be discussed. A possible limitation is that the individual-specific factor L is assumed to be static over time, while another common fact is that many unobserved factors related to humans can evolve over time (e.g., [1-2]), such as mental status, and affect human behaviors.

### Summary
This paper mainly focuses on the problem of identifying the individual-specific state-transition processes. To handle this problem, this paper introduces a method that proficiently learns these processes from observed state-action trajectories and individualized policies. The results of synthetic and real-world datasets seem to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods.

### Strengths
1. This paper is well-written and easy to read.
2. The contribution of the paper is clear, and the proposed method is relatively novel.
3. The code has been provided, which increases the reproducibility.

### Weaknesses
The paper lacks a thorough explanation of the effectiveness of each component within the proposed method. While the overall approach appears novel, the rationale behind specific design choices, such as the quantization layer and the noise estimation module, is not sufficiently elaborated. For instance, the transition from a continuous latent representation to a discrete individual-specific factor through quantization needs further justification. Additionally, the role of the noise estimator in capturing the stochasticity of the individualized transition processes could be more clearly defined. It may be more helpful for readers to understand if the effect of each component and why it works can be more clearly displayed, especially regarding how these components collectively contribute to the identification of individual-specific state-transition processes.

### Questions
Due to the discussion of Individualized Markov Decision in the paper, Processes does not add a reference, which is a custom task for the paper. So, is there any significant difference between L (individualized latent space) and state in IMDP? Are there any significant differences between the two? Can L be regarded as an unobserved state?
