## Abstract
The magnitude of a metric space was recently established as
a novel invariant, providing a measure of the `effective size' of
a space across multiple scales.
By capturing both geometrical and topological properties of
data, magnitude is poised to address challenges in unsupervised
representation learning tasks.
We formalise a novel notion of a dissimilarity between magnitude
functions of finite metric spaces and use them to derive a quality
measure for dimensionality reduction tasks.
Our measure is provably stable under perturbations of the data, can be
efficiently calculated, and enables a rigorous multi-scale comparison of
embeddings.
We show the utility of our measure in an experimental suite that
comprises different domains and tasks, including the comparison of
data visualisations.

### Summary
This paper proposes a method using magnitude in metric space as an evaluation method for dimensionality reduction methods. Specifically, the paper defines two indicators and compares them with traditional indicators on multiple data sets.

### Strengths
The concept of Magnitude on the metric space is extended to define a suitable metric for evaluating dimensionality reduction.

### Weaknesses
The first point of concern is that I do not know what the paper is trying to argue. If the claim is that the proposed method is an indicator that can determine whether it is a good dimensionality reduction or not, it is necessary to clarify what makes it a good dimensionality reduction. If this were global isometry (which seems to be the case from the theorem that follows), then the experiments should be compared in this light, but this does not seem to be the case. The experiment seems to be just an observation, and I am not sure if the proposed method is a good one.

The second concern is in terms of novelty: the magnitude function is already known and the difference defined is the simplest one. It should be clarified whether the introduction of Magnitude into the evaluation of embedding performance is novel or whether the construction of a specific indicator is novel. "Our contribution" section seems to indicate that the evaluation of the experiment and the proof of the theorem are additional contributions. Whichever points are novel, it should be clear why they are necessary. The motivation for introduction is written, but it is similar to the first point that it should be clear why the proposed method is superior.

Third, it is unfriendly to readers in several respects.For example, 
- The main proposal in this paper appears to be Def. 4.2 and 4.3, but it is written in a way that makes it unclear that it is a proposed method. Fig. 2 helped me recognize this point, but it would not be sufficient as a document. (Is it a typo that in Fig.2 it is Magnitude function difference, but in Def.4.2 it is Magnitude profile difference?)
- It seems to me that Def4.3 must assume that the X and Y components are aligned correspondingly, but it does not say that. (Otherwise, they are not unique according to the order.) There is a reference at the beginning of Section 4, but it does not specify that the alignment condition is a prerequisite.

### Questions
- Regarding the definition of re-scaled in Def.4.1, it is multiplied by $t_{conv}$, but seems to emphasize scale more. Is $s/t_{conv}$ incorrect?
- Scale-invariant is claimed as an advantage of the proposed method, which I believe means that it does not require the setting of hyperparameters in the neighborhood. On the other hand, magnitude measures global features when the scale parameter is small and local features when it is large. In the end, the proposed index is considered to be the sum (average) of the differences in features calculated by varying the hyperparameters by some rule. From this perspective, even with the conventional method that requires hyperparameter settings, the objective can be achieved by changing the hyperparameters and taking the sum (average) of the calculated values. Is there any reason why scale-invariant can be achieved because of Magnitude?
- From a representation learning perspective, affine transformations, i.e., enlargement and reduction, are not so essential differences. From this perspective, it would be more valuable for the proposed method to be an indicator that the expansion and contraction can be automatically ignored by re-scaling.

### Summary
This paper focuses on the metric space magnitude which is defined as a measure of the similarity matrix of a set of instances. The authors proposed two new definitions of magnitude differences (namely dissimilarity). They provided theoretical analysis to validate the robustness and invariant properties of their proposed metrics. Numerical experiments on some classical unsupervised representation learning approaches demonstrate the soundness of the proposed method.

### Strengths
1). The topic studied in this paper is interesting and I really appreciate the authors' efforts on the theoretical formulations and analysis results.

2). Experiments on classical manifold/unsupervised approaches with real-world data validate that the proposed magnitude difference is indeed a reasonable metric to evaluate the consistency between two metric spaces.

### Weaknesses
1). The novelty is somewhat limited. Considering that the metric space magnitude is already an existing work and has been widely applied in mathematics and machine learning, the authors's contribution is actually providing the difference between the magnitudes of two metric spaces. 

2). The technical difficulty is trivial. When I check the theoretical results in lemmas and corollaries, it seems that most of them are very straightforward conclusions from the corresponding definitions (the proofs are actually very short as shown in the appendix).

3). The motivation and experiments are not very solid to me. The effectiveness of unsupervised dimensionality reduction can already be evaluated by their original loss functions such as distance preservation and reconstruction error. Why do we still need the magnitude difference to validate their effectiveness? Second, how such a new space metric help us in our algorithm desgin? For example, can we integrate this new magnitude difference into exsiting unsupervised learning to obtain some better dimensionality reduction results? I was looking forward to seeing these results but I failed to find any of them in the experiment section.

### Summary
The paper introduces a concept called "magnitude" for metric spaces, serving as an invariant to measure the effective size of a space across various scales. This magnitude considers both geometric and topological aspects, making it useful for unsupervised representation learning tasks. The authors propose a dissimilarity measure between magnitude functions of finite metric spaces, offering a stable quality assessment for dimensionality reduction tasks. The measure proves stability under data perturbations, is computationally efficient, and facilitates a thorough multi-scale comparison of embeddings. Experimental results validate the measure's utility. The paper establishes a scale-invariant framework for quantifying the difference between magnitudes, links this difference to embedding quality, and demonstrates empirical effectiveness on simulated and real data.

### Strengths
The paper's strengths lie in its:

- Clarity and Organization: The clarity of writing and well-organized structure contribute to an easy and accessible read, enhancing the paper's overall effectiveness.

- Accessible Background: The inclusion of a background that caters to readers outside the specialized field ensures that a broader audience can understand and engage with the content. This accessibility promotes the dissemination of the concepts introduced.

- Comprehensive Approach: By addressing both theoretical and computational aspects of the proposed magnitude, the paper offers a well-rounded exploration of the concept. This comprehensive coverage enhances the paper's credibility and applicability in both theoretical and practical contexts.

### Weaknesses
The weaknesses of the paper include:

- Limited Convincing Power in Experimental Results: The paper's diverse range of experiments is noted, but the absence of statistical uncertainty in the reported results diminishes their convincing power. Without incorporating measures of uncertainty, readers may question the generalizability of the experimental findings to the broader population and the long-term effectiveness of the proposed method. For instance, when comparing magnitude differences across different embeddings, it's unclear if the observed differences are statistically significant or simply due to random variation. The lack of error bars or confidence intervals makes it difficult to assess the robustness of the results.

- Lack of Statistical Analysis: The paper seems to lack a robust statistical analysis of the experimental results. Statistical analyses, such as confidence intervals or hypothesis testing, are crucial for establishing the reliability and significance of the observed effects. Without this, the strength of the experimental evidence may be undermined. For example, in the dimensionality reduction experiments, it's not clear if the reported magnitude differences are statistically significant enough to conclude that one embedding is superior to another. A more rigorous statistical approach is needed to validate the claims made based on the experimental outcomes.
