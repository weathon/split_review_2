## Abstract
Online continual learning is challenging as it requires fast adaptation over a stream of data in a non-stationary environment without forgetting the knowledge acquired in the past. To address this challenge, in this paper, we introduce Amphibian - a gradient-based meta-learner that learns to scale the direction of gradient descent to achieve the desired balance between fast learning and continual learning. For this purpose, using only the current batch of data, Amphibian minimizes a meta-objective that encourages alignments of gradients among given data samples along selected basis directions in the gradient space. From this objective, it learns a diagonal scale matrix in each layer that accumulates the history of such gradient alignments. Using these scale matrices Amphibian updates the model online only in the directions having positive cumulative gradient alignments among the data observed for far. With evaluation on standard continual image classification benchmarks, we show that such meta-learned scaled gradient descent in  Amphibian achieves state-of-the-art accuracy in online continual learning while enabling fast learning with less data and few-shot knowledge transfer to new tasks. Finally, with loss landscape visualizations, we show such gradient updates incur minimum loss to the old task enabling fast continual learning in Amphibian.

### Summary
This paper presents a rehearsal-free continual learning algorithm, based on La-MAML. It employs bi-level optimization to learn a diagonal scale matrix in each layer, aiming to prevent catastrophic forgetting. Comprehensive experiments and analyses demonstrate its superior experimental performance. However, there may be an unfair comparison setting that needs clarification.

### Strengths
+ The paper focuses on Task-IL incremental learning and significantly improves performance in the realm of rehearsal-free methods.
+ I commend the authors for conducting comprehensive analysis experiments to evaluate the proposed Amphibian. These include Task Learning Efficiency, visualization of the loss landscape, and a comparison of few-shot forward transfer.

### Weaknesses
 + I have concerns about the fairness of the comparable online setting. In both La-MAML and the code provided in your appendix, you have the hyper-parameter 'self.glances', which allows your online training batch to be optimized multiple times. While it's understandable that the early CL work La-MAML adopts this 'single-pass' setting due to the lack of clear definitions for online and offline CL settings, if you're adopting the online CL setting, you need to clearly highlight the differences between your experimental setting and the standard online CL setting where each example can only be seen once. Furthermore, you should provide results of other comparable methods under this setting or set your hyperparameter 'self.glances' to 1 for a fair comparison.
+ La-MAML, as the most important baseline, also learns the learning rate through bi-level optimization, similar to your learned diagonal scaled matrix. Despite the results provided in Table 3, I'm still unclear if the learned diagonal scaled matrix truly outperforms the learned learning rate for each parameter of La-MAML. The differences between La-MAML and the proposed Amphibian are:
    - La-MAML uses samples from the memory buffer, while Amphibian does not.
    - Both La-MAML and Amphibian apply the ReLU operation on the learned learning rate or the diagonal scaled matrix. However, La-MAML only applies this ReLU operation during the outer loop, while Amphibian uses it in both the inner and outer loops. Existing research [1] shows that using the ReLU operation on the learning rate during both inner-loop and outer-loop can effectively improve performance. So it is unclear if your performance gains lies in this different operation.
In Table 3, you only show the ablation study on the first point. Therefore, it doesn't convince me that the learned diagonal scaled matrix is truly superior to the learning rate learned by La-MAML.

+ In my view, the learned diagonal scaled matrix is equivalent to learning the important weights for the current task. However, like EWC, it learns the important weights (i.e., the Fisher information matrix) for each task and suppresses the model’s updates in these directions. I'm still unsure how the timely learned diagonal matrix can prevent catastrophic forgetting of previous tasks. I believe the authors need to provide more explanations. Is the proposed method, Amphibian, only applicable in the relatively simple Task-IL setting? Providing the Class-IL online CL performance could be much more convincing.

### Summary
This work proposes a continual learning approach called Amphibian, which is based on MAML-style model updates.
Unlike existing MAML-based approaches (e.g., Gupta et al., 2020), it does not rely on a replay buffer.
It assumes that the training examples are provided as a sequence of batches, each with dozens of examples.

The basic training scheme can be summarized as follows.
When a new batch comes in, it performs gradient descent for each example in the batch one by one (the inner-loop updates), producing a temporary model fitted to the batch.
The temporary model is then evaluated on the entire examples in the batch to yield the meta-loss.
Finally, the original model parameters are updated with the gradient w.r.t. the meta-loss (the outer-loop update), and the training proceeds to the next batch.

The main novelty of Amphibian is to introduce a gradient scaler $\lambda_i$ for each parameter $i$.
Whenever gradient descent is performed, this value is multiplied to the gradient, acting as a per-parameter learning rate.
This $\lambda_i$ is updated every batch by accumulating the products of the outer-loop gradient and the inner-loop gradient.

### Strengths
This paper dedicated significant effort to ensure reproducibility.
The appendix includes experimental details, and the code is provided in the supplementary material.

### Weaknesses
### Lack of Justification for the Method

Overall, the proposed method does not seem to have a solid theoretical basis.
The key idea of this work is to adjust the per-parameter learning rate with the cumulative sum of the products between the inner-loop gradients and the outer-loop gradients.
If the inner and outer gradients have the same sign in the current batch, the learning rate for the corresponding parameter is increased, and vice versa.
However, there is no justification for how such learning rate updates can be helpful to continual learning.

Interestingly, if we consider the case where the batch size is reduced to 1, this algorithm seems to become almost the opposite of EWC (Kirkpatrick et al., 2017).
In EWC, squared gradients are accumulated for each parameter, and the parameter becomes less flexible as the accumulated value grows.
In Amphibian with a batch size of 1, the inner gradient and the outer gradient are both computed with the only example in the batch.
Assuming the inner gradient does not incur drastic changes in the parameters, their product can be likened to the squared gradient in EWC.
However, Amphibian encourages the changes in the parameters with larger accumulated gradient products, which is the opposite of EWC.

### Confusing Notations

Starting from Eq. (7), $\ell_{in}$ and $\ell_{out}$ take only $\theta_0^j$ as input.
This ambiguates the meaning, especially for $\ell_{in}$.
According to the description under it, the inner loss $\ell_{in}$ is computed with a single example in a batch, but which example is it?
And why isn't there a summation of multiple $\ell_{in}$ from each example in the batch?

Similar confusion continues, even in the appendices.
For instance, $g_k$ in Eq. (14) and $g_{k'}$ in Eq. (16) seem to have the same definition with a different index, but their definitions are completely different.

I also do not see any utility in adopting the concept of gradient space.
Since the authors simply use $e_i$ as basis vectors, all the scaling is independently performed for each individual parameter.
Therefore, many equations can be simplified without introducing $e_i e_i^T$, which causes unnecessary confusion.
Similarly, the scale matrix $\Lambda$ can be simplified to per-parameter scale values.

Additionally, there is inconsistency in the subscripts for $\lambda$ and $e$.
The use of $i$ and $m$ is mixed in various instances, as seen in Equation (8) and (9).

I strongly recommend that the authors carefully restructure the overall notation in a systematic manner.


### Technically Incorrect Statements

#### Online Setting?

Although Amphibian is proposed as an online continual learning approach, one of its key assumptions is that the training examples are provided as a series of batches.
I think this is far from a truly online setting.
Generally, an online learning algorithm should be able to update a model meaningfully, even with a single example.
However, this is not the case for the proposed method.

#### Equivalence between Eq. (6) and (7)
The authors argue that Eq. (7) is *equivalent* to minimizing Eq. (6).
However, it seems to be an approximation, according to Appendix A.

### Questions
How does Amphibian work in a fully online setting where each example is given individually, i.e., when $|\mathcal B_i| = 1$?
