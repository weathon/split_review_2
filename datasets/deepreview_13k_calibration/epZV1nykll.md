## Abstract
Recently, people have shown that large-scale pre-training from diverse internet-scale data is the key to building a generalist model, as witnessed in the natural language processing (NLP) area. To build an embodied generalist agent, we, as well as many other researchers, hypothesize that such foundation prior is also an indispensable component. However, it is unclear \textit{what is the proper concrete form we should represent those embodied foundation priors} and \textit{how those priors should be used in the downstream task}. In this paper, we propose an intuitive and effective set of embodied priors that consist of foundation policy, foundation value, and foundation success reward. The proposed priors are based on the goal-conditioned Markov decision process formulation of the task. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed priors, we instantiate an actor-critic method with the assistance of the priors, called Foundation Actor-Critic (FAC). We name our framework as \textbf{Foundation Reinforcement Learning} (FRL), since our framework completely relies on embodied foundation priors to explore, learn and reinforce. The benefits of our framework are threefold. (1) \textit{Sample efficient learning}. With the foundation prior, FAC learns significantly faster than traditional RL. Our evaluation on the Meta-World has proved that FAC can achieve 100\% success rates for 7/8 tasks under less than 200k frames, which outperforms the baseline method with careful manual-designed rewards under 1M frames. (2) \textit{Robust to noisy priors}. Our method tolerates the unavoidable noise in embodied foundation models. We have shown that FAC works well even under heavy noise or quantization errors. (3) \textit{Minimal human intervention}: FAC completely learns from the foundation priors, without the need of human-specified dense reward, or providing teleoperated demonstrations. Thus, FAC can be easily scaled up.
We believe our FRL framework could enable the future robot to autonomously explore and learn without human intervention in the physical world.
In summary, our proposed FRL framework is a novel and powerful learning paradigm, towards achieving an embodied generalist agent.

### Confidence
4: You are confident in your assessment, but not absolutely certain. It is unlikely, but not impossible, that you did not understand some parts of the submission or that you are unfamiliar with some pieces of related work.

### Summary
The paper proposes a novel framework called Foundation Reinforcement Learning which leverages foundational priors: policy prior, value priod and success-reward prior which enables sample efficient training even under potentially noisy prior knowledge. The paper also proposes a foundational actor-critic algorithm that utilizes value, policy and success-reward prior knowledge. Paper shows empirical  results on 8 object manipulation tasks in Meta-World environment. FAC achieves 100% success on 7/8 tasks in less than 200k frames of training, significantly outperforming baselines like DrQv2 and R3M. In addition, paper also presents ablations to verify importance of each prior in the experimental setup.

### Strengths
1. Paper is well written
2. Idea of leveraging foundational priors to assist RL training and removing the need for human designed rewards is promising and interesting.
3. Preliminary evidence of policy working even with noisy foundation priors in MetaWorld environment is promising and shows initial signs of success of the proposed framework
4. Paper provides ablations to demonstrate importance of each component of the framework

### Weaknesses
1. Eventhough paper mention about using foundation priors for policy, value and success-reward the results use ground truth success-reward and do not show any results with foundation success-reward prior. Given the proposed contribution is a framework with foundation prior in policy, value and success-reward it is essential that authors present results with a foundation prior for success reward as well. 
2. The proposed foundation actor critic algorithm is a simple extension to DrQv2 which just adds a KL constraint to the prior foundation policy. This idea of using a KL constraint is very common in RL finetuning literature where we have a access to pretrained policy (trained using demonstrations or any other prior data) that we want to finetune with RL. 
3. The experimental setup is quite simple and doesn’t present extensive comparison with other baselines. For example, how does using a policy prior pretrained on a small dataset collected using a DRQv2 perform in comparison with the UniPi data? It is unclear if using data collected from a finetuned foundation model like UniPi is better than any other policy trained using in-domain data.
4. Comparison is only presented with DRQv2, R3M and other zero-shot baselines like UniPi and Prior. The experiment section needs to be expanded and compared with other commonly used baselines and SOTA methods on MetaWorld
5. Experiments are only presented in 1 simple environment where results on some tasks are not that convincing. For example, in figure 3 ablations results on button-press-topdown task shows that FAC vs FAC w.o. policy prior performs almost the same. Similarly, on door-open task FAC vs FAC w.o value prior performs almost the same. It is unclear from this experimental setup whether each component of the framework is important. Authors need to present experiments on more complex environments to clearly demonstrate importance of each component.
6. The core contribution of FRL is using foundation priors for RL training but in the experiments authors finetune the UniPi distilled policy with in-domain data which raises concerns that whether the policy prior benefits are coming purely from small in-domain finetuning or from base UniPi demonstrations that are used for distillation. It is essential that to disentangle these factors and present detailed ablations in the experiments.

### Questions
1. It’d be nice if authors can show benefits of foundation priors for policy without any finetuning on in-domain data for the tasks used in experiments as that is the most exciting result in my opinion.

I’d be happy to increase my score if authors address my concerns

4: You are confident in your assessment, but not absolutely certain. It is unlikely, but not impossible, that you did not understand some parts of the submission or that you are unfamiliar with some pieces of related work.

### Summary
The paper proposes to combine the benefits of pre-trained policy prior (from Unipi) and pre-trained value prior (from VIP) to improve reinforcement learning. The authors suggest learning a policy prior from Unipi and using it to regularize policy learning. They also use VIP as a value function prior and shaping reward.

While the paper's contribution is clear, the story may be confusing. If the authors aim to propose a framework for foundation RL, they should discuss 1. the concrete form in which to represent embodied foundation priors and 2. how to learn such a foundation model from the dataset. However, they didn't propose a new form for embodied foundation priors but leveraged existing embodied foundation priors(Unipi and VIP).
 
I think what the authors did, is to argue that both "Foundation Models for Policy Learning" and "Foundation Models for Representation Learning" in related works are important.  Unipi's policy prior is empirically weak due to a lack of interaction with the environment, while VIP's representation prior has not been fully leveraged. The authors propose novel ways to leverage VIP and combine the strengths of Unipi to achieve better performance.

### Strengths
The paper proposes to combine the benefits of pre-trained policy prior (from Unipi) and pre-trained value prior (from VIP) to improve reinforcement learning. Specifically, they propose novel ways to leverage VIP.

I am curious why you use R3M, rather than VIP, as the baseline for representation learning.

### Summary
This work proposes a foundation actor-critic framework which leverage foundation priors provided by foundation models. The expoeriments show the proposed method can learn efficiently and is robust to noisy priors with minimal human intervention.

### Strengths
1. This work investigates the adoptation of foundation models in the field of reinforement learning.
2. The proposed framework yields a promising performance on robotics manipulation tasks.

### Weaknesses
1. It looks like what happened in this paper is that the authors simply substituted the value and policy functions in the vanilla actor-critic with the VIP (Ma et al., 2022) model and the UniPi (Du et al., 2023) model, respectively. The so-called Reward Foundation Prior is still a 0-1 success signal as in the vanilla actor-critic framework. By doing so, the authors peddle a concept of foundation reinforcement learning. This manuscript looks like an empirical study of recent rl foundation models, without new theoretical contributions. 
2. The experimental results mainly demonstrate that by simultaneously using Unipi and VIP, the proposed method learns faster than DrQ-v2 (ICLR 2022), while the proposed method is only compared (or comparable) to DrQ-v2, other methods either do not involve training (Unipi and Prior) or yield a success rate of 0% (R3M) in 6 out of 8 tasks. (See fig. 2). Also, experiments are insufficient. All the experiments are conducted in a simple environment. The proposed method is compared to a limited number of baselines. Experiments on more SOTA baselines and investigation of more foundation models are welcome.
2. From my perspective, I don't think the proposed method can be claimed as a brand new "Foundation Reinforcement Learning" framework since it simply uses two existing foundation methods.

### Questions
It would be appreciated if the authors could lay out more about the uniqueness of the proposed foundation actor-critic method to the vanilla ones except for the utilization of existing foundation models.

### Summary
The paper proposes a new goal-conditioned reinforcement learning framework that leverages foundation models to accelerate learning, named Foundation Reinforcement Learning (FRL). FRL consists of three components, policy, value, and reward priors. To construct the policy prior, FRL utilize a pre-trained video generation model and an inverse dynamics model and distill them to a lightweight policy network. To construct the value prior, FRL uses VIP, which trains a universal value function on internet-scale robotic dataset, without fine-tuning. Finally, FRL uses 0-1 success function as the reward prior. FRL achieves superior performance compared to RL-only or foundation-only model methods on Meta-World.

### Strengths
- Novelty: The proposed framework that seamlessly integrates foundation models with reinforcement learning is indeed a novel contribution. Particularly striking is the concept of decoupling the policy and value priors, an unconventional move considering that values typically depend on policies, and utilizing the value prior as a potential-based reward function.
- Presentation: The meticulous ablation study presented in Section 5.3 adds a crucial layer of understanding by isolating and illustrating the distinct impact of each prior.
- Performance: Perhaps most compelling is its performance, exhibiting surprising sample efficiency in stark contrast to DrQ-v2.

### Weaknesses
- Limitation: While this paper is robust in its findings and methodology, acknowledging potential limitations would contribute to a more balanced discourse and pave the way for future research avenues. One such aspect is the comparison with methodologies like VLM that have a noted advantage in generating language-instructed policies. Specifically, the paper could benefit from a discussion on the limitations of FRL in handling tasks that require complex, nuanced language instructions, where VLMs might offer a significant advantage. Furthermore, the paper does not address the potential challenges of scaling FRL to a larger number of tasks or more complex environments. A brief discussion on the computational cost and scalability would be beneficial.

### Questions
- Extension to multi-task RL: It seems the authors train a policy on each of individual tasks in Meta-World. However, an intriguing extension of this work would be exploring the feasibility of training a singular policy across multiple tasks
