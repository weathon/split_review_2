## Abstract
\label{abstract}
Actor-critic algorithms have shown remarkable success in solving state-of-the-art decision-making problems. However, despite their empirical effectiveness, their theoretical underpinnings remain relatively unexplored, especially with neural network parametrization. In this paper, we delve into the study of a natural actor-critic algorithm that utilizes neural networks to represent the critic. Our aim is to establish sample complexity guarantees for this algorithm, achieving a deeper understanding of its performance characteristics. To achieve that, we propose a Natural Actor-Critic algorithm with 2-Layer critic parametrization (NAC2L). Our approach involves estimating the $Q$-function in each iteration through a convex optimization problem. We establish that our proposed approach attains a sample complexity of $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}\left(\frac{1}{\epsilon^{4}(1-\gamma)^{4}}\right)$. In contrast, the existing sample complexity results in the literature only hold for a tabular or linear MDP. Our result, on the other hand, holds for countable state spaces and does not require a linear or low-rank structure on the MDP.

### Summary
The authors study natural actor-critic with multi-layer neural network as the function approximation, which builds upon their unique decomposition of the error in the critic steps.

### Strengths
- The paper extends previous on natural actor critic to the case of multi-layer neural network and studies the sample complexity of the algorithm. The theoretical study is solid.
- The presentation of the paper is great.
- The paper relaxes the assumptions of previous study of natural actor critic. In particular, the paper does not require i.i.d. sampling.

### Weaknesses
 - The paper extends previous on natural actor critic to the case of multi-layer neural network and studies the sample complexity of the algorithm. The theoretical study is solid.
- The presentation of the paper is great.
- The paper relaxes the assumptions of previous study of natural actor critic. In particular, the paper does not require i.i.d. sampling.

 - The paper does not provide any empirical study on the algorithm and does not discuss on the empirical implicaiton.
- The authors claim that they are the first to show the sample complexity of natural actor critic algorithms with neural networks. However, to my understanding, the asymptotic converge result in Wang et al, 2019 and Fu et al, 2020 can be converted to an upper bound on the sample complexity directly. Given that, the contribution in this study is rather incremental.

### Questions
- In Theorem 1, $J.n$ should be written as $J\cdot n$. 
- The paper does not present a detailed description on how to parameterize the Q function and the policy with neural network in the main part of the paper. A detailed description or a hyper-link to it is helpful.
- The analysis and the error rate of the neural network seems to lie in the regime of neural tangent kernel. Papers on neural tangent kernel should be cited properly. Here are a few examples:

### Summary
This paper studies the convergence of NAC under two two-layer NN settings. The authors gives a $\epsilon^{-4}(1 - \gamma)^{-4}$ sample complexity for the guarantee for global convergence.

### Strengths
- This paper provides a non-asymptotic sample complexity for NAC under two-layer NN, compared to previous work, the non-asymptotic bound is more challenging.
- This paper is well-written and easy to follow.

### Weaknesses
 - The contribution of this paper needs to be highlighted: it seems that the result can be provided by combining the NTK analysis and the global convergence of NAC (Xu et al., 2020a). Since NTK analysis views the neural networks as a kernel method, the analysis is just let the width of $m$ be very large and then does the error analysis given the linear function.
- Given the aforementioned issue, the result $\epsilon^{-4}(1 - \gamma)^{-4}$ cannot match the previous result $\epsilon^{-3}(1 - \gamma)^{-4}$ in the linear case. I suspect the addition $\epsilon^{-1}$ is sacrificed for the neural network approximation errors

Therefore, I would encourage the authors to highlight the contribution of this paper based on the current well-developed NTK theory and  NAC theory.

### Summary
The authors propose an actor-critic method with neural network parametrization to solve the RL problem with discrete time, a finite action space and a (potentially) continuous state space. A natural policy gradient method is used for the actor and a method similar to the deep Q-net is applied for the critic. The authors give a global convergence result for the algorithm.

### Strengths
The authors propose a new method to solve the RL problem, which has a nice convergence result. I would suggest the paper be published if the author could address my concerns and problems.

### Weaknesses
The presentation is not clear enough and there are many mistakes. The correctness of the main theorem remains questionable. I will put the details in “Questions”.
For example, the authors did not give definition for the notation r’(s,a), which caused some confusion. I will, according to the description of Definition 2, understand r’(s,a) as a realization of R(\cdot | s,a), which is the same as r(s,a).

Major questions:
1.	Page 3. The definition of Bellman operator. In (3), the authors use one realization of the reward r’(s,a) to define the Bellman operator. This makes (T^\pi Q)(s,a) a random variable. So, T^\pi Q^\pi = Q^\pi does not hold. Maybe the authors can consider the setting when the reward is deterministic, otherwise there is a lot to fix. A more challenging alternative is to redefine the Bellman operator with r’(s,a) replaced by its conditional expectation. As a follow up, when T^\pi Q is not deterministic, \eps_{approx} in Assumption 4 could be as large as O(1) according to the variance of the reward. In this case, Theorem 1 becomes meaningless. As another follow up, in page 8 eqn (24), Lemma 2 of Munos (2003) is also for deterministic reward.
2.	Page 4 before (8). The authors use the property of compatible function approximation, which is an extremely strong assumption for neural network parametrization. According to Sutton, this means \frac{\partial Q}{\partial \theta} = \frac{\partial \pi}{\partial \lambda} / \pi. And Sutton also points out (in the paper that the author cited) that “Q being linear in the features may be the only way to satisfy this condition”. On the one hand, this assumption is too strong to make the work practical. On the other hand, there is no critic parametrization until eqn (10). So, I think a normal version of the policy gradient theorem (theorem 1 in the ref) is enough.
3.	Theorem 1 (and also Lemma 7). The authors give no description or assumption on \mu_k. Therefore, the constants for big O in the theorem depend on \mu_k, and hence depend on K. This makes the theorem meaningless. I would suggest giving a positive lower bound for \mu_k. Please note that \mu_k is also the lower bound for the (eigenvalue of the) Fisher information matrix (7), which guarantees that F is invertible.
4.	Lemma 6. According to the description of Lemma 6, there is no randomness in (50) and I don’t see why “with high probability” is needed. My understanding is that (50) left is not an expectation, but a conditional expectation only w.r.t. the RL problem. The randomness comes from the initialization of neural network etc. However, the authors give no description of the network (except the width). I believe inequality like (50) could only hold when one gives a very explicit setting for everything. Please clarify the setting with details so that we can justify the application of the referenced theorems.
5.	Proof of theorem 1. Eqn (56) is not consistent with line 20 in the algorithm. There should be a coefficient 1/(1-\gamma). I think the statement of theorem 1 need modification accordingly, because you are tracking the dependence on 1/(1-\gamma). (58)-(60), when you define err_k, do you mean to use A^{\pi_{\labmda_k}} instead of A_{k,J}? Otherwise, it is not consistent with (66).

Minor questions:
1.	Page 2. The sentence “the non-convexity of the critic can be avoided if we use the natural policy gradient algorithm” is not clear. What do you mean by “the non-convexity of the critic”? Natural policy gradient is the actor algorithm, why does it resolve the problem for the critic?
2.	Page 2 Related works: actor-critic methods. I think papers like “Provably global convergence of actor-critic: A case for linear quadratic regulator with ergodic cost” (NIPS2019) and “Single Timescale Actor-Critic Method to Solve the Linear Quadratic Regulator with Convergence Guarantees” (JMLR2023) are also related.
3.	Page 3. Why does the stationary distribution \rho^\pi_\nu depend on the initial distribution \nu, especially when Assumption 2 holds?
4.	Page 4. The definition of natural policy gradient method. I believe that the dagger means inverse of pseudo-inverse of the matrix. It should not appear in eqn (7), where the Fisher information matrix is defined. Also, please clarify the dagger notation.    
5.	Page 4. Please give the full name of DQN when it first appears.
6.	Page 6 after (15). In Xu and Gu (2020), I did not find the assumption described in the paper.
7.	Proof of theorem 1. (53)(54) looks unnecessary when you have (55)(56). (54) looks wrong. (58) should be >= instead of <=? Eqn (58) to (59) has nothing to do with the performance difference lemma, maybe you mean eqn (59) to (60)? (59) first line, should use the advantage function instead of the Q function? (59) second line, should be + instead of -? Eqn (63), why does k goes to J-1 instead of K? Also, in (63), \pi_{\lambda_0} should be \pi_{\lambda_1}? It seems that one of \eta is omitted from (62) to (63), which is not wrong but makes the proof harder, why doing this?
8.	Please add an explanation for the log(|A|) in eqn (64).

There also some Typos:
Page 3 after “Hence, we can write” d^\pi(s_0) should be d^\pi_{s_0}(s)
Page 4. \Lambda should be a subset (not element) of R^d
Page 5 Algorithm. Line 12, should be Q_k = Q_{\theta_n}?
Page 6 eqn (15). w^t should be w?

### Rating Number

### Confidence
3: You are fairly confident in your assessment. It is possible that you did not understand some parts of the submission or that you are unfamiliar with some pieces of related work. Math/other details were not carefully checked.

### Summary
The paper provides a theoretical convergence analysis for natural actor-critic with neural network function approximation for the critic and softmax parameterization for the actor. The authors are able to prove global convergence is proven.

### Strengths
This paper studies a problem closely related to the practice. Data are allowed to be Markovian in the analysis, which uses a result from Bertail & Portier (2019), which might be of independent interest.

### Weaknesses
First of all, the authors claim in the introduction that existing works that study actor-critic with neural network function approximation only provide asymptotic results. However, I found the following paper, which is not compared with in this paper:

Cayci, Semih, Niao He, and R. Srikant. "Finite-time analysis of entropy-regularized neural natural actor-critic algorithm." arXiv preprint arXiv:2206.00833 (2022).

Could the authors kindly clarify how the result in this submission differentiates from the one in this paper from 2022?

In addition, the authors consider the flexibility of allowing non-i.i.d. samples in their analysis as a contribution of this paper, but the following paper, which the authors have already cited, also allows Markovian data. Could the authors shed some light on how the analysis technique used in this paper differs from the one in the following paper? (I understand their result is only for linear function approximation. Does this make a big difference in the part of analysis pertaining to the concentration over non-i.i.d. Markovian data?)

Xu, Tengyu, Zhe Wang, and Yingbin Liang. "Improving sample complexity bounds for (natural) actor-critic algorithms." Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems 33 (2020): 4358-4369.

The above two questions is mainly concerned with the significance/novelty of this submission. I also have several technical questions, which I will defer to the Questions section.

- What is the architecture of your neural network in Algorithm 1? How does this function class look like? You stated $L$ layers and $m$ neurons per layer in Section 4, but is there any other requirements or specifications? A paragraph that states this more rigorously would be appreciated.

- A related question is: how does the size of your neural network function class or $\Theta$ affect the variance portion of your final error bound? Your current bound does not show any dependence on it. Could you explain why the upper bound of the expectation of a supremum over $\Theta$ does not need to depend on the complexity of $\Theta$ in Equation (110)? Otherwise, if the Rad quantity in (110) actually depends on $\Theta$, could you explicitly present in your theorem how $C_k$ in your Equation (111) depends on $\Theta$, as most existing theoretical results do. This is an important aspect of such theoretical results, since taking a covering with a supremum usually compromises the sharpness of the bound. If you'd like to compare with the rates in other theoretical works, it might come across as unfair if your bound does not show this aspect.

- Is there any difference between Algorithm 1 and the procedure you actually use in your theoretical analysis? Algorithm 1 seems to be a practical implementation which uses gradient descent to solve the objective in Equation (11), whereas I believe you assume there is an oracle that can find the global minimizer of (11) in your theoretical analysis. (Otherwise, could you explain how you avoided the non-convexity?) If this is the case, this difference should be made much clearer in the writing, and Theorem 1 should not be claimed as a result for the current Algorithm 1.

- Please let me know if the following is correct: $\alpha m$ can be $\Theta(\frac{1}{\mathrm{poly}(n,L)})$, so the second line of Equation (17) can be viewed as $\frac{1}{K(1-\gamma)}\sum_{k=1}^K\sum_{j=0}^{J-1}(1 - \frac{1}{n^2})^n$. Since $(1 - \frac{1}{n^2})^n$ is monotonically increasing and converges to a constant, is this term on the order of $\frac{J}{1-\gamma}$? If this is the case, it is non-decaying.

- What is $\mu_k$ in Theorem 1? Isn't the loss function in Equation (9) just MSE?

- Could you also explain the following in Remark 3:

> This term is present due to the fact that the optimization for the critic step is non-convex, hence convergence can only be guaranteed with a high probability. We show in the Appendix F that if the critic is represented by a two layer neural network with ReLU activation, using the convex reformulation as laid out in Mishkin et al. (2022), a deterministic upper bound on the error can be obtained.

Normally, the high probability bound is due to the randomness in your samples. Could you explain why you attribute it to the non-convexity? Furthermore, when everything is convex, could you explain why you can obtain a deterministic result, when the samples from Line 5 and 10 of Algorithm 1 are still random?

- Also, the notation $n.J$ in Algorithm 1 and Theorem 1 seems weird. Did you mean to write $n\cdot J$? Same with other instances of dots.

Despite my serious concerns at the moment, I'm open to raising my score if authors' clarification could clear my questions.
