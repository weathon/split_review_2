## Abstract
Incorporating a customized object into image generation presents an attractive feature in text-to-image generation. However, existing optimization-based and encoder-based methods are hindered by drawbacks such as time-consuming optimization, insufficient identity preservation, and a prevalent copy-pasting effect. To overcome these limitations, we introduce CustomNet, a novel object customization approach that explicitly incorporates 3D novel view synthesis capabilities into the object customization process. This integration facilitates the adjustment of spatial position relationships and viewpoints, yielding diverse outputs while effectively preserving object identity. Moreover, we introduce delicate designs to enable location control and flexible background control through textual descriptions or specific user-defined images, overcoming the limitations of existing 3D novel view synthesis methods. We further leverage a dataset construction pipeline that can better handle real-world objects and complex backgrounds. Equipped with these designs, our method facilitates zero-shot object customization without test-time optimization, offering simultaneous control over the viewpoints, location, and background. As a result, our CustomNet ensures enhanced identity preservation and generates diverse, harmonious outputs.

### Summary
The paper presents a novel approach to text-to-image generation that integrates 3D novel view synthesis for enhanced object customization. Unlike traditional methods that have challenges with identity preservation and limited customization, CustomNet offers explicit viewpoint control, location adjustments, and flexible background generation. It leverages a new dataset construction pipeline using both synthetic multiview data and natural images. The result is a model that achieves zero-shot object customization with improved identity preservation, diverse viewpoints, and harmonious outputs.

### Strengths
1. The paper is well-written and easy to follow.
2. The authors present a comprehensive solution that seamlessly integrates background inpainting into the Zero-1-to-3 pipeline, addressing its potential limitation in altering the background or location of the object.
3. The paper utilizes the latest vision foundation models, such as SAM and BLIP, in conjunction with "Zero-1-to-3," to construct a dataset that supports the training of the proposed unified framework. The inverse data generation pipeline which decompose the netural image into the training component is interesting.

### Weaknesses
1. A significant concern with this paper is its limited novelty. It leans heavily on the "Zero-1-to-3" model as its foundation. While the addition of background inpainting offers an enhancement, the core mechanism—explicit 3D novel view synthesis—remains unchanged. Moreover, it inherits constraints from "Zero-1-to-3", particularly the resolution limitation of 256 × 256, which might not be practical for real-world scenarios.
2. The approach to decompose foreground objects using SAM and augmenting them using "Zero-1-to-3" is intriguing. However, there are lingering questions about the methodology. For instance, considering that SAM segments every element in a scene, how does the paper specifically determine the foreground object? Furthermore, if the selected foreground object falls outside the "Zero-1-to-3" training domain, is the efficacy of the method compromised?
3. The paper mostly compares CustomNet with "Zero-1-to-3" and a few other models. A broader discussion with state-of-the-art models in the domain would have given a better quality assessment of CustomNet's performance. For example, [1] also employs stable diffusion for background inpainting while preserving the appearance of foreground objects through a dual-branch composition.

### Confidence
3: You are fairly confident in your assessment. It is possible that you did not understand some parts of the submission or that you are unfamiliar with some pieces of related work. Math/other details were not carefully checked.

### Summary
The paper presents an method for inserting objects into scenes. The main contribution is a unified framework that allows users to specify the background, the object, and its location. The background can be specified by text description (generation) or actual image pixels (composition), while the object is specified by its background-subtracted image, the desired relative camera view, and its bounding box within the final image.

### Strengths
There are two main strengths of the paper:

1. The presented method is an end-to-end solution for the task of placing objects into scenes, which produces harmonious outputs easier than a multi-stage pipeline.

2. The presented results look convincing in both preserving the object's identity a and harmonizing the final composition.

### Weaknesses
The novelty of the approach is somewhat limited, as it essentially plugs background generation/compositing into the Zero-1-2 architecture. Placing the object into a localized bounding box as a guide instead of keeping it centralized would be straightforward to do in Zero-1-2. The core contribution seems to be the combination of these elements rather than a fundamentally new method. While the bounding box provides spatial control, it's not clear how this interacts with the existing camera parameters, particularly the radius, and whether this introduces any redundancy or unexpected behavior. The paper does not adequately explore the limitations of this bounding box approach, such as how it handles extreme aspect ratios or occlusions.

An interesting component of the system is the synthetic dataset of objects composed onto backgrounds. Publishing that dataset for future research would add to the contribution.

Paper should discuss some remaining artifacts in the limitation section, such as:
  * Minor change of identity in Figure 1 Row 3 (look at the number 1 on the toy car)
  * Bad aspect ratio of the dog in Figure 1 Row 4 (it's too squished)
  * The white pixels around the character in Figure 4 Row 1 Last Column
Where do these come from and how would one go about improving them?

### Questions
How come you need to specify both the camera translation and image location? Wouldn't it be enough to only encode camera rotation and the bounding box to place the object anywhere in the image?

You mention that Zero-1-to-3 method cannot produce non-centered objects. But they allow users to specify full 3D camera rotation and translation, which is a component that this paper inherits. Why wouldn't translation enable users to place objects off-center?

If I understood the section 3.2 correctly, to make Figure 2 more clear, you could show 2 branches as the input to the text encoder: "sitting on the beach" for the Generation branch and NULL for the Composition branch.  Although I may be wrong, since the model could possibly take in both  the background image and the textual description. What happens in that case in terms of the output?

Phrases like "delicate designs" and "intricate designs" seem out of place in this paper. The network design, if that's what this refers to, seems reasonable and straightforward.

It may be helpful to specify that R is a 3x3 matrix and T is a 3-vector. If that really is the case (as it is in Zero-1-2), then the rotation is not just a rotation, but also non-uniform scaling and sheer and possibly even reflection. Is that too many degrees of freedom to specify as input for a human user? Why not just specify the viewing direction with something like azimuth+altitude?

You did not define d in equation 2.

A figure visualizing some of the synthetic dataset images would be helpful.

  * The white pixels around the character in Figure 4 Row 1 Last Column
