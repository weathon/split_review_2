## Abstract
Online-Within-Online (OWO) meta learning stands for the online multi-task learning paradigm in which both tasks and data within each task become available in a sequential order. In this work, we study the OWO meta learning of the initialization and step size of within-task online algorithms in the non-convex setting, and provide improved regret bounds under mild assumptions of loss functions. Previous work analyzing this scenario has obtained for bounded and piecewise Lipschitz functions an averaged regret bound $O((\frac{\sqrt{m}}{T^{1/4}}+\frac{(\log{m})\log{T}}{\sqrt{T}}+V)\sqrt{m})$ across $T$ tasks, with $m$ iterations per task and $V$ the task similarity. Our first contribution is to modify the existing non-convex OWO meta learning algorithm and improve the regret bound to $O((\frac{1}{T^{1/2-\alpha}}+\frac{(\log{T})^{9/2}}{T}+V)\sqrt{m})$, for any $\alpha \in (0,1/2)$. The derived bound has a faster convergence rate with respect to $T$, and guarantees a vanishing task-averaged regret with respect to $m$ (for any fixed $T$). Then, we propose a new algorithm of regret $O((\frac{\log{T}}{T}+V)\sqrt{m})$ for non-convex OWO meta learning. This regret bound exhibits a better asymptotic performance than previous ones, and holds for any bounded (not necessarily Lipschitz) loss functions. Besides the improved regret bounds, our contributions include investigating how to attain generalization bounds for statistical meta learning via regret analysis. Specifically, by online-to-batch arguments, we achieve a transfer risk bound for batch meta learning that assumes all tasks are drawn from a distribution. Moreover, by connecting multi-task generalization error with task-averaged regret, we develop for statistical multi-task learning a novel PAC-Bayes generalization error bound that involves our regret bound for OWO meta learning.

### Summary
The authors consider the problem of meta-learning, in particular the online-within-online setting with non-convex loss functions.  They consider the initialization and step size of the Exponentially Weighted Aggregation (EWA) algorithm.  For functions that are bounded, non-convex, and piecewise Lipschitz they propose modifications to the state of the art algorithm and obtain better task-averaged regret bounds.  For bounded, non-convex, non-Lipschitz functions they propose a new method and obtain the first task-averaged regret bounds for that problem.  They also apply those results to obtain novel PAC-Bayes generalization bounds for meta-learning.

### Strengths
### Results
- For adversarial bounded, possibly non-convex, piecewise Lipschitz loss functions, the authors propose modifications to a state-of-the-art method in Balcan et al. (2021) and obtain significantly improved task-averaged regret bounds.  In contrast to prior bounds, the bound (Theorem 1) is sub-linear w.r.t. the number of per-task iterations $m$).  The dependence on the number of tasks $T$ is also improved.  
- The authors consider a more general class of problems (removing assumption of piecewise Lipschitz) and propose a new algorithm and the first regret bounds for this setting.  Though there are some concerns about this set of results (discussed below)


### Writing & Soundness
- Overall I found the writing and organization to be good in terms of organization and clarity.  I did not carefully check the analysis, but as far I could tell the results appear sound.

### Weaknesses
### Significance of Algorithm 2 and its regret bound
The non-convex non-Lipschitz setting is challenging.  The authors derive the first task-averaged regret bounds  for non-convex non-Lipschitz loss functions.  However some issues (which are acknowledged and discussed in the appendix) lead to concerns about the significance of the results for this problem.  
- It is noted in the appendix (Remark B.1, which is referenced at the end of Section 4) that due to the initialization update rule of the FTL algorithm, the regret bound in Theorem 3 may be vacuous under the regret definition in Eq (1) when the task optimal distribution $\rho_t^*$ is a Dirac measure.    It is mentioned in Remark B.1 that alternative update rules of $\rho_{t1}$ may address the issue but (i) are there candidates in mind and (ii) how badly might they impact the regret bound?  i.e. is it plausible that an analog to Proposition 4 could be found that would still yield the same or almost the same good task-averaged upper-regret bound as Theorem 3?
- It is also noted in the appendix (Remark H.1, which I don’t think was referenced in Section 4) that the analytic form of the RN derivatives can’t be computed in practice even for uniform or Gaussian distributions. This also leads to concerns over the significance of Theorem 3

### Experiments
- It was good to include some experiments, but only Algorithm 1’s performance is shown, not (Balcan et al. (2021)) or any other baseline, even though the experiments used are set up the same as those in (Balcan et al. (2021)).

### Questions
### Main comments/questions

1. Can you include some discussion on how the problem set up, methods, and regret bounds for OWO relate to the problem of online learning with dynamic comparators, (eg “Online Optimization : Competing with Dynamic Comparators” https://proceedings.mlr.press/v38/jadbabaie15.pdf and more recent works).  It seems for OWO meta-learning the comparator sequence would be fixed for each task and the changes would be known a priori (every $m$ rounds).  Perhaps there would be a significant gap between regret bounds from online optimization with dynamic comparators specialized to OWO (eg accounting for task similarities etc) versus regret bounds for methods designed specially for OWO.

### Minor comments/questions
2. Can you add some discussion for problem parameter sizes --- eg for some potential applications would the number of iterations $m$ be large while the number of tasks $T$ be much smaller or vice versa?  
3. (Related works) “These regret bounds are irrelevant to the sample size m per task…” does that mean ‘the regret bounds do not depend on the sample size m per task’ or something else?

### Summary
In this paper, the authors study an Online Within Online (OWO) meta learning problem in which both the tasks and data within each task become available in a sequential order. The correlation among tasks is assumed to be helpful for learning the latter tasks. This paper provides a sub-linear regret w.r.t. the number of iterations $m$, and the regret exhibit a better convergence rate w.r.t. the number of tasks $T$. The authors investigate both non-convex piecewise Lipschitz continuous functions and non-Lipschitz functions in section 4.1 and 4.2, which makes the contribution fruitful. The proposed algorithm uses FT(R)L to update distribution $\rho_i$ in two different settings, which is motivated by previous work. The improvement comes from the learning initialization step and the choice of step size.

The authors are quite honest to discuss the limitation in Remark~B.1 of Appendix~B and Remark~H.1. Thus, there is no need to further discuss these issues in my comments. 

I strongly recommend the authors to complement more details and explanations in the proof to make it more readable. For instance, I was quite confused on the third equation in the proof of Proposition~F.1., where the explanation that $\ell_i'$ ``is the i.i.d. copy...'' is not enough to show the equivalence, the boundedness of $\ell_i$ is also required. I cannot fully understand $\{\ell\}_{j=1}^{i-1}\sim \mu^{i-1}$, $j=0$ and $\mu^{i-1}$ are not defined. The issues like that are common in proofs. I have to admit that I was convincing myself some (in)-equalities are correct since the authors are honest to admit their issues. Due to the time limit, I can only proof check some part of the proofs. I hope other reviewers and the authors could help checking the theoretical part in the future.

### Summary
This paper first improves the regret bound of an existing non-convex online-within-online OWO) meta-learning algorithm for bounded and piecewise Lipschitz functions, and then design a new efficient OWO meta learning algorithm for bounded functions (maybe non-Lipschitz). This paper also derives a transfer risk bound and a PAC-Bayes bound for statistical meta learning via the regret analysis.

### Strengths
1) The problem of non-convex online-within-online OWO) meta-learning problem studied in this paper is interesting, which does have many real applications.
2) This paper has proposed two improved regret bounds for the non-convex OWO meta-learning problem.
3) The authors also extend the improved regret bound to the transfer risk bound and PAC-Bayes generalization bound for multi-task learning.

### Weaknesses
1) Although improved regret bounds are presented, the authors do not explain why their specific analysis and algorithmic choices, such as the use of Follow-The-Leader (FTL) and Follow-The-Regularized-Leader (FTRL), led to these improvements over existing methods. The connection between the algorithm design and the resulting regret bounds is not clearly articulated. 
2) Moreover, it seems that the second improved regret bound is tighter than the first one, and holds in a more general case (non-Lipschitz). The practical value and specific scenarios where the first bound would be more relevant are not well-defined, making its contribution less clear. The paper does not provide a comparative analysis of the conditions under which each bound is most applicable.
3) The transfer risk and PAC-Bayes generalization bounds are derived by using the online-to-batch and online-to-PAC techniques, which appear to be incremental applications of existing results, lacking significant novelty in their derivation. The paper does not highlight specific challenges in applying these techniques to the meta-learning setting, nor does it demonstrate any novel insights gained from this application.
4) Although some experimental results are provided, no existing algorithms are compared and discussed in the experiments. The experiments only show performance against a single-task baseline, but do not benchmark against other meta-learning algorithms, making it difficult to assess the practical significance of the proposed methods.

### Questions
1) The authors should explain why their analysis and algorithm led to the improvements in the regret bounds. 
2) The authors should explain whether there exist some advantages of the first improved regret bound when it is compared with the second one.
3) The authors should conduct some experiments to compare their algorithms against existing algorithms.

### Summary
In this work, the authors consider the problem of non-convex online within online (owo) meta learning, which is a framework where a learner has to adapt to several online learning problems sequentially, and aims to use knowledge of the learned learning rate and step size of previous tasks to speed up learning.
The author first consider the same restrictions for the loss function (namely bounded and piece-wise Lipschitz) as in a previous work of Balcan et al. (2021) and widely improve the results, deriving regret bounds with improved dependencies on the number of tasks $T$ and the number of episodes within each task $m$. This algorithm is easy to implement and experiments can be found in the appendix that highlight that transferring information helps. 

They then propose a different more general approach, which only requires the assumption of bounded loss functions. They derive regret bounds that are tighter than for the first algorithm, and are even sharper than the bounds derived by Khodak et al. (2019). While the theoretical results hold, it is also indicated in the appendix that they cannot manage to implement the algorithm, which limits the practical interest of this algorithm to specific and easy to implement problem instances.

Finally, they also provide generalization bounds for statisitical meta-learning and PAC-Bayesian bounds for statistical multi-task learning.

### Strengths
The paper proposes significant improvements in the analysis of the non-convex OWO problem, which is a complex problem that has not been widely studied up to now.
The proposed algorithms rely on well studied frameworks of online learning, notably the EWA algorithms as well as the FTRL and FTL framework.
Using a similar framework as the only exisiting previous result for non convex OWO (to the best of my knowledge), they propose an algorithm with significantly tighter bounds in terms of $T$ and $m$, which can be implemented and appears to perform fine in experiments.

The second algorithm appears simple, but achieves a significant improvement.

The generalization bounds are novel and a good addition to the work.

From what I got to see, the proofs seem correct and are well detailed.

### Weaknesses
It would be good to have a more detailed explanation of why the second algorithm does not work well in practice. 
In particular, the EWA step is normally expressed in close form solution and thus computation should not be an issue. 
Detailing the relation between the EWA and the FTRL formulations of Algorithm 2 l.4.  and how that prevents computations would be a good step towards understanding the limitations of this algorithm. 
In the current format of the paper, it is necessay to reach the last remark of the appendix to understand why the result of Theorem 2 is not 
directly eclipsed by the more general and tighter bound of Theorem 3, which affects the clarity of the paper.

A discussion of the lower bounds and of the optimality of the results is lacking and would help getting a better understanding of how much the bounds can be further improved.

### Questions
Could you clarify the relation between the EWA and the FTRL formulations of Algorithm 2 l.4.  and how that prevents computations would be a good step towards understanding the limitations of this algorithm?

Could you discuss existence of the lower bounds for this problem and of the optimality of the results?
