## Abstract
Recent research in decoding methods for Natural Language Generation (NLG) tasks has shown that MAP decoding is not optimal, because model probabilities do not always align with human preferences. 
Stronger decoding methods, including Quality Estimation (QE) reranking and Minimum Bayes Risk (MBR) decoding, have since been proposed to mitigate the model-perplexity-vs-quality mismatch. While these decoding methods achieve state-of-the-art performance, they are prohibitively expensive to compute. In this work, we propose \textit{MBR finetuning} and \textit{QE finetuning}, which distill the quality gains from these decoding methods at training time, while using an efficient decoding algorithm at inference time. Using the canonical NLG task of Neural Machine Translation (NMT), we show that even with self-training, these finetuning methods significantly outperform the base model. Moreover, when using an external LLM as a teacher model, these finetuning methods outperform finetuning on human-generated references. These findings suggest new ways to leverage monolingual data to achieve improvements in model quality that are on par with, or even exceed, improvements from human-curated data, while maintaining maximum efficiency during decoding.

### Summary
The paper describes approaches to training NMT models that use different decoding methods than beam search, namely, QE reranking and MBR decoding. Using such decoding methods in inference can be quite expensive computationally but using them in training time allows for maintaining inference time efficiency while leveraging their mitigation of model-perplexity-vs-quality. This approach can be seen as an alternative to aligning MT models with human translation preferences, given by the QE or utility function used in MBR. Furthermore, using either QE reranking or MBR decoding allows for exploring monolingual data augmentation for training as neither require references for scoring translation hypotheses. Automatic and manual evaluation results indicate that QE-finetuned systems outperform the reference-finetuned baseline, and QE finetuning using a PaLM-2 teacher outperforms using the self-teacher model.

### Strengths
The paper is a good contribution towards aligning MT models with human preferences as given by reference-less or reference-based metrics (QE reranking and the utility function used for MBR, respectively). It allows leveraging monolingual data relevant to the MT model application setting for improving its translation quality. Automatic evaluation is consistent with manual evaluation and the experimental setting is sound. This is an interesting alternative to reinforcement learning models that have shown to be quite unstable in MT settings. The approaches shown here are also generalizable to other natural generation tasks though no experiments have been devised to show that.

### Weaknesses
The paper is quite dense at some parts, mainly at the experimental setting. It takes a few passes on those sections to completely understand the results and the settings but it is clear. The QE approach is not really reproducible as the QE model is not publicly available. Furthermore, the best teacher model seems to be a PaLM2-Bison that is also not publicly available.

### Questions
* Is there any description of MetricX-XXL-QE in another paper? I could not find a paper describing except a paragraph in the Findings paper. How many languages does it support? This seems to be a very big QE model, 30B parameters. 

* How much time is added to the training process when using the MBR and QE reranking? Maybe a table illustrating the added wallclock time would be interesting to contrast with the gains in performance. 

* How much does the data used to train the QE model and the utility function used in MBR affect the final results for specific domains? Do yo have any insights on this? For example, for English-German, it seems most of the MT training data is similar to the data used to train the QE and BLEURT models. What if this is not the case? Do you observe the same improvements or does something change in the translation quality of the best models?

### Confidence
4: You are confident in your assessment, but not absolutely certain. It is unlikely, but not impossible, that you did not understand some parts of the submission or that you are unfamiliar with some pieces of related work.

### Summary
The paper proposes two new training methods called MBR finetuning and QE finetuning to distill the benefits of high-quality decoding methods like Minimum Bayes Risk (MBR) decoding and Quality Estimation (QE) reranking into the model weights, while avoiding expensive inference costs. The results demonstrates their effectiveness for machine translation including exceeding human references

### Strengths
1. MBR and QE produce superior quality but are too expensive for inference. The finetuning approach provides a way to achieve most of their benefits without sacrificing efficiency. This could enable deploying higher performance models in real applications.
2. The proposed methods are clearly explained and technically sound. The experiments are comprehensive and rigorous, spanning various metrics, domains, language pairs, and resource settings. The results consistently validate the effectiveness of MBR and QE finetuning over strong baselines.

### Weaknesses
1.	The novelty of the method is unclear. Using high-quality pseudo data generated by better decoding methods is a common technique in neural machine translation. This paper does not seem to provide new insights beyond what is already known.
2.	While this paper reports significant gains with MBR and QE finetuning, the reasons for the improvements are not well analyzed. In some cases, QE finetuning performs better, while in others, MBR finetuning is superior. More details and an in-depth analysis of the advantages and limitations of each finetuning method would be expected.

### Questions
1.	Please report the performance of the PaLM-2 Bison model.
2.	For English-German, MBR finetuning seems to outperform QE finetuning. Why was only QE finetuning evaluated for English-Japanese instead of also evaluating MBR?
3.	Can you report the training time and compute requirements for the QE and MBR finetuning experiments? Providing the concrete training costs for comparison would be helpful.

3: You are fairly confident in your assessment. It is possible that you did not understand some parts of the submission or that you are unfamiliar with some pieces of related work. Math/other details were not carefully checked.

### Summary
This paper uses expensive decoding methods like MBR decoding and QE using neural metrics to generate data for finetuning. After fine-tuning, the model can be used with cheaper decoding strategies like beam search/greedy search and still retain the gains of the expensive decoding methods.
The paper explores different setups: finetuning on references, finetuning on MBR/QE decoded reference set, finetuning on MBR/QE decoded sampled monolingual data, finetuning on MBR/QE decoded samples from a very strong teacher (finetuned LLM) and show that finetuning on MBR/QE decoded monolingual data can get additional benefits over finetuning on references. They also show that finetuning using decoded data from a very strong teacher shows the best results.
The paper also does ablations around the effect of candidate size/source sentences selected/forward translation vs. backward translation while generating the finetuning data.
Finally the QE finetuned systems are evaluated against baselines in an MQM human evaluation to confirm the rankings produced by COMET-20

### Strengths
Strengths of the paper:

1. Sound experimental setup, clear description of the proposed method and showing its effectiveness
2. Important contribution for practitioners because currently MBR and QE decoding with neural metrics is computationally infeasible to be deployed in real time, the proposed approach can help bring some of those gains to production systems

### Weaknesses
Weaknesses of the paper:

1. The paper presents a section of the results from Palm2 finetuning and show large improvements. I think that is expected because it is a much stronger model. This set of experiments doesn't add too much value to the paper. The paper should also show the beam and MBR decoded results of the Palm2 model used for finetuning, so that the readers can understand show much of the teacher model performance can be transferred to the student via this finetuning.
2. After using MBR/QE finetuning, do we still see a difference between beam decoding and MBR/QE decoding? Table 3 summarizes the results using beam/greedy and sampling, but MBR/QE decoding results should also be included for completeness.
3. In Table 1, we see 2a perform better than 1c) and 2c) perform better than 1b). This is a bit suprising because I would have assumed that finetuning performance will be upper bounded by MBR/QE used during run-time. I couldn't find any comment on this comparison in the paper.
4. The paper does not have any numbers on lexical metrics like chrF. Would have been nice to include those numbers atleast in the Appendix, for interested readers

### Summary
Previous research has shown that ranking techniques (with QE metrics or MBR) generally improve machine translation quality, being very expensive at inference time. This paper proposes MBR/QE finetuning—using QE/MBR outputs at training time, while employing efficient decoding algorithms (e.g., beam search) during inference. Their experiments suggest that (1) MBR/QE finetuning alone are worse than vanilla finetuning with human references using the same high-quality data; (2) self-MBR/QE finetuning can complement finetuning on a small dataset of high-quality human references; and (3) using MBR/QE data generated by a stronger teacher model further improves quality. A subset of the results is validated by professional translators.

### Strengths
- The motivation is clear and the paper is well written.
- MBR/QE finetuning (their method) seems to work well with beam/greedy search, making inference faster when compared to standard reranking techniques that employ rerankers at inference time.
- Their models are evaluated with multiple state of the art evaluation metrics for MT. Their findings are further validated by 9 professional translators using the MQM framework.

### Weaknesses
 - Some parts of the paper (e.g., the first three paragraphs of the introduction) talk about NLG in general but the paper focuses on machine translation. Reranking methods, in particular, rely on good quality estimation models that exist for MT but may not exist for other tasks. Of course, MBR finetuning can be applied to other NLG tasks (e.g., summarization) but this paper does not touch this problem. I think the authors should either revise the writing and make the scope more clear from the beginning, or perform experiments in other NLG tasks. The contribution is mainly empirical and only validated for MT. 
- The study is limited in terms of language coverage. They perform experiments on 2 language pairs only (mid & high resource), both for translation out of English. It’s not clear if the findings hold for lower resource languages and when translating into English. In particular, I’m expecting quality estimation models to be worse for low resource languages, which may end up affecting the quality of the translations produced with their method. Have you tried other languages? If so, what happens in that case?
- The related work discusses other methods for training NMT models beyond MLE (e.g., RL methods) but none of them is used as a baseline.

### Questions
I left some questions in the weaknesses part. Other comments/questions: 

- MBR decoding uses BLEURT and is prohibitively expensive. Note, however, that more efficient alternatives exist. See implementation details discussed in [1], Section 4.3. Is there a reason to choose BLEURT? While efficiency at inference time is an advantage, MBR/QE finetuning is expensive at training time. It would be good to see some numbers to understand the training/inference time difference when compared to other existing approaches.
- In the introduction you say that MBR decoding requires the generation of a large number of candidates. While this is true if you get unbiased samples from the model, it does not seem to be the case when you bias the distribution (e.g., using nucleus sampling). I suggest you see the discussions in [2] and [3] and comment. Also, see my comment above about [1]. 
- Results use COMET-20 instead of more recent versions already available online such as COMET-22. Is there a reason for using the 2020 version?
- Human evaluation results are important and should not be in the appendix (Table 7). In fact, I think they should be more highlighted in the paper! It would also be interesting to see if they generalize for En-Ja. Can you explain the reasoning for using 9 professional translators for En-De instead of using fewer and evaluate En-Ja as well?
- What happens if you decode with reranking techniques (QE/MBR) using a model trained with your method, instead of using beam/greedy search? Even though this would make the method very inefficient at inference time, it would be interesting to see if it further boosts the performance.
- According to Table 3, both beam and greedy search work well. Does this mean that your method helps solve the beam search curse [4]? What happens when you increase the beam width?
