## Abstract
\vspace{-2mm}
Many recent prompting strategies for large language models (LLMs) query the model multiple times sequentially -- first to produce intermediate results and then the final answer. However, using these methods, both decoder and model are unaware of potential follow-up prompts, leading to disconnected and undesirably wordy intermediate responses.
In this work, we address this issue by proposing prompt sketching, a new prompting paradigm in which an LLM does not only respond by completing a prompt, but by predicting values for multiple variables in a template. This way, sketching grants users more control over the generation process, e.g., by providing a reasoning framework via intermediate instructions, leading to better overall results. The key idea enabling sketching with existing, autoregressive models is to adapt the decoding procedure to also score follow-up instructions during text generation, thus optimizing overall template likelihood in inference.
Our experiments show that in a zero-shot setting, prompt sketching outperforms existing, sequential prompting schemes such as direct asking or chain-of-thought on 7 out of 8 LLM benchmarking tasks, including state tracking, arithmetic reasoning, and general question answering. To facilitate future use, we release a number of generic, yet effective sketches applicable to many tasks, and an open source library called \lstinline|dclib|, powering our sketch-aware decoders.

### Summary
This paper proposes a new approach to decoding LLM outputs when chaining multiple LLM queries. Such chains of queries can be specified as *sketches*: natural-language prompts that contain *holes* that the LLM is meant to fill in. Each hole is associated with a stopping phrase, and a natural way to read the sketch is as specifying an interaction pattern, where we alternate between (1) deterministically extending an LLM's context window with the next (non-hole) chunk of the sketch, and (2) allowing the LLM to fill in the value of a hole by sampling tokens freely until it emits the stopping phrase for that hole. Because LLMs are autoregressive, this interaction pattern does not allow the LLM propose values for the holes in a way that is *aware* of future interactions in the sketch. To alleviate this problem somewhat, the paper presents two new decoding algorithms (variants of beam search) that optimize the joint log probability of the entire LLM context. On several benchmark tasks, the paper compares the zero-shot performance of LLMs with standard prompts + standard decoding algorithms, vs. with particular prompt sketches and the new proposed decoding algorithms.

### Strengths
* Prompt sketches are an intuitive format for specifying certain types of chained queries.

* The paper identifies a connection between decoding for these prompt sketches and constrained decoding, and points out (correctly) that standard beam search is insufficient for this task. The variants of beam search that the paper introduces are largely sensible, and overcome the key barriers to performing beam search in the multi-variable setting—namely, the fact that beams with the same number of tokens may be at different stages of the sketch, making their scores difficult to compare fairly.

* Results are reported both for open models and closed (OpenAI) models. Many souped-up decoding methods require information that is not available through the OpenAI APIs, and it's nice that the authors have shown that a version of their approach (at least for small beam sizes) *can* be implemented atop the user-facing API (at least for text-davinci-003).

### Weaknesses
 * I couldn't quite follow the motivation: what problem with existing decoding techniques is prompt sketching meant to address? Figure 1 comes closest to illustrating the problem, but it was not particularly compelling. (I am not sure which model was used to generate Figure 1, but I tried copying the prompt and constraint into text-davinci-003 and it had no trouble following the constraint.) To be sure, there are many sketches that I am sure GPT-3 would often fail to follow, even if the sketch were included in the prompt; you can encode arbitrarily difficult infilling problems into sketches. But the sketches presented in this paper are enforcing very simple formatting constraints on, e.g., the list of thoughts generated for a chain-of-thought prompt. What failure modes do you see when just explaining to the model that it should follow the desired format (e.g. by pasting the sketch into the context)? Do failures to follow the format cause failures in reasoning? How exactly do VAR and BEAM_VAR address these failures? (Can they really be doing much, at a beam size of only n=2?)


* The experiments provide somewhat weak evidence for the value of the new decoding methods. In different tasks, it often seems to be the case that *one* of the methods outperforms an argmax baseline, whereas the *other* method underperforms the baseline, and which method wins varies from task to task. Even when the new decoding methods provide a modest advantage over argmax decoding, it is not clear whether the advantage is worth the added computational cost (or dollar cost, for OpenAI models).


* I am not convinced the experimental setup is completely debugged. For example, in chain-of-thought for the "date understanding" task, a period is used as the stopping phrase for each thought. However, periods show up frequently in dates (e.g., "Sept. 1"), and this stopping-phrase is clearly causing the model to cut off thoughts early (page 21). Some experimental settings are also missing details; e.g., in the single-variable chain-of-thought prompts, it is unclear when the [COT] variable ends -- I did not see a stopping phrase reported.


* Some of the algorithmic choices in VAR / BEAM_VAR were not sufficiently justified, and struck me as slightly odd. For example, the VAR algorithm shrinks the n^2 generations for a variable back down to a beam width of n *before* adding the next deterministic chunk. But I thought a key point of these algorithms was to enable the next deterministic chunk to provide a "score" for the proposed variable values; wouldn't it make more sense to rank all n^2 variable proposals by how well they fit with the next deterministic chunk, scale back down to n, and then generate proposals for the next variable?

### Questions
I'd appreciate your thoughts on the questions raised in the "weaknesses" section. In particular, it would be great to better understand example failure modes of simpler methods (e.g., argmax decoding for few-shot chain-of-thought prompting) and how prompt sketching addresses / avoids these failures.

### Summary
This paper proposes templated prompt sketches for problems requiring structured generation from LLMs. Structurally constrained generation is an important but overlooked problem. The paper also proposes sketch-aware decoding that considers the structured variables in decoding, and releases the code as an open-source library.

### Strengths
The motivation is clear, and the proposed methods which performs beamsearch over the variables (to be generated) is reasonable. 

A thorough study of non-templated and stop-and-go method as well as the proposed method, using various decoding strategies, is provided.

The provided prompt sketches are useful for various tasks.

### Weaknesses
The experiments show that stop-and-go inference works well, and the proposed method does not significantly improve performance despite the additional overhead. Further, on many of the tasks simple autoregressive CoT seems sufficiently close in performance.

While the paper provides some additional applications for prompt sketches, the tasks and the performance on the tasks are not entirely convincing.

### Questions
1. How is the custom decoding applied when using OpenAI API?
2. I'm curious about the results if few-shot prompts are used.

### Summary
This paper proposes a novel prompting method (Prompt Sketching) which guides intermediate inference steps based on template. Prompt Sketching provides more control over generation and inference steps by putting deterministic chunks in decoding steps. In addition to the prompting strategy, authors suggests two variants of beam search (VAR, BEAMVAR) to adapt LLM to new decoding process. Experiments show its effectiveness in LLM reasoning tasks over CoT. Also, authors suggests types of task for which prompt sketching can be especially useful.

### Strengths
- Simple prompting strategy to improve LLM reasoning performance
- New applications are interesting and could be useful for launching practical AI services.
- Structured outputs induced by prompt sketching have potential to automate various tasks beyond suggested applications.
- The suggested method can reduce the number of model calls compared to stop-and-go and thus reduce the cost, which is practical.

### Weaknesses
 - Generating templates requires human intervention and may necessitate significant efforts until finding a template working well. Also, potentially, templates can overfit to evaluation datasets.
- It does not work well for small LMs.
- Evaluation results are given with limited amounts of data, which may harm the credibility of the results. Especially, confidence intervals in Table 6 look pretty large.
- Most of new applications look already doable by guidance-ai (https://github.com/guidance-ai/guidance ), which is cited in the paper. Also, naive stop-and-go is not compared in main results.

### Questions
- What’s the Sequential Prompting used in Table 3? CoTs or stop-and-go?
- Can templates be generated or suggested by LLM as well? I am also wondering if templates can be generated by retrieval.
- Is the suggested method applicable to programming tasks?
- Can Prompt sketching get help from demonstrations?

### Summary
This paper proposes prompt sketching, a method to first provide sketches to the language model, then ask the model to fill in certain variables. The authors did experiments on several reasoning tasks and some planning tasks (with state tracking), to show the proposed method outperform existing method like direct prompting and chain-of-thought prompting. The models used are InstructGPT-based (text-davinci-003) and Llama-2 Chat based.

### Strengths
- The motivation of this paper is great, and the sketching idea is highly interesting. Currently most language models do decoding in an auto-regressive fashion and might not adhere to certain constraints in the input. Sketching can definitely help models better plan and output responses better fit into user constraints.

- Some of the tasks explored are quite novel and interesting, like the interleaved reasoning tasks and the planning tasks (section 4.2), and the experiments do show they benefit from prompt sketching quite a bit.

### Weaknesses
The biggest concern is the experiments in this paper, which do not clearly show the benefits of the proposed method:

Most of the explored tasks, including logical reasoning, question answering, and arithmetic reasoning, use the *multi-variable* prompting method (BeamVar, Var) as the sketch (Figure 3), which is actually a variant of the self-consistency [1] method: sample multiple chain-of-thoughts and then aggregate. Hence a fair comparison should be between the proposed method and self-consistency-based chain-of-thought, under the exact same number of samples. 
- The novelty of the proposed method compare to self-consistency should be discussed in details in this paper. 
- Can the authors add self-consistency with the same number of samples as a baseline?
- Comparing chain-of-thought prompting under BeamVar and prompt-sketching under BeamVar (this should be a more fair comparison with the same number of sampled thoughts), the proposed method does not yield much gains. Hence the authors should better discuss what is the main contribution of "sketching" over existing chain-of-thought.

In section 4.2, some novel tasks are explored and could potentially show the benefits of the proposed sketching. However, the experiments are extremely small-scale (10 Sudoku puzzles, 10 Dungeon environments), so it is unclear whether the proposed method indeed outperform existing methods.

Performance gains: from Table 6, the confidence intervals are fairly large, and it is unclear which method is significantly better compared to the others. Can the authors clarify which result is statistically significant?

Computational cost: can the authors discuss in more details on the exact computational cost used for the proposed method?
