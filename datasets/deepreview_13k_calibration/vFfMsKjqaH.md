## Abstract
The theoretical advantages of distributional reinforcement learning~(RL) over expectation-based RL remain elusive, despite its remarkable empirical performance. Starting from Categorical Distributional RL~(CDRL), our work attributes the potential superiority of distributional RL to its \textit{risk-sensitive entropy regularization}. This regularization stems from the additional return distribution information regardless of only its expectation via the return density function decomposition, a variant of the gross error model in robust statistics. Compared with maximum RL that explicitly optimizes the policy to encourage the exploration, we reveal that the resulting risk-sensitive entropy regularization of CDRL plays a different role as an augmented reward function. It implicitly optimizes policies for a risk-sensitive exploration towards true target return distributions, which helps to reduce the intrinsic uncertainty of the environment. Finally, extensive experiments verify the importance of this risk-sensitive regularization in distributional RL, as well as the mutual impacts of both explicit and implicit entropy regularization.

### Summary
The paper establishes an equivalent representation of distributional RL (with a histogram representation of random variables) that seem to indicate that it takes the form of a regularized Q-iteration. This might also explain why categorical distributional RL might implicitly encourage exploration.

### Strengths
The paper investigates an important question: namely, how to explain the better performance of distributional RL algorithms. It articulates an innovative perspective on the question by decomposing the random variable representation as a mixture of a measure concentrated at the mean and a measure that embodies the spread.

### Weaknesses
The paper establishes an equivalent representation of distributional RL (with a histogram representation of random variables) that seem to indicate that it takes the form of a regularized Q-iteration. This might also explain why categorical distributional RL might implicitly encourage exploration.

 The paper is highly obscure and filled with ambiguous statements and typos that prevented me from validating most of its claims. It also appear to support its theory using arguments that lack rigour or purely contradictory. I finally disagree with the claim on page 4 that distributional RL produces risk sensitive policies:

Examples of lack of rigour:
- the use of the concept of "ideal case" mentioned at the bottom of page 2 to support the idea that Neural FQI converges to optimal Q-function, which is reused in the proof of proposition 3 to assume that neural FZI's iterate recover the Bellman update. 
- a mismatch of assumption between the statement of proposition 3 and its proof, where the former assumes that the $Y_i$'s are representable while the latter assumes that $E[Y_i]$ is.

Example of contradiction:
Proposition 3 is contradicting itself in equation (6). The left equation claims that the minimizer over $q_\theta$ converges to the k+1 iterate of the Q function in FQI while on the right claiming that it converges to the actual Q-value function.

Typos & inclarities include:
- p2: defining the support of \hat \eta first as $z_i$ then later by $l_i$
- Eq 1: $[y_i - Q_\theta(s_i,a_i)]^2$ instead of $[y_i - Q_\theta^k(s_i,a_i)]^2$
- Eq. 2: similar issue but for $Z_\theta^k(s_i,a_i)$
- p.3 "As such, this ... shifting problems" needs rewritting
- p.3 "the the"
- p.4 I suspect that in proposition 2 $\Delta_E^i$ represents the interval that $E[ R(s,a) + \gamma Z_k^\pi(s_i',\pi_Z(s_i') ]$ and that generally there is a confusion between this expression and $E[Z^\pi(s,a)]$. 
- p.2  why define $R(s,a)$ with capital when it is a deterministic reward? 
- p.3 in an expression like $Y_i = R(s_i,a_i)+\gamma Z_{\theta^*}^k(s_i',\pi_Z(s_i'))$ there needs to be a notation warning that lower cases variables are given.
- p4 the definition of $\hat \mu$ in proposition 2 is inaccurate as it seems to be the induced histogram from the decomposition of $Y_i$
- p4 "for $\forall$ k" should be "for all k"

### Questions
I do not have questions as I believe the paper needs a thorough rewriting and is currently unfit for publication.

### Summary
In this work, the authors take a closer look at the categorical
distributional RL framework and study the properties of the
optimization problems therein. Inspired by their analysis, the paper
presents a novel framework (DERPI) for model-free RL similar to MaxEnt
RL, and an associatedc
actor-critic algorithm (DERAC) based on this framework. Optimization
in the DERPI framework is shown to be closely related to categorical
distributional RL, thereby establishing a connection between
categorical disatributional RL and MaxEnt RL.

### Strengths
This paper presents some interesting insights into the optimization of
return distributions in categorical distributional RL, and inspired by
these insights, proposes a new framework for exploration in RL. The
new framework is closely related to the highly successful MaxEnt RL,
but it performs reward shaping based on the mismatch between the
predicted return distribution and its target, which I believe is novel
and sensible. This framework also explicitly leverages the "auxiliary
tasks" quality of distributional RL for exploration, which is satisfying.

### Weaknesses
Many of the mathematical statements and objects are not defined
precisely -- this is a recurring issue throughout the text, making it
extremely difficult to follow. Please see the "Questions" section for
further details.

The histogram parameterization given in equation (3) needs more
clarification. Some terms are left undefined (e.g. $p_i^\mu$), making
it difficult to understand the model and the motivation.

As discussed more in "Questions", the return distribution
decomposition is fairly mysterious to me. It seems that the purpose is
to show that some component of CDRL is sort of 'mimicking' expected
value RL. However, this is already known, since it is known that the
categorical projection $\Pi_{\mathcal{C}}$ is mean-preserving. Thus,
I do not undertand the value of Proposition 3: we already know that
CDRL will learn the mean of the return distribution function.

Generally, I do not agree that the proposed algorithms are
risk-sensitive in any meaningful sense -- they simply have an
additional distribution-matching term in the reward signal. The
risk-seeking/risk-averse behavior is driven by a mismatch in return
distribution estimates and not a specified propensity for risk
(i.e. there is no way to control or predict how risk-averse the agent
will be). Furthermore, the authors claim this approach reduces intrinsic uncertainty, but the return distribution models aleatoric uncertainty, so it's not clear that the proposed "risk-sensitive regularization" should have this effect.

The connection between DERPI and CDRL is not established clearly at
all, which is a shame, since I believe this is the most significant
finding. Particularly, I belive the content of Appendix I, notably
equation (37), should be clearly written in the main text and
discussed. As it stands, this part is easy to miss, and I believe it
is crucial for tying together the claims of the paper.



### Questions
In the "Bellman Operators vs Distributional Bellman Operators"
section, it says tha random variable definition of the distributional
Bellman operator is less mathematically rigorous than the
return-distribution definition -- what do you mean by this? Both
definitions should be equivalent.

I doubt Theorem 1 is novel, it is essentially a concentration
inequality on histogram estimates. It is also not clear to me what is
meant by $O_P$ here. What is the difference between Theorem 1 and
e.g. the DKW inequality?

The object $\widehat{\mu}^{s,a}$ is not defined clearly at all.
Particularly, $p_i^\mu$ is not defined anywhere.
Is $\widehat{\mu}^{s,a}$ just the difference between the "true"
histogram of the return distribution function and the histogram with
all mass (times $1-\epsilon$) in $\Delta_E$?

Right after Proposition 1, what does "this decomposition exactly keeps
the vanilla (categorical) distributional RL scenario without shifting
problems" mean? What are shifting problems?

I don't agree that the second term of equation (5) is doing
"risk-sensitive entropy regularization". It is neither risk-seeking
nor risk-neutral (at least, not intuitively). Moreover, I wouldn't
classify this as a regularization term -- it is directly learning the
parameters of the model -- the only "regularization" here is the
explicit constraint of modeling categorical distributions. But
regardless of the parameterization of the return distribution
function, you can decompose the return distributions into a term
encapsulating the mean and the other encapsulating the rest of the
statistics. Is the idea that under the KL loss, the loss for the mean
component does not interact with the rest of the loss?


I don't understand the claim of equation (6). It says that with
probability 1, $Z_\theta^{k+1}=\mathcal{T}Q_{\theta^*}(s,a)$ -- how
can this be true? Isn't $Z$ supposed to represent the random return?
In this case, why should it be deterministic?

The proof of proposition 3 is sloppy. Firstly, equation (29) is incorrect -- the KL is not
proportional to the last line, it is missing an additive
$\Delta\log\Delta$ term I believe (though this does not change the
minimizer).
More importantly, the claim that the limiting optimizer as $\Delta\to
0$ is not proved correctly -- you proved that the limit of the
minimizer tends to the Dirac, but not that the minimizer of the limit
tends to the Dirac, as claimed. However, again I am not really
concerned about the correctness of the claim here.
Equation (30) is not justified to me at all -- the target should still
include the $\mu$ term, which seems to have disappeared. I believe the
confusion is coming from misleading notation. To my understanding, the
claim of Proposition 3 is that this is the behavior if you optimize
the random returns only w.r.t. term (a), but then that is not really
$Z$. So really, what this proposition is saying is that if the targets are
deterministic, they are at the expected return and CDRL will converge
to the Diracs at the expected return, but we already know this from
e.g. "An Analysis of Categorical Distributional Reinforcement
Learning" by Rowland et. al.

### Summary
This paper studies why distributional reinforcement learning (RL) can achieve successful empirical results. They mainly investigate the Categorical Distributional RL (CDRL) and indicate its strength comes from risk-sensitive entropy regularization. They showed that this regularization serves as an augmented reward function, pushing the learned distribution toward the target one. Experiments highlight this regularization's importance in distributional RL.

### Strengths
This paper studies an important question (why distributional RL is successful), and the way that they consider the distributional RL (or specifically, the categorical RL) is interesting. The theoretical claims are supported by the experiments.

### Weaknesses
The paper is a bit hard to follow. Some of the theoretical derivation is not followed by intuitive explanation or proof sketch. For example, eq. (3) and the subsequent remarks confused me regarding what $\hat\mu$ and $p_i^\mu$ are. Does $p_i^\mu$ mean the coefficient of the corresponding bin? I also don't see what $\mu^{s,a}$ is two lines below. Moreover, I failed to understand eq. (6) and what Proposition 3 tries to convey, specifically regarding the integral on the right. Additionally, Theorem 2 asserts the convergence of the learned policy, yet it does not specify under what notion it converges, that is, it lacks clarity on the measure under which it converges.

I found most theoretical results rely on the assumption that $\mathcal{H}(\mu^{s,a},q_\theta^{s,a})$ is bounded by a constant for all $s,a$, which I think needs to be justified. I guess $\mu$ is the resulting histogram density, so the difference here might depend on the range of support and $N$, and thus the upper bound might actually look like the results in [1].

Overall, I think this paper may need some necessary polish to improve clarity before I can make an informed evaluation.

### Questions
The formulation of neural FZI is similar to [2]. The latter focuses on maximizing the log-likelihood, which is equivalent to minimizing the KL divergence or cross-entropy. The authors also proposed to specify the $d_p$ in eq.(2) to KL divergence, so the formulation looks almost same. Hence, I am wondering about the potential connection here.

### Summary
The paper proposes a novel interpretation of the distributional Bellman operator based on entropy entropy regularization. Specifically, it represents the continuous return distribution by a histogram of fixed support with equal bin size. Then the return distribution can be decomposed into a single-bin histogram (i.e. the bin the expectation of the return distribution falls into) and a term characterizing the impact of the return distribution despite its expectation. The relative weights between the two terms are regulated by a pre-defined hyperparameter. The authors then move on to show that this decomposition of the return distribution allows the distributional Bellman operation (which they call Neural Fitted Z-Iteration) to be reframed as a cross entropy-regularized Neural FQI when the distribution divergence to minimize is chosen as the KL divergence. They've demonstrated convergence of the decomposed distributional Bellman operator when minimizing the KL divergence as a consequence of the equivalence between optimizing histogram function and categorical distribution. Finally they proposed a new actor-critic algorithm incorporating the cross-entropy regularization. Experiments on Atari and Mujoco demonstrated better overall performance and analyzed the interplay between two types of entropy regularization.

### Strengths
1. proposed and analyzed a novel angle to distributional RL
2. thorough experiments

### Weaknesses
1. I'm not so sure how enlighening the findings of the paper are. When you choose the KL divergence to minimize, equivalently you're maximizing cross-entropy. It doesn't come off as much of added value if you've shown the distributional Bellman operator minimizing KL is equivalent to a cross entropy regularized conventional Bellman operator when you approximate (I wouldn't say decompose, as the epsilon term renders your decomposition not exact) the return distribution as an expectation term and a categorical distribution. The core issue is that the paper's 'decomposition' of the return distribution is not a true decomposition but rather an approximation controlled by a hyperparameter epsilon, which determines the weighting between the expectation and a dispersion term. This approximation, while potentially useful, does not fundamentally alter the nature of the learning process when using KL divergence, which is inherently linked to cross-entropy maximization. The paper essentially rephrases a known optimization objective in a slightly different form, without providing a significantly new perspective or insight into distributional RL.

2. (minor) insufficient rigourousness in basic concepts, e.g., in Introduction, Q-learning is a type of TD learning not a separate category. Also TD learning is not specific to expectation-based RL, most existing distributional RL including the referenced CDRL is TD learning (i.e. bootstrapping from other timesteps) w.r.t. return distributions. And CDRL doesn't seem an actor-critic to me as the policy is just argmax of expected atom values.

### Questions
1. how the epsilon in Eq. 3 is pre-specified? Should it not be dependent on the actual return distribution which cannot be known in advance? Am I correct in the understanding that you are actually not learning the full return distribution, but still its expectation albeit allowing some uncertainty around it?

2. if so, it seems to me you're matching the expaction whilst expanding it according to a pre-defined level of uncertainty retained from the target distribution. In this case, how would you ensure that the so expanded distribution still has the same expectation/the correct expectation?

3. if you are minimizing KL divergence, how would you ensure the return distribution model is and remains as a histogram which is count-based?

4. in Eq. 5, you're regularzing the cross-entropy between consecutive 'return distributions'. How is it connected to maximum-entropy RL which encourages 'policy' entropy or cross-entropy between the policy and a reference policy? There seems no bridge to me to be built between uncertainty in action selection and that in return estimate, the only connection perhaps being both can be approached by augmenting the reward function with the entropy term. In fact, I failed to understand the claim that your regularization is favouring target return distributions with large dispersion. It seems to me only to push the dispersion of the return distribution model to catch up with the dispersion of the target return distribution.

5. (minor) how and why a policy can be learned to reduce the intrinsic uncertainty of the environment, shouldn't it by definition be intrinsic and thus independent from the policy?
