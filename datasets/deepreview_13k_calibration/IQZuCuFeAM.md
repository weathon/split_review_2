## Abstract
Federated learning (FL) offers the ability to train models using decentralized data at client sites, ensuring data privacy by eliminating the need for data centralization. A predominant challenge with FL is the constrained computation and narrow communication bandwidth, particularly evident in resource-restricted edge client nodes. Various solutions, such as transmitting sparse models and iterative pruning have been suggested to tackle this. However, many existing methods necessitate the transmission of full model weights throughout the training, rely heavily on arbitrary or random pruning criteria or costly iterative pruning schedules. 

In this work, we propose SSFL, a streamlined approach for sparse decentralized FL training and communication. SSFL identifies a subnetwork prior to training, leveraging parameter saliency scores keeping in mind the distribution of local client data in non-IID scenarios. Distinctively, only the sparse model weights are communicated in each round between client models in a decentralized manner, sidestepping the conventional need of transferring the complete dense model at any phase of training. We validate SSFL's effectiveness using standard non-IID benchmarks, noting marked improvements in the sparsity-accuracy trade-offs. Finally, we deploy our method in a real-world federated learning framework and report improvement in communication time.

### Confidence
5: You are absolutely certain about your assessment. You are very familiar with the related work and checked the math/other details carefully.

### Summary
The paper proposes a new communication-efficient federated learning (FL) framework, SSFL, that initially finds a binary sparsity mask by using the non-iid dataset across clients and then trains a sparse network extracted by this mask during the FL stage. This reduces the communication cost in the FL stage as each client trains and communications a sparse model at every round.

### Strengths
The proposed method is intuitive, easy to grasp, and the paper is well-written. The empirical results suggests an improvement over the selected baselines.

### Weaknesses
 - While the proposed method, SSFL, outperforms the selected baselines, overall the performance degrades considerably even for 50% sparsity. For standard gradient sparsification methods such as Top-k[1], Random-k[2], or rTop-k[3], there is no significant performance loss up to 90% sparsity with error feedback. I wonder if the authors have any explanation as to why SSFL and the selected baselines degrade the accuracy even with small sparsity ratios like 50%. Is this because only a fixed sparse portion of the model is trained while the rest is kept at zero? If so, would it be possible to let each client find their own mask rather than aggregating them to have one global mask for all the clients. This way, different portions of the model could be trained by different clients at the cost of losing the communication gain from server to client communication -- which is typically not the main bottleneck compared to client to server communication especially given that the current approach results in considerable accuracy loss. 

- I also think comparing SSFL to these alternative sparse methods (Top-k[1], Random-k[2], or rTop-k[3]) would provide a more complete picture to the readers. Also, other methods for finding optimal global sparsity masks should be added as baselines as well such as FedPM [4].

### Summary
In this work, the authors suggest a novel federated learning paradigm that trains a sparse model while maintaining robust performance. This paradigm can be used to improve bandwidth during decentralized federated training and reduce communication costs. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach by testing it on multiple datasets (TinyImageNet, Cifar 10, Cifar 100) on various models. The suggested approach surpasses other benchmarks in most of the experiments.

### Strengths
I really liked the presentation of this paper, I am not familiar with federated learning but it was easy for me to understand the federated learning and the suggested paradigm. Also, the suggested approach is novel.

### Weaknesses
As I mentioned before, this novel approach raises two concerns:

1) While the approach is indeed innovative, it appears to be overly simplistic. The core mechanism of applying a mask based on gradient magnitude, while intuitive, lacks a sophisticated exploration of the underlying parameter space. It's unclear if this method effectively captures the complex interdependencies between parameters, or if it simply identifies the most active neurons without considering their importance for generalization. The method appears to rely heavily on the initial random mask, which could lead to inconsistent performance across different runs, and it doesn't seem to incorporate any adaptive mechanisms to refine the mask during training based on the specific characteristics of the data or the model's learning trajectory.
2) The experimental results are promising, but there is potential for improvement, particularly when tested on alternative models and datasets. While the authors demonstrate results on TinyImageNet, Cifar 10, and Cifar 100, the range of models tested is somewhat limited. The method's performance on more complex architectures, such as transformers or very deep convolutional networks, remains unexplored. Additionally, the datasets used, while standard, might not fully capture the challenges of real-world federated learning scenarios, which often involve highly imbalanced and heterogeneous data distributions. Further experiments are needed to assess the robustness of the method in more challenging settings.

### Questions
1) Can this approach be applied to Large Language Models (LLMs)? If so, incorporating empirical results would significantly enhance the paper.
2) Is your proposed method connected to the concept of core sets?
----------------------------------
The authors clearly addressed my concerns. Hence, I am raising my score to Accept.

### Summary
This paper explores how to settle limited computation and communication resources in federated learning. It thereby proposes SSFL, an approach to identify a subnetwork before the model training. Specifically, the parameters in the subnetwork are the largest $k$ values of saliency scores calculated by the absolute element-wise product of the weights and the gradients. The experiments validate the proposed SSFL can reduce the communication overhead as well as improve the model performance when compared to the existing works.

### Strengths
1. This paper introduces a simple and efficient approach to subnetwork extraction. 
2. This paper comprehensively reviews the relative works.

### Weaknesses
1. The contribution of this paper is trivial. Although the proposed method seems efficient because the mask is found in the beginning, I don't think the proposed approach makes sense. Before the model training, the parameters $w_0$ are generated at random. Denote the gradient by $g_0$ for the initial model. Intuitively, when the model converges, the important parameters are with relatively large values, while the ignorable ones are close to 0. As the mask is merely generated in the beginning, I cannot see why Eq. (3) can find a reasonable mask. In other words, I cannot see the differences when the mask is generated arbitrarily. 
2. In addition to the mask initialization, the rest of the design is consistent with FedAvg. Following the first point, I cannot see the significance of this work. 
3. The authors mention the work based on decentralized FL. After reading the paper, I don't have an idea why it can work under peer-to-peer network architecture. Instead, it is solely workable with the client-server settings. 
4. The experiments only show the result on a sparsity level of 50\%, which is not convincing. I would like to see the performance results when the sparsity level is at 10\% or smaller. According to Figure 4, I notice DisPFL and Ditto are yet to converge. I wonder about their final results when they converge.

### Questions
Please address my concerns listed in the weaknesses. In addition, I suggest the authors conduct an empirical study to show the performance differences when the mask is randomly drawn in the beginning.
