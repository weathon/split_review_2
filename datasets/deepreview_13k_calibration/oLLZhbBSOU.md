## Abstract
Although reinforcement learning methods offer a powerful framework for automatic skill acquisition, for practical learning-based control problems in domains such as robotics, imitation learning often provides a more convenient and accessible alternative. In particular, an interactive imitation learning method such as DAgger, which queries a near-optimal expert to intervene online to collect correction data for addressing the distributional shift challenges that afflict na\"{i}ve behavioral cloning, can enjoy good performance both in theory and practice without requiring manually specified reward functions and other components of full reinforcement learning methods. 
In this paper, we explore how off-policy reinforcement learning can enable improved performance under assumptions that are similar but potentially even more practical than those of interactive imitation learning. 
Our proposed method uses reinforcement learning with user intervention signals \emph{themselves} as rewards.
This relaxes the assumption that intervening experts in interactive imitation learning should be near-optimal and enables the algorithm to learn behaviors that improve over the potential suboptimal human expert.
We also provide a unified framework to analyze our RL method and DAgger; for which we present the asymptotic analysis of the suboptimal gap for both methods as well as the non-asymptotic sample complexity bound of our method.
We then evaluate our method on challenging high-dimensional continuous control simulation benchmarks as well as real-world robotic vision-based manipulation tasks. 
The results show that it strongly outperforms DAgger-like approaches across the different tasks, especially when the intervening experts are suboptimal. Additional ablations also empirically verify the proposed theoretical justification that the performance of our method is associated with the choice of intervention model and suboptimality of the expert.

### Summary
This paper tackles how to enable sub-optimal human interventions (sub-expert samples) to improve a RL agent. It falls in two sub-domains in the field: interactive imitation learning, and reinforcement learning from human feedback. 

The authors explore the assumption that the decision to intervene provides an effective supervision signal. Accordingly, a solution based on augmentation the reward with intervention penalty, and off-policy learning is used to minimize such a penalty (maximize the accumulative negative reward), so that the RL agent achieve 3X performance gain compared to DAgger, and BC (bahevior cloning) baselines. Ablation studies on sub-optimality of expert samples are also provided.

### Strengths
Novelty:
========
The assumption of “when an sub-optimal expert to intervene” provides useful learning signals is novel to me.

Soundness:
========
Accordingly, the authors provide both empirical results in simulation and real-world robotic task, and theoretical justifications by proposing a probabilistic model of “when human expert will intervene”.

### Weaknesses
 - Though the theoretical analysis does not answer the key problem, how the level of sub-optimality results in what sample complexity of the offline RL agent. The reviewer still enjoys reading the analysis framework proposed here. The reviewer may miss some key contents, but would the authors explain more in the proposed Corollary 6.7 regarding the above key problem?
- Baselines:
There is no offline-RL baselines provided. Is it because that the true reward function is unknown in the evaluation results? Otherwise, please add at least 1 offlineRL baseline in all the simulation based experiments.

### Questions
Please check the two questions the reviewer proposed in the Weakness part.

### Summary
This paper introduces a novel off-policy RL method that uses user intervention signals as rewards, allowing learning beyond the limitations of potentially suboptimal human experts. This approach is less reliant on near-optimal expert input compared to DAgger. The authors provide a unified analytical framework for their method and DAgger, including asymptotic and non-asymptotic evaluations. They validate their method with high-dimensional simulations and real-world robotic tasks, showing its practical effectiveness in surpassing traditional imitation learning methods in complex control scenarios.

### Strengths
(1) The motivation behind this paper is natural and valuable.

(2) The theoretical analysis is sufficient.

(3) The authors conduct some experiments on real robot arms, which proves the effectiveness of the algorithm.

### Weaknesses
 (1) The author should include more baselines in Table 1, where the mentioned methods only contain DAgger. For example, some IRL methods could also be applied in the same settings. Specifically, methods like GAIL or AIRL, which learn a reward function from expert demonstrations, could be adapted to use the intervention signals as a form of weak supervision, and would provide a more comprehensive comparison. The current comparison only against DAgger and its variants is not sufficient to demonstrate the advantages of the proposed method.

(2) Does this method require high frequencies to intervene? Can you do some ablations for this? If RLIF cannot work under high frequent intervenes, it can be hard to apply in more complicated real-world scenarios. It's unclear how the performance of RLIF degrades with reduced intervention frequency, and whether there's a critical threshold for effective learning. The practical applicability of the method hinges on understanding this relationship, especially in scenarios where continuous human intervention is not feasible or desirable.

### Questions
I am wondering what the difference is between RLHF and your work RLIF when you choose the Space Mouse to give signals by hand. No related works are mentioned and no experiments are conducted for this. For example, what about using some foundation models to give signals?

### Summary
The paper tackles the problem of learning from suboptimal experts in interactive settings. It proposes to add a negative reward term in reinforcement learning whenever an expert requires being invoked in a RL DAgger setup, and it shows performance gains with different expert accuracy levels compared to supervised learning baselines.

### Strengths
- I appreciate the effort to bring the model to a real-world setting.

Edit:
- The paper has a through theoretical justification and a sensible set of simulated baselines, showing the power of the proposed method.

### Weaknesses
 - The paper only compares with DAgger in supervised learning setups, even though DAgger is often used in RL and should have been included as a baseline in such configuration.
- The proposed technique seems to reduce to a heuristic to define a reward function.

Edit:
- After a very thorough set of responses from the authors, I admit I misinterpreted the actual scope of the paper, so these weaknesses are actually obsolete.

### Questions
- What is the advantage of the proposed paper versus using DAgger in RL?

### Summary
This paper provides a methodology for learning a policy given human intervention. Unlike other imitation learning frameworks such as Dagger, the method does not directly clone the actions taken by the expert, but rather uses the expert’s decision to intervene as a negative reward signal. The paper claims that by doing so, the learned policy has the potential to exceed the performance of a suboptimal expert, and does not need to assume the expert is optimal. The method is demonstrated experimentally in simulation to outperform imitation learning baselines, and is demonstrated to work in a real world experiment. Theoretical analysis is provided to justify the method.

### Strengths
The key strengths of the paper are as follows:
- The method is simple and easy to implement, thereby making it useful.
- The method does not require access to a task reward signal and makes only the benign assumption that an expert would intervene if the policy were performing badly. This is realistic and gives the method a broad scope.
- The paper includes a thorough justification of the method, which with some additional clarifications could be compelling (see the questions I have).

### Weaknesses
The main weakness of this paper is that I am suspicious of the results due to some confusion. Please answer the questions below, and I would be happy to revise my rating upward if they are satisfactory. [Edit: updated rating since questions were addressed]

Aside from the questions, below are a few recommendations for clarity improvement and a few grammatical errors caught.

Clarity recommendations:
- In the intro, add a more intuitive explanation for how RLIF is able to exceed the expert’s performance without access to a task reward signal.
- In the intro, you describe the theoretical analysis performed, but don't state the bottom line. What does the analysis tell us? 

Grammar:
- “…for selecting when to intervene lead to good performance…”
- “We leave the of DAgger analysis under…”

### questions:
 - If the expert intervenes for 5 steps, would all 5 transitions be labeled -1? Wouldn’t this result in actions taken by the expert being labeled -1 too? 
- Could the else statement in line 7 of Algorithm 2 set the reward to the RL reward signal if it were available? 
- I’m very confused by this sentence: “the performance of DAgger-like algorithms will be subject to the suboptimality of the experts, while our method can reach good performance even with suboptimal experts by learning from the expert’s decision of when to intervene.“ If no task reward is provided, how could the policy end up outperforming the expert?
- How do you end up with a 110% expert if the expert level is w.r.t an expert trained to near optimality?
- It seems unfair that Dagger variants are given 100 episodes to learn from while RLIF gets 1 million. It is also unrealistic to expect that we could have 1 million episodes in any real-world setting. How would RLIF perform if also restricted to a more realistic 10-100 episodes?
- In experiments, do you warm start the dataset for RLIF? If so, with what reward? And does this pose an unfair advantage to your algorithm?
