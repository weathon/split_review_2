## Abstract
Large Language Models (LLMs) inherently encode a wealth of knowledge within their parameters through pre-training on extensive corpora. While prior research has delved into operations on these parameters to manipulate the underlying implicit knowledge — encompassing detection, editing, and merging — there remains an ambiguous understanding regarding their transferability across models with varying scales. In this paper, we seek to empirically investigate knowledge transfer from larger to smaller models through a parametric perspective. To achieve this, we employ sensitivity-based techniques to extract and align knowledge-specific parameters between different LLMs. Moreover, the LoRA module is used as the intermediary mechanism for injecting the extracted knowledge into smaller models. Evaluations across four benchmarks validate the efficacy of our proposed method. Our findings highlight the critical factors contributing to the process of parametric knowledge transfer, underscoring the transferability of model parameters across LLMs of different scales.

### Confidence
4: You are confident in your assessment, but not absolutely certain. It is unlikely, but not impossible, that you did not understand some parts of the submission or that you are unfamiliar with some pieces of related work.

### Summary
This paper proposes a method to transfer knowledge from big to small models by sharing the parameter. To be specific, it first detects and extracts a submatrix of parameters in large models, and the submatrix has the same size as the small model. Then, it decomposes the matrix into the Lora module and adds this module with the parameters of a small model. On Five datasets, this method brings about 2 points improvement compared to the original small model.

### Strengths
1. This paper proposes a novel method that transfers knowledge from large models to small models by sharing parameters.

### Weaknesses
1. The experiments are limited. This paper only tests on a few datasets for LLMs, does not discuss which amount of parameters is the best for transferring, and does not compare with other distillation methods, and does not compare with other methods about intrinsic dimension.

2. The application of this method is limited. The paper does not experiment on different models. Can the knowledge transfer across architectures with this method?  This paper also assumes that the small model is already fine pre-trained. Can we transfer to the random-initialized model?

### Questions
1. I would like to see results from llama2 70b to 7b.

2. In Formula 3, you use Taylor expansion to approximate the change of masking some parameters. But mask parameters are not trivial. Why can 1-order Taylor expansion approximate it?

---I have read the whole rebuttal and raise my score from 5 to 6.

### Summary
The authors propose to better understand knowledge transfer between LLMs by identifying/extracting/aligning knowledge-specific parameters between teacher/upstream and student/downstream LLMs.
Compared to offlne/online distillation methods which transfer knowledge via synthetic datasets / teacher model outputs (offline) or use teacher activations as a loss/regularizer for the student (online), the proposed parametric knowledge transfer method seeks to identify and re-scale task-specific parameters in the teacher model and inject them into the student model via LoRA.
The authors use the gradient of parameters with respect to the loss across a number of sampled instances as a parameter set sensitivity measure, and extract parameters via 1) identifying the top LAYERS by task sensitivity; 2) extracting student matrix-size submatrices from the top teacher layer matrices to transfer; and 3) decompose the extracted parameters and fine-tune the student model with LoRA initialized from the decomposition.
The authors demonstrate that their method out-performs vanilla LoRA and fine-tuning of smaller student models across a variety of reasoning tasks.

### Strengths
S1 - The paper targets an important fundamental question about how knowledge is stored/represented across language models (e.g. are representations aligned / similarly structured across different pre-training or architectural regimes).

S2 - The authors evaluate on a good variety of knowledge-rich tasks (reasoning, MMLU/professional QA, instruction tasks, and open dialog) to demonstrate significant improvements over vanilla LoRA and fine-tuning. It would be interesting to see a wider range of model sizes being compared or comparing models pre-trained on different corpora (e.g. LLaMA-1/2 cross-transfer, or something like GPT-J). 

S3 - There is a solid discussion of different factors that may affect parametric knowledge transfer here (layer selection, parameter location [ffn/self-attention], structure in transferred parameters, and number of seed samples)

### Weaknesses
W1 - The technical details (Section 3) are succintly written but could be written in a more clear and understandable way (e.g. summarize how standard LoRA is modified in knowledge injection). Certain details are explained in a more accessible manner in e.g. 4.3 but should be present in the main technical spec.

W2 - The diagrams can be more clearly framed with larger font and clear colors. In particular, the legend for Figure 3 is very difficult to read.

W3 - In 4.3, it seems that random submatrix initialization from the 30B model is copmarable to sensitivity-extracted submatrices from the 13B model. This merits further discussion about what the trade-offs are between just using random sub-matrices from larger models vs. the sensitivity method.

### Questions
Q1 - Can the authors provide more detail about 3.2 - how exactly the submatrix (with highest cumulative sensitivity) is extracted from the larger-parameter teacher model layer to create a mapping matrix in the student model's parameter set? And why in particular extracting a submatrix (with arbitrary possible location in the larger 2D teacher layer matrix) works?

### Summary
Large Language Models (LLMs) inherently encapsulate a vast reservoir of knowledge within their parameters, acquired through pre-training on extensive textual data. The authors investigate the possibility of transferring parametric knowledge across Large Language Models (LLMs) of different sizes. They introduce a novel approach, examining knowledge transfer from a unique parametric angle. Employing a two-stage framework involving knowledge extraction and injection, they conduct thorough experiments on four varied benchmarks, confirming the natural transferability of model parameters. Additionally, through detailed analysis of the pivotal factors impacting parametric knowledge transfer, they provide valuable insights for future research in this field.

### Strengths
The transferability of parametric knowledge is an important and timely topic that this paper addresses. Filling this gap is crucial in understanding the broader applicability and potential democratization of cutting-edge machine learning capabilities.

The paper introduces a novel parametric knowledge transfer paradigm. It moves beyond traditional methods like online and offline distillation and presents a unique approach focused on selecting specific static parameters from teacher models and injecting them into student models.

The experiments are conducted across various benchmark categories and LLM sizes. The results consistently demonstrate improvements in student performance after transferring teacher model parameters, providing strong empirical support for the proposed method.

The paper provides in-depth analysis of crucial factors such as teacher scales, initialization strategies, number of seed samples, and the nature of extracted parameters. This enriches the understanding of parametric knowledge transfer and its underlying dynamics.

The paper is clear and concise in writing.

### Weaknesses
How does your method compare with the existing distillation and pruning methods? It would have been great to see some other methods applied for comparison.

### Questions
Given the rapid evolution of LLMs, do you foresee the long-term viability and adaptability of the proposed knowledge transfer approach?
