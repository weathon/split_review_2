## Abstract
Human motion stylization aims to revise the style of an input motion while keeping its content unaltered. Unlike existing works that operate directly in pose space, we leverage the \textit{latent space} of pretrained autoencoders as a more expressive and robust representation for motion extraction and infusion. Building upon this, we present a novel \textit{generative} model that produces diverse stylization results of a single motion (latent) code. During training, a motion code is decomposed into two coding components: a deterministic content code, and a probabilistic style code adhering to a prior distribution; then a generator massages the random combination of content and style codes to reconstruct the corresponding motion codes. Our approach is versatile, allowing the learning of probabilistic style space from either style labeled or unlabeled motions, providing notable flexibility in stylization as well. In inference, users can opt to stylize a motion using style cues from a reference motion or a label. Even in the absence of explicit style input, our model facilitates novel re-stylization by sampling from the unconditional style prior distribution. Experimental results show that our proposed stylization models, despite their lightweight design, outperform the state-of-the-arts in style reeanactment, content preservation, and generalization across various applications and settings.

### Confidence
4: You are confident in your assessment, but not absolutely certain. It is unlikely, but not impossible, that you did not understand some parts of the submission or that you are unfamiliar with some pieces of related work.

### Summary
This paper introduces an innovative framework for human motion stylization. The method breaks down the motion latent code into a content code and a style code. It leverages AdaIN to infuse style information into the semantic content, dictated by the content code. Furthermore, the authors introduce a new learning approach that encompasses reconstruction, cycle consistency, and homostyle alignment.

### Strengths
1. The paper demonstrates impressive quantitative and qualitative results, establishing a new state-of-the-art with a substantial margin.

2. The proposed framework is novel. The associated conclusions and experiments make significant contributions to the research community.

3. The paper is well-written, ensuring that its content is easily understandable for readers.

### Weaknesses
My main concern primarily revolves around the selection between probabilistic and deterministic methods when extracting the content code and style code. The authors should incorporate further discussion and analysis in the following areas:

1. The authors should provide more intuitive explanations for why deterministic encoding is used for the content code while probabilistic encoding is used for the style code.

2. The authors need to conduct an ablation study to validate their conclusions regarding this design aspect.

### Summary
The paper presents a new human motion stylization method based on a latent editing approach. The approach is based on a latent motion space which can differentiate the content and style of the motion. Based on the label or prior information of the style, the proposed approach can generate stylized motion results. The proposed approach is validated on several motion benchmarks like Aberman and CMU Mocap. Also, an user study is reported to further validate the performance of the approach.

### Strengths
1. The idea of generate stylized motion sequence is interesting and helpful in many industry applications. 
2. The proposed approach is well validated in several motion benchmark quantitatively. Also, a user study is provided to further validated the performance of the approach.

### Weaknesses
1. How to differentiate between the content and style of motion is not a trivial work. Usually, these two content is interleaved. The proposed approach seems to implicitly to decouple these two factors. Is it possible to provide a validation of the proposed approach can decouple these two content?

2. For the experiments, the metrics may not well validate the performance of the proposed approach. For example, the style accuracy is based on a style classifier, which may be very accurate to capture the styleness of the proposed algorithm. Also, for case with a styled motion input, the transfer result based on the stylized input may not be easily verified.

3. In the attribute edting literature, scholars are actively involved in the style edting, for example, to interpolate two style codes. Is it possible to generalize the generative ability of the proposed approach for more editing operation based on the latent space.

4. How about the performance of the proposed approach on the long motion sequence? Is it possible to maintain the style for the whole motion sequence rather than a short period.

Please well address the questions in the weakness section.

### Summary
The authors propose a generative method for motion generation. The key idea is using the motion latent code as a compact and expressive representation. The motion code is enforced to decompose into a deterministic content code and a probabilistic style code. The style code is expressed in a certain formula of distribution. And the generation is performed by an auto-encoder. The method can generate stylized motion in different schemes: unconditional or conditional to certain style label or exemplar motion. Also, the benchmarking results also suggest the good effectiveness and the time efficiency of the proposed method.

### Strengths
- The proposed method can support two modes of motion generation: conditional to label of style and the by sampling from the prior distribution. This enables a diverse potential downstream applications.
- The latent code of motion is shorter than the motion itself, making the leveraging of motion descriptor in the neural network more efficient.
- The stylization and the content information can be disentangled from the input motion code, supporting versatile application of motion generation.
- I find the idea of using three groups of input is interesting that requires no additional style label but can encourage disentanglement. Also, the cycle-consistency idea is also interesting.

### Weaknesses
 - Probably not a “weakness”, but this is a unconvincing design to me that a small 1D convolutional network can predict the global motion (say root position) from local joint motion. I would ask for more details and evidence to support this design. The results shown in Table 7 only suggest relatively marginal influence, especially in the supervised settings. Is it possible to also have more results on other datasets?
- Given multiple components and modules are proposed to construct the proposed method, a complete ablation study is expected to validate their effectiveness. The ablation of loss weights shown in Table 6 is probably not enough to convince readers that all proposed components are contributing to the final improvement of the observed benchmarking results.
- Question: The results are focused on motion generation in the skeleton representations. Can the authors also propose some visualization with SMPL LBS? With the mesh, sometimes it can be more intuitive to estimate the plausibility of the joint angles.

### Summary
This paper tackles the problem of stylizing 3D human motions. To this end, the authors first train an autoencoder to bring the motion sequence into latent space and propose to decouple the style and content of the motion in latent space. Specifically, the latent code is mapped to content code and style space via two encoders and then mapped back to the original latent space via a generator equiped with adaptive instance normalization (controled by the style code).  During training, several losses are applied to ensure the disentanglement between the content and style including  the Homo-style Alignment loss, swap and cycle reconstruction loss.

### Strengths
- The presentation is clear and easy to follow.
- The overall pipeline is sound and the authors provide comprehensive experimental analysis on the performance of the proposed method.

### Weaknesses
 - In terms of the pipeline itself, there are not much novelties. Every component in the pipeline is straightforward and proposed by previous methods for example the adaptive instance normalization, the cycle consistent reconstuction. Although the proposed homo-style alignment loss is new, it is quite simple.
- More details about the "Ours w/o latent" model is needed.
- It seems all the inline references used in the paper are not in parenthesis. I believe the authors miss used \citet when there should be \citep.

### Questions
- It seems the whole model can be trained end-to-end. Why the motion autoencoder is pretrained? What will happend when every components are trained end-to-end?
