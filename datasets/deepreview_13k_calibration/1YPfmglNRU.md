## Abstract
\vspace{-6pt}
    \justify{Decision-makers are often experts of their domain and take actions based on their domain knowledge. Doctors, for instance, may prescribe treatments by predicting the likely outcome of each available treatment. Actions of an expert thus naturally encode part of their domain knowledge, and can help make inferences within the same domain: Knowing doctors try to prescribe the best treatment for their patients, we can tell treatments prescribed more frequently are likely to be more effective. Yet in machine learning, the fact that most decision-makers are experts is often overlooked, and \textit{``expertise''} is seldom leveraged as an inductive bias. This is especially true for the literature on treatment effect estimation, where often the only assumption made about actions is that of overlap. In this paper, we argue that expertise---particularly the \textit{type of expertise} the decision-makers of a domain are likely to have---can be informative in designing and selecting methods for treatment effect estimation. We formally define two types of expertise, \textit{predictive} and \textit{prognostic}, and demonstrate empirically that: (i) the prominent type of expertise in a domain significantly influences the performance of different methods in treatment effect estimation, and (ii) it is possible to predict the type of expertise present in a dataset, which can provide a quantitative basis for model selection.}

### Summary
The paper discusses the notion that expert decision-makers can implicitly use their domain knowledge when choosing actions, like prescribing treatments. These actions, in turn, can reveal insights about the domain. For example, frequently prescribed treatments might be more effective. However, current machine learning methods may fail to capitalize on the concept of "expertise" as a guiding factor. Specifically, in the context of estimating treatment effects, the prevailing assumption is simply that treatments overlap without considering expert behavior. The paper proposes that recognizing two types of expertise: (1) predictive and (2) prognostic, possessed by decision-makers may enhance the methodology and selection of models for estimating treatment effects. The authors show that understanding the predominant expertise in a domain may significantly impact the performance of these models and that it is possible to identify the type of expertise in a dataset to inform model choice.

### Strengths
The paper presents the following advantages: 

Firstly, it effectively communicates its proposed concepts through relatable examples, such as those from the medical and teaching fields, introducing and distinguishing between predictive and prognostic expertise. 

Secondly, it addresses an intriguing problem that may often be overlooked in causal inference: the incorporation of domain knowledge. By shedding light on this issue, the paper emphasizes the importance of considering expert behavior in the analysis, which could lead to more accurate and informed causal inferences.

### Weaknesses
The paper proposed two novel concepts to define the expert knowledge: (1) Prognostic expertise: $\mathbb{E}^{\pi}_{prog} = 1 - \mathbb{H}[A^{\pi}|Y_0, Y_1] / \mathbb{H}[A^_{\pi}]$. (2) Predictive expertise: $\mathbb{E}^{\pi}_{pred} = 1 - \mathbb{H}[A^{\pi}|Y_1 - Y_0] / \mathbb{H}[A^_{\pi}]$. The rationale for selecting entropy over other statistical measures, such as the variance of actions, is not immediately clear. Can you elucidate the benefits of employing entropy in this context? What are the specific advantages of entropy in capturing the nuances of expert decision-making, and under what conditions does it outperform simpler measures like variance?

The consideration of domain expert knowledge in personalized decision-making problems is crucial but challenging, especially given that such expertise may not always be accurate or easily discernible in real data sets. How might one effectively balance the integration of domain knowledge with data-driven insights to mitigate the risk of relying on potentially inaccurate expertise? Is there a methodology within your framework that utilizes data-driven approaches to validate and calibrate the contributions of domain expertise, particularly through the lens of prognostic and predictive expertise measures?

In the context of clinical trials, where treatment assignments are typically randomized and propensity scores are uniformly distributed. Then, the application of expert knowledge is less straightforward. Considering such scenarios, how do the proposed prognostic and predictive expertise metrics maintain their utility? Can these metrics still provide meaningful information for personalized treatment recommendations when the baseline assumption of expert influence on treatment assignment is removed? How might these metrics be adapted or interpreted in a randomized trial environment to enhance personalized medicine approaches?

### Summary
THis paper extends methods for estimating causal treatment from observational data in the presence of expert actions, e.g. the treatment decisions of a clinician.  There is value in the information available from the expert's actions;  What can we learn about the effectiveness of treatment from their actions as domain experts? As mentioned in the  paper "These methods become susceptible to confounding... and treatments (are assigned) based on factors that infuend the outcomes..." This is related to "confounding by indication" [ Salas, M., Hotman, A., Stricker, B.H.: Confounding by indication: an example of variation in the use of epidemiologic terminology. American journal of epidemiology 149(11), 981–983 (1999)]. Confounding occurs because the expert's action conditions both the treatment applied and the outcome

The paper makes a distinction between "predictive" expertise (knowledge of likely outcome,  specifically of Y_1 - Y_0, as occurs in healthcare) and "prognostic" expertise. (knowledge of potential outcomes, Y_1, Y_0 as occurs in education) Prognostic expertise implies predictive, since Y_1 - Y_0 can be determined by knowlege of Y_1 and Y_0. 

For this to work one must take into account "overlap" - the variability due to the decision-maker's imperfect knowledge; equivalently the possibility of perfect expertise.  The paper makes the point that one needs the additional distinction between "predictive" and "prognostic."

### Strengths
The paper shows that it is possible to take expertise into account and exploit the value of a decision-maker's inductive bias. It concludes that the type of expertise affects the performance of methods for estimating treatment effect (because such methods rely on the difference Y_1 - Y_0,?) , and that the difference in type of expertise may be evident as a way to distinguish datasets.

### Weaknesses
The prognostic - predictive distinction on which the paper depends is so subtle that it is hard to see how it is of any consequence.  This may be just a lack of clarity and familiarity with the current economic literature on causality, but it seems to rely on a strong claim that characteristically clinical treatment decisions would be ignorant of outcomes, but only of the _difference_ in outcomes, a claim whose reasons are obscure.  Both types of expertise are defined in terms of expectations of actions conditioned on outcomes as in Equations (2) and (3) -- definitions that leave this question of the distinction open. 

Such formulation of expertise  as '.. to what extent the actions of a decision-maker are informed by what a subject’s potential outcomes' seem to contradict the basic notion that experts "assign treatments based on factors that influence the outcomes." What influences what?  In simple terms, the decision-maker's action depends on their state of information -- the features known to them at the time they make their decision. One presumes that thinking of actions influenced by subsequent outcomes is a convention in the economics literature on causality.  This may be necessary for the methods of analysis but it is far from intuitive. 

In summary, the significance of the paper relies on a questionable distinction.

### Questions
In this conference venue why not draw upon the ML literature on causality (e.g. Pearl's work) and its use of structural equation models? I presume this touches on a long standing discussion that encompasses much more than just the claims of the paper, but such a comparison would open the field to a larger audience, and possibly, by recourse to additional domain knowledge elucidate why it is so that "Cases where more information can be gained through expertise (i.e. cases with high expertise) happen to align with cases where treatment effect estimation is particularly hard." (But other methods may be able to identify the causal effect.)

### Summary
This paper introduces the idea that selection bias due to expertise might be informative in designing and selecting methods for the conditional treatment effect (CATE) estimation.

They differentiate between two types of expertises, which are formally defined using the concept of entropy for actions induced by a certain policy. On the one hand, they define *prognostic expertise* where actions are based on all potential outcomes. It is given as one minus the relation of the entropy conditional on the potential outcomes and the total entropy. On the other hand, *predictive expertise* refers to the case where actions are based on the treatment effects, and is defined analogously as one minus the relation of the entropy conditional on the treatment effect and the total entropy. Note that these definition bound the expertise between zero and one with zero being no expertise and one being perfect expertise.

They draw connections from expertise to the validity of the overlap assumptions. In particular, the higher the expertise of a policy, the lower is the overlap.

They perform multiple experiments using semi-synthetic data and give intuitive explanations for the different performance of state-of-the-art CATE estimation methods.

Based on the theoretical definition of expertise, they propose an estimator for the predictive and prognostic expertise and a pipeline, called "expertise-informed" to that automatically chooses a suitable CATE estimator based on the dominant expertise type.

### Strengths
1. The paper seems to be novel in introducing the idea that a specific type of selection bias, namely allocation done by experts, is informative.

2. The paper is very well-written. It provides a great intuition why the idea of formally introducing expertise is fundamental and how it is related to other quantities of interest such as optimality or overlap assumption.

3. The proofs are very detailed and easy to follow.

### Weaknesses
*Definition of Expertise*

1. The relationship between in-context action variability and the overlap assumption is just intuitively explained. A formal proof for this relationship is missing. Specifically, the paper lacks a rigorous demonstration that a policy with zero in-context action variability necessarily violates the overlap assumption, which is crucial for causal inference. This requires a more explicit mathematical link rather than an intuitive argument.

2. In Figure 1 the axis tick values are missing. (The ticks are also confusing as for $C^{\pi}=0$, the expertise is somewhere between ticks.) The absence of clear tick values makes it difficult to interpret the relationship between in-context action variability and expertise, and the positioning of $C^{\pi}=0$ is ambiguous, hindering precise understanding of the conceptual space.

*Application*

3. The authors explain in great detail why some CATE estimator perform intuitively better under some type of expertise than others. A formal proof for this intuition is however missing. While the explanations are helpful, the lack of a formal connection between the estimator properties and the defined expertise types limits the theoretical impact of the analysis. For example, a rigorous analysis of how the bias and variance of each estimator are affected by different expertise levels would be beneficial.

*Estimating Expertise*

4. It is unclear in the proposed pipeline whether the expertise is estimated on same samples used for training or on some hold-out set and what the consequences of this choice have on the outcomes. This raises concerns about potential overfitting or bias in the expertise estimation, and the paper does not discuss the potential impact of this choice on the final results, particularly if the expertise estimation is not robust.

### Questions
*Definition of Expertise*

1. The entropy is defined with log to base 2. Do you decide on this because the actions are binary, i.e. $A\in$ { 0,1}?

2. Could you formally prove that $C^{\pi} =0$ implies the violation of the overlap assumption?

3. The comment (i) after Proposition 2 is unclear to me. Could you provide an example for that?

*Application*

4. Is it possible to give more formal arguments how the discussed CATE estimators (TARNet, IPW, CFRNet, DragonNet) are related to the entropy definition of expertise?

5. Are the results sensitive to the choice of network based CATE estimators in the analysis?

*Estimating Expertise*

6. Could you please provide a more detailed description of your pipeline process, in particular whether the same samples are used for estimating expertise and treatment effect? Do you anticipate pre-testing problems in this case?

7. How sensitive are the outcomes of the pipeline to the threshold 1\2?

### Summary
This paper studies the role of expertise in treatment effect estimation. They formalize predictive (actions dependent on treatment effect) and prognostic expertise (actions dependent on potential outcomes) and argue that knowledge of the type of expertise provides a useful inductive bias for selection of a treatment effect estimation method. They further show that the type of expertise present in a dataset can be estimated observationally with a plug-in method, suggesting a meta-algorithm whereby the type of expertise is estimated and the more appropriate method chosen. Experiments are conducted with sweeps over the amount of each type of expertise in the data. The results have implications particularly for the appropriateness of methods that learn balancing representations, as these are shown to worse than other methods in cases with predictive expertise (as the balancing removes information about the treatment effect from the representation) and better than other methods in cases with prognostic expertise (as the shifts present are unrelated to the treatment effect).

### Strengths
* This work offers a novel perspective and analytic framework for reasoning about expertise in treatment effect estimation problems. I found it particularly insightful in the context of reasoning about the causes of covariate shift and overlap violations across treatment strata and the implications for estimation. 
* The paper is well-written and clear, with high-quality visualizations.
* The experiments are well-designed and convincing in supporting the theoretical claims with empirical evidence.

### Weaknesses
The paper takes a somewhat narrow lens with respect to the breadth of relevant prior work considered. It largely focuses on a particular lineage of treatment effect estimation methods that use neural networks for representation learning, balancing, and fitting potential outcome models. The work would be stronger if it could be contextualized better in the full landscape of work on causal inference for treatment effect estimation across fields, including statistics, epidemiology, and econometrics. 

It would be particularly prudent to try to understand how this work fits into the broader landscape of approaches that aim to learn doubly-robust estimators that only require one of either the treatment or outcome models correctly and do not require any notion of balancing beyond overlap. For example, see the Augmented Inverse Propensity Weighted Estimator (e.g., Glynn and Quinn 2010) and Targeted Maximum Likelihood Estimation (Schuler and Rose 2017)

### Questions
* As a suggestion, it would interesting to understand the relationship between the issues identified with balancing representations for treatment effect estimation in the presence of predictive expertise with the consistency issues identified with balanced representations for domain adaptation (see Johansson 2019 https://proceedings.mlr.press/v89/johansson19a.html).
* Please elaborate on the relationship the expertise measures and mutual information and the motivation for defining new measures given the relationship between them.
* I don’t follow the argument in section 3.1 regarding the relationship between the two types of expertise. It seems odd to say that predictive expertise implies prognostic expertise, because a policy with predictive expertise (dependent only on the treatment effect) would be insensitive to a constant shift in the potential outcomes while a policy with prognostic expertise would be sensitive to it.
