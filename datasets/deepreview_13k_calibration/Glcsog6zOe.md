## Abstract
This paper studies close-loop task planning, which refers to the process of generating a sequence of skills (a plan) to accomplish a specific goal while adapting the plan based on real-time observations.
Recently, prompting Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate actions iteratively has become a prevalent paradigm due to its superior performance and user-friendliness.
However, this paradigm is plagued by two inefficiencies: high token consumption and redundant error correction, both of which hinder its scalability for large-scale testing and applications.
To address these issues, we propose \ours, which reframes task planning with LLMs into three distinct phases: 
plan sampling,  action tree construction, and grounded deciding.
\ours starts by using an LLM to sample a set of potential plans before execution, followed by the aggregation of them to form an action tree.
Finally, the LLM performs a top-down decision-making process on the tree, taking into account real-time environmental information.
Experiments show that \ours achieves state-of-the-art performance while maintaining high efficiency.
By decomposing LLM queries into a single plan-sampling call and multiple grounded-deciding calls,
a considerable part
of the prompt are less likely to be repeatedly consumed. 
As a result, token consumption is reduced by 92.2\% compared to the previously best-performing model.
Additionally, by enabling backtracking on the action tree as needed, the correction process becomes more flexible, leading to a 40.5\% decrease in error corrections.

### Summary
The paper presents an algorithm specialized in LLMs for interacting with an environment for solving tasks that require planning. In this context, the state, the observations and the actions are represented as text. 

In previous work, called iterative-planning in the submission, When an action is executed, another call to a LLM appends the observation and attempts to obtain a new action. In the planning literature, that is close to what is called integrated planning&execution, as the agent must choose actions for achieving the goal, but observations might lead the agent to change the course of action completely.

In contrast, the paper follows a more restricted mode that can be more efficient under some circumstances: offline planning, then execution of the plan. This is the more studied case in the symbolic planning literature, where offline planning has received much more attention than execution.

The proposed algorithm —Tree-Planner— is relevant for domains expressed in text, where a LLM could approximate a world model, and could produce a plan using knowledge widely available in text. 

While the task can be formulated as a POMDP, the initial phase –called plan sampling– does not deal with further possible observations but just the general scene. Indeed, the samples are converted that represent common prefixes of the plans. So, the policy from plan sampling can be seen as a stochastic policy. That makes sense in some cases, but it generally cannot solve POMDPs where policies might need to map state distributions into actions, and update state distributions with new observations.

Always assuming the use of a LLM, the main hypothesis mentioned in the abstract are:
1. Tree-planner might be more effective than alternatives like iterative planning by avoiding redundant error correction.
2. Tree-planner might have a lower token cost.

The second hypothesis is true, almost by construction, as the algorithm only needs less information about actions and objects. The first hypothesis is only studied for VirtualHome, a domain of some interest. The main claim is that backtracking allows more effective recovery than appending the error and letting the LLM recover.

The paper shows how high-quality data was refined to allow the evaluation of metrics like success rate. 

The experimental setup reports a comparison with baselines including iterative-planning, all using the proprietary LLM GPT-3.5.

The results show improvements in the 35 tasks of the dataset. For N=50 samples, the best possible GCR (goal condition recall) reaches 81.2% of the tasks.

### Strengths
- Good idea: While for model-based planning, offline planning might be weaker than integrated planning and execution, that might be different for LLM-based planning. Obtaining a policy without the distraction of the incoming observations might allow a more systematic execution.
- The paper is reasonably well-written.
- The benchmark is interesting.
- The LLM-based baselines are reasonable enough. Some readers might want to see Chain-of-Though or Self-reflection, but I think zero-shot and iterative replanning are enough.
- The results using the ground truth plans (oracle planner) show that more samples lead to a smaller improvement, showing the initial phase tends to find more of the correct plan.
- Using success rate is robust with respect to alternative ways to achieve the goal.

### Weaknesses
 - Not clear if the policy is grounded in the environment or in the LLM implicit distribution.
	- Section 3.1 mentions the initial observation as part of the prompt, but the prompts in section F include a long “(observation)” for iterative planning and the grounded-deciding phase, but **not** for plan sampling.
	- If a detailed initial observation is given, then it’s possible that many of the actions are grounded on them, reducing the significance of seeing the algorithm as dealing with a POMDP.
	- If a detailed initial observation is **not** given, then the LLM might be retrieving possible courses of action given the initial description but not grounded in the environment.
	- Both scenarios diminish the apparent significance of the work.
 - No discussion of the systematicity of LLM-based planning.
	- LLM-based planning is a popular topic, but the increasing body of work might call for a more careful examination. Each paper in this direction is an opportunity to examine the problem and the methodology.
	- In general, planning seems easier in the “happy path,” where text with high likelihood matches what might work in an environment, but things can get more complicated quickly.
	- Consider the task of “calling Mary using the cell phone”. A good plan is not about assuming that the cell phone is on a table but exploring the space until the cell phone is found. A diverse set of plans might include the more usual places, perhaps even mentioning multiple places in a single path. But it’s possible that the cell phone is in the fridge or in the supermarket bag. 
	- While the prompt in the grounded deciding phase includes the full observation, the super-market bag would be there, prompting to choose among a few actions to pass the responsibility of examining the supermarket bag and the freezer to the plan sampling phase.
	- It’s possible that finding a cell phone might require samples beyond a fixed N, and no alternative is offered.
	- So, the **key underlying problem** is that a flexible plan dealing with observations **cannot** be found using a fixed number of samples. Some tasks might require fewer samples, and some might require more. That’s precisely why planning algorithms use search.
 - Experimental significance: a single environment with only 35 tasks.
	- The dataset subsection explains that 35 tasks were used, but the tasks were not listed. The VH has many other tasks. The 35 tasks may be biased in a way that affects the significance of the observations.
 - Experimental significance: Only VH
	- There are other environments for testing these ideas. For instance, the reference below. The related work section must cover what other alternatives are used in related work and why it’s a good idea to select only this environment.
	- (Jericho) Hausknecht, Matthew, Prithviraj Ammanabrolu, Marc-Alexandre Côté, and Xingdi Yuan. “Interactive Fiction Games: A Colossal Adventure.” arXiv:1909.05398 [Cs], February 25, 2020. http://arxiv.org/abs/1909.05398.
 - In general, given the absence of task descriptions and their plans, it’s hard to know whether the results are significant.
	- Even if we have the 35 tasks and their plans, the results might be an artifact of this particular environment. Perhaps the current version of GPT 3.5 is better at those household tasks than at navigating in a store to buy groceries.

Secondary issues:

 - Goal Condition Recall might be a misleading metric
	- different subgoals might be easier than others
	- we don’t know the structure of the subgoals 
 - Confusions in the theoretical emphasis on POMDPs.
	- The hallmark of POMDPs, being a Markov decision process, is the Markov assumption: decisions can be made just by looking at the state without the history. However, the policy in section 2 includes the history of actions but perhaps not the observation history.
	- The emphasis on POMDPs is over-stated as the VH has high visibility while other environments feature more partial observability  (for instance, Jericho)
 - Global replan is non-comparable with other algorithms.
	- Whether it’s possible to teleport to the initial state or not fundamentally changes the problem.
 - The notion of inverse actions is a form of symbolic knowledge, leaving the scope of the paper.
	- A more purist approach would task the LLM to undo the last k actions, perhaps offering the list of actions.

Minor

 - The best GCR in section 5.2 is interesting, but GCR is not a good predictor of SR (success rate).
	- Actually, in Table 2, the gap between GCR and SR is higher for Tree-Planner than for other approaches.
	- Related: Table 3 reports 45.5% of errors due to missing correct plan.
 - It must be clarified if the LLM is called when there is only one possible action.
	- Some action trees in the appendix have a few actions with no branches. This affects the overall cost but not other statistics.
 - Alg 1 doesn’t add much. Any algorithm for building a “trie” data structure would work.

### Questions
- What are some other environments where this method could be tested?
	- Why was only VH selected?
- Given a fixed task, is the same prompt used for the four scenes?
- Does the observation of plan-sampling include the full description of the room or just the type of room?
	- I understand that in VirtualHome, the top-down view allows the agent to see everything except what’s hidden in containers like drawers.
	- The prompts in section F include a long “(observation)” for iterative planning and the grounded-deciding phase, but not for plan sampling.
- Did you consider adding the observation history?
	- The list of actions with the observation context where they were made might need to be more informative.
	- Unless the observations are monotonic, meaning that after each action, the agent observes more and more. For instance, if once the agent opens a drawer, it would still see what’s there.
	- Are the observations monotonic?
- GCR metric: what’s the distribution of the number of goal conditions? Are the number of goal conditions the same for each of the 35 tasks?
- Sect 5.2
	- Did you randomize the results for table 2? A new seed might generate another set of plans.
	- What would be the results for SR? Table 1 shows how GCR grows with SR, but doesn’t predict SR. Actually, the gap between GCR and SR is higher for Tree-Planner than for other approaches.
	- Related: Table 3 reports 45.5 of errors due to missing correct plan.
- What is the inverse of all the actions? 
	- The supplementary material lists them, please list the corresponding inverse, say how that information was obtained, and discuss how realistic it is for that information to be available or learned.
- Branches in action trees.
	- Some node action trees have no branches. See leftmost path Fig 12. Is the LLM prompt for choosing one action or are they executed? Is this accounted in the cost of the predictions?
- Please report the average number of branches for reaching the leaves for each of the 35 tasks. This is equivalent to aggregating sequences without branching into a single action. For instance, Fig 12 has 8 leaves with [1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 2, 3] branches, average 2.125 branches per leave. So, the agent should make an average of 2.125 decisions when following that branch.
- Please discuss the number of error corrections in Table 1 compared to the number of branches. Otherwise, it’s hard to know whether 3.29 vs 1.86 is a significant difference.
- Sect 4.1: Dataset: what are the 35 unique tasks?
	- VirtualHome has multiple programs for some tasks, not a single gold plan.
	- Did you create new scenes or used scenes in VH?
	- Are the gold truth plans associated to a task or to (task, scene)?
	- Please list the 35 tasks descriptions.
	- What is the distribution of the number of steps for the gold truth? Even better, provide this information for each task
- Methodological: was N=50 selected using the 35 tasks?
	- Is it possible that examining the tasks leads to bias in the selection of N?
- Sect 4.1: implementation.
	- Was majority vote only used for grounded-deciding? Please add a reference for the method.
- Table 3: errors for Tree-planner N 25
	- Is this success rate, SR?
	- The false negative is misleading. In the appendix, the error explanation says that the environment reports that there is no keyboard. Are keyboards part of the possible objects? The observations in the prompt mention a computer but no keyboard.
	- The example of the keyboard should be an environment misunderstanding.
	- Please fix the tables, and refine the definition of false negative. Perhaps you might to add false negative to the missing correct plan, calling it “semantically correct.”
- What are the error modalities with correction?
- Sect C.1 describes performance across plan length. 
	- Can you provide the statistics for other approaches?
	- What about kind of task?

### Summary
The paper proposes TreePlanner, an LLM-based algorithm for task planning. TreePlanner uses the LLM more efficiently without reducing performance. The main contributions are algorithmic and empirical. The key idea is to decompose the planner into two distinct stages of LLM use. In the first stage (plan sampling), an expensive set of calls to the LLM is used to sample a number of full plans. These plans are aggregated into a tree structure which is then searched over in the second stage of the planner. The main source of efficiency (wrt LLM costs) is that the second stage (grounded deciding) can use a simpler prompt to perform action selection (instead of action generation). Experiments on tasks from the VirtualHome domain indicate the method is far more efficient without any loss of performance, compared to strong baselines.

### Strengths
+ The paper tackles an important and popular problem of leveraging LLMs for task planning. Progress here would likely be impactful and of interest to the community.

+ The main ideas in TreePlanner are intuitively clear. The two step approach for efficient use of the LLM seems novel, to my knowledge.

+ The results show that compared to the baselines, TreePlanner makes very efficient use of the LLM without losing performance.

### Weaknesses
 - While the method clearly shows good performance on the considered domains, the experiments could be improved to address important questions about the approach, namely prompt engineering and the most efficient use of an LLM in task planning.
  - For example, how good is the current prompt used in the plan sampling step? Given that errors made here are currently catastrophic and the prompt needs to be task-specific, a careful analysis of the quality of this prompt would be interesting.
  - Another open question is whether it's more efficient to restrict the use of the LLM to plan sampling alone. See the questions for more details. (I'd be open to adjusting my score based on the responses to these questions.)

- The set of tasks considered are from a single domain (VirtualHome). This makes it difficult to evaluate the broader utility of the proposed ideas.

- Some of the the implementation details of the prompts, especially the one used in grounded deciding, are not fully described. See the questions for more details.

### Questions
- I was unable to identify what error information is included in the history of the prompt used for grounded deciding. Per Figure 2 and Appendix F.3, it seems like some information about previously failed actions seems to be included in the history part of the prompt. If yes, are failed actions restricted to those on the current trajectory from the root to the current node or are they a global history over the entire tree? Which variant is better and why?

- How sensitive is overall performance (e.g., success rate) to the prompt used in Plan Sampling? Since the absence of valid / optimal plans in the constructed tree leads to severely degraded performance and LLM performance is known to be very dependent on its prompt, it'd be useful to understand how much performance might be gained from a better Step 1 prompt? 
  - A related (but harder) question, how does the choice of LLM affect performance (e.g., off-the-shelf black box vs fine-tuned, etc.)?

- Would it be possible to include additional tasks beyond those in VirtualHome? For example, is Toolbench relevant here?

- Given the paper's emphasis is on efficient use of the LLM, what performance improvement does the LLM offer in grounded deciding over other action selection mechanisms? For example, is it feasible to replace the use of the LLM in grounded deciding with "classical" action selection techniques (e.g., UCB, best-first heuristic search)? How might this perform? More generally, please discuss where exactly the LLM is required / beneficial over classical search-based planners.

### Summary
This paper revisits LLM-based close-loop task planning on a classical application benchmark (VirtualHome). 
Previous LLM use has been faced with two major limitations, which are high token consumption and redundant error correction. The proposed approach, TREE-PLANNER, aims at addressing the above limitations by reframing LLM-based task planning with LLMs into three distinct phases: plan sampling, action tree construction, and grounded deciding. 
This decomposition of queries into a single plan-sampling call ensures token efficiency, while factoring action trees facilitates backtracking and error correction.  The system is compared to two baseline systems: Zero-Shot planner and ProgPrompt, and surpasses the state-of-the-art on multiple criteria, each time by at least a few percentage points.

### Strengths
The paper adresses a competitive topic in the field of LLM for agents and its rationale is presented in a very compelling fashion. It is technically sound, with an excellent balance of technical description and use of supplementary material for examples. The approach itself can be seen as an improvement over previous approaches, but the grounds for such improvements are well justified, and address specific limitations rather than incremental tuning of pre-existing models, conferring originality to the work.
Very good presentation of related work by structuring it through relevant topics (to the exception of LLM for traditional Planning). 
Well-presented technical insights, in particular the formalization of token consuption, or the analysis of error types.
Detailed results, using a panel of criteria both technical and practical (i.e. cost), which are quite convincing.

### Weaknesses
Although the paper includes a fairly comprehensive list of related works, it does not address some of the LLM-based planning work. For instance, while 'Tree of Thoughts' is referenced, there is no mention of 'Faithful CoT' [Lyu et al., 2023] and its suggestion for LLM to produce PDDL representations to be passed to a regular Planner (which would still support online planning or replanning via restarting).
It would be good to include such a discussion, or to justify not including it (e.g. on grounds of partial observability), provided such grounds effectively preclude adoption.

### Questions
1) What guarantees scalability to domains comprizing a larger number of actions and greater tree perplexity?
2) Could you discuss how different LLM could be used (GPT-4, or LLaMA) with a similar approach and whether the prompting strategy would be affected?
3) Is partial observability really a salient property of this specific set of 28 actions?

### Summary
Language model planning frameworks operate iteratively by generating one action per time-step, appending it back to the prompt (along with observation for closed-loop planning), and repeating the process until the task is executed. Such approaches are token-inefficient because of their repetitive use of prompt tokens (which includes the task, action-observation history, and in-context exemplars) for each action-step generation. Moreover, in closed-loop planning, such methods may often lead to infeasible action steps, thus, requiring corrective steps/replanning (local or global). In this paper, the authors propose a way to make closed-loop planning (i) more token-efficient (i.e. requiring fewer tokens) than an iterative planner and (ii) more replanning efficient (requiring fewer corrective steps). 

Specifically, the authors propose to sample multiple plans from the LLM in a non-iterative and offline fashion (Plan Sampling). These plans are then merged into a tree-like structure to avoid repetitive actions (Action Tree Construction). Finally, these executable actions are selected by prompting the LLM with the task, current observation, and the history of executed actions (Grounded Deciding). The non-iterative plan sampling approach is more token-efficient. The tree-like structure helps to backtrack and select different steps in case of action failure without having to plan from scratch, avoiding large token costs.

### Strengths
* Overall, the paper is well-motivated. 
* Through a number of empirical and ablation studies on VirtualHome environment, the authors show how their approach is significantly more token-efficient compared to the general iterative closed-loop planning approaches. The authors also show improved performance wrt ProgPrompt, however, ProgPrompt is more token-efficient (Table 1)
* The framework would be of significance to the planning and decision-making audience (especially in academia) who want to use the larger models for similar works.

### Weaknesses
 * Originality: Placing this paper in the context of existing works (like Tree-of-Thoughts & SayCan), much of the contributions seem to be merely engineering tweaks that do not contribute (significantly) on a more fundamental level. Considering how generating and planning over tree-like structures have been explored in the past in open-loop/offline planning [A][B], where planning trees are generated iteratively, while simultaneously grounding the actions, the only novelty here is to decouple the tree construction from the grounding (Grounded deciding) for token-efficiency. Backtracking is also something that has already been introduced in Tree-of-Thoughts, although not in a proper task-planing framework.

* Clarity: From what I understand, the sampled plans were generated in one go (non-iteratively) to avoid higher costs. However, iterative planning is useful in avoiding compounding errors and it is unclear as to how the authors handle such errors in their non-iterative setup (see Questions). Certain details like the definition of "corrections" are somewhat ambiguous.

[B] SayCanPay: Heuristic Planning with Large Language Models Using Learnable Domain Knowledge, Hazra et al., 2023

### Questions
1. When sampling plans (action sequences) non-iteratively, an error in one action step (something that diverges from the list of executable actions) can lead to subsequent actions being erroneous, leading to a so-called "compounding effect" as highlighted in [C]. This would lead to most of the sampled plans being infeasible. How do the authors address this problem?

2. "In terms of correction efficiency, TREE-PLANNER reduces the number of corrections by 37.99% and 40.52%, respectively:" How do you define and measure an error "correction": For instance, it could be (i) a new action insertion; (ii) an action deletion; (iii) replacing one action with another generated action. Is it evaluated irrespective of the success rate (i.e. is it only measured for plans that have succeded in correctly executing the task or for any plan)?

Minor comments: 

a considerable part of the prompt "is" less …
