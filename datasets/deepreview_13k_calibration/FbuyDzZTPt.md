## Abstract
Recent works have shown that by using large pre-trained models along with learnable prompts, rehearsal-free methods
for class-incremental learning (CIL) settings can achieve superior performance to prominent rehearsal-based ones.
Rehearsal-free CIL methods struggle with distinguishing classes from different tasks, as those are not trained together.
In this work we propose a regularization method based on virtual outliers to tighten decision boundaries of the classifier,
such that confusion of classes among different tasks is mitigated.
Recent prompt-based methods often require a pool of task-specific prompts, in order to prevent overwriting knowledge
of previous tasks with that of the new task, leading to extra computation in querying and composing an
appropriate prompt from the pool.
This additional cost can be eliminated, without sacrificing accuracy, as we reveal in the paper.
We illustrate that a simplified prompt-based method can achieve results comparable to
previous state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods equipped with a prompt pool, using much less learnable parameters and lower inference cost.
Our regularization method has demonstrated its compatibility with different prompt-based methods, boosting
those previous SOTA rehearsal-free CIL methods' accuracy on the ImageNet-R and CIFAR-100 benchmarks.

### Summary
This paper considers rehearsal-free class-incremental learning (CIL), and proposes the "OnePrompt with Virtual Outlier Regularization" technique (OVOR) that performs equally or better than existing prompt-based CIL methods in terms of accuracy and computation. The proposed method consists of two elements, 1) the "OnePrompt" - a single prompt based mechanism that gives comparable results to mechanisms with multiple-prompts, 2) an outlier regularization technique that reduces the inter-task fusion by tightening the decision boundaries of the classes among different tasks.

### Strengths
- The proposed method for rehearsal-free CIL outperforms (or performs equally) existing methods in terms of accuracy, computation and storage.
- The pipeline is clearly explained

### Weaknesses
 - The functionality of the virtual outliers is not very clearly explained.
- The paper lacks intuition on how the single prompt method works equally or better than the multiple prompt methods.

### Questions
- Is there any mathematical explanation/proof as to why the outlier method works well in tightening the decision boundaries, based on the Gaussian mechanism employed?
- Is there any intuition as to how why the single prompt method is comparable to the multiple prompt cases in terms of the performance?

### Summary
There are two primary motivations in this paper. The first one is to show that the need to have a pool of prompts (something that most prompt-based approaches in CL do) is not necessary. For this, the authors propose OnePrompt, which is a simple baseline that uses only one prompt to learn all tasks instead of having task-specific prompts. The second motivation is that rehearsal-free approaches struggle to differentiate classes from different tasks since they are never optimized simultaneously. For this, the authors propose regularizing the decision boundary using  Virtual Outliers. The authors mentioned that these outliers help to define the decision boundary of each class better. The results show promising results in two commonly used benchmarks. Surprisingly, OnePrompt does not present high forgetting.

### Strengths
- The idea of having a OnePrompt method is interesting. And it surprised me how well it worked.
    - I especially like the idea of reducing the computational cost by not requiring to find the closest key-pair values.
- The results showed that the proposed regularization method helps improve the accuracy. The motivation is clear.
- The paper shows promising results in 2 standard benchmarks. However, only state-of-the-art results in one.
- The background section in a paper is very helpful since it presents the notation and everything it needs to know about the contributions

### Weaknesses
 - I understand and share the motivation that rehearsal-free approaches struggle to distinguish classes from different tasks. However, it would be good to add a more realistic example, values or theory that support this statement.
    - Or at least something that shows what you think is happening.
 - In multiple parts of the paper, it is mentioned that prompt-based approaches require a pool of task-specific prompts. Although I understand the idea behind it, this is only partially true, as the authors say in section 3.2. They explain that the selection depends on a function; ideally, one would expect this feature to be able to be separated by task, but it is not a requirement of the methods. 
 - The structure of the paper needs to be clarified. For example, why present Virtual Outlier Regularization first rather than OnePrompt?
    - At least for me, OnePrompt is like a simple baseline. It's a good one, as it shows in the results, but only a base method to be compared.
    - I believe that adding Virtual Outlier to other methods is the main contribution. However, how to obtain the virtual outliers is not explained in the paper. I understand that citing is a proper way of explaining it. However, as it has been such an essential part of the contribution, it is better to have a small explanation.
 - In Table 3, it should be good to include OnePrompt for comparison. Also, add some vertical lines to separate # of tasks clearly.

### Questions
- It is not clear which setting OnePrompt works. Does it work in a Class incremental or task incremental setting (with a share classifier)?
    - This confusion appears especially after seeing Table 1. Why is this table important? How does the same experiment behave in CIL?
- Is there an intuition on how and why OnePrompt works so well? 
    - How much does the prompt change in each task? Since there is no forgetting, it shouldn't change much or no?
    - How does the representation of previous tasks change after training new tasks?
- Have you run experiments when training only the classifier? Together with using the approach mentioned in Eq 3.
- Is there an explanation for why the VOR increases forgetting? As shown in Table 2.
- In Section 5, you mentioned that for OnePrompt, you insert the prompts into the first 5 layers. Did you do an ablation of this hyperparameter? 
- How costly is the VOR approach?
- Do you have the results for OnePrompt for Table 4? In the last 2 paragraphs, you mentioned a comparison between OnePrompt and other methods, however, I don't see it in the tables. Are you referring to OVOR?

### Summary
This paper describes a method for class incremental learning (CIL) that makes use of frozen pre-trained ViT transformer networks. The essence of the method is to learn prompts, while keeping the pre-trained network frozen, and hence ensure it is unable to forget during CIL. Past work in this area, namely L2P, DualPrompt and CODA-P, is therefore highly relevant.  The paper identifies several weakness with those past methods for prompting ViT networks for CIL, and proposes improvements to the general methodology. Firstly, it proposes the use of "VOR", i.e. Virtual Outlier Regularization, in which the learned output head is trained further following freezing of newly learned prompts, on a combination of feature vectors, and synthesised outliers. The idea here is to try to tighten the decision boundaries between classes. Secondly, it proposes OnePrompt, a simplification to past prompting mechanisms, namely removing the use of different prompt sets for different tasks. When VOR and OnePrompt are combined (as OVOR), the paper shows better results than L2P and DualPrompt, with comparable or better results than CODA-P.  The number of parameters and FLOPs is reduced in OVOR compared to those methods.

### Strengths
- Originality: the paper isolates weaknesses in comparison methods and proposes a solution, namely the VOR method, which is the first use of such a method in the prompting of ViT models for CIL. Moreover, the proposed simplification to past prompting methods for CIL is novel, as is the combination of VOR and OnePrompt
- Quality: the paper sets out the context and problem setting well, clearly explains the rationale for the methods, and tests the method on datasets that are of clear interest in the CIL community.
- Clarity: the writing is clear and the structure easy to follow; this is why I have very few questions.
- Significance: Given prompting methods using pre-trained ViTs are very new in CIL, this is a potentially important paper. I think the community is currently unclear on whether prompting methods can be significantly improved on, and there is a need for studies such as this in which simplifications, parameter efficiency and additional regularization are used to enhance prompting methods.

### Weaknesses
 - 1. The main weakness of the paper is that important comparison results in the use of pretrained ViT networks are omitted. The significance of the contribution in this paper would be much easier to appraise if these are added by the authors.
    - 1.1 First, there are two omitted relevant papers that use alternative methods to prompting. These both produce higher final average accuracies using pre-trained ViT models than any reported here.  The first of these is the SLCA method [1]. The second is the RanPAC method [3] that builds on the work of the paper by Zhou et al [2], which is already cited in the paper.
        - In the current paper, OVOR on ImageNet-R achieves 75.6% for T=10, and CIFAR-100 achieves 86.7% for T=10.
        -  In ref [1], ImageNet-R achieves 77% for T=10 and CIFAR-100 achieves 91.53% for T=10. 
        - In ref [3], ImageNet-R achieves 78.1% for T=10 and for CIFAR100 achieves 92.2% for T=10 ( T=5 and T=20 results can also be seen in Table A4 of [3]).
    - 1.2 Second, a clear distinction between refs [1,2,3] and the current paper is that [1,2,3] report results on many more datasets, whereas here only two are used: split CIFAR-100 and split ImageNet-R. 
        - The current paper's contribution and standing relative to refs [1,2,3] would be much clearer if results for OVOR are reported on at least 4 datasets. E.g. [1] also reports results on split CUB and split Cars, while [2] and [3] each report on 7 datasets for CIL in total. There is no good reason to not demonstrate OVOR's performance on at least 4, and preferable 6 datasets such as those in [1,2,3].  This is particularly important given that table 2 shows that OnePrompt alone produces lower final average accuracy than CODA-P, and only the combination of OnePrompt with VOR does better than CODA-P.
    - Note: I am aware that paper [3] (and possibly [1]) might be deemed "contemporaneous" according to the FAQ on this point (which is unclear re arXiv). Therefore, my recommendations to compare to those are aimed at improving the value of the paper should it be published. However, my recommendation to add more datasets is independent of any date comparisons, especially given Zhou et al's other datasets could have been used to add more dataset comparisons, to help the reader understand whether there truly is a trend for the method to outperform coda-prompt, DualPrompt etc.

- 2. The paper does not thoroughly explore  ablation results with regards to the combination of OnePrompt or other prompting methods with VOR.  While ablations for OnePrompt are shown for ImageNet-R in Table 2, there is no data for CIFAR-100.  My above comments re more datasets extends to this point - for the reader to understand the contributions of OnePrompt and VOR both individually and combined, we really need to see data for ablations on more than just a single dataset. Moreover, the authors state "The proposed virtual outlier regularization (VOR) is agnostic to any prompt-based CIL." This therefore means it is of high interest to know how well VOR combines with CODA-P, given that CODA-P without VOR outperforms OnePrompt without VOR.

- 3. On page 3, in the second paragraph, the authors refer to the prototype methods of Zhou et al and Ma et al and state "However, it is unclear whether they can be considered rehearsal-free, as they claim to be."
    - This is a misleading statement that should be deleted. Rehearsal methods require storage of samples from past tasks for inclusion in training in newer tasks.  In my view it's very well understood in the CL community that this means retaining a copy of the full original datasample, e.g. an input image, and using such samples individually alongside new samples to update the parameters of a model. This is really quite different to class prototypes as used by Zhou et al (and also, for example, Ref [3]). In Zhou et al, class prototypes are firstly certainly not the original samples, as they are formed from the output feature representations (e.g. a length 512 vector instead of an RGB image). More importantly, prototypes are an average over all the length 512 vectors for a class, so the result cannot in any way be thought of in the same way as "rehearsal", since there is no way to recover individual samples, and in this sense are more like the weights in a neural network than actual samples. Finally, and most important of all for this point, in Zhou et al  class prototypes from past tasks are not used to update any parameters in any subsequent task, which is in total contrast to the entire point of  rehearsal memory. In summary, I think its false to suggest that Zhou et al and related methods are not "rehearsal free".
    - The authors then make a statement about privacy concerns - this is a totally independent point to the distinction between class prototypes and rehearsal memory, but I am skeptical about how much privacy concern there can be about a class-mean vector. I'm willing to stand corrected, but I cannot see any chance of original samples being extracted from a mean created from many orders of magnitude of samples to form a feature vector....
    - The inclusion of these statements has the appearance of being an attempt to justify why a prompt based CIL method should be preferred over a prototype method like Zhou et al. But I don't think it is necessary to try to justify this. Regardless of whether prototype methods may or may not achieve better results than prompting methods, the current paper's advantages over past prompting methods are still potentially important, because (i) there may be benefits from combining prompting and prototype methods, which to my knowledge has not yet been done; and (ii) it could happen that future improvements on ViT transformer networks may benefit more from prompting than they do from prototype methods. 

- 5. Minor point: the paper's intro assumes the reader understands well that the approaches in the paper apply only to pre-trained ViT networks. For the larger Continual Learning community, this is still unusual as most methods for CL focus on training CNNs such as ResNets, and on mitigating forgetting when the benefits of a pre-trained model are not available. The paper would benefit from making these points clear early on.

- Summary: I have chosen a rating of 5 at this time. In order to reconsider my rating, the authors will need to (i) provide the reader with a clearer view on how OVOR compares to other methods on more datasets  (and, ideally, comparison with refs [1,3] as well), and (ii) show thorough ablations compared with the best competing prompting method, CODA-P, i.e. CODA-P with and without VOR, and OnePrompt with and without VOR, all on at least 4 datasets.

### Questions
This is repeating the content of my response under "Weaknesses": my questions are these: 

1. What is the performance of VOR when combined with L2P, DualPrompt and CodaPrompt, and how does that compare with OVOR? 
2. What is the performance of OVOR, and ablations (VOR alone and OnePrompt alone) on at least 2 more datasets?
