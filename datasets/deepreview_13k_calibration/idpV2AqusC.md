## Abstract
This paper rethinks Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM), which is originally formulated as a zero-sum game where the weights of a network and a bounded perturbation try to minimize/maximize, respectively, the same differentiable loss.
To fundamentally improve this design, we argue that SAM should instead be reformulated using the 0-1 loss. 
As a continuous relaxation, we follow the simple conventional approach where the minimizing (maximizing) player uses an upper bound (lower bound) surrogate to the 0-1 loss. 
This leads to a novel formulation of SAM as a bilevel optimization problem, dubbed as BiSAM. 
BiSAM with newly designed lower-bound surrogate loss indeed constructs stronger perturbation.
Through numerical evidence, we show that BiSAM consistently results in improved performance when compared to the original SAM and variants, while enjoying similar computational complexity.

### Summary
The paper investigates applying SAM to the actual metric (0-1 loss) in the classification problem and proposes reformulating the original zero-sum game in SAM as a bilevel optimization problem. The bilevel optimization formulation is motivated by the relation between cross-entropy and 0-1 loss. To counter the non-differentiability of the 0-1 loss, the proposed method (BiSAM) introduces a surrogate loss coupled with the cross-entropy loss. The empirical results show consistent improvement over SAM and orthogonal improvements when accompanied with other SAM variants (ASAM and ESAM).

### Strengths
- The approach is simple, scalable, and theoretical-sound
- The flow is easy to follow
- The improvements are convincing and validated in many learning scenarios, including standard learning, fine-tuning and noisy-data learning

### Weaknesses
 - As mentioned in the conclusion, it will be great to see if BiSAM benefits other domains, e.g. NLP

### Questions
- In A.3, to further ground BiSAM's improvements under noisy labels. Can the authors provide the number with noisy learning approaches, e.g., mixup?

### Summary
The authors propose BiSAM, an algorithm for solving the Sharpness Aware Minimization (SAM). The original SAM algorithm (Foret et al., 2021) aims to solve a min-max problem of a differentiable loss that upper bounds the 0-1 loss. The authors suggest that directly considering the min-max problem of the 0-1 loss provides a tighter generalization bound. Accordingly, the BiSAM algorithm aims to solve the problem by substituting the 0-1 loss with a differentiable upper bound for minimization and a differentiable lower bound for maximization. The experimental results demonstrate the benefit of BiSAM compared with the original SAM algorithm.

### Strengths
- The idea of directly aiming to solve min-max of 0-1 loss and accordingly minimizing/maximizing different surrogates brings novelty.
- The authors provide theoretically justified lower bound for practical implementation. They also provide a clear discussion on two different choices of surrogates.
- The numerical results demonstrate that BiSAM improves accuracy.

### Weaknesses
 - The numerical results show limited improvements. Also, in some other works (Foret et al., 2021; Liu et al., 2022), SAM achieves accuracy higher than the accuracy of BiSAM in this paper (with the same model and number of epochs).

 - The comparison to the original SAM objective is not fully explored. While the authors propose a different objective based on the 0-1 loss, the theoretical connection between minimizing the proposed objective and the original SAM objective is not clear. Specifically, the paper lacks a theoretical analysis that directly compares the generalization performance of the two approaches, making it difficult to assess the true benefit of the proposed method.

### Questions
1. Please see the weakness section.
2. The original SAM aims to solve $ \min_w \max_{\epsilon: \Vert \epsilon \Vert_2 \leq \rho} L^{\mathrm{ce}}_S (w + \epsilon) + h(\Vert w\Vert^2_2 / \rho)$, whereas BiSAM aims to solve (15).

    Is there any theoretical result that could compare the gaps between $\min_w L^{01}_\mathcal{D} (w)$ and the two different solutions (the aim of SAM and the aim of BiSAM, respectively)?

### Summary
The article 'Rethinks Sharpness-Aware Minimization' addresses the issue of 0-1 loss being non-continuous and thus not amenable to gradient-based optimization. This is tackled by having the minimizing (maximizing) player use an upper bound (lower bound) surrogate for the 0-1 loss. The problem is analyzed thoroughly and the task is clearly defined.

### Strengths
The BiSAM method proposed in the paper somewhat resolves the issue of optimizing the 0-1 loss using gradients. 
This method has been validated across multiple datasets, demonstrating its advantages over SAM through extensive experiments.

### Weaknesses
1. The idea of BiSAM is very good, but its performance in experiments is only marginally better than SAM. The improvement over SAM is often within the range of error, making it hard to believe that it is an enhancement of SAM.

2. Can you explain why BiSAM using tanh as the lower bound has higher test accuracy on CIFAR-10 compared to using -log as the lower bound, but the results are the opposite on CIFAR-100?

3. Could you combine the characteristics of tanh and -log to create a new lower bound that is suitable for different datasets?

### Summary
Motivated by the min-max nature of sharpness-aware minimization (SAM), the paper develops a reformulation of SAM using bilevel optimization called BiSAM. This approach can be viewed as a continuous relaxation of SAM with 0-1 loss and the authors argue it provides a tighter bound on generalization gap. Numerical experiments are conducted to demonstrate the empirical improvement of BiSAM over original SAM.

### Strengths
The presentation of the work is clear to me. In particular, the motivation of using different bounds for min and max parts to handle the discrete 0-1 loss looks insightful to me and this naturally leads to the development of bilevel approaches. The numerical comparisons of BiSAM and SAM are conducted on various models to demonstrate the possible practical benefits of BiSAM. The authors also show that BiSAM can be easily embedded into variants of SAM such as adaptive SAM and efficient SAM.

### Weaknesses
 - The significance of the contribution is unclear to me. According to the numerical experiments conducted, the improvement of BiSAM over original SAM seems quite minor. Based on the standard deviation provided, it is hard to conclude that the improvements are due to randomness or indeed statistically significant.
- In turn, this makes me wonder if there is any real benefit of approximating 0-1 loss (via this bilevel method) instead of cross-entropy. The authors argue that directly building SAM over 0-1 loss provides tighter generalization bound but more discussions are required.

### Questions
Major comments:

- The major concern is the significance of the contribution. When comparing the performance of BiSAM and SAM, it turns out the improvement in test accuracy is quite minor. Based on the standard deviation provided, it is hard to conclude that the improvements are due to randomness or indeed statistically significant. 
- The motivation behind BiSAM is the benefit of approximating 0-1 loss via BiSAM over continuous surrogate like cross-entropy. The intuition of lower bounding the max part is convincing but I wonder the actual benefit of doing so. In particular, could the authors justify the using of lower bound (11) provides tighter bound than using $L^{ce}$ in the original SAM? I think illustration by a simple synthetic example can help a lot, or through theoretical derivations.


Other comments: 

- Is the term $-\frac{1}{\mu}\log k$ missing in the right-hand-side of Equation (14)?
- In the paragraph below Equation (8), what does this sentence mean: ``it would be wrong to simply replace it by cross-entropy"? I think it is valid to upper bound the right-hand-side of (8) by $L^{ce}$. Is there anything I'm missing?
