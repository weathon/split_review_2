## Abstract
For forecast-informed linear optimization problems, neural networks have shown to be effective tools for achieving robust out-of-sample performance. Various decision-focused learning paradigms have further refined those outcomes by integrating the downstream decision problem in the training pipeline. One of these strategies involves using a convex surrogate of the regret loss function to train the forecaster, called the SPO+ loss function. It allows for the training problem to be reformulated as a linear optimization program. However, this strategy has only been applied to linear forecasters, and is prone to overfitting. In this paper, we propose an extension of the SPO+ reformulation framework that solves the forecaster training procedure using an interior-point optimization method, and tracks the validation regret of intermediate results obtained for different weights of the barrier term. Additionally, we extend the reformulation framework to include the possibility of neural network forecasters with non-linear activation functions. On a real-life experiment of maximizing storage profits in a day-ahead electricity market using actual price data, we show that the proposed methodology effectively solves the problem of overfitting, and that it can outperform other decision-focused benchmarks including training the forecaster with implicit differentiation.

### Summary
Machine learning forecasts are often used as part of downstream decision making tasks, motivating the area of decision-focused learning. In decision-focused learning, the downstream optimization problem is included in the forecasting pipeline by using a task-aware loss function, such as the regret loss. However, these loss functions often have ill-defined gradients, making it difficult to apply gradient descent to minimize the risk. As one way of approaching this problem, a previous work has used a subgradient methods to minimize a convex surrogate of the regret loss. This work proposes an interior point method to solve the forecaster training problem that avoids overfitting by tracking the validation regret obtains by different iterates. An advantage of this approach is that it can accomodate training of neural network forecasters.

### Strengths
1. The problem that the authors study--broadly, how to solve optimization problems by machine learning forecasters, is an important and broadly applicable problem. Practitioners from economics and operations research often interested in problems of this flavor, and it's great that this work aims to develop algorithms that can incorporate flexible forecasters to solve optimization problems.

2. The authors do a good job of summarizing and contextualizing previous work, and they carefully distill the shortcomings of previous approaches.

3. The idea of using a "validation performance tracking procedure," inspired by early stopping, is a simple data-driven approach for preventing overfitting. A common concern in solving data-driven constrained optimization problems is that the solution to the problem may not generalize well out-of-sample. I think this procedure offers a simple, transparent, and promising approach of preventing over-fitting. It's an idea that has come to mind before but I actually haven't seen it formally written up in any works so far. Although the idea is simple, I think this idea could be very useful strategy for handling overfitting in constrained optimization problems, and I would like to see this idea developed with more careful theory in future works.

Overall, I recommend to accept this paper and am willing to raise my score if the authors adequately address the questions listed below. This paper tackles an important and challenging problem, and the ideas that they propose (1) a validation performance tracking strategy to evaluate iterates of an interior point method (2) using interior-point methods to facilitate using neural network forecasters as part of optimization problems--are promising and have the potential to be useful in practice.

### Weaknesses
1. One weakness of this paper is that the authors do not provide very much theoretical justification for why their validation performance tracking procedure may yield improved out-of-sample performance. As a result, the strategy that they propose is largely a heuristic. That being said, I think this heuristic is quite promising and I would hope that future works can develop a rigorous theory to justify this approach.

2. There are some clarity concerns that I had (see questions below), but I believe that these can be addressed with proper writing and motivation.

3. The authors demonstrate a nice proof-of-concept, but I would be interested in seeing a more thorough empirical evaluation, even on synthetic optimization problems.

### Questions
1. It is somewhat unclear what "the ERM" is in the following sentence in the introduction ``Secondly, the ERM can be re-written to a single-level
optimization program by applying duality theory`` -- what ERM problem are the authors referring to? The problem of training the forecaster? The problem of minimizing the regret loss? While this is clarified later in the paper, it would be helpful to make this clear in the introduction as well.

2. In equation 4, the set $S$ is not yet defined? I assume that $S$ is the feasible set for $x$. From the example in Equation 1, I presume that $S = \{ x \mid Ax \geq b}.$ I think it would be helpful if the authors could reiterate the downstream optimization task again in Section 3 for clarity.

3. Do the authors have any intuition on why training a neural network to minimize the SPO+ loss function $l^{SPO+}$ performs poorly?

4. How does the validation performance tracking procedure that the authors propose compare to just solving the original SPO+ problem (Equation 9) with regularization?

5. Could the authors elaborate more on the following sentence: ``We argue
that when the optimization program is an ERM for training a forecaster, the points on the central
path should be regarded as actual intermediate solutions to be tested on the validation set"?

6. The authors make the following comment: ``Since the proposed methodology currently does not involve mini-batches, the IP solution method processes all the train data in a single run.``
Do the authors think it would be possible to implement a ``stochastic`` version of the IP method where a new mini-batch of data could be used to solve for each the optimal parameters in each iteration of the interior-point method? Could this also prevent overfitting? Or do the authors expect this approach to be unstable?

7. The idea of warm-starting the forecaster by first fitting the forecaster with the MSE loss is another useful heuristic--this one is probably used in various prior works. Also, it would great if the authors could comment on how much benefit is derived from each stage of training (how far does fitting with the MSE loss get you? how much additional benefit does the IP method provide?). Is the forecaster that is fit with the MSE loss the ``Initial FC`` in Table 1? In addition, the authors comment that a ``refined`` set of features are used to train the second-stage forecaster, how is this refined set of features selected? Also, could the authors add citations to other works that use the warm-start strategy? 

8. I am struggling to interpret Figure 2. Could the authors explain the difference betwen the SP-R-IP methods they evaluate in the experiments? What is the expected behavior under each of these 3 different algorithms? Are they all variants on the authors' proposed approach? What is the reason that the validation regret of SP-R-IPs and SP-R-IPd oscillates (instead of decreasing monotonically)?

### Confidence
3: You are fairly confident in your assessment. It is possible that you did not understand some parts of the submission or that you are unfamiliar with some pieces of related work. Math/other details were not carefully checked.

### Summary
The paper considers the problem of learning cost functions of linear programs. The decision focused learning aspect incorporates the downstream decisions obtained on solving the estimated linear program. This is usually accomplished by adding a regret loss term in the training procedure. The paper builds upon the SPO+ framework which constructs a convex surrogate for the generally non-convex decision focused loss term. The key idea is to use an interior point method for solving the same surrogate while also incorporating early stopping. The proposed approach extends to both linear and non-linear model classes. Experiments are performed on day-ahead scheduling problem for energy storage.

### Strengths
- The paper does a really good job of introducing the literature to a reader not well-versed with this literature. I think section 3 is a really good setup for understanding both the problem and solution space.

- Although the idea mostly builds upon SPO+ framework, I think it is still valuable as it allows non-linear model classes not possible with the earlier approach.

- The proposed approach does well on an important real-world application related to electricity market.

### Weaknesses
 - I think the comment about treating intermediate points on the path of a interior point solver as intermediate solutions require more justification. I am referring to "However, we argue that when the optimization program is an ERM for training a forecaster, the points on the central path should be regarded as actual intermediate solutions to be tested on the validation set." Please provide some principled justification as this is critical to the early stopping procedure.

 - Does the method's extension to neural networks in Section 4.2 work for any general activation function or is it restricted to just the ReLU function? How does the choice of activation function (i.e. 3rd constraint in (15)) affect the optimization problem?

 - If possible, can you please add error bars to the result in Table 1.

### Summary
The authors propose an approach for decision focused learning in a setting where a neural network is trained to predict latent objective coefficients for a linear program. The proposed approach builds on previous work that trains a linear model by solving an optimization problem that identifies the best linear model leading to high-quality downstream decisions as evaluated by the true objective coefficients. The authors extend this work by proposing a method for finding the best neural network parameters that lead to high quality downstream decisions. The proposed approach formulates this end-to-end pipeline as an optimization problem which is solved using an interior point method which maintains a current solution, comprised of neural network weights, and iteratively updates the solution to trade off avoiding constraint violation versus rewarding higher-quality solutions. The authors compare three versions of their approach for training both neural networks as well as linear models against three previous approaches: an implicit differentiation approach with quadratic smoothing, a subgradient approach, and a subgradient approach with reformulation. They evaluate these methods on one real world dataset for optimal scheduling of energy storage. The results demonstrate that their approach improves over the baselines in performance while it does take extensive time to train. 

With the main strength being the novelty of the approach, there are several limitations in the method and empirical evaluation. If these are addressed, I am happy to increase my score.

### Strengths
The main strength of this approach is that their formulation and solving approach are novel, and they demonstrate improved performance on a real world setting over reasonable baselines. 

The solving approach of interior point method is promising in that it can potentially combine the gradient-based methods that can be used to solved linear programs with the gradient-based methods for training neural networks. Proper combination of these two has the potential to tightly integrate the learning and optimization components for improved performance as suggested in this work.

The method additionally does seem to give improved performance over the investigated baselines in a realistic setting. Additionally, the contribution of this new setting to the space of decision-focused learning will greatly improve the space by introducing another method for evaluation that has real world impact.

### Weaknesses
The main weaknesses of the proposed approach are the running time and the empirical evaluation.

The approach overall seems to take longer due to requiring the solving of a large optimization model with the interior point method, an approach that is known to not scale well. The authors hint that this might be alleviated by using minibatches which seems reasonable in that they could simply iterate by optimizing over a minibatch of problem instances from one iteration to the next. It would be great to understand whether using minibatches improves or harms the training performance as it may make the training process more unstable. Specifically, the computational cost of solving the interior point method at each iteration, especially with a large number of variables and constraints, could be prohibitive. The paper lacks a detailed analysis of how the computational cost scales with the problem size and the number of training iterations. Furthermore, the potential instability introduced by minibatch training needs to be explored, including the impact of batch size on convergence and solution quality.

In the evaluation, there are a number of aspects that would improve the paper.

It would be helpful to evaluate the proposed approach against the relevant baselines. For instance, it would be helpful to compare against the other interior point method for decision-focused learning, in the cited Mandi & Guns 2020 paper. Additionally, consider evaluating against the implicit MLE paper [1], differentiable perturbed optimizers [2], dfl without optimization [3], and using CvxpyLayers [4]. The current evaluation is limited to a single real-world dataset, which makes it difficult to assess the generalizability of the proposed approach. The paper should also consider comparing against other state-of-the-art decision-focused learning methods, including those that use different optimization techniques. Furthermore, the lack of comparison against methods that directly learn decision variables, rather than predicting cost coefficients, is a significant gap in the evaluation.

Furthermore, it would be helpful to evaluate some of the LP-based settings used in previous work. For instance, the bipartite matching setting from the cited Wilder et al. 2018, the warcraft path planning setting from [5], or the shortest path setting from the cited Mandi and Guns 2020 paper. Since the evaluation is solely empirical, it would help to further improve the empirical evaluation by demonstrating that the method works in more settings. The current evaluation lacks diversity in problem structure and size, which limits the conclusions that can be drawn about the method's applicability.

### Questions
Is this method potentially applicable to other optimization frameworks which use interior methods for solving? It seems that it requires taking the dual of the downstream optimization problem. Would it be readily applicable for prediction plus optimization for quadratic programs? Is it possible to extend this framework to differentiation of nonlinear optimization problems?

Why is time bolded for the proposed method when it seems to consistently have high running times especially when compared to the implicit differentiation method?


What is the impact of penalizing the difference between the initial predictions in the formulation? It seems that this is present only for the proposed method but not for the baselines whereas the penalty term could be easily added to the implicit differentiation method by adding a penalty term. It might help to preform an ablation study to understand the impact of training using IP versus adding a penalty for deviating from the initial prediction. For instance, this deviation could also be used for the ID models by adding a loss that penalizes deviation from the initial cost prediction. 

Along the lines of using a pretrained model, does the cold start method have access to the predictions of the pretrained model as it is solving 15? Do the other methods have access to the pretrained model as well in the cold start?

### Summary
This paper builds upon the dual formulation of the Linear Program (LP) Decision Focused Learning (DFL) framework, as initially introduced in Elmachtoub & Grigas (2022), in two notable ways:

1. The introduction of an interior point method to tackle the constraint optimization problem, enhancing the computational efficiency and accuracy of the framework.

2. Expansion of the framework to accommodate non-linear and non-convex mappings, such as neural networks, as opposed to the original work, which exclusively considered linear mappings.

In an empirical assessment conducted on a single dataset, the paper substantiates the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

### Strengths
- The paper presents a commendable mathematical formulation in Section 4, characterized by its clarity and logical coherence. This robust formulation lays a solid foundation for the subsequent analyses and conclusions.

- The experimental comparison conducted in this study is particularly commendable for its reliance on real-world practical data. This empirical approach not only enhances the relevance and applicability of the findings but also underscores the potential real-world impact of the proposed methodology.

### Weaknesses
 - **Novelty and contribution**: The method outlined in this paper is a direct extension of the dual linear programming (LP) approach put forth in Elmachtoub & Grigas (2022). The first contribution, introducing the application of an interior point method (IP) for constrained optimization, represents a straightforward but meaningful addition from an optimization standpoint. Similarly, the second contribution involving the incorporation of neural network (NN) layers into constraints is conceptually clear-cut.

- **Scalability**: The optimization problem defined in equation 15 encompasses all NN layers and parameters, potentially leading to scalability challenges. The authors acknowledge this concern in Section 4.3 and propose heuristics to partially address it. Nonetheless, it is plausible that this issue may persist despite these mitigating measures. The experimental results also reflect this, as the use of a neural network with just one hidden layer took a considerable amount of time to train, surpassing 14,000 seconds. This highlights a critical scalability concern that may limit the practical applicability of the proposed method.

- **Limited experiments**: The validation of the proposed method exclusively on a single dataset may be insufficient to establish its robustness and generalizability. It is advisable to broaden the experimental scope by evaluating the approach across multiple datasets. This would provide a more comprehensive understanding of its performance under diverse conditions and enhance the overall confidence in the proposed methodology. Expanding the experimental validation to encompass a wider range of scenarios would strengthen the empirical foundation of the study.

### Questions
The paper refers to Appendix A to detailed explanation. However, Appendix A lacks such a description. I understand that the derivation follows from Elmachtoub & Grigas (2022) but still, it would be nice to incorporate the detailed derivation in the paper. This is also true for eq. 15.

### Summary
The paper proposes an extension to the SPO+ reformulation of the decision-focused learning problem where the downstream decision problem can be framed with a linear objective. The SPO+ reformulation turns the decision-focused learning problem which is a bi-level optimization problem into solving a linear programming problem. The paper makes extensions on top of the SPO+ reformulation by introducing a neural network to forecast training and using the interior point method to solve the extended problem. To demonstrate the usefulness of the proposed method, the paper carried out experiments on a day-ahead energy scheduling dataset, comparing the proposed method with a wide variety of alternative methods.

### Strengths
* originality: the paper extends the SPO+ reformation of the decision-focused learning problem. I think the extension is not trivial but still somewhat incremental.
* quality: I think the paper properly identifies the limitation of the SPO+ reformation in using a linear forecaster. The paper also provides a solid solution to mitigate this limitation. The proposed method is compared to a variety of alternatives in the experiments.
* clarity: The presentation is clear. I can follow the paper.
* significance: It may help improve the effectiveness of solving the decision-focused learning problem via SPO+ reformulation, although I find it to be an improvement in a niche area.

### Weaknesses
 * I find the paper's contribution to be somewhat incremental. Although I think the technical treatment described in the paper is non-trivial, the idea of replacing a linear forecaster with a non-linear one and the deployment of the interior point method appears to be straightforward observations. The core idea of using a neural network to predict the cost parameters in the SPO+ framework, while practically useful, lacks significant theoretical novelty. The interior point method, while a valid optimization technique, is a well-established approach and its application here doesn't introduce a fundamentally new concept.
* While the paper compared the proposed method with other competing methods, experiments are conducted on one dataset. This may suggest that the proposed method solves a problem in a niche area. The lack of diversity in the experimental setup limits the generalizability of the findings. It's unclear if the performance gains observed on the day-ahead energy scheduling dataset would translate to other problem domains or datasets with different characteristics.
* The method appears to not be fairly efficient and scalable, as evidenced by the need for forecasting and warm starts. The reliance on warm starts, while a common practice, indicates that the method may not be as efficient when applied to new instances without prior information. The need for forecasting also adds a layer of complexity and potential error propagation, which might hinder the scalability of the method to larger problem instances.
