# Noise-guided Unsupervised Outlier Detection

- Decision: Reject
- Avg Score: 3.67

## Abstract
Over the past decade, we have witnessed enormous research on unsupervised outlier detection techniques, ranging from statistical models to recent deep learning-based approaches. Existing approaches generally limit their discussions to unlabelled data mixed with normal data (inliers) and abnormal data (outliers), constituting only a tiny fraction of the whole value space. Such approaches tend to fall into the local optimum of a specific subspace and hardly generalize to diverse datasets. This paper proposes a novel end-to-end Noise-guided unsupervised Outlier Detector (NOD), which infers the anomaly score of the entire value space via a simple MLP to learn the difference between samples and uniform noise. We further theoretically prove that the learned classifier can separate outliers from inliers under a loose condition. Extensive experiments show that NOD significantly advances UOD performance in 22 diverse real-world datasets by an average of 30.6% ROC_AUC against 11 state-of-the-art counterparts without dataset-specific tuning. The merit is of paramount importance for UOD due to the lack of labeled data for supervision.

### Rating

### Confidence
4: You are confident in your assessment, but not absolutely certain. It is unlikely, but not impossible, that you did not understand some parts of the submission or that you are unfamiliar with some pieces of related work.

### Summary
The paper proposes NOD, an anomaly detection method for unsupervised settings. NOD focuses on the idea that instead of separating outliers from inliers, we can actually compare data against uniform random noise to spot changes from normal behavior. Experimental results across several datasets and baselines demonstrate the potential of this solution.

### Strengths
- Timely and challenging problem, especially under unsupervised settings
- Idea is nicely motivated and appears to work well
- Experimental results support the overall claims of this work

### Weaknesses
- Novelty is somewhat low
- Experimental settings not clear for baselines
- Experimental results are not outperforming clearly baselines

### Questions
- Novelty is somewhat low

The idea is nicely motivated at first, but then the novelty becomes unclear. Several earlier solutions (REPEN) seems to rely on similar ideas so this appear to not be novel. The negative examples generation, smoothness prior etc. all components already exist. The work needs to highlight new ideas vs. existing ones and preliminaries can help understand how these solutions build on top of prior work 

- Experimental settings not clear for baselines

Settings for baselines are not clear. The work indicates that they use a particular package and parameters are optimized for these datasets, but these are not clear settings for reproducibility. Clear settings, parameter choices, estimation techniques, etc. need to be provided for the baselines

- Experimental results are not outperforming clearly baselines

Experimental results do not show significant improvement over prior solutions relying on a similar concept (comparison against noise) - REPEN is the second best method and results appear to not be statistically significantly different.

### Summary
The paper proposes NOD, a method for unsupervised outlier detection. NOD trains a binary classifier to distinguish between sample data and generated noise. The score produced by this classifier is considered as the anomaly score of data samples. NOD is backed by some theoretical results.

### Strengths
NOD, being a binary classifier, is very simple and easy to deploy. This simplicity is based on the following reasonings (verbatims of the original text in the paper):
- outliers should be generally sparser distributed than inliers, 
- noises with uniform prior probability density have the maximum entropy, and thus essentially have little chance of resembling structured inputs, hence should have high probability of being outlier than most samples in the original (unlabelled) data, and
- random noise can act as a trustworthy and stable reference for a sample's anomaly degree in the whole data space and demands few assumptions towards the inliers' distribution

Based on the above observations, the authors propose to generate random noises and train the classifier to differentiate between original data samples and noises. My understanding here is this model will assign outliers in the original data higher anomaly score than inliers.

NOD is corroborated by a couple of theoretical results.

Experimental results look comprehensive and solid.

### Weaknesses
From Equations (1) & (2) and Figure 2, one can see that both inliers and outliers in the original data sets are used as positive samples in the training set. But then would this be an issue? Put differently, I don't follow how the binary classifier can distinguish original outliers from inliers given that both belong to the same class in training data.

Propositions, lemmas and theorems are hard to follow. I suggest to have a table of notations used.

The proofs are also not that convincing. For instance, Lemma 1 sounds as if it's applicable to any type of noise. The proof in the Appendix needs specifically generated uniform noise. To fix this, please restate this Lemma (and others) to make clear what kind of inputs are required, e.g. noises generated in a specific way.

### Questions
How can the binary classifier differentiate between inliers and outliers?

The propositions, lemmas and theorems in the paper need to be revised to include all necessary inputs.

In the experiments, NOD is run 20 times. Is this to account for fluctuation between different training rounds?

### Summary
This paper proposes an unsupervised learning-based approach for outlier detection. Specifically, they propose to train a binary anomaly classifier discriminating the given data and the uniform noise. They provide a theoretical analysis supporting the existence of an optimal classifier. To validate their approach, they conducted experiments on 22 different datasets and compared the performance to state-of-the-art baseline methods.

### Strengths
- The introduction effectively conveys a compelling motivation. 
- The suggested approach is straightforward to put into practice. 
- The proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance on diverse real-world datasets. 
- The authors conduct a variety of analyses on their proposed method, making them valuable.

### Weaknesses
- The theory is challenging to comprehend as the explanations are insufficient and lack consistency. 
   - For instance, in Lemma 1, they introduce the density function $\rho$, but it's not clear what the underlying distribution of this density function is and its conceptual interpretation.
   - The proof provided in the appendix is complex to follow and is not self-contained. (please see the questions below)
- Figure 1 is unclear and lacks adequate explanation. 
- There are numerous inconsistent expressions and typos:
  - p.4 Proposition 1 => Assumption 2
  - p.4 socre => score
  - p.4,5 Equ. => Eq.
  - p.5 donot => do not
  - In the proof of lemma 1, x,y => $x,y$
  - In the proof of lemma 1, they use $y$ to denote a data point, but in p.3, $y$ stands for the label. 
- The uniform sampling approach may have limitations in high-dimensional data.

### Questions
- In lemma 1, what is the underlying distribution of $\rho$?
- In the proof of lemma 1 in the appendix, what is the definition of the scaling factor?
- In the proof of lemma 1 in the appendix, what is the source of the term $4\sqrt{dim}$?
- In the proof of lemma 1 in the appendix, what is the meaning of “dataset space”?
- In the proof of lemma 1 in the appendix, what is the meaning of “tag”?
- In figure 1, why assigning the same score to A,B, and C is a disadvantage and limitation of the kNN approach? From the figure, it seems that the kNN approach is able to classify all three points as outliers.
- Can the approach be applied to high-dimensional data, such as ImageNet?
