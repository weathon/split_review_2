- Decision: Accept
- Avg Score: 6.75
- Scores: 8, 6, 5, 8

## Abstract
Recent large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated great potential toward intelligent agents and next-gen automation, but there currently lacks a systematic benchmark for evaluating LLMs' abilities as agents. We introduce \benchmarkname{}: both a challenging benchmark and a methodology for evaluating LLMs as agents. \benchmarkname{} consists of 6 different games, including Rock-Paper-Scissors, Tower of Hanoi, Minecraft. Each game features a unique setting, providing up to 20 evaluation settings and infinite environment variations. Each game in \benchmarkname{} uniquely challenges a subset of 9 important capabilities of an intelligent LLM agent, including reasoning with object dependencies, planning ahead, spatial reasoning, learning from history, and understanding randomness. The distinction between the set of capabilities each game test allows us to analyze each capability separately.
\benchmarkname{} serves not only as a rigorous testing ground for evaluating the overall performance of LLM agents but also as a road-map for identifying gaps in current methodologies.

### Summary
The paper introduces SmartPlay, a benchmark with 6 games, designed to evaluate the capabilities of recent large language models (LLMs) when applied as agents in intelligent automation. The authors identify 4 key challenges important for general intelligent LLM agents but not captured in previous benchmarks: 1) long-horizon planning and execution, 2) understand the odds, 3) spatial reasoning, 4) learn from interactions or mistakes.  The authors claim that each of the games of the new benchmark offers a unique challenge mentioned previously.  Overall, SmartPlay is positioned to push the boundaries of current LLM evaluation methodologies. By systematically assessing the performance of LLMs as agents across a range of games and challenges, SmartPlay aims to provide insights into the current state of LLMs and identify gaps that need to be addressed for the advancement of intelligent agents.

### Strengths
1, SmartPlay is a good benchmark for evaluating the performance of large language models (LLMs) as agents. It introduces a diverse range of games carefully chosen to assess different critical capabilities required for intelligent agents, making SmartPlay a well-structured and challenging platform. 

2, The paper is well-written. The authors clearly articulate the need for such a benchmark and provide enough background and related works to well-position the benchmark. 

3, In addition to introducing the benchmark, the authors also conduct a comparative analysis of current state-of-the-art LLMs using SmartPlay. This comparison is crucial as it validates the effectiveness and rigor of the benchmark, and it provides a snapshot of the current landscape of LLMs' abilities as agents. The findings from this analysis enhance the understanding of LLMs' strengths and weaknesses, identifying areas that require further development and offering clear directions for future research.

### Weaknesses
1, Evaluation metrics proposed in the paper are commonly used in the domain of reinforcement learning (RL). While these metrics are established and provide a common ground for comparison, they may not be entirely suited to capture the unique nuances of planning and reasoning that are specific to LLMs functioning as agents. The paper could be strengthened by proposing or developing novel metrics that are tailored to the particular dynamics of LLMs' operational framework, offering a more precise measurement of their planning, reasoning, and adaptability skills in agent-based scenarios.

2, Is it possible to craft the prompt to show the flow of reasoning and planning when LLMs as agents play the games?

# Post Rebuttal

I appreciate the efforts made by the authors. Their rebuttal clarify lots of my concerns, and thus, I raised my scores. However, I believe I am not an expert in the field of LLM-Agent --> I am just okay with its acceptance.

### Strengths
This paper takes a step towards a crucial need in the field of LLM for a standardized benchmark to evaluate the agent-like abilities of LLMs. SmartPlay is presented as both a benchmark and a methodological tool, which may be a good contribution to the research community. By offering a variety of games that test a comprehensive set of agent capabilities, the benchmark allows for a detailed assessment of LLMs beyond language-solely-based tasks. The commitment to providing an open-source benchmark (referenced GitHub repository) is commendable and encourages community engagement and continuous improvement. The paper is well-structured and provides good explanations of the games and the intended capabilities they aim to evaluate.

Extensive evaluation of existing LLM are provided in Table2. Some analysis are also included to emphaize the need of the proposed benchmark. Also, the results show the gap between open-sourced LLM and commercial LLM.

### Weaknesses
I believe the starting point, i.e. evaluating the LLM in the context of intelligent agent, is crucial to our community. However, I am unsure if the proposed games can well evaluate this aspects: (1) the games are still too simple to solve real-world challenges; specifically, the games lack the complexity and open-endedness of real-world scenarios, potentially failing to capture the nuances of agent behavior in dynamic and unpredictable environments. For instance, the deterministic nature of games like Tower of Hanoi contrasts sharply with the stochasticity and ambiguity inherent in real-world tasks; (2) It is unclear which games correspond to which nine abilities to which levels; the mapping between the games and the nine agent abilities lacks granularity. The paper does not specify the level of proficiency required in each ability for each game, making it difficult to interpret the results. For example, it's unclear how playing Minecraft at a basic level translates to advanced spatial reasoning skills; (3) why human has all 1 for all the games? why davinci-model has 1.04 on bandit? The normalization process, while intended to provide a clear comparison, introduces some confusion. The fact that human performance is uniformly set to 1 across all games raises questions about the validity of this baseline, especially when considering the diverse nature of the games. Also, the slightly higher-than-human score of text-davinci on the bandit game is counter-intuitive and warrants further explanation. 

Besides, there may be concerns regarding the scalability of the benchmark and whether it can keep pace with the rapid advancements in LLMs. 

Additionally, the paper might benefit from a more detailed discussion on the implications of these benchmarks in real-world scenarios and how they reflect the complexities of actual agent tasks.

### Summary
Summary: 

The paper introduces "SmartPlay," a benchmark designed to evaluate Large Language Models (LLMs) in the role of intelligent agents. The authors emphasize the growing potential of LLMs in intelligent agents and next-generation automation, highlighting the need for a systematic benchmark to assess their capabilities.

Main Contributions are as follows:
1. **Introduction of SmartPlay**: The paper presents SmartPlay as both a challenging benchmark and a methodology for evaluating LLMs as intelligent agents.
2. **Diverse Game Set**: SmartPlay includes a set of 6 different games, such as Rock-Paper-Scissors, Tower of Hanoi, and Minecraft, each with its unique setting. These games collectively offer up to 20 evaluation settings and infinite environment variations.
3. **Capability Assessment**: Each game in SmartPlay is designed to challenge a subset of 9 crucial capabilities of an intelligent LLM agent. These capabilities include reasoning with object dependencies, planning ahead, spatial reasoning, learning from history, and understanding randomness.
4. **Comprehensive Evaluation**: Through the diverse set of games and challenges, SmartPlay aims to provide a comprehensive evaluation of LLMs’ abilities as agents.

### Strengths
1. **Definition and Problem Formulation**: The paper introduces a new benchmark, SmartPlay, specifically designed to evaluate Large Language Models (LLMs) as intelligent agents. This represents a novel approach to addressing the current gap in systematic evaluation methods for LLMs in agent-based roles.
2. **Well-Defined Benchmark**: SmartPlay is presented in a structured manner, with explanations of the different games and the specific capabilities they assess. This clarity aids in understanding the paper's objectives and the proposed methodology.

### Weaknesses
1. **concerns on fairness for different LLM**: The author solely relied on a pre-trained LLM for evaluation in these environments. However, since various language models are trained on different corpora and some remain undisclosed (such as close-source OpenAI language models), it becomes challenging to ascertain whether the LLM has been exposed to these specific environments. For instance, GPT possesses extensive knowledge of Minecraft, whereas LLAMA has relatively limited knowledge in this area. Consequently, ensuring fairness in direct comparisons of evaluations becomes difficult. To address this issue, I recommend that the author gather sufficient data for each environment and evaluate the capabilities of different language models separately using zero-shot learning, few-shot in-context learning, and instruction tuning approaches.
2. **concerns on 3d spatial reasoning performance of LLM**: I noticed that current Large Language Models (LLMs) struggle with 3D spatial reasoning in environments like Minecraft. This could be due to the lack of visual information in their training data, making it difficult to directly apply LLMs to tasks in this dataset. The author attempted to describe visual images using text, but previous experiments have shown this approach to be impractical. Additionally, the source of these visual descriptions was not explained by the author. Can models like LLaVA, GPT-4V, and Flamingo overcome these challenges by being fine-tuned with visual images and other relevant information?
3. **concerns on difficulty computation**: The setting of difficulty for each game seems quite arbitrary. How are these difficulties determined? Are they based on human evaluation? I suggest the author provide clear explanations regarding this.
4. **concerns on prompt design for different llms**: Despite instruction tuning, the performance of LLM still relies on prompt design. It is best to conduct explicit experiments and explanations on prompt design.

### Questions
1. The author can use **one** simulator to assess the various abilities of the LLM agent, rather than relying on multiple simulators for each ability. For instance, Minecraft offers an open world with numerous engaging tasks that require long-term planning and learning from interactions. However, the author only utilized Minecraft to evaluate the LLM agent's 3D spatial reasoning skills. Another convenient and popular option is a readily installable simulator package that is user-friendly.
2. **Comparison with Existing Benchmarks**: The paper could be strengthened by comparing SmartPlay’s performance and effectiveness in evaluating LLMs against existing benchmarks or evaluation methodologies, if any are available.
3. There are some typos and table type errors.

### Confidence
4: You are confident in your assessment, but not absolutely certain. It is unlikely, but not impossible, that you did not understand some parts of the submission or that you are unfamiliar with some pieces of related work.

### Summary
The paper presents SmartPlay, a benchmark that turns a number of control-agent environments applicable for LLMs by providing observations and actions in text format. The benchmark involves 20 unique evaluation settings, together spanning 9 different important capabilities highlighted by the paper. Results with different LLMs indicate that GPT-4 and its variants outperform other LLMs across the different tasks.

### Strengths
This type of work, presenting benchmarks and evaluation settings, is direly required in the LLM-as-agents space. Recent publications have each come up with their own ways of interfacing with environments and defining new tasks, and it is impossible to tell which agents are "more capable" than others. This work is a clear stepping-stone in defining standardized sets across different domains.

### Originality

Very original, no other exhaustive benchmarks in this domain exist.

### Quality

Moderate to high quality. The benchmark is exhaustive in terms of different environments and challanges included, as well as conducting basic baselines. However some details and potentially expected benchmarks are missing (see weaknesses).

### Clarity

Paper is well structured and easy to read for the most part.

### Significance

This paper, and the benchmark, can be important motivators and stepping stones for people to create comparable results between different LLM agent solutions. While I do not expect this to become de-facto way of measuring agent performance, I believe it will serve as a fixed benchmark, and in future people can improve upon it when needed. I believe this is a very significant contribution for ICLR readers.

### Weaknesses
The paper omits bunch of important details and is vague at parts, which is why I am setting my recommendation to "borderline accept" in the first rating.

### Missing details

Some important details to function as a benchmark are missing, such as  _how_ the evaluation of new LLMs/agents should be done (e.g., number of episodes, at minimum. Are users allowed to change the environment? Can users change the prompt manually before feeding to the agent?)

Details/motivation of the different capabilities is missing (see questions). I feel this need to be clarified and carefully motivated for a solid case why these capabilities matter and how they are properly measured.

Other important details (e.g., human baseline collection) are missing. See questions.

### (Minor) Missing baselines/experiments

While having a fixed, single way of defining prompts makes the benchmark fixed and results comparable across models, I think there should be an option to try different techniques of prompting the models. E.g., chain-of-thought [1] can, with simple modifications to the prompt, improve results in LLM space (see questions).

### Questions
1) How were numbers for the spider plots in Figure 2 came up with? On left it shows three degrees for every capability, but it is not obvious if it directly maps to different levels in the spider plot. If numbers on spider plot should reflect these three levels, I'd recommend adding the labels to the spider plots so reader knows to connect the two. Additionally Table 3 in the Appendix has four degrees for some of the capabilities (e.g., long text understanding), but this is not shown in Figure 2. Is this to save space or an oversight? If anyway possible, I'd recommend keeping the two consistent to avoid confusion.
2) How were the capabilities chosen, and how would you exactly define their different degrees and their importance to the LLM research? By reading the paper, it seems they stem from the environments you chose, but they still come out as somewhat vague (e.g., what is "Randomness", exactly? Randomness in what? What is "Reasoning with object dependencies"? What is "rollback" error handling?). A valuable contribution would be to add as exact definitions as you can come up with, and detail them in a new section of the paper. The choice of your games helps you keep grounded to what can be measured, and by defining the metrics accuratelly, other researchers can bring new environments / dimensions into the mix.
3) Likewise, can you provide exact details on the environments used in your benchmark package? While the code will allow exact reproduction, it might get updated as it lives on Github, so having a one solid description of the originally proposed setup would be beneficial.
4) Have you experiment with ways to improve model performance by, e.g., chain-of-thought [1] prompting? These seem to improve models' performance across different tasks, and I feel this should be supported by this benchmark. E.g., you could add a flag or mutator or wrapper to your environment that adds/modifies the instructions/observations. Seeing initial results with these would strengthen the paper, but not necessary; my core request is to think these possibilities and also support them.
5) How was the "human baseline" obtained, exactly? Did they play the games through the same exact API as the LLMs play (i.e., via text)? Were they familiar with the environments beforehand? Were there multiple human players? Likewise, how was the zero value defined in Table 2? Was it a random agent or literal 0 value for the score?
