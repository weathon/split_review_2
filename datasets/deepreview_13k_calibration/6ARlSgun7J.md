## Abstract
Extreme Classification (XC) architectures, which utilize a massive One-vs-All (OvA) classifier layer at the output, have demonstrated remarkable performance on problems with large label sets. Nonetheless, these architectures falter on tail labels with few representative samples. This phenomenon has been attributed to factors such as classifier over-fitting and missing label bias, and solutions involving regularization and loss re-calibration have been developed. This paper explores the impact of label variance - a previously unexamined factor - on the tail performance in extreme classifiers. It also develops a method to systematically reduce label variance in XC by transferring the knowledge from a specialized tail-robust teacher model to the OvA classifiers. For this purpose, it proposes a principled knowledge distillation framework, LEVER, which enhances the tail performance in extreme classifiers with formal guarantees on generalization. Comprehensive experiments are conducted on a diverse set of XC datasets, demonstrating that LEVER can enhance tail performance by around 5\% and 6\% points in PSP and coverage metrics, respectively, when integrated with leading extreme classifiers. Moreover, it establishes a new state-of-the-art when added to the top-performing Renee classifier. Extensive ablations and analyses substantiate the efficacy of our design choices. Another significant contribution is the release of two new XC datasets that are different from and more challenging than the available benchmark datasets, thereby encouraging more rigorous algorithmic evaluation in the future. Code for LEVER is available at: aka.ms/lever.

### Summary
The paper presents a methodology for improving performance on tail-labels. The main observation behind the proposed approach is that there is a significant variance in the label distribution due to the finite and even scarce number of data points for tail-labels in the extreme classification. The paper builds a connection with an existing work (Menon et al. 2021), on which it heavily relies, for most of the motivation, to propose a variance reduction strategy (Theorem 1 in the paper & discussion thereafter) and hence improvement in the generalization error. 

The focus of the approach (generalization analysis) is on the last/classification layer of the network. The above generalization analysis leads to an augmented objective which, in addition to standard hard labels, also consists of a loss term consisting of soft labels from a teacher model, for which recent frameworks based on Siamese training are exploited. The proposed approach is tested on a range of datasets from the extreme classification repository, and it is shown that the proposed approach leads to significant improvements in the prediction performance in terms of P@k and PSP@k metrics. The augmentation strategy is also compared to existing methods for data augmentation in extreme classification to further demonstrate its general applicability.

### Strengths
1. The paper attempts to address a key shortcoming of existing methods in extreme classification i.e. performance of sota methods on tail-labels, which despite its importance, doesn’t get much focus of research.

2. The experimental results of the paper are quite impressive, and significant gains on a range of datasets, and methods are shown, thereby demonstrating its general applicability. Overall, the experimental setup is quite detailed.

3. The paper also contributes two additional datasets (LF-AOL-270K, and LF-WikiHierarchy-1M), which may be helpful for the community.

### Weaknesses
1. The main shortcoming of the paper is the lack of novelty in the main idea and the approach :

1a) In terms of the content i.e. the main theoretical results such as Theorem 1, its proof, the idea to reduce variance for improving generalization, using soft-labels in teacher-student setup has already been explored in the existing work of Menon et al 2021. It seems that the paper attempts to build a loose bridge between this earlier theoretical work to build a weighting scheme and soft-labels (equation 9).

1b) The paper claims that the variance issue for tail-labels has not been explored so far. However, this seems not quite true, as a similar concern has been raised in the earlier work Babbar and Scholkopf 2019, where there was a similar argument that due to the lack of data in tail-labels, for a given class label, there is high variance between the input features between two samples.

2) There also seems to be a lack of consistency in terms of using the symbols and notation in many places. For instance, X is used in Section 3.1 to denote a (random?) instance in the input space $\mathcal{X}$. However, the same is used to limit the norm of x in the same section. For equation (1), should the LHS also not be conditioned on x i.e. V[y|x]. It is not clear why there are two different symbols for the sub-script (small-case) x. Why the equation (6) is defined in terms of a trained classifier w*, while the standard generalization results are stated in terms of all possible classifiers in the hypothesis class. The theorem statement needs to be on a better formal footing as done in the original paper Menon et al. 2021, the current version is incomplete and unclear.

3. In terms of properly citing related work, the paper falls somewhat short. For instance, the paper introduces the need to use calibrated losses without a proper justification to use calibrated losses or a reference thereof. It does not seem to be in the sense of the word used in the last sentence of page 1. Another concern is the lack of setting the right context for the cited papers.  As mentioned above, the high variance problem for tail-labels has also been explored. As another instance, the work of Schultheis et al. 2022 is cited but the correct context is in the related work section when discussing Missing and Tail-labels in Section 2.2, and not only later down in discussing coverage as a metric. Even though the paper has been cited, it is not in the right context. In terms of the main classifier, the focus of the paper is on one-vs-rest approaches, while DiSMEC which initiated this approach in extreme settings isn’t referred.

### Summary
The paper introduces a new extreme multi-label classification algorithm called LEVER, that aims to improve the existing methods by proposing training with a loss function that combines loss calculated on observed hard labels and soft labels coming from the teacher model, which is assumed to have superior performance on the tail labels. The teacher model used by the authors in the empirical part of the paper is a Siamese-style neural network that leverages label features and is trained with a logistic-loss-based objective, which was found to yield calibrated estimates of the marginal probabilities of labels. The authors demonstrate the attractiveness of the proposed approach in the exhaustive empirical comparison when they used 4 popular XMLC benchmarks, introduced 2 new benchmarks, and combined the proposed approach with 3 SOTA methods. The proposed approach, in many cases, significantly improves the performance on standard precision@k, propensity-scored precision@k, and coverage@k.

### Strengths
1. The paper is well-written and easy to follow.
2. The proposed method is simple to apply to a wide range of XML classifiers.
3. The exhausting empirical comparison proved the attractiveness of the proposed method.
4. In addition to the main results, the authors provide a wide array of additional experiments in the appendix.
5. Two new datasets additionally strengthen the contribution of this work.

### Weaknesses
1. The proposed method is just a combination of loss with hard and soft labels, which is a simple idea.
2. I find the theoretical results rather simplistic, expected, and being there to serve as just justification for the applied method rather than its original motivation.
3. This part of the paper especially confirms that for me:

   > Notably, if we have precise estimates of marginal relevance, denoted by $p_x = E[y|x]$, we can replace $y$ with $p_x$, effectively reducing the variance term to 0 and thereby improving classifier generalization. This principle forms the foundation for the LEVER framework, which employs an additional teacher network to provide accurate estimates of $p_x$.

   If we have a model that provides good estimates $p_x$ then we don't need to train another one, the XMLC task is already solved! The strength of the method seems to lay in the properly selected trade-off between loss calculated on hard observed labels and soft labels coming from the teacher network that seems to be much better on tail-labels thanks to leveraging labels-side information. 

4. From the appendix, I understand that $\lambda = 0.05$ (the variable that weights the hard and soft part of the loss) was used for all the experiments. Since the choice of $\lambda$ seems to be crucial for the method. I find the lack of further comments on it and experiments demonstrating its impact the biggest weakness of this paper.

### Questions
1. As I mentioned in the weakness section, I would like to see how different values of $\lambda$ impact the final performance and what the trade-off curve between head-labels and tail-labels performance looks like. Could the authors comment on that?
2. On the LF-AOL-270K dataset, LEVER combined with ELIAS yields extremely high improvement on standard precision@k, especially at @5. These seem almost unrealistic when compared with scores of other methods. Are these numbers for sure correct? If yes, do the authors have any explanation for this result?

### Summary
This paper aims to improve the tail labels performance of the extreme multi-label classification (XMC) problems. The paper propose LEVER, a knowledge distillation framework, that learns student OVA classifiers with binary relevance true labels and soft-labels generated by teacher bi-encoders. The author claims that bi-encoders have better performance on tail labels, and hence using their soft labels as additional signals to learn the student OVA classifiers can help reduce the variance for tail labels. Empirically, LEVER demonstrated consistent improvement upon competitive OVA classifiers on a wide-range of XMC datasets.

### Strengths
1. The paper writing is easy to follow
2. Empirical results are strong

### Weaknesses
1. Its questionable that using "pairwise" logistic loss (Eq.10) lead to calibrated scores
2. Some experiment settings are not clear from the main text. See detailed questions below.
3. Missing proper evaluation metrics (i.e., Macro-average Precision/Recall/F1) for tail-labels performance

### Questions
## 1. Calibrated Scores
Its well known that pairwise ranking losses (e.g., Equation (10) of this submission) is shift-invariant hence may not produce calibrated scores, as pointed out by [1]. Why not considering point-wise loss functions or hybrid objectives [1] (listwise Softmax + pointwise BCE) to produce more calibrated scores?

## 2. Experiment Settings and Results
(1) What's the model size for each method in Table 1 and Table 2? The model size should include every component needed to do inference. For example, does ELIAS and ELIAS+LEVER have the same model size, as LEVER is just in-place modifying the OVA classifiers of LEVER? If not, I am concern about the performance gain of LEVER is due to additional model capacity. 

(2) In Table 1, ELIAS+LEVER achieved >20% absolute gain on LF-AOL-270K in P@3 and P@5. If not a typo, any insight why such significant gain? Similar questions to ELIAS+LEVER on LF-Wiki-1M, PSP metrics.

(3) On page 9, the author claims the training time of LEVER only increased by at most 2x. Does that include (a) training time of teacher bi-encoders (b) prediction time of teacher bi-encoder to generate soft-labels (c) training time of student OVA classifiers which are trained by not only sparse ground truth labels but also dense soft-labels? If so, what's the detailed breakdown in terms of those three components?

(4) Suppose the ground truth label matrix is a sparse $N \times L$ matrix. How dense are the soft-labels generated by LEVER? Does the performance of LEVER vary when using different top-$k$ soft-labels per input?

## 3. Macro-averaged Evaluation Metrics
To properly measure the performance of long-tailed labels, text classification community often consider Macro-average Precision/Recall/F1 metrics [2,3,4]. The author should also report Macro-averaged metrics to further validate the major claim of LEVER, which is the the performance gain on tailed-labels.

### Summary
This paper investigates a novel factor, label variance, in the context of tail performance in extreme classifiers. To address this issue, the authors propose LEVER, a knowledge distillation framework that leverages a robust teacher model to reduce label variance. Experimental results demonstrate that LEVER significantly improves tail performance, achieving approximately 5% and 6% increases in PSP and Coverage metrics, respectively, when integrated with state-of-the-art extreme classifiers.

### Strengths
1. The paper give a proof of the correlation between the generalization performance of a classifier and the variance in labels.
2. Use a Siamese- style model as a teacher to help reduce the label variance effects.
3. The extensive experiment results are promising.
4. The paper contribute two new datasets to the field.

### Weaknesses
1. The readability of the paper is not strong, and the formatting is uncomfortable. For example, the abstract should generally be a single paragraph, there are too many blank spaces before and after Section 2 Related Work, and the spacing of equations is large. With ample space in the appendix, the full text does not fill up the nine pages. Improvements are needed in basic writing formatting and readability.
2. The paper has limited novelty. From a personal perspective, the innovation lies in using a teacher model to predict probabilities. The rest of the paper mainly demonstrates the significant impact of tail classes. From the perspective of innovative design, it is not convincing. It is also unclear why the teacher model can provide accurate estimates of $p_x$.
3. There is limited description regarding fair comparisons. After introducing the teacher model, the training process and time will be affected. The main part should devote more space to introducing the teacher model, analyzing its performance, and comparing the training time with other models.

### Questions
1. Can the teacher model be adapted to the current task? How does its performance compare? What are the differences between directly using a better model for distillation and utilizing the results of other models as auxiliary information in this paper?
2. Refer to the weaknesses mentioned.
