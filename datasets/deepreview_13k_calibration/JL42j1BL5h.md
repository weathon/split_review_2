## Abstract
Ensuring safety is fundamental when developing and deploying large language models (LLMs).
However, previous safety benchmarks only concern the safety in one language, e.g., the majority language in the pretraining data, such as English.
In this work, we build the first multilingual safety benchmark for LLMs, \textsc{XSafety}, in response to the global deployment of LLMs in practice. \textsc{XSafety} covers 14 commonly used safety issues across ten languages spanning several language families. 
We utilize \textsc{XSafety} to empirically study the multilingual safety for four widely-used LLMs, including closed-source APIs and open-source models. Experimental results show that all LLMs produce significantly more unsafe responses for non-English queries than English ones, indicating the necessity of developing safety alignment for non-English languages. 
In addition, we propose a simple and effective prompting method to improve ChatGPT's multilingual safety by enhancing cross-lingual generalization of safety alignment. 
Our prompting method can significantly reduce the ratio of unsafe responses by 42\% for non-English queries.

5: You are absolutely certain about your assessment. You are very familiar with the related work and checked the math/other details carefully.

### Summary
The paper introduces XSAFETY, a new benchmark for evaluating the multilingual safety of LLMs across 10 languages and 14 safety issues. The paper shows that LLMs are significantly less safe in non-English languages than in English, and proposes prompting methods to improve multilingual safety.

### Strengths
1. The paper proposes a valuable multilingual safety benchmark, that enables a systematic and comprehensive assessment of the safety performance of LLMs across different languages and scenarios.

2. This comprehensive analysis effectively sheds light on the potential risks and challenges associated with deploying LLMs in multilingual settings.

### Weaknesses
1. The motivation behind the benchmark is to address safety issues in global deployments, as indicated by the title "All languages matter". However, the current selection of translated languages primarily focuses on high-resource languages, which limits the comprehensiveness and representativeness of the evaluation. Additionally, the inclusion of only two low-resource languages, Bengali and Hindi, both from South Asia, further exacerbates this limitation.

2. The proposed prompting methods lack novelty and, as mentioned in the footnote on page 8, they only exhibit marginal improvements on models other than ChatGPT. While these three models are less safe than ChatGPT and have a higher demand for safety, as demonstrated in Table 5, the effectiveness of these methods is limited.

3. Ensuring accurate annotation in a multilingual dataset is a challenging task that requires a rigorous verification process. However, the annotation process employed by XSAFETY and the validation of automatic evaluation lack essential details for standard data validation, such as cross-validation, and inter-annotator agreement.

4. ChatGPT is chosen as both the tested model and the evaluator model, meaning it needs to assess its output. However, this self-evaluation approach diminishes the reliability of the assessment. To enhance the reliability, additional steps or more advanced models should be explored.

### Questions
1. The second line below Table 3 mentioned XLingPrompt3, but it's never introduced in this paper.

2. Can LLMs understand user input and generate coherent responses in non-English languages, especially Hindi and Bengali, considering their limited multilingual capabilities?

### Summary
This paper proposes a new benchmark for safety of LLMs across multiple languages. This is done by translating two existing datasets by Sun et al. and Levy at al. from Chinese and English respectively.

### Strengths
Overall, I think this contribution is very nice in some ways. I do think it'd be very good to have a better idea of whether safety guardrails are equally effective across languages.

### Weaknesses
However, I'm pretty concerned with the evaluation methodology. Arguably I am being a bit picky here, but given the importance of this topic and the fact that the benchmark could become standard if it is published at a prominent venue such as ICLR, I am a bit hesitant to suggest that the paper be accepted in its current form.

1. All of the text is Google translated from English or Chinese. There is a possibility that translating this data across cultures would result in it not being representative of the harms that appear in those cultures. There is a good example of removing the China-specific safety questions from the Sun et al. dataset.
2. There is a manual evaluation of 50 instances only from the Crimes and Illegal Activities and Goal Hijacking scenario indicating 94% accuracy, and it is not clear what language the model was queried in. This is a small number on a very limited subset of the data, so I am not sure how trustworthy this accuracy number is.
3. There are no actual qualitative examples or data provided with the submission, so I am not able to further validate and understand whether I test the benchmark results or not.

If the authors could address these concerns about the validity during the response period I would be willing to raise my score, as I do think that the general idea of this benchmark is compelling.

4. Finally, I believe that the authors did not mention that they would release any software or data. I would like to know if this framework will be released for others to benchmark systems against.

### Summary
The paper focuses on evaluating safety of LLMs in multilingual setup. To do so, it describe how the multilingual benchmark for safety is created by post-editing Google Translate outputs of the Safety dataset from (Sun et al., 2023) and Commonsense safety from (Levy et al., 2022). The authors evaluated ChatGPT, PALM2, LLaMA2, Vicuna on the benchmark and found that the percentage of unsafe responses is higher for non-English languages. The authors proposed a mitigation via prompting schemes that explicitly ask for safe responses or to “think” in English then answer in foreign languages.

### Strengths
- Benchmarking safety is important for making progress in safety research. This paper expands the benmark in Chinese and English to multiple languages is an important step.
- Propose a simple set of prompts that could potentially improve safety responses from LLM.

### Weaknesses
 - The benchmark is based on the work of (Sun et al., 2023), which hasn’t been peer-reviewed thus I’m not sure about the validity of the dataset and the broader taxonomy in (Sun et al., 2023). It’s also worth to mention that I read (Sun et al., 2023) but the examples are provided in Chinese without gloss so I can’t access the quality of the dataset in (Sun et al., 2023)

- While the work focuses on evaluating English-centric LLMs, the benchmark is mainly derived from the Chinese dataset in (Sun et al., 2023). This could potentially be biased toward safety assessment in Chinese rather than English. While the authors attempted to remove culture specific (Chinese) aspects from the dataset. It’s unclear to me why this dataset is a good starting point for building the multilingual benchmark As benchmarking is a very important step toward making LLMs more safe, I would expect much of the text dedicated to describe and convince the reader that the benchmark is adequate and well constructed. 

- Using chatGPT as an evaluator for safety doesn’t seem like a good idea to me. The authors have stated that safety is a very important issue, to which I agree. As such an important issue, human evaluation should be done rather than using another LLM. Human evaluation is only conducted on 50 samples from Crimes and Illegal Activities and Goal Hijacking scenarios. What languages do these 50 samples come from? What is the quality of the translation of the responses? 50 samples seem too small for human evaluation and to make a statement about multilingual performance of LLMs. Moreover, it’s unclear if we can trust chatGPT on other scenarios in the taxonomy.

- While this is not a major weakness, the authors tried to provide some estimate about the percentage of language data in each LLMs. While I appreciate this effort, I don’t think Table 4 makes sense. Training data for GPT-2 is **NOT** the training data for chatGPT. And PALM2 training data is **NOT** the training data of PALM. Thus that information is not relevant at all in the paper.

- Finally, I have a meta-concern/question about the setup. If culture specific is removed from the safety benchmark then is it an interesting problem to study? If everything can be mapped to English and the model chooses to respond or not based on its safeguard then is it just a machine translation problem? In the experiment when the prompt asks chatGPT to think in English then answer, is it just a specific instance of implicit translation?

4: You are confident in your assessment, but not absolutely certain. It is unlikely, but not impossible, that you did not understand some parts of the submission or that you are unfamiliar with some pieces of related work.

### Summary
This paper studies whether the safety performance of popular LLMs is lower when prompted in languages other than English. The authors create a new dataset and establish that this is indeed the case. They also offer prompts that improve the safety performance in the target languages.

### Strengths
1. The paper addresses an important problem: LLMs, even when not designed to work in languages other than English, have been trained on non-English data. As a result result they can be used in these languages, and people do use them. However, if the safety alignment only targets English, this can result in a significant disparity in the outcomes, beyond simple performance differences. That is why multilingual safety evaluation of LLMs is very important.
2. The paper demonstrates that significant safety disparities do exist between languages.
3. The paper shows that simple prompting strategies can reduce these disparities.
4. The paper offers a new dataset, which while being machine-translated, has been checked by professional translators.
5. The authors also validate that their automated evaluation using Google Translator is good enough by again using professional translators.

### Weaknesses
1. The “The Resulting XSAFETY Benchmark” paragraph is not all clear. I don’t see why “if each unique Chinese phrase is consistently translated into the same phrase across instances for another language, the datasets of the two languages should share similar data distributions”. Especially considering that different languages have different grammar and large part of the tokens is not topic-specific. You say “Both quantitative and qualitative analyses show that the XSAFETY benchmark shares similar data distributions across languages, indicating the possibly consistent translation as expected.” but where is this analysis? Furthermore, the “translation” of ませ and すれ is not a translation but rather transliteration. They are both parts of grammatical constructs and hence not translatable. Overall, this paragraph seems unmotivated and poorly defended. Won’t the issue be resolved by simply having multiple translations and variations per sample? And similarly augment the original corpus? This would also make the results more robust to the choice of words and phrasing.
2. The “Models” paragraph seems to be mostly pure guessing of the language distribution in the pretraining data. It is not clear that the GPT-3 distribution is representative for ChatGPT, and furthermore, depending on whether one uses the 3.5 or 4 version of ChatGPT the number could be even more different. The values for PaLM 2 seem to be not “estimated” but “guessed”. The issue is further complicated because of language similarity: German, French, Italian, Spanish, Dutch, etc. can result in cross-language learning while others, e.g. Korean cannot. Overall, this analysis does not seem to be necessary for the conclusions of the paper, so I am not sure what purpose it serves.
3. I am missing a discussion on the limitations of the work.
4. Neither the dataset nor the results (actual model responses) have been provided.
5. The dataset offered consists of translated samples of two prior works. However, there is no mention of their licences and whether they allow for such a use or not.

### Questions
1. You say that “Bengali, Hindi, and Japanese are […] generally are the most low-resource languages in the preatraining data of LLMs”. However, is this really the case or are these just the languages with least resources amongst the one that you consider? Generally, LLMs see much less data in, e.g. Tibetan, Burmese, Shan, etc, than, e.g. in Japanese.
2. Are the prompts that you propose in 4.3.1 always provided in English or are they also translated?
3. How come that the XLing1 prompt actually increases the unsafe ratio for Hindi?
4. When you prompt the model to “think” how do you implement this? Does the model “think” by generating first an output in English and then respond in the target language (similar to chain-of-thought prompting) or do you expect it to internally do this thinking?
