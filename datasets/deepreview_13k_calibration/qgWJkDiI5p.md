## Abstract
Normalization layers are ubiquitous in deep learning, greatly accelerating optimization. However, they also introduce many unexpected phenomena during training, for example, the Fast Equilibrium conjecture proposed by (Li et al.,2020), which states that the scale-invariant normalized network, when trained by SGD with $\eta$ learning rate and $\lambda$ weight decay, mixes to an equilibrium in $\tilde{O}(1/\eta\lambda)$ steps, as opposed to classical $e^{O(\eta^{-1})}$ mixing time. Recent works by Wang & Wang (2022); Li et al. (2022c)  proved this conjecture under different sets of assumptions. This paper aims to answer the fast equilibrium conjecture in full generality by removing the non-generic assumptions of Wang & Wang (2022); Li et al. (2022c) that the minima are isolated, that the region near minima forms a unique basin, and that the set of minima is an analytic set. Our main technical contribution is to show that with probability close to 1,  in exponential time trajectories will not escape the attracting basin containing its initial position.

### Summary
This paper proves the fast equilibrium conjecture for SGD on neural nets with normalization layers in a more general setting than previous works Li et al., 2022c and Wang & Wang, 2022. Specifically, it shows that the conjecture still holds without the unique basin and analyticity assumptions made in Li et al., 2022c. The theoretical results are further supported by experiments.

### Strengths
This paper is mathematically solid. It extends the conditions for the fast equilibrium conjecture to a more general setting, making a good technical contribution to the community.

### Weaknesses
1. Referring to the second experiment as "stochastic weight averaging" (SWA) is inappropriate, as SWA averages the model parameters at different iterations along the same trajectory. Conversely, the approach in this paper averages the parameters at the same iterations from different trajectories.

2. Missing discussion of related works, which 

   - argue that the iterates stay in the same basin for a significant amount of time when starting from the same initialization.

### Summary
This paper provides a strengthened proof of the fast equilibrium conjecture that was proved in the previous works (Wang &Wang (2022); Li et al. (2022c)) by removing the non-generic assumptions of the unique basin and that the set of minima is an analytic set. In order to remove these additional assumptions, this paper mainly adopts a purely probabilistic method rather than the spectral analysis that was used in the previous works. 

Toward this goal, this work shows that trajectories would not escape from the initial basin in exponential time.

### Strengths
1. This paper is clearly organized and well-structured so that it is easy for the readers to grasp the main contributions of this work.
2. I like the fact that this work provides solid and well-supported arguments (Remarks 1.4 and 1.5) that Assumptions 1.2 are natural and Assumptions 1.3 are non-generic. These motivate removing these less natural assumptions well and signifies the contribution of this work. 
3. The main result that the Fast Equilibrium conjecture holds without the assumptions of the unique basin and that the set of minima is an analytic set is significant, and it contributes well to the theoretical understanding of the effects of normalization layers. 
4. While I did not check all the proof details, I followed the proof at a high level.

### Weaknesses
It could be good to add some theoretical reasonings (in addition to being natural) about why Assumption 1.2 might be essential to prove the Fast Equilibrium conjecture.

### Questions
1. Will the noise structure affect the convergence rate?
2. Would it be possible to achieve a similar result if $L$ had a homogeneity degree  $> 0$?
3. Are all the remaining three assumptions essential to prove the Fast Equilibrium conjecture? Would it be possible to even weaken the assumptions?
4. Minor:
In the first line in Section 4, "Assumption 1.3. (ii)" -> "Assumption 1.3. (i)"?

### Summary
In this technical paper, the authors deal with fast convergence of networks with normalized steps to the solution.  The authors successfully prove their result and many insights are given on practical training of these networks in the experiments section.

### Strengths
This is a very technical paper, very mathematical, and centered around proving one conjecture in the literature. I like this, and I also enjoyed reading the paper: it is very well written and has pleasant notation. What I especially liked is the clear statement of the assumption and remarks 1.4 and 1.5. The authors also showed they mastered the subject with many useful citations and discussions around existing results. Though I did not unfortunately find the time to go through the proofs, the narrative and the impeccable discussion in the main paper leave no doubts on correctness. On a technical level, I was always curious about projections of the Brownian motion on the sphere in the context of Langevin dynamics, so I will for sure get back to this paper in the future to find more details on this. I also have a question, which you can find in the proper section below.

I placed the contribution as fair since I think the result does not explain the fast convergence of normalized networks compared to not-normalized (motivation in the abstract). Please comment on this if you think your result motivates this, I am happy to revise!

### Weaknesses
I guess one obvious question is "can you have more experiments". I think this might be silly in this paper, but maybe there is something you can do to reach people outside the very technical domain. One thing I think would be useful is to illustrate the rates known in the literature and the conjecture - maybe with evidence from some datasets and some networks. I think you can attract the interest of many people if you have a headline figure showing the speed of convergence to the stationary distribution and exactly the rate you prove.
A thing I found a bit confusing is going back-and-forward on between $O(1/\eta)$ and $e^{O(\eta^{-1})}$ results. That got me a bit thinking and I have a question (below).

I placed the contribution as fair since I think the result does not explain the fast convergence of normalized networks compared to not-normalized (motivation in the abstract). Please comment on this if you think your result motivates this, I am happy to revise!

### Questions
1) This is something I am pretty sure I could solve on my own with a bit of thinking, but I guess it hints to lack of clarity in some parts of the intro: I find a bit of contradiction between the sentences (1, abstract) "scale-invariant normalized network, mixes to an equilibrium in
$O(1/\eta\lambda)$ steps, as opposed to classical $e^{O(\eta^{−1})}$ mixing time" and (2, intro) "When normalization is used,  the effective learning rate for the renormalized parameter vector will stabilize around $O((\eta\lambda^{-1/2} )$ and in consequence $e^{O((\eta\lambda)^{-1}}$ is replaced with $e^{O((\eta\lambda)^{-1/2}}$". I think this is a bit unclear, can you please explain? 

2) From my SDE knowledge, I always understood that convergence to the stationary distribution is dominated by the drift. What is the convergence rate -- to a local minimum -- if you drop the noise term? I think providing an analysis of this setting will certainly help the reader understand the proof in a simplified setting. 

3) The SDE you study certainly is a model for SGD in the setting you study. However, I am a bit worried about the noise structure. Is there some guarantee in previous literature that constant gradient noise in the not-normalized setting translates to the noise projection structure you study in the normalized case? I am talking about formula 4-5 in comparison to the discrete update.

### Summary
To understand the behaviors of normalization in deep learning, Li et al. (2020) proposes the Fast Equilibrium conjecture: the scale-invariant normalized network, when trained by SGD with $\eta$ learning rate and $\lambda$ weight decay, mixes to an equilibrium in $\tilde{O}(\frac{1}{\eta \lambda})$ steps, as opposed to classical $e^{O((\eta \lambda)^{-1})}$ mixing time. Recent works by Wang & Wang (2022) and Li et al. (2022c) further proved this conjecture under different sets of assumptions.

This paper instead proves the fast equilibrium conjecture in full generality by removing the non-generic assumptions of Wang & Wang (2022) and Li et al. (2022c) that the minima are isolated, that the region near minima forms a unique basin, and that the set of minima is an analytic set. Their main technical contribution is to show that with probability close to 1, in exponential time trajectories will not escape the attracting basin containing its initial position.

### Strengths
**Originality:** 1) They first analyze the generality of assumptions used in existing work and then successfully remove non-generic assumptions, which is very important to reduce the gap between the theory and the experiments 2) They use Arnold-Kliemann's condition instead of Kliemann's condition to remove the analyticity assumption 3) They make use of large deviation principle of Dembo-Zeitouni in Dembo & Zeitouni (2010, Chapter 5) instead of the Freidlin-Wentzell’s original theory to show that with very high probability, the trajectory will not escape from the basin in exponential time to remove the unique basin assumption

**Quality:** I'm not familiar with the theoretical techniques but I feel it has good quality.

**Clarity:** It looks quite clear in most cases but needs some modifications for some tiny writing errors.

**Significance:** Okay but not very significant for the following two reasons: 1) It relaxes the assumptions for an existing conjecture instead of discovering some new phenomena, 2) The fast equilibrium conjecture is not as important as many other things in deep learning, such as the generalization ability of deep neural networks, the puzzles in large language models, the interplay among the model, the algorithm, and the data, etc.

### Weaknesses
1) They only conduct experiments on MNIST which is almost a linearly-separable dataset, which is not good for deep learning analysis. I suggest the authors conduct the experiments on other more difficult datasets, such as CIFAR-10. The issue is not just about the dataset's complexity, but also about the fact that MNIST doesn't represent the typical challenges encountered in modern deep learning applications. For instance, MNIST lacks the high dimensionality and complex feature interactions present in datasets like CIFAR-10 or ImageNet. This makes it difficult to assess the practical relevance of the theoretical results. The fast equilibrium conjecture might hold for MNIST due to its simplicity, but its validity on more complex datasets remains unclear.
2) There are some tiny errors in the paper, so I'd suggest the authors to proofread their paper more carefully. 
- They sometimes use an uncommon citation format for references in some places. For example,
"The works by Bovier et al. and Shi et al. (Bovier et al., 2004; Shi et al., 2020)" may be changed as "Bovier et al. (2004) and Shi et al. (2020)"; "Li et al. made certain assumptions in (Li et al., 2022c)" may be changed as "Li et al. (2022c) made certain assumptions".
- Similarly, they seem use wrong references in some places. For example,
"We now stop assuming Assumption 1.3.(ii) and decompose" => I feel it's Assumption 1.3. (i) instead of Assumption 1.3 (i) since they are talking about removing the unique basin assumption (Assumption 1.3 (i));
"Recall that (Li et al., 2022c)) also assumes Assumption 1.3.(i), but that can be dropped by the discussion in Chapter 3 above." => I feel it's Assumption 1.3 (ii) instead of Assumption 1.3 (i) since Chapter 3 discusses removing the analyticity assumption (Assumption 1.3. (ii)); 
"Figure 5 shows that V11 and V22 stabilizes near similar but different values," => I think they mean Figure 1 instead of Figure 5 here.

### Questions
I have a question about the classical mixing time: You use $e^{O(\eta^{-1})}$ in the abstract but use $e^{O((\eta \lambda)^{-1})}$ in the Introduction. I feel $e^{O((\eta \lambda)^{-1})}$ looks more natural to me. Could you clarify this?

Similarly, $\tilde{O}(1/\eta\lambda)$ in the abstract may need to be changed as $\tilde{O}(\frac{1}{\eta \lambda})$.
