## Abstract
Large language models are typically aligned with human preferences by optimizing \textit{reward models} (RMs) fitted to human feedback. However, human preferences are multi-faceted, and it is increasingly common to derive reward from a composition of simpler reward models which each capture a different aspect of language quality. This itself presents a challenge, as it is difficult to appropriately weight these component RMs when combining them. Compounding this difficulty, because any RM is only a proxy for human evaluation, this process is vulnerable to \textit{overoptimization}, wherein past a certain point, accumulating higher reward is associated with worse human ratings. In this paper, we perform, to our knowledge, the first study on overoptimization in composite RMs, showing that correlation between component RMs has a significant effect on the locations of these points. We then introduce an approach to solve this issue using constrained reinforcement learning as a means of preventing the agent from exceeding each RM's threshold of usefulness. Our method addresses the problem of weighting component RMs by learning dynamic weights, naturally expressed by Lagrange multipliers. As a result, each RM stays within the range at which it is an effective proxy, improving evaluation performance. Finally, we introduce an adaptive method using gradient-free optimization to identify and optimize towards these points during a single run.

### Summary
The authors analyze the problem of reward model over parameterization in the context of composite reward functions. They propose a method of identifying the points of over parameterization or proxy points taking into account the correlations between reward models. Once these proxy points are determined, the authors propose several constrained RL approaches which incorporate these points into the optimization objective.

### Strengths
1. The analysis of the over parameterization of composite reward functions in interesting and of importance to LLM-Alignment
2. The proposed derivative free optimization method, NM-PPO is novel and computationally efficient.   
3. The paper is generally well written and easy to follow.

### Weaknesses
 **Determining the joint maximizing point seems heuristic**

To determine the joint maximizing proxy point, the evaluation scores as a function of the METEOR and intent rewards for each run shown in Fig. 3.1 are plotted and a surface is fit over them. But these evaluations were done by maximizing each reward individually, without account of any interaction. Thus using these to determine the joint maximizing point seems heuristic at best. 

In other words, if the ultimate objective is to determine the weighting among RMs to find the combination which produces the best correlation with ground truth evaluation, and to fine-tune the language model until it reaches  the proxy points of this composite RM, the proxy points obtained using the method outlined in the paper may not align with this desired outcome.

### Questions
1. **Proxy Points** 
    1. How and how many times is the ground truth evaluation function queried to determine the maximizing proxy point? (For results in Fig 3.2 and 5.1)
    2. How is line 9 in algorithm 2 computed?
    3. Why is KL regularization not used to determine the proxy points? (results in Fig 3.1)
2. In Fig 5.1 (right) the performance of $\xi-$PPO drops after about 180k training steps, are the constraints still satisfied during this stage? 
3. **Minor Points** 
    1. It would be clear if you could plot $\xi-$PPO and $\mu-$PPO in figure D2 for reference. It will help in understanding the instability of All-PPO.
    2. Does All-PPO have an KL constraint?
    3. It would be helpful if  you could plot the training curve for  NM-PPO? It would be helpful to see how the changing threshold affects the training process. 
    4. Sample outputs of NM-PPO are missing in section D.2
    5. Could you explain the sample outputs in section D2? its hard to understand the performance of the different algorithms. It would be helpful if you could include the evaluation score and the rewards obtained as well.

### Summary
This paper provides a novel analysis of overoptimization in the context of RLHF with multiple proxy reward functions, identifying their termed "proxy points" of overoptimization. The proxy point is a threshold at which further increasing the proxy reward results in decreased ground-truth performance. Their primary contribution is to introduce constrained RL approaches that incorporate these points into optimization objectives. Additionally, they demonstrate how a derivative-free optimization method can be used to dynamically identify the proxy points in a single run.

### Strengths
**Originality**

The paper presents a unique framework that introduces the concept of "proxy points" to address overoptimization in an environment with multiple proxy reward models and a given ground-truth reward model. This novel idea of defining a threshold for proxy rewards, ensuring that they don't exceed the proxy point, is a commendable original contribution to the field of RLHF. 

**Quality**

The authors have validated the effectiveness of the proposed approach through empirical experiments. The application of a local hill-climbing algorithm, the Nelder-Mead threshold search, is also shown and validated through numerical experiments.


**Significance**

In the broader perspective of RLHF, managing overoptimization is a critical challenge. By estimating the thresholds that may cause a drop in performance and incorporating them in the optimization process, this paper makes a significant stride in improving the robustness and reliability of reinforcement learning models.

### Weaknesses
- One significant limitation, as acknowledged by the authors themselves, is the assumption of the availability of the ground-truth reward model in RLHF. While such an assumption of the gold reward model aids in understanding and analyzing overoptimization as in Gao+ 2022, its actual use within RLHF algorithms seems impractical. This reliance on a ground-truth reward model for identifying proxy points significantly restricts the applicability of the proposed method in real-world scenarios where such a model is often unavailable or extremely costly to obtain. The method's dependence on this oracle makes it more of a theoretical analysis tool than a practical solution for RLHF.

- The evaluation metric described in Section A.2 is aimed at respecting both the METEOR and intent reward functions in light of Goodhart's Law. While the authors have meticulously chosen metrics from two categories - lexical quality and text diversity, there seems to be a lack of in-depth discussion about its relevance and applicability in the context of LLM-based RLHF. Drawing insights from works such as the one by Maynez et al. (Benchmarking Large Language Model Capabilities for Conditional Generation, ACL 2023) could have provided a clearer perspective on how well the proposed metric aligns with the requirements and challenges of LLM. Specifically, the use of ROUGE-2, while common, might not fully capture the nuances of text quality in dialogue, and the diversity metrics, while important, need more justification in the context of the specific RLHF task. The paper would benefit from a more thorough discussion of the limitations and potential biases of the chosen evaluation metric.

- The lack of detailed descriptions and elaborations of the specific methodologies presented in Table 1 raises concerns about the paper's clarity. One might find it challenging to grasp the proposed approach without sufficient explanations. For instance, the precise implementation of the constrained RL approaches, particularly how the proxy points are incorporated into the optimization objectives, is not sufficiently detailed. The paper would benefit from a more step-by-step explanation of the algorithms, including pseudocode or more explicit mathematical formulations, to enhance reproducibility and understanding.

### Questions
- On the Validity of Evaluation Metric (Equation A.1):
  - How did the authors determine that the evaluation metric chosen in Equation A.1 accurately represents the efficacy of the proposed method?
  - Were there other potential metrics considered? If so, could the authors elucidate the rationale behind the chosen metric over others?
  - Are there any design principles or guidelines followed when setting this metric? The significance of this setting in the proposed method seems critical, and a clearer explanation would be beneficial.

- Regarding mixed advantages right after Equation (4.3): Shouldn't the term v_µ(s) encompass the second term from Equation (4.3)?

- I understand that PPO-SAT adheres to the Lagrangian multipliers method for equality constraints and thus the weights of RMs will be adjusted based on how well the constraints are met. However, in Section 5, the authors mentioned that the RM weightings in PPO-SAT are fixed. Can you please provide clarity on the workings of PPO-SAT?

- In Figure D.2, for All-PPO, why is the tanh function used for constraints that seem to be inequality constraints? This appears to be inconsistent with the explanation provided in Section 4 of the main text.

### Summary
In this work, the authors improve the ability to optimize LLMs so that they are aligned with human preferences, but not overly optimized to a specific reward model (inferred via reinforcement learning from human feedback or some oracle model) or set of reward models. In this work, the authors identify the points of overoptimization, termed proxy points, and use constrained optimization to ensure that each reward model reaches, but does not surpass the proxy point. The authors explore two different approaches to determining proxy points and display that the proposed technique can avoid overoptimization and improve performance. The authors present detail regarding related work, their approach for determining proxy points, the proposed method, and a thorough evaluation section.

### Strengths
+ This paper is extremely well-written and contains sufficient related work and explanation to understand the proposed techniques and prior work.
+  To the best of my knowledge, the proposed technique to avoid LLM overoptimization toward composite RMs is novel.
+ The analysis is very detailed and showcases the proposed technique works as expected
+ As LLMs are a very popular topic now and actively being deployed, this approach tackles an important issue in optimizing and improving LLM performance toward high-performance behavior.

### Weaknesses
 - Could you comment on how easy it is to identify the proxy point? In larger or multi-topic datasets, would determining a proxy point be more difficult?
- While the paper does contain much information, a lot of important information is in the appendix that would benefit from also appearing briefly in the paper. On that thread, it would be beneficial to highlight important details in D.2. Is there a specific feature of the sample outputs you are attempting to highlight?

### Questions
- Could you comment on how the results may differ for newer, more high-performing LLMs (e.g., GPT-4)?

- Could you also address the questions in the weaknesses above?

### Summary
This paper shows that over-optimizing reward models can lead to decreased performance of LLMs. The authors remedy this through constrained reinforcement learning, where the LLM is prevented from exceeding each reward model's usefulness threshold.

### Strengths
- The authors address the reward model over-optimization problem with a simple constrained optimization solution.
- The authors identify that the interaction between component RMs can influence the proxy points of the component rewards.
- The authors experiment with a number of different constrained optimization solutions (e.g. $\xi$-PPO, $\mu$-PPO, etc.)
- The authors present NM-PPO to mitigate the need for multiple runs to identify proxy points.

### Weaknesses
 - The method requires multiple runs to identify proxy points for each reward model. This is somewhat addressed by NM-PPO, but NM-PPO still requires some queries to the evaluation metric during training.


### Questions
- I'm curious if it's necessary in practice to satisfy all constraints. For instance, I wonder how performance would be affected if only the intent constraint was satisfied, or if only the METEOR constraint was satisfied (while still identifying proxy points through considering all RMs together)
- I'm a bit confused on why $\mu$-PPO still performs well even though the proxy point thresholds are exceeded. I do see that the authors acknowledge this as a reason why $\mu$-PPO may perform worse than $\xi$-PPO, but I wonder why $\mu$-PPO still performs well. I'm especially confused about this because in Figure 5.3 the authors show that using thresholds that are higher than the proxy point thresholds leads to much worse performance for $\xi$-PPO. Can the authors provide an explanation for this?
