## Abstract
Among various methods for learning with noisy labels, the transition matrix method has attracted sustained attention due to its simplicity and statistical consistency. However, estimating the transition matrix for each sample may be unidentifiable and computationally expensive in the case of instance-dependent label noise and real-world situations. In this paper, we propose a concise method that only requires estimating a global matrix, combining with implicit regularization, to replace the estimation of the individual transition matrix for each sample. Specifically, by estimating the transition matrix, we can determine the overall probability transfer from correct labels to noisy labels and use implicit regularization to adjust the sparse form representation of the difference between the estimated posterior probability distribution and the noisy label distribution. This approach can be applied to diverse types of noise as well as alleviating the problem of inaccurate posterior probability estimation. We theoretically analyze the consistency and generalization results of the proposed method and conduct experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets with different types of label noise. The experimental results show that our method significantly outperforms previous transition matrix methods and has a wider range of applicability. Additionally, our method achieves impressive results without the need for additional auxiliary techniques. Our code will be open source and put on Github.

### Summary
The paper introduces an enhanced transition matrix method for diverse label noise using implicit regularization. Traditional techniques for estimating per-sample transition matrices are computationally intensive and may be infeasible, particularly for instance-dependent noise. The proposed method estimates a single global matrix by gauging the probability transfer from accurate to noisy labels, adjusted via implicit regularization to bridge the gap between estimated posterior and noisy label distributions. This method, applicable to various noise types, addresses issues of posterior probability estimation inaccuracies. Supported by theoretical proofs and experimental results, the approach surpasses prior transition matrix techniques without necessitating auxiliary methods.

### Strengths
- The paper presents a novel approach to deal with label noise in machine learning models. It proposes the combination of global matrix estimation and implicit regularization to replace the cumbersome existing transition matrix methods. This is a creative combination of existing ideas, leveraging the strengths of each to propose a powerful, effective, and concise method for dealing with noisy labels in diverse situations.

- The experimental results reported in the paper demonstrate the proposed method's formidable performance, surpassing some robust algorithms based on sample selection and semi-supervised techniques.

### Weaknesses
 -  The primary shortcoming of the paper lies in its lack of originality. While the idea of combining global noise transition matrix estimation with implicit regularization as an alternative to existing methods possesses some novelty, the concrete implementation, in my view, seems to be merely a straightforward amalgamation of SOP and VolMinNet. Furthermore, the derivations in the theorem-related sections bear considerable resemblance to those in SOP. Hence, from my perspective, the proposed algorithm appears more as an interpretation of SOP from an instance-dependent angle.



### Questions
Q1: The article claims that VolMinNet exhibits inaccuracies in its noisy posterior probability estimation, prompting the introduction of the method delineated in this paper as a solution. However, the experiments seem to overlook the state-of-the-art (SOTA) work, CCR, which also seeks to enhance VolMinNet. Would it be possible to include comparative experiments involving CCR?

Q2: The methodology section of the paper proposes estimating the discrepancy between \( P(\tilde{\boldsymbol{Y}} \mid X) \) and \( \boldsymbol{T}^{\top} P(\boldsymbol{Y} \mid X) \) using a feature-embedded regularization term. I'm curious, does this framework exhibit generality? In other words, would other regularization terms incorporating features produce similar or equivalent effects?
 
Q3: Indeed, there appears to be a potential inconsistency in the experimental setup. Comparing the results of a model using ResNet-18 as its backbone (TMR) with another using ResNet-34 (SOP) may not provide a fair comparison, especially given the capacity and potential performance differences between the two architectures. It becomes even more noteworthy if the TMR model with a ResNet-18 outperforms the SOP model with a ResNet-34 by a significant margin. This discrepancy might introduce biases in the evaluation and potentially affect the validity of the claims made.

### Summary
This paper proposed integrating implicit regularization and the transition matrix method for noisy label learning. To avoid the difficulty of estimating the instance-dependent transition matrix, by assuming the sparsity of the difference between the estimated posterior probability distribution and the noisy label distribution, it only estimated a global transition matrix for each sample, and an implicit regularization is applied in the residual vector to promote the sparsity.  Theoretical analyses provided the consistency and generalization results of the proposed method. Experimental results confirm the superiority of the proposed method.

### Strengths
1. The combination of transition matrix methods and other robust techniques is a seldom-explored and important direction for noisy label learning.
2. This work provided the consistency and generalization results of the proposed method, which keeps the advantages of the transition matrix methods.
3.  Experimental results showed promising results on various benchmarks.

### Weaknesses
1. The specific definition of the sparsity of the residual term in this paper is unclear.  Does it mean that the residual term includes many zero elements?  Besides, could the authors provide some evidence to support the sparsity assumption across various noisy cases? I think it's necessary to show the advantages of the assumptions of the proposed method compared with existing methods. Specifically, the paper should clarify whether the sparsity is element-wise or in some other structured form (e.g., low-rank). Furthermore, the justification for assuming sparsity in the residual, which represents the difference between the noisy posterior and the transition-corrected posterior, needs more rigorous backing. It's not immediately obvious why this difference should be sparse across diverse noise types. A more detailed analysis, perhaps with empirical evidence or theoretical arguments, is needed to support this core assumption.
2. Some statements in this paper need further discussion or clarification:
- Handling diverse label noise doesn't make sense in my opinion, since the real-world label noise is usually instance-dependent. The claim of handling diverse noise types is vague. The paper should specify the types of noise it aims to address (e.g., symmetric, asymmetric, instance-dependent) and provide a clear rationale for why the proposed method is suitable for each. Simply stating 'diverse' is not sufficient.
- What is a "valid" transition matrix and residual term in Section 2.2? Could the authors provide some theoretical results that show in certain cases, a clean class-posterior probability can be obtained, regardless of instance-dependent noise or the noisy class-posterior has a large estimation error? The notion of a "valid" transition matrix and residual term needs to be formalized. What properties must these terms satisfy to guarantee the recovery of the clean posterior? The paper should provide a precise definition of validity, potentially linking it to conditions on the noise distribution or the structure of the transition matrix. Furthermore, the paper should clarify under what conditions the proposed method can provably recover the clean posterior, especially when dealing with complex, instance-dependent noise.
- Why log det(T) can be ignored in the generalization analysis? The justification for ignoring the log determinant of the transition matrix in the generalization analysis is not clear. While it might be constant with respect to the sample X, it is still a crucial part of the loss function and could affect the generalization bound. The paper should provide a more rigorous explanation for why this term can be safely ignored, possibly by showing that its contribution to the generalization error is negligible under certain conditions.
3. (Minor) I suggest the authors discuss more recent SOTA works, e.g. [3,4].
4. (Minor) The novelty of techniques seems a little limited. It seems that the proposed method mainly combined the techniques from [1] and [2]. The paper should clearly articulate the novel contributions beyond simply combining existing techniques. What specific modifications or insights allow the proposed method to outperform existing approaches? A more detailed explanation of the unique aspects of the method is needed.
5. (Minor) The presentation should be improved largely. For example, this paper only uses a single number to refer to one equation.

### Summary
This paper proposes a new method for estimating a global transition matrix for dealing with noisy labels, which combines implicit regularization to replace the estimation of the individual transition matrix for each example. The proposed approach is claimed to be suitable for diverse types of noise as well as alleviating the problem of inaccurate posterior probability estimation. The authors theoretically analyze the consistency and generalization results of the proposed method, and also conduct experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets with different types of label noise.

### Strengths
1.	The paper is written in a clear way.
2.	The experimental results reflect the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.

### Weaknesses
1. I feel that the high-level idea of this paper is a bit similar to T-revision (Are anchor points really indispensable in label-noise learning? NIPS 19). In T-revision, the authors propose to learn \deltaT which is imposed to transition matrix T. In this paper, the authors aim to learn \gamma(X) imposed on T^{\top}*P(Y|X). Note that these two formations are actually the same, if we let \gamma(X)=\deltaT*P(Y|X). In other words, both methods aim to learn a residual term to correct the original estimation. Therefore, I feel that the authors need to clarify the essential difference between the two methods.  
2. One selling point of this proposed method is that it can handle different types of noise, especially instance-dependent noise, as claimed by the authors. After investigating the model, I think such merits mainly come from the term \gamma(X). However, l cannot fully understand why introducing such term can enable the method to deal with various noise types. The authors claim that they impose sparsity to \gamma(X) to achieve this target, but why? What is the relationship of sparsity with the noise types, especially instance-dependent label noise? I think such rationale is neither clear nor straightforward enough.
3. Even the formulation (5) is correct, the authors decompose \gamma(X) into N pairs of {u_i, v_i}. Then the problem comes. I notice that no regularization is imposed to {u_i, v_i}, how to guarantee its identifiability, uniqueness, or even optimality? Note that the identifiability of T is very important for label noise learning, and the identifiability of {u_i, v_i} is actually very related to it.
4. The authors might misused the terms “sample” and “example”, which confused me a lot when I read the paper at the first time. Note that their meanings are totally different. I think most of the term “sample” should be “example” in this paper. 
5. The notion “diagonally dominant” is not correctly used in this paper. Note that when we say a c*c matrix T is diagonally dominant, it means T_ii>|T_i1|+|T_i2|+…|T_i,i-1| +|T_i,i+1| +|T_ic| mathematically, rather than T_ii>T_ij for j \neq i.
6. The experimental results reveal that sometimes the accuracy of the proposed method is very similar to baseline methods. Therefore, I think statistical significance analysis is needed to justify the real superiority of the proposed method to baseline methods.

### Summary
This paper focuses on label-noise learning, which is a realistic and important topic in weakly supervised learning. Specifically, this paper mainly targets the estimation of the noise transition matrix. It argues that estimating the transition matrix for each instance may be unidentifiable and computationally expensive in the case of instance-dependent label noise and real-world situations. Therefore, it proposes to learn the residual between probabilities, which is easier. Theoretical analysis is provided to discuss the estimation performance and generalization performance. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world label-noise datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

### Strengths
- The motivation is clear. It is significant to study how to estimate the noise transition matrix, especially for the instance-dependent transition matrix. 
- Experimental results are overall great. On a series of tasks, the proposed method achieves the best performance.

### Weaknesses
 - The contributions are somewhat overclaimed. 
- The theoretical analysis should be improved. More descriptions and explanations should be provided. 
- The writing also should be polished. For the current form, there are a series of unclear justifications. 

More details about the above weaknesses can be checked below.

**On contributions**
- This paper claims that it contributes to estimating instance-dependent transition matrix. However, after reading this paper, it seems that this paper studies a specific type of label noise, which is a weak version of instance-dependent label noise. Specifically, the paper proposes first to learn a global transition matrix and learn the residual term with respect to each instance. This holds only when the noise patterns of different instances are similar. 
- The previous work [R1] employs a similar idea. However, [R1] is not discussed. 

**On theoretical analysis**
- The analysis highly relies on neural tangent kernels. It is somewhat less general for me.
- For Theorem 2, when the sample size $n$ approximates $+\infty$, the error is not zero. It depends on the parameter $\epsilon$. 
- Condition 1 is not very reasonable. It needs the network parameter to be zero at the beginning of training. It is not very practical. 


**On writing**
- In the “Introduction”, the definitions of $Y$ and $X$ should be provided.
- This paper argues that compared to traditional transition matrix methods for class-dependent label noise, the proposed method does not require much additional time consumption. However, I do not find strong evidence about this claim.
- The notation $-\top$ is a bit confusing. "Inverse + Transpose"?
- Why using $u$ and $v$? It is confusing for me. 
- Could the proposed method be boosted by semi-supervised learning methods, e.g., DivideMix, for better performance?
