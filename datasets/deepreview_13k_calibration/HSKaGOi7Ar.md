## Abstract
\looseness=-1 Designing expressive Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) is a fundamental topic in the graph learning community. So far, GNN expressiveness has been primarily assessed via the Weisfeiler-Lehman (WL) hierarchy. However, such an expressivity measure has notable limitations: it is inherently \emph{coarse}, \emph{qualitative}, and may not well reflect practical requirements (e.g., the ability to encode substructures). In this paper, we introduce a unified framework for \emph{quantitatively} studying the expressiveness of GNN architectures, addressing all the above limitations. Specifically, we identify a fundamental expressivity measure termed \emph{homomorphism expressivity}, which quantifies the ability of GNN models to count graphs under homomorphism. Homomorphism expressivity offers a complete and practical assessment tool: the completeness enables \emph{direct} expressivity comparisons between GNN models, while the practicality allows for understanding concrete GNN abilities such as subgraph counting. By examining four classes of prominent GNNs as case studies, we derive simple, unified, and elegant descriptions of their homomorphism expressivity for both invariant and equivariant settings. Our results provide novel insights into a series of previous work, unify the landscape of different subareas in the community, and settle several open questions. Empirically, extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world tasks verify our theory, showing that the practical performance of GNN models aligns well with the proposed metric.

### Summary
In this paper, the authors study the set of substructures that various definitions of GNNs can distinguish. They consider the new notion of homomorphism expressivity (Definition 3.1), which intuitively means the ability of GNNs to count different substructures. In Theorem 3.3., which is the main contribution of the paper,  they use the concept of NED (Definition 3.2) to exactly express the power of GNNs in homomorphism counting for MPNNs, Subgraph GNNs, Local GNNs, and FGNNs. In a follow-up result, in Theorem 3.6., they extend their method to node-level functions on graphs. In Theorem 3.7. and Theorem 3.8., they find the homomorphism expressivity of Subgraph k-GNNs and Local k-GNNs using NEDs. In Proposition 4.4., they show how counting substructures is related to homomorphism expressivity. The paper is concluded with experiments.

### Strengths
- This paper is extremely well-written; the authors have spent a lot of time polishing the paper

- The theoretical problem is relevant to GNNs, while most theory works in GNNs are not necessarily applicable to practical scenarios

### Weaknesses
 - it's better to have more examples of different kinds of substructures in Theorem 3.3 (and how they are different from each other).

- Missing discussion on some previous works: there are many papers proposed to count substructures, and it is not clear how your result is related to them.

### Questions
This is a well-written, interesting theoretical work on GNNs expressivity. I have a few questions:

- Why are homomorphism numbers important to us? Are there any concrete applications (e.g., in biology, etc.) that they appear? I know that subgraph counts are definitely important (from molecular biology), but not sure about homomorphisms. I'm asking because the main point of characterizing the power of GNNs is to have a better understanding for practical purposes.


- Under what conditions can the models in this paper express all subgraph counts of a  particular size (say less than k)? Indeed, how do you compare your method for counting with the other methods, like equivariant polynomials for GNNs and also recursive-based methods (like RNP-GNNs)? Is there a way to understand how recursion in RNP-GNNs can help counting all subgraphs using your theory (i.e., NEDs, etc.) and if there is any connections? I suggest discussing it a bit in the paper because recursion is a popular way to boost GNNs, and it's not clear if NEDs somewhere appear there or not.

### Summary
The paper deals with the expressive power of GNN-type architectures for graph-, node-, and edge-level representation learning. Specifically, the authors propose a framework based on graph homomorphisms to compare the expressive power of four classes of GNN architectures, namely, MPNNs, subgraph GNNs, local $k$-GNNs, folklore-WL GNNs, and their ability to count subgraphs. 

To that, they extend the known results of Dell et al. connecting $k$-WL expressivity and homomorphism counts via a novel variant of nested ear decompositions. They show which kind of homomorphism counts the above three GNN types can distinguish, compare them, and shed some light on their cycle and path counting ability. 

Finally, they probe their theoretical results empirically, showing that increased expressivity indeed translates into increased homomorphism 
 and cycle-counting ability. Further, they show a similar effect on the ZINC and Alchemy graph regression datasets.

### Strengths
- The authors propose a unified framework to study the expressive power of various GNN-type architecture, unifying the landscape of different architectures. By that, they recover and extend several known results.
- Clear, although dense, presentation
- Proofs are clearly structured  
- Good synthetic results, verifying the theoretical results

### Weaknesses
 - The presentation is quite dense. It might be beneficial to push Subsection 3.3. to the appendix and expand on the other parts.
- The experimental study on real-world datasets is quite limited. It would be nice to see a more refined analysis, e.g., analyzing subgraph occurrences and see if an architecture's performance is correlated to its ability to count different subgraphs.


### Questions
- Is the connectedness assumption in Definition 3.1 necessary?

**Comments**
- On page 5, in the definition of $\mathsf{Clo_{ind}}$, there seems to be $G \in \mathcal{G}$ missing 
- The results of Dell et al. were previously shown in

### Summary
This paper proposes a new theoretical way to analyze the expressive power of several types of expressive GNNs (including MPNN, k-subgraph GNN, k-local GNN, and k-local FGNN) using the concept of homomorphism. Concretely, the authors prove that the set of the base graphs a GNN can identify under the homomorphism to the input graph can be a sufficient evaluation of the expressive power of GNN. Then, the authors systemically analyze several popular GNN variants using this metric through the novel concept of nested ear decomposition (NED) and give a complete expressive hierarchy. Moreover, the proposed metric also provides a new way of analyzing the subgraph counting power of GNN variants under moderate graph size. Finally, the authors conduct experiments to verify the theorems.

### Strengths
1. Although the paper may still be hard for general readers in the DL community to understand, I think the authors already did a great job of formalizing and presenting these extensive theoretical concepts and theorems.

2. The proposed metric and the theoretical proofs are comprehensive and elegant. It provides a new way to reveal the strict hierarchy and the expressive gap among several high-expressive GNNs. Moreover, the subgraph counting power analysis is also impressive.

### Weaknesses
I cannot see any major weakness but have one potential minor weakness for the authors:

Although the authors claim that the proposed framework can quantitatively analyze the expressive power of different GNN variants based on the NED, the authors didn’t characterize the exact number of NED that exists for each NED class (share-point/strong/near strong/general NED). Thus, it is still hard to see the quantitative expressive gap between each GNN variant. I understand the exact number could be hard to count but It would be excellent if the authors could at least give a rough scale for each NED class.

### Questions
For the framework:
1. For the subgraph GNN, the authors seem to only discuss the variant that first pool nodes within each subgraph and then pool all subgraph, which corresponds to the SWL(VS) proposed in the [1]. However, [1] also characterizes other different subgraph GNN variants with different theoretical expressive power (form a strict hierarchy). I am wondering could the proposed framework be used to analyze other variants and reveal the same result as discussed in [1].

2. Can the proposed framework also be used to analyze other more general GNN frameworks like [2] or [3]? 

3. The subgraph counting power is proved for only moderate graph size (nodes size $\leq$ 6 or edge size $\leq$ 8). I am wondering, what is the major gap or obstacle for proving a more general graph size? I am guessing it is related to the equation stated in the paper that characterizes the quantitative relationship between homomorphism count and subgraph count. For graphs of general size, is the proposed theorem at least an essential condition for successful counting?

For the broader impact:
1. So far, the paper only discusses the analysis result of the proposed framework on some existing GNN variants. I am wondering if the authors could discuss how the proposed framework can be used to analyze new GNN variants when it is proposed or how could other researchers design new powerful and efficient GNN variants based on this analysis framework.


I understand some questions may not be easy to answer and the answer will not negatively affect my score. I think the current paper is already worth a clear acceptance. However, it is hard for me to check all the proofs given this short period of time. But I will try my best to check it later.

### Summary
The expressive power of GNNs is commonly measured via their correspondence to Weisfeiler-Lehman (WL) graph isomorphism tests. In efforts to address limitations of the WL framework, the current paper advocates quantifying GNN expressivity through *homomorphism expressivity* — their ability to count graph substructures under homomorphism. The main theoretical contribution is a characterization of homomorphism expressivity for popular classes of GNNs in the context of graph, node, and edge representation. Among others, this allows a more fine-grained comparison between architectures, resolving several open questions. Experiments on synthetic and a couple of real-world tasks corroborate the theory, showing that the performance of GNNs aligns with the proposed expressivity measure.

### Strengths
1. Homomorphism expressivity provides a refreshing perspective on the expressivity of GNNs, alleviating some of the shortcomings of the popular WL framework. In particular, equivalence to WL tests can be too coarse of a measure and proving that one architecture is superior to another is often based on individual exemplar graphs. In contrast, for several GNN architectures, the current paper completely characterizes the graph homomorphisms they can count, facilitating a more fine-grained comparison and analyzing their subgraph counting ability.

2. In general, the paper is well-written. The motivation and main results are clearly described, along with discussions on relevant literature and technical details. Though the paper is a bit dense. I would suggest allocating more space for providing examples and intuitions as to which types of graphs are included in the characterizations of Theorem 3.3 that are based on nested ear decompositions (NEDs). In my opinion, this can come at the expense of the extensions in Subsections 3.3 and 3.4, which can be deferred to an appendix.

3. The theoretical analysis establishes elegant connections to concepts from graph theory, e.g. nested ear decompositions, which may prove useful for future work.

I believe the technical contributions pose a promising step forward in formalizing the expressive power of GNNs, and therefore recommend acceptance. Yet, there are a few weaknesses (listed below). Most importantly, a technical issue with the definition of homomorphism expressivity that requires clarification.

### Weaknesses
1. There seems to be a technical issue with the definition of homomorphism expressivity (Definition 3.1). I believe it can be solved, but requires addressing or further clarification. Specifically, $\mathcal{F}^M$ is not necessarily defined for all models $M$ since it does not take into account graphs $F$ for which there exist graphs $G$ and $H$ with equal homomorphism counts with respect to $F$ but different representations according to $M$. Homomorphism expressivity of $M$ is defined only if no such $F$ exists since it cannot be within $\mathcal{F}^M$ and also cannot be outside $\mathcal{F}^M$. For example, homomorphism expressivity is not defined for a universal architecture as it can assign different representations to any two non-isomorphic graphs.
    1. Is it the case that for the GNNs considered $\mathcal{F}^M$ is always well-defined? This seems to be indicated by Theorem 3.3 and the subsequent discussion, however, it is not clear enough. I strongly recommend elaborating upon this point near the definition to avoid confusion.

    2. Homomorphism expressivity is referred throughout as a “complete” measure. Given that it is not defined for all architectures $M$, I believe this terminology can be misleading.

2. Homomorphism expressivity suffers from a limitation that also exists in the WL framework: it disregards features of vertices/edges. The proposed expressivity measure takes into account only the ability to capture graph structures, assuming each vertex is associated with a unique discrete label. While identifying graph structure is indeed important, in many cases the features of vertices play an equal, if not more important role (see, e.g., [1]). I do not believe this significantly harms the quality of the current paper, and is perhaps a consideration for future work, but to me referring to homomorphism expressivity as a “complete” measure may require some hedging.

### Questions
Aside from the question in weakness 1.1 above, modifying (a) in the definition of homomorphism expressivity such that, it only demands that the homomorphism counts to be equal if the representations are, makes it well-defined for all models $M$. Does this allow taking into account all possible models or is it incompatible with the results in the paper?

An additional (more minor) comment. In the paragraph at the bottom of page 5 it is stated:

> “First, we highlight a key insight that homomorphism can serve as a fundamental
expressivity measure, which is achieved by further proving a non-trivial result that FM is maximal
(Definition 3.1(b)).”

By definition $\mathcal{F}^M$ is maximal, hence, it is not clear the intention of this sentence is. Was it that the existence of a maximal $\mathcal{F}^M$ is proven?
