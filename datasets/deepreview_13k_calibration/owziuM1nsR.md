## Abstract
\vspace{-2mm}
Transformer architectures have exhibited remarkable performance in image super-resolution (SR). Since the quadratic computational complexity of the self-attention (SA) in Transformer, existing methods tend to adopt SA in a local region to reduce overheads. However, the local design restricts the global context exploitation, which is crucial for accurate image reconstruction. In this work, we propose the Recursive Generalization Transformer (RGT) for image SR, which can capture global spatial information and is suitable for high-resolution images. Specifically, we propose the recursive-generalization self-attention (RG-SA). It recursively aggregates input features into representative feature maps, and then utilizes cross-attention to extract global information. Meanwhile, the channel dimensions of attention matrices ($query$, $key$, and $value$) are further scaled to mitigate the redundancy in the channel domain. Furthermore, we combine the RG-SA with local self-attention to enhance the exploitation of the global context, and propose the hybrid adaptive integration (HAI) for module integration. The HAI allows the direct and effective fusion between features at different levels (local or global). Extensive experiments demonstrate that our RGT outperforms recent state-of-the-art methods quantitatively and qualitatively.

### Summary
The authors propose the Recursive Generalization Transformer (RGT) for image super-resolution. The network can capture global spatial information and is more suitable for high-resolution images. It introduces Recursive-generalization self-attention (RG-SA) to recursively aggregate input features and Hybrid Adaptive Integration (HAI) to integrate global and local modules. Experiments show that the proposed method outperforms recent methods quantitatively and qualitatively.

### Strengths
1. The idea of using global attention in the Transformer is widespread. But, the authors effectively maintain low computational complexity, which is meaningful in image SR.
2. Additionally, the proposed HAI is simple yet effective. Both the ablation experiments (Table 1 (c), (d)) and the visual results (Figs. 3, 4, 5) strongly support the authors' claim: integrate global and local modules.
3. The main comparisons with recent methods demonstrate the superiority of this method. I also notice that the authors provide model size comparisons and a more fair comparison with SwinIR in the supplementary materials.
4. The paper is carefully organized. The paper is well-written and easy to read. The proposed methods are easy to follow.

### Weaknesses
1. The experiments on RG-SA are not enough. The authors claim the superiority of RG-SA, but it is not compared with other global attention mechanisms.
2. The authors only provide visual comparisons on Urban100 and Manga109 datasets. Comparisons on other datasets are lacking.

### Questions
1. The authors should compare RG-SA with other global attention, such as sparse attention proposed in ART (Accurate Image Restoration with Attention Retractable Transformer).
2. It is suggested to add more comparisons with more SR methods like ART.
3. Providing visual comparison results on more datasets to strengthen the effectiveness of the model.
4. Compared with other Transformer methods like SwinIR, are their training datasets the same? Are there any differences in the training strategy?

### Summary
This paper presents the Recursive Generalization Transformer (RGT) for image SR. Specifically, the recursive-generalization self-attention (RG-SA) is proposed to capture global spatial information. And the hybrid adaptive integration (HAI) is designed for module integration. Experiments show that the proposed RGT achieves improvements over recent methods.

### Strengths
1. The authors propose the recursive-generalization self-attention (RG-SA), which controls computational complexity while achieving global modeling.
2. They also design the hybrid adaptive integration (HAI). It is a simple yet effective.
3. The paper's experiments are comprehensive. The ablation study demonstrates the effects of each component.
4. Quantitative and qualitative results indicate that the proposed method outperforms SwinIR and CAT-A.
5. The authors provide various visual results: feature maps and CKA heatmap, which greatly support the author's claims and enrich the overall quality of the paper.
6. The paper is well-organized, with clear and readable content.

### Weaknesses
1. Some details in the paper are not clear. For example, the representative map size "h" is set as 4 for training but 16 for testing. Why not use the same settings?
2. The RGT-S and RGT all adopt a larger window size than SwinIR. To establish a fairer comparison, it is recommended to use the same window size.
3. It would be beneficial to include comparisons with more recent methods, such as RGT, to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method.
4. A comparison of running times should be given, which is important for practical applications of the model.

### Summary
This paper proposed a novel image SR method, Recursive Generalization Transformer (RGT). The RGT uses recursive-generalization self-attention (RG-SA) and hybrid adaptive integration (HAI) to model global information. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed RGT achieves state-of-the-art performance on image SR.

### Strengths
- The paper's writing and organization are good. All illustrations, tables, and visual results are intuitive and clear.
- The motivation for the proposed method is reasonable. The global information in SR is important while reducing the complexity of global attention is crucial for its application in SR tasks. 
- The proposed components RG-SA and HAI are novel and valuable.
- The ablation study is extensive. The effectiveness of each part in RGT is demonstrated.
- The authors provide multiple model versions and compare them with state-of-the-art methods. All results prove that the RGT proposed in this paper is a promising SR method.

### Weaknesses
 - When compared with CAT-A, the improvements of RGT on some datasets (Set5, Set14) are not very obvious (< 0.1 dB).
- Although FLOPs are provided in Sec. 4.4, the running time of the model on real devices should also be provided. The provided FLOPs are theoretical and do not always translate directly to practical speed, especially with different hardware and software implementations. It's crucial to understand the actual inference time on target devices.
- The primary evaluation metrics used in the paper are PSNR and SSIM. However, these metrics may not reflect actual SR performance. Some perceptual metrics, such as LPIPS, should be evaluated. Furthermore, the paper should consider including metrics that evaluate texture fidelity and sharpness, as these are often critical in SR tasks.

### Questions
- The author mentioned in the paper that the proposed RG-SA realizes linear complexity, which is better than other global methods. So, has the author tried other global attention, such as the attention proposed in PVT or XCiT? How do the computational complexity and performance of RG-SA compare with these methods?

### Summary
This paper proposes a recursive generalization transformer for image SR. In which, the recursive-generalization self-attention (RG-SA) recursively aggregates input features into representative feature maps, and then extract global information via the cross-attention. Moreover, the authors combine the RG-SA with local self-attention to enhance the exploitation of the global context, and further propose the hybrid adaptive integration (HAI) for module integration. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed RGT achieves good performance.

### Strengths
1.The paper is well writting and easy to following. 
2.The author proves the effectiveness of the proposed components by sufficient experiments.

### Weaknesses
1. The comparisons with recent ViT-based methods are insufficient.
2. The author should also make comparisons on inference speed and GPU usage to evaluate the model computational efficiency.
3. What is the performance of a larger window SA with HAI?
4. In the ablation of RG-SA, the authors state that "a smaller cr reduces redundancy between channels". Why does fewer channels reduce feature redundancy? 
5. What are the implementation details of dynamically choosing the recursion time T in RGM？
