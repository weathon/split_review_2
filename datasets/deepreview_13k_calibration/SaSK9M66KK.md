## Abstract
Domain adaptation plays a pivotal role in deploying models when inference data distribution is different from the training data. It becomes particularly challenging in source-free domain adaptation (SFDA) scenarios, where access to the source domain data is restricted due to data privacy concern. To tackle such cases, existing approaches often resort to generating source-like data for standard unsupervised domain adaptation or endeavor to fine-tune a model pre-trained on a source domain using self-supervised training techniques. Instead, our approach strikes a different path by theoretically analyzing into an empirical risk bound for SFDA. We identify the population risk and domain drift as the major factors from the risk bound. Subsequently, we introduce a top-k importance sampling to purify the pseudo labeling and thus reduce the population risk. We further present a nearest neighbor voting based semantic domain alignment to mitigate the domain drift. An iterative optimization is finally proposed to combine the above two steps for multiple rounds. Extensive experiments across three widely applied domain adaptation datasets, i.e., Office-Home, DomainNet, and VisDA-C, demonstrate the consistently advantageous performance over the state-of-the-art methods.

### Confidence
4: You are confident in your assessment, but not absolutely certain. It is unlikely, but not impossible, that you did not understand some parts of the submission or that you are unfamiliar with some pieces of related work.

### Summary
This paper proposes a simple but effective SFDA solution that focuses on the efficient use of unlabeled data, selecting the parts with rich information and distinct distribution for model optimization.
The theoretical analysis of this solution fully reveals an available SFDA theory, which utilizes top-k samples for reducing inner-class risk and presents a nearest neighbor voting for reducing distribution shift risk.

### Strengths
1. The proposed theoretical analysis exhibits a high degree of comprehensibility, rendering it accessible to researchers and practitioners alike.

2. The experimental results empirically demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed methodologies in enhancing SFDA performance across diverse benchmark datasets.

3. This paper is well-written, which is easy to understand and the intuition behind the proposed regularization-based is clear.

### Weaknesses
1. The proposed approach is based on the known techniques, using all data for training leads to information redundancy, which puts the model in a suboptimal state. 
Training with "key samples" found by data sampling techniques can improve performance. This paradigm has been widely used [1][2][3][4].
Authors should consider introducing literature on similar paradigms in the related work.

2. More ablation studies should be considered. 
The difficulty of adaptation varies across different dataset combinations. 
Existing ablation studies have only discussed Office-home A to C.

(1).  Do all adaptation tasks require 5 rounds to achieve a good result? What is the round number curve for other dataset combinations?

(2). The ratio of labeled data in different dataset combinations should be discussed, so as the " ratio of reliable data" and the " Top-k for neighbors"

(3). Actually, authors can count the number of samples that have been sampled, and even analyze whether there are some common samples (sampled multiple times), which will help to give more convincing analysis and conclusions.

### Questions
My main concern lies with the questions mentioned above concerning weaknesses. Could you kindly furnish me with elaborate responses to them? Having thorough answers to these queries might prompt me to reassess my evaluation.

### Summary
The paper focuses on the problem of source-free domain adaptation (SFDA) that is practically valuable and has attracted widespread attention. Following a theoretical analysis of SFDA that is provided in the paper, population risk and domain drift have been identified as major factors and a new method to address these aspects is proposed. More specifically the method performs iterative optimization and combines top-k importance sampling and nearest neighbour voting-based semantic segmentation domain alignment.

### Strengths
* Theoretical analysis of SFDA is provided and used to motivate the proposed approach.
* The proposed method generally performs well and improves state-of-the-art performance on Office-Home and DomainNet (not on VisDA-C though).
* Extensive comparison with other approaches on Office-Home and VisDA-C datasets (not on DomainNet though).
* There is ablation study to analyse the impact of the different components which is particularly useful as there are multiple components present.
* A very good analysis of hyperparameters is provided.

### Weaknesses
 * The method is relatively more complex as there are several components involved that are needed to obtain strong performance.
* Ablation study would be better designed if various source datasets were considered (even if only three scenarios would be evaluated due to compute).
* DomainNet dataset has only a relatively small number of approaches evaluated.

### Questions
* How does the method compare to others in terms of adaptation time (especially with respect to ERM and the best performing competitors)?

### Summary
Authors analyze Source-free domain adaptation tasks through an empirical risk bound under the assumption that some labels can be obtained. To minimize the risk bound which consists of the population risk term and domain divergence term, authors propose a pseudo labeling strategy and a domain alignment strategy. Experimental results across three domain adaptation datasets are provided to prove the effectiveness of two strategies above.

### Strengths
1. The paper gives a risk bound analysis for source free domain adaptation task.

2. Authors propose two strategies to minimize the population risk term and domain divergence term in the risk bound.

3. The structure of the paper is well organized.

### Weaknesses
1. The assumption of treating pseudo-labels directly as ground truth labels does not fit SFDA tasks, and it is unreasonable to assume that both D_tl and D_tu are both i.i.d sampled from the target doamin, so the correctness of Eq.2 is doubtful.

2. Authors should provide the ablation study about C-sampling and T-sampling to prove the effectiveness of I-sampling.

3. Ablation study should use diverse tasks, three tasks used in Table 3 are from the same source model.

4. Authors should analyze the sensitivity of trade off ρ in Eq. 13.

5. The proposed method is too complicated and does not correspond to the theoretical analysis of the risk bound.

### Questions
1. In Eq.7, if using the intersection between C-sampling and T-sampling, why it degrades to single sampling when the other set is empty?

2. The results of VISDA should be placed in the experimental section.

3. Figure 3 (b)(c) is hard to understand: Why accuracy of pseudo labels decrease from 90% during adaptation? 

Typo error: the caption of Table 3, A->R.

### Summary
This paper analyses the empirical risk bound for SFDA, and proposes a method that picks the reliable sets from target sets and then aligns the reliable pseudo-labeled sets with the remaining unlabeled sets.

### Strengths
- This method is easy to follow.
- The method achieves competitive results with the state-of-the-art methods.

### Weaknesses
The key techniques proposed in this manuscript are not novel. Some papers are highly correlated with the proposed method but not listed in the reference.

   - Besides, the sampling strategies and the curriculum learning regime are also not novel in 2023.

### Questions
- To validate the proposed techniques fairly, I think the author should compare the picking and adaption strategies separately with other well-known picking and adaption strategies. E.g., the minimum entropy, nearest distance to classifier weights, max probability, etc.
- I might improve the rating if the author could illustrate the novelty more clearly.
