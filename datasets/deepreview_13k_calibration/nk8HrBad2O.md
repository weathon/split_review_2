## Abstract
We hypothesize that diffusion models can be used to enhance the performance of deep learning methods for predictive tasks involving sparse outputs, such as point-localization tasks. However, this has two difficulties: slow inference and the stochastic nature of sampling, which leads to variable predictions for different initialization seeds of the sampling chain. To improve inference efficiency, we propose the introduction of task bias in the forward diffusion process, replacing the standard convergence to zero-mean Gaussian noise by convergence to a noise distribution closer to that of the target sparse point localization data. This simplifies the reverse diffusion process and is shown to decrease the number of necessary denoising steps, while improving prediction quality. To decrease prediction variance due to seed stochasticity, we propose a task-guided loss that is shown to decrease the average distance between predictions from different noise realizations. The two contributions are combined into the  Task-Guided Biased Diffusion Model (TGBDM), which maps an initial prediction from a classical localization method into a refined localization map. This is shown to achieve state-of-the-art performance for crowd localization, pose estimation, and cell localization.

### Confidence
3: You are fairly confident in your assessment. It is possible that you did not understand some parts of the submission or that you are unfamiliar with some pieces of related work. Math/other details were not carefully checked.

### Summary
This paper proposes a new method for point localization. The proposed method utilizes diffusion models along with existing point-localization models. The proposed method refines the generated density map from the existing methods and adopts the task-related loss to form the final predictions. The proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performances on some benchmark datasets.

### Strengths
The proposed method is somehow simple yet effective. The proposed method is a general framework and can have performance gains on multiple tasks.

### Weaknesses
However, I still have some concerns about this paper:

1. The proposed method somehow lacks novelty here. In general, the author just utilizes existing methods and with a "Diffusion model" to build the final model predictions. To me, it is like a two-stage/post-processing step of the model. Also, the proposed method is somehow simple: The task loss is not a new component in the model, the author just applies it in the training process of the diffusion model. Also, the biased term is not a brand new idea in the vision community (like non-gaussian diffusion models and others).

2. The "biased" DDPM needs careful design: As I said before, the proposed biased diffusion model is just a diffusion model with prior. The computer vision community has multiple choices to inject priors to the diffusion models like conditions, texture inversions, etc. The author could provide more choices in the ablation step.

3. The experiments part needs to be revised. From my side, the author could have a brief recap of diffusion models in 3.1, then give more space to provide ablations, and more detailed methods (like the proposed framework on different methods in the same task), FPS, training times, etc.

### Summary
This paper proposes a method to use diffusion models for the task of point localization. Specifically, the model introduces a task-guided bias in the diffusion modeling to improve inference efficiency. Besides, it also uses a task-guided loss to decrease the variance of diffusion model predictions in order to increase the accuracy.

### Strengths
- The proposed method may be interesting for the community of specific vision applications such as point localization.
- The paper conducts extensive experiments on three tasks including crowd localization, pose estimation, and cell localization. The comparison with previous results seems to show the promising results of the proposed method in these benchmarks.

### Weaknesses
 - The motivation and hypothesis of the paper may be questionable: At the beginning of the abstract, the author “hypothesize that diffusion models can be used to enhance the performance of deep learning methods for predictive tasks involving sparse outputs, such as point-localization tasks.” Where is this hypothesis or intuition from? What kind of data distribution is learned by the diffusion model in this formulation? Why should the incorporation of a diffusion model be helpful for the sparse outputs? Although Sec. 3.2.1 describes some motivations, it is not very convincing and clear why the diffusion model is inherently helpful in this case. The authors need to provide a more rigorous justification for why a generative model, specifically a diffusion model, is suitable for a discriminative task like point localization. The connection between the generative capabilities of diffusion models and the desired outcome of precise point prediction is not clearly established.
- About the novelty of task-guided bias: In order to reduce sampling steps, the method uses the baseline prediction as initial prediction. This looks very similar to a bunch of previous works on conditional diffusion models, such as [1], while the paper seems not to mention any previous works in this line and no comparison as well. From Sec. 3.2.2, it looks like the forward and backward diffusion process all needs a biased noise distribution, does it mean that the training process of the diffusion model also requires the paired data (initial prediction and ground truth)? This may indicate that for each different dataset/task/baseline to obtain the initial prediction, it is required to train a new diffusion model? What kind of data distribution priors are learned in the process? The paper needs to clarify the novelty of their approach compared to existing conditional diffusion models and provide a detailed explanation of the training data requirements and the learned priors. The dependence on paired data (initial prediction and ground truth) for training raises concerns about the generalizability and practicality of the method.
- About the purpose of task-guided loss: From the paper, this loss is proposed to reduce the variance of prediction from different noise so as to improve accuracy. First, it is not very clear to me why minimizing the stochasticity of the reconstructed samples can help with accuracy. Second, with such constraint, it seems the prior Gaussian noise distribution is collapsed or converted to a delta data distribution? What does this mean in the predictive task? If the stochasticity of the reconstructed samples is not preferred, why not just use a fixed input or deterministic sampling process? The rationale behind using a task-guided loss to reduce variance needs further clarification. The potential collapse of the prior distribution and the implications for the predictive task should be addressed. The authors should justify why a stochastic process is used if deterministic outputs are desired.
- Experiments and results: 1) The proposed method seems to be quite sensitive to the baseline method used to get the initial prediction, as shown in Table 4. 2) The gain and difference between the proposed method compared with corresponding baseline models seem to be relatively small, as shown in Table 4. 3) In Table 1, the precision of the baseline method achieves a much higher score than all other DDPM incorporated methods. Again, what prior has been learned by such a diffusion model and why it should benefit the predictive results. The motivation is not very clear. The experimental results raise questions about the robustness and effectiveness of the proposed method. The sensitivity to the baseline, the small performance gains, and the superior performance of the baseline in some cases all indicate that the method may not be a significant improvement over existing approaches. The paper needs to provide a more thorough analysis of these results.
- One of the many contribution claims of the paper is that task-guided bias can improve sampling efficiency. What is the sampling time of the proposed method? How does it compare with the model without task-guided bias? How does it compare with the baseline models in those tables achieving comparable results? The paper lacks a detailed analysis of the computational cost and sampling time of the proposed method, which is crucial for evaluating its practical applicability. A comparison with baseline methods and a model without task-guided bias is necessary to validate the claim of improved sampling efficiency.
- No discussion about the method limitation in the paper.
- The figure demonstration such as Figure 1 could be further improved.

### Summary
This paper introduces the Diffusion Models to refine the results of point localization from classical methods. Considering the slow inference speed and stochastic nature of sampling of diffusion models, the paper presents the task-biased noise in the forward diffusion process for inference efficiency and a task-guided loss for mitigation of stochasticity. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

### Strengths
1. This paper introduces the task-biased noise in the forward process in place of the zero-mean Gaussian with reasonable derivation for accelerated reverse sampling speed.
2. Experiments on several point localization tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

### Weaknesses
1. The necessity of applying diffusion models to point localization tasks is not illustrated. In other words, the positive properties of diffusion models seem not incorporated into this approach. Whether the diffusion model here can be replaced with other simple network for the same purpose while the posed two problems are correspondingly absent.
2. The proposed method is not correlated to the task of point localization, as the targeted problems are general for diffusion models. So why the point localization tasks are chosen.
3. Lack of the visualization for two out of three comparison tasks (neither in appendix).
4. Introducing the task-biased noise in the forward diffusion process have been proposed in literatures [1][2]. The comparison baselines should include these methods instead of all non-diffusion methods and the discussion is recommended.
5. Please carefully check the full manuscript for writing typos.

### Summary
The authors hypothesize that diffusion models can be used to enhance the performance of deep learning methods for predictive tasks involving sparse outputs, such as point-localization tasks. They introduce two approaches in order to reduce the number of steps required to make a prediction and in order to reduce the variability over different predictions resulting from different Gaussian noise samples fed to the reverse diffusion process. The first one consists of modifying the conditional forward diffusion process such that the evolution of each conditional distribution terminates to non-standard Gaussian, whose mean is a function of a density map predicted by another given baseline method. Second, they modify the loss function and propose a task-guided loss that decreases the average distance between predictions in the experiments they conducted.

### Strengths
- The idea of using non-standard Gaussians as base distributions in conditional diffusion models is interesting. In particular if the generated dimensions will not be very different from the conditioned dimensions, this could potentially simplify the learning task. 
- The empirical results across different datasets and tasks are encouraging.

### Weaknesses
 - While the biased forward diffusion process is defined and derived, the inverse $q(x_{t-1}|x_t,x_0,\tilde{x})$ is not, which normally would allow the definition of the estimated generative process which is not included in the paper. Furthermore, the authors do not provide the KL divergence between $p(x_{t-1}|x_t,\tilde{x})$ and $q(x_{t-1}|x_t,x_0,\tilde{x})$ which would allow the construction of the loss function for the biased conditional diffusion. Only the loss for a vanilla diffusion model is given in Equation (2) (also in $L_n$, n is not defined, it should be $L_{simple}$?). The score estimator $\epsilon_{\theta}$ in loss function in (2) does not admit any dependent variables to condition on. To summarise, no details are provided with regards to the generative process.
- The task-guided loss is not motivated and explained properly. In addition, the expression of the loss $L_t$ is not provided explicitly anywhere in the paper. Furthermore, the ground truth image cannot be reconstructed with the expression (9), and one should notice that the score here is not defined to depend on any conditioned variables either. When $L_t$ is the MSE between $\tilde{x_0}$ and $x_0$, then $L_t$ forces the model to simply try to predict a scaled version of the data point $x_0$. How do the authors justify training the same network to predict both the score and the data point? Training a network to learn one of these enables us to define a function predicting the other (they both enable us to predict the mean of $q(x_{t-1}|x_t,x_0)$, with some modifications), but training the same network to perform both tasks is counter-intuitive to me. In [1] (Equation 16) a similar combination of the loss is used, but here one network focuses on modelling the mean and the other the covariance matrix of $p(x_{t-1}|x_t)$.
- The authors appear to use the classical DDPM from Ho et al 2020, and the classical generative procedure as a baseline, that is, GL+DDPM (and probably in their method, even though that is not described). Considering that the suboptimal classical DDPM generative procedure is used for the baseline, it would be interesting to see the comparison between GL+EDM (which is more efficient [2]) and the model the authors introduce.


Minor Weaknesses:


- In Equation (1), it should be $\sqrt{1-\bar{\alpha}_t}$ in front of the noise instead of $1-\sqrt{\bar{\alpha}_t}$. Also, in Equation (9) $\sqrt{1-\bar{\alpha}_t}$ and $\sqrt{\bar{\alpha}_t}$ should switch places.
- Some parts of the text can be expressed better (example: third line of the abstract).
- The structure is not ideal. The details of diffusion models should be given in Section 2 under a subsection titled 'background' and not in Section 3. In addition, the position of tables/figures and the places when they are referenced should be improved. Figure 3 is referenced in the introduction, but is located in page 5. While Figure 1 is located in page 3, but is referenced for the first time at the end of page 4. Similarly, Table 1, is placed in page 6, but is referenced for the first time in page 8, while table 2 is introduced and referenced in page 7. This makes reading the paper quite confusing. 
- A table with all the steps performed should be given as comparing them just from written text in the current form is difficult.

### Questions
- Why does the AUC drop in Figure 3b at step 10?
- Why was a discrete setting was implemented instead of an SDE diffusion model [3]? Furthermore, more modern conditioning strategies can be used [4].
