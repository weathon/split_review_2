## Abstract
This paper investigates the stochastic contextual bandit problem with general function space and graph feedback. We propose a novel algorithm that effectively adapts to the time-varying graph structures, leading to improved regret bounds in stochastic settings compared with existing approaches. Notably, our method does not require prior knowledge of graph parameters or online regression oracles, making it highly practical and innovative. Furthermore, our algorithm can be modified to derive a gap-dependent upper bound on regrets, addressing a significant research gap in this field. Extensive numerical experiments validate our findings, showcasing the adaptability of our approach to graph feedback settings. The numerical results demonstrate that regrets of our method scale with graph parameters rather than action set sizes. This algorithmic advancement in stochastic contextual bandits with graph feedback shows practical implications in various domains.

### Summary
The paper tackles the challenging problem of multi-armed bandits with arm rewards in general function spaces and time-varying graph feedback.  The central challenge is the quantification of the graph feedback influence on the regret. To make things harder, the graph changes with time and the reward function doesn't have a closed-form structure that can be exploited. 

The authors propose the algorithm FALCON.G to tackle the MAB with a probabilistic time-varying graph feedback problem.  The authors provide both gap-dependent and gap-independent regret bounds and provide matching lower bounds to showcase the optimality of the same. This is supplemented by simulation evidence showcasing the prowess of the proposed methods

### Strengths
The paper exhibits several commendable strengths. 
1. The authors have done an exceptional job in comparing themselves with other closely related works, ensuring that they improve on the subject matter with this paper. This meticulous attention to detail provides readers with a comprehensive understanding of the existing literature in the field. 
2. The proposed method FALCON.G is theoretically proven to be optimal by showing matching upper and lower bounds. Showcasing the dependence on $\delta_f(\cdot)$ for both bounds adds strength to the tightness argument. 
3. Both routine of "Option 1" and "Option 2" setups not only demonstrate practicality but also significantly enhances the complexity of problem-solving as compared to previous works.
4. Overall the clarity and coherence of the writing make the paper accessible and easy to follow.

### Weaknesses
I would really appreciate the author's comments on the following:

1. **UCB-like approach**: The necessity for forced exploration is not clearly justified. The possibility of employing a UCB (Upper Confidence Bound) type scheme is not explored in depth. It would be beneficial if the authors could provide an explanation of the challenges or limitations associated with the UCB approach, specifically in the context of general function spaces and time-varying graph feedback. The paper should elaborate on why constructing valid confidence bounds in this setting is difficult, and what specific hurdles prevent a direct application of UCB-style algorithms.
2. **Offline Oracle**: The usage of regression oracle in FALCON.G resembles (in my opinion) batch regression rather than offline regression.  Especially when considering that FALCON.G utilizes it in the inner loop, albeit not at every cycle. Would you strengthen your argument on the usage of the "offline regression"? Also, what would be the typical complexity for solving the regression problem or would it be an artifact of the functional form of rewards? The paper needs to clarify whether the regression oracle is truly offline, or if it requires access to data from the current round. A discussion on the computational cost of the regression step and how it scales with the size of the function space and the number of arms is also needed.
3. **Fundamental importance of $\delta_f(\cdot)$**: Would really appreciate a section on the discussion as to whether this graph parameter $\delta_f(\cdot)$ is fundamental to the problem or is it just an artifact of the design of FALCON.G and proof methodology. The paper should provide more intuition on the role of $\delta_f(\cdot)$ and whether it is an inherent property of the problem or a consequence of the algorithm's design. It would be helpful to discuss if other algorithms could potentially achieve similar performance without relying on this specific graph parameter.
4. **Real-world dataset**: Would you see any impending issues for running the simulations on a real-world dataset or dataset with much higher dimensions? The paper should address the potential challenges in scaling the proposed algorithm to real-world datasets with high dimensionality, and discuss any modifications that might be needed to handle such scenarios.

### Questions
The paper, while detailed, leaves a few questions unanswered:

1. Theorem 3.1's phrasing presents a contradiction. On one hand, it mentions that the "expectation of regret is taken w.r.t. all kinds of randomness," but then goes on to state the result is "with high probability." What is the specific randomness associated with the high probability argument, and how does it differ from the randomness tied to the expectation? Could you clarify this split?

2. It would be beneficial to have real-world examples that align with the setup described in the paper. Specifically, are there tangible instances where the function class and changing graphs over time can be observed?

3. Regarding Theorem 3.2, how expansive is the function class? Are there any practical applications or examples that fall within these classes that can provide a clearer context?

4. In the simulations section, is it feasible to use the baseline of algorithms from related works for comparison? This would offer a more holistic view of how the proposed methods stack up against existing solutions.

### Summary
In this paper, the authors consider a contextual bandits framework with a general reward function space and side-observations given to the learner in form of (informed) feedback graphs. The authors propose a new algorithm that achieves an improved upper-bound (instance-independent) regret upper-bound than previously known algorithms.  The authors proceed to prove a lower-bound to show the near-optimality of this algorithm (ignoring logarithmic terms and constants). Finally, some modifications are introduced in order to derive a gap-dependent upper-bound. Several experiments are conducted to highlight the improvements of proposed algorithms (and further analyses are realized to show the limitations of previously known algorithms).

### Strengths
As I understand, the paper poses a quite interesting question on the extension of contextual bandit framework with general reward function space (and the associated inverse gap weighting technique) into scenarios with graphical feedbacks. In general, the writing is quite good (although the structure is less so). The authors attempt to provide both concrete proofs and intuition explanation, this is applaudable.
 
Moreover, the authors have done a quite comprehensive comparison with three previous works that facilitates the review tasks.  The authors also keep both options in building the exploration set (which seems to be the key ingredient of the proposed algorithm) and analyse the involved exploration-exploitation trade-off (on top of the traditional trade-off of bandit); which is rather quite interesting although this make the presentation more cumbersome (see below).

### Weaknesses
- The paper is not very well structured; it is not easy to understand the flow of the paper. In particular, although Table 1 and 2 capture quite well the main contributions, the involved notation are not introduced there but scattering across the paper (hence, readers need to revise these tables after finishing the paper to understand the notation). Similarly, while it is good to have a comparison with previous works in Section 1.2, it is hard to understand as no proper description of the contribution is introduced yet (for example, the beginning of page 4 discusses “first and second options” that has never been mentioned before). A simplified version of main theorem before this section, for example, could facilitate the comprehension here. 
- Another major critic is that it does not seem necessary to present ConstructExplorationSet with two options (or at least it lacks a major justification for the necessity of this). As I understand from page 6, “Option 2” is recommended to be used with an integration of empirical best arms from Option 1. Moreover, from Table 1, the major improvement (switching from bounds with independence numbers to bounds with dominating numbers) comes from Option 2. The experiments also show the speriority of this Option 2. I do not see why the authors cannot simply combine these two so-call options into one procedure. 
- The notion delta_f of fractional dominating number is important to this paper, but it is never defined properly. As mentioned above, the ability to obtain a method having bounds with this delta_f instead of alpha is a major point; however, the proof is written only for the alpha case (so-called option 1) and the detailed proof for delta_f is omitted in appendices. Only a small explanation is presented in page 6 that is not sufficient. 
- The idea of the main algorithm is quite natural and obvious (applying IGW to a well-selected exploration set). Can the authors highlight further any novelty of this algorithm or the contribution comes more in the proof aspects? 
- Another point that should be mentioned is that the main result is of the high-probability bound flavour that differs from most of previous works that are directed compared.

### Questions
- Technically, in Tables 1 and 2, results of Wang et al.2021 can be presented with upper-bound of alpha(G_t) and hence, only require to know this upper-bound instead of the real independence number. This mitigate the "critics" in page 4. 

- Do the authors choose to run experiements only in comparison with FALCON and not the one of Zhang et al. 2023 because the latter is instable? 

- Why do the authors prefer high-probability bound? Is it posible/easy to derive an expected regret result from Theorem 3.1?

- The presented framework uses undirected feedback graph, can this be extended with directed ones? (note that Zhang et al. consider directed graph). 

- Can we have a definition of the set S_t?

### Summary
This paper considers the problem of (stochastic) contextual bandits under feedback graphs, which generalizes the classic contextual bandit problem. Specifically, the authors consider the realizable setting [Foster et al., 2018, Foster et al., 2020] where the true expected loss function $f^\star$ lies in a function class $\mathcal{F}$, which is known to the learner. The authors proposed an algorithm based on FALCON [Simchi-Levi & Xu 2022] but with a different choice of exploration set $S_t$ and claimed to achieve $O(\sqrt{\delta T})$ regret where $\delta$ is the averaged expected domination number of feedback graph. This is achieved by selecting $S_t$ to be the dominating set of the graph. The author also shows that with an adaptive tuning technique proposed in [Foster et al., 2020], their proposed algorithm achieves the gap dependent bound $\tilde{O}(\delta/\Delta)$. Moreover, the authors also prove that the problem-independent lower bound is $\Omega(\sqrt{\delta T})$.

### Strengths
- The problem considered in this paper is important and the motivation is clearly stated.

### Weaknesses
- This paper is not written clearly and does not provide clear proofs for the claimed theorems. Specifically, I do not find proofs about the $O(\sqrt{\delta T})$ regret upper bound in the appendix. In fact, this $O(\sqrt{\delta T})$ result just should not hold since it breaks the lower bound proven in [Alon et al., 2015, 2017] even in the non-contextual setting. Consider the star graph (or K-tree graph in the context of this paper). If the center node has 1 loss and the remaining nodes have $Ber(1/2)$ loss except for one node having $Ber(1/2-\epsilon)$ loss, we can not do better than $\min(\sqrt{KT}, T^{2/3})$ regret bound but what claimed in this paper is a $O(\sqrt{T})$ regret bound. Although the authors do not show the exact analysis in the appendix for the $O(\sqrt{\delta T})$ result, technically, the error is that their Lemma B.2, Lemma B.3 both consider the policy on $\Psi(S_t)$ but the regret benchmark may not be within this set, making the analysis break.

- For the upper bound result achieving $O(\sqrt{\alpha T})$ regret, option 1 for ConstructExplorationSet is actually also not new and is shown in Proposition 4 of [Zhang et al., 2023] for self-aware undirected graphs. Therefore, I feel that the result with respect to the independence number is also not hard to obtain based on FALCON and this exploration set construction.

### Questions
Can authors provide detailed proofs for the results claimed in the paper, especially for the upper bound results that is related to the dominating number?
