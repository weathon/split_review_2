## Abstract
In this work, we generalize the problem of learning through interaction in a POMDP by accounting for eventual additional information available at training time.
    First, we introduce the informed POMDP, a new learning paradigm offering a clear distinction between the information at training and the observation at execution.
    Next, we propose an objective that leverages this information for learning a sufficient statistic of the history for the optimal control.
    We then adapt this informed objective to learn a world model able to sample latent trajectories.
    Finally, we empirically show a learning speed improvement in several environments using this informed world model in the Dreamer algorithm.
    These results and the simplicity of the proposed adaptation advocate for a systematic consideration of eventual additional information when learning in a POMDP using model-based RL.

### Summary
This paper considers the problem of learning in POMDPs with privileged information during training time. The motivation is that POMDPs are in general very hard to solve; however, often during training there can be substantially more information revealed to help learn the policy than what is available at test time. This work makes progress towards this goal by proposing the Informed Dreamer algorithm which attempts to model a sufficient statistic that is enough for optimal control, combined with the model-based Dreamer algorithm. Experiments across a variety of domains are presented.

### Strengths
- The problem is very well motivated and I think this is relevant to people in the RL community.
- The solution is also well motivated by the theory and technically interesting from that standpoint. The method also appears to be fairly flexible to the level of privileged information that is available.
- The experiments are conducted on many different environments, which helps paint a fairly complete picture of the performance of the method.
- The paper is clearly presented.

### Weaknesses
 - The gains are only marginally better than without privileged information. There are also no comparisons to alternative algorithms (like those mentioned in the related work), so it’s hard to judge the merits beyond how it can potentially outperform the uniformed version.
- There are a few examples of the informed method converging to a reward above the convergence of the uninformed method. There are also a few showing the opposite. Given this, I think this paper could really strengthen its position if it studied a practically interesting POMDP that would otherwise be completely intractable to solve alone (without information), but becomes solvable with training information. I believe this would constitute a very convincing result of the importance of privileged information empirically.
- The main paper does not spend much time investigating the failures that arise or trying to explain why they do. Based on the motivating theory it is not clear to me why they would happen since there is strictly more information available in the training time and the procedure would otherwise be the same. Thus, I wonder: what are the causes of informed dreamer failing to keep up with uninformed dreamer? Could it just be hyperparameters or issues with optimization? I think it would have been nice to investigate this.

### Questions
- Why does the reward decrease over time for some of the environments? E.g. Noisy position cart pole.
- In (10) it may be helpful to say that I is the mutual information (I assume?) to distinguish it from \tilde{I}.
- In 3.1 there’s a typo on $\gamma \in$...
- Beyond settings where $i = s$, what are practically relevant scenarios where you would see $s \rightarrow i  \rightarrow o$ non-trivially? For the sake of exposition, do you also have non-examples where you might have $i$ a training time but $s$ is not conditionally independent of $o$?

### Summary
This paper proposes informed POMDP, a formalization that utilizes additional information about the state (information beyond the agent’s observations) that is only available during training time. It is assumed that this additional training information is designed such that observation is conditionally independent of the state given this information. Using this information, the authors propose a world model, obtained by leveraging the information for learning a recurrent sufficient statistic, to sample latent trajectories. The authors then adapt Dreamer model-based RL algorithm to use the informed world model and show improvement in convergence speed when compared to Dreamer on a variety of environments.

### Strengths
- The informed POMDP is a natural and useful formalization that clearly articulates how additional training information can be incorporated in model-based RL. Such additional information is well motivated, especially when the agents are trained in simulation and have access to privileged information/full state information.
- The theoretical results connecting predictive models and sufficient statistics for optimal control look technically sound and are in line with prior results in similar existing work.
- The proposed approach is simple and intuitive, and can be easily adapted in many existing model-based RL approaches. The authors demonstrate this by adapting Dreamer with a modified objective and world model.
- The empirical results demonstrate clear benefits on a variety of POMDP environments when compared to Dreamer. The informed model leads to substantially faster convergence in some environments.

### Weaknesses
 - The theoretical justification for why an informed model-based policy should converge faster, particularly in the case of informed Dreamer, isn’t completely clear. Is this solely because the recurrent state-space model in the informed world model has access to complete state information, used as the additional information, in all examples? It's not clear if the improved convergence is due to the specific structure of the informed model or simply because it has access to more information during training. The paper lacks a rigorous analysis of how the information content of the additional signal affects convergence, making it difficult to isolate the benefits of the proposed method.
- While the experiments demonstrate that informed Dreamer converges faster than Dreamer in the environments tested, I don’t think this is necessarily indicative of the question of how useful the additional information is in solving POMDPs - I believe all it shows is that having access to full state information during training outperforms Dreamer in convergence speed. There should be comparison with other SOTA methods that are focused on POMDP and can exploit handle the additional information (that the Dreamer baseline doesn’t have access to in the experiments). The experiments do not sufficiently isolate the impact of the informed model in the context of POMDPs. The comparisons should include methods that also leverage additional information during training, to demonstrate the unique benefits of the proposed approach beyond simply having access to more data.

### Questions
- How sensitive are the improvements in convergence speeds to the choice of additional information? What happens when only a subset of the full state information (in addition to observations) is shared as the additional information? Do they degrade gracefully? (I acknowledge the comments on learning degradation in varying mountain hike example but this question still stands).
- Could you provide any theoretical analysis characterizing what types of additional information are most useful? Perhaps in more restricted, simpler POMDPs?
- I’m curious how consistent/different were the reconstructed observations in the case of informed world model and the baseline dreamer world model in imagined rollouts.

### Summary
This paper proposes a model-based RL method for partially observable environments that exploits additional information during training.

The paper introduces a nice framework called the informed POMDP, which introduces an additional variable "i" (information variable) between the state and observation such that the observation is independent of the state given i.
Predicting this variable i is supposed to be easier than o --- accelerating the representation learning --- but also sufficient for optimal control (based on the fact that its sufficient to predict the observation), hence they show theoretically sound.

In practice, they do this by adjusting dreamerv3 [1] to learn to decode the state rather than the observation.
In some domains this improves the learning rate, presumably because is it easier / quicker to learn to predict the (more informative or more compactly represented) state than the observation.

Altogether I believe this is a fantastic step into a promising direction, that of exploiting additional information during training, which has been more common in model-free approaches (typically through auxiliary learning tasks, which has parallels with the proposed work).
Their dreamerv3 seems to work at least as good as the original one, fairly consistently beating it with somewhat, on domains including "mountain hike", "velocity control", and "pop gym".

### Strengths
This paper is clearly written and proposes a solution method that should be relevant to a significant portion of the RL community: those that care about partial observability or dreamer-like solution methods.
The proposed setting, that of exploiting additional information during training in partially observable environments, is reasonable and a promising direction that has not been explored for model-based RL much yet.
Lastly, I found the formalization of the informaed POMDP and the theoretical support helpful.

So, altogether, this is a good fit for ICLR based on those reasons.

### Weaknesses
The main points of improvement, in my opinion, is in the actual implementation of the theoretical ideas in this paper.
In particular, the resulting algorithm is a minor change in which dreamerv3 is learned to decode the state, rather than the observation. It is not hard to see that this, likely, will lead to an easier learning task, hence improving performance.

Furthermore, the results are not nearly as impressive as they should be for a method that suddenly assumes access to the state during training. This is an incredibly strong assumption in most real applications and thus heavily limits its applicability. Yet, performance-wise, we see a minor improvement on most and only one some significant performance boost.

Lastly, while the theoretical set up was nice to see and thorough, I did not find the findings particularly surprising or promising:
It is rather obvious that if predicting the observation is "good enough" than predicting anything that can fully explain (predict) the observation also has that property.

Lastly, I found it particularly frustrating how hard it was to piece together exactly the difference between the proposed method and dreamer, since the notation is just slightly different enough that it takes a lot of puzzling to align the two.

### Summary
The paper introduces a new formalisation for learning optimal policies in POMDPs where the agent is allowed to additional information during training. The additional information, denoted as i, is assumed to be a function of the underlying state s, which makes the observation o conditionally independent of s given i. 

The paper then proves that a representation of the history is sufficient for optimal control if it is recurrent and can accurately predict the next reward and the next information i. This is different to the prior works, which looks for sufficient representation that can predict the next reward and the next observation o. 

After providing a learning objective for such sufficient representations, the paper presents a practical method that combines the learning objective and DreamerV3, a state-of-the-art MBRL method. 

Through experiments, the paper investigates main two research questions. First, does the use of priviledged information during training improve the convergence of the agent? It also briefly studies the impact of different information on the speed of the agents' training.

### Strengths
The paper is well written. 

Sufficient relevant works have been discussed. 

Experimental evaluation is conducted on a diverse set of environments.

### Weaknesses
## Novelty

One of the main contributions of this paper is the proposal of the informed POMDP formalization.
The key novelty I find form this formalization is that it enables a new objective for learning sufficient statistics in POMDPs, which relies on predicting the next reward and information instead of the next reward and observation as in prior works.
Building on top of DreamerV3, this formalization leads to a practical MBRL algorithm that leverages additional information during training and does not need to reconstruct observations.

While I acknowledge that this is a new and promising idea, I don't find it very novel.
As discussed in the paper, asymmetric learning for learning policies in POMDPs has already been well explored.
The paper leverages this idea and combines it with MBRL approaches for POMDPs, which are not new neither.
The theoretical result is not suprising. Intuitively, if a representation of the history is predictive for the reward and information, it should also be predictive for the reward and observation by the construction of information i. The later has already been proven sufficient for optimal control by Subramanian et al. (2022).

## Experimental evaluation
I also have concerns on the experimental evaluation.

1. The authors hypothesize that leveraging this additional information will improve the convergence of the agents. However, I don't think this hypothesis is clearly supported by the results as I don't see significant improvement from informedDreamer. Moreover, for domains in which the authors claim that informedDreamer performs better at the end of training, I don't find the results very convincing due to the large standard errors. In Table 2, the large standard errors make the confidence intervals of informed and uniformed heavily overlap with each other. I would strongly suggest to run more random seeds to reduce the standard errors.

I would also like to see more reasoning for the hypothesis that leveraging such additional information will improve convergence. I disagree with the reasoning that because the information i contains more information than the observation o, the new objective will be better than the classical objective. Rather, I would argue that learning to predict i, a more complex variable, instead of o, a simpler varibale as it's function of i, might actually make the objective harder to optimize. And it is not necessary.

2. To understand the proposed method well, I think it is important to investigate the impact of different information on the training. The paper explores this question but only in one environment. I think more ablation study on this question would greatly increase the value of this research. For example, one can conduct similar controlled experiments in other domains. Or dive deeper by looking at the losses of different components of the learning objective.

### Questions
Questions:
- It seems that in Figure 4(b), there is no confidence interval. Does this mean that the standard error is 0?
- Does the proposed method introduce new hyperparameters? How are they tuned? For example, are there any coefficients used to balance different losses in the learning objective?

Minor:
- I would suggest to add the uninformed baseline in Figure 4(b) as well for comparison. 
- Typo: Section 3.1 the discount factor \gamma \in [0,1[
- There seems to be a double citation in the second paragraph of introduction: Gregor et al. 2019. 
- Figure 4 can be made larger.
