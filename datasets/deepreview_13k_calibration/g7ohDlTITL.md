## Abstract
We propose Riemannian Flow Matching (RFM), a simple yet powerful framework for training continuous normalizing flows on manifolds. Existing methods for generative modeling on manifolds either require expensive simulation, are inherently unable to scale to high dimensions, or use approximations for limiting quantities that result in biased training objectives. Riemannian Flow Matching bypasses these limitations and offers several advantages over previous approaches: it is simulation-free on simple geometries, does not require divergence computation, and computes its target vector field in closed-form. The key ingredient behind RFM is the construction of a relatively simple premetric for defining target vector fields, which encompasses the existing Euclidean case. To extend to general geometries, we rely on the use of spectral decompositions to efficiently compute premetrics on the fly. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on many real-world non-Euclidean datasets, and we demonstrate tractable training on general geometries, including triangular meshes with highly non-trivial curvature and boundaries.

### Summary
This paper proposes Riemannian flow matching (RFM), a generalization of Euclidean flow matching techniques to arbitrary (complete and connected) Riemannian manifolds. The basic idea is similar to the Euclidean setting, where the authors seek to learn a vector field pushing a tractable base distribution to the data distribution, which is achieved by conditional flow matching on a specified path of probability measures. However, the Riemannian setting introduces several challenges, chiefly in the construction of said probability paths and corresponding flows. The authors demonstrate how to construct such flows using general premetrics, a special case of which is the geodesic distance. Practically, the method enables is simple, scalable approach for learning continuous-time normalizing flows on general manifolds.

### Strengths
- The problem of learning models with geometric constraints is both difficult and important, and this paper solves several key practical challenges present in prior work in this area (namely, simulation-free and scalable training).
- The paper is a joy to read -- the paper is atypically clear in its aims, methods, and results.
- The empirical support for the method is clear and convincing across a diverse set of settings, and the evidence provided by the experiments generally supports the conclusions drawn by the authors.
- All theoretical claims made in the paper are, to the best of my knowledge, complete and correct.

### Weaknesses
 - It would have been interesting to have an experiment exploring the effect of $k$ on the learned model (i.e. the number of terms taken in the spectral distance, Equation 16). Specifically, how does the choice of $k$ impact the accuracy of the learned vector field and the resulting generated samples? Does a larger $k$ consistently lead to better performance, or is there a point of diminishing returns? Furthermore, it would be valuable to see how the computational cost scales with $k$, as this could be a limiting factor in practice.
- In the same vein, additional experiments on the choice of scheduler $\kappa(t)$ could provide valuable practical insights regarding the design of these models. For instance, how does the choice of scheduler affect the stability of training and the quality of the generated samples? Are there specific schedulers that are better suited for certain types of manifolds or data distributions? It would be helpful to see a comparison of different schedulers, perhaps including linear, cosine, and exponential schedules, and how they impact the learned flow.

### Questions
- The base measure used throughout the paper is the uniform distribution. Is there any benefit to considering non-uniform base distributions? While the theory easily admits arbitrary base distributions, are there practical challenges in using non-uniform distributions?
- Some more exposition regarding practical choices surrounding premetric choices would improve the paper. For instance, can we say anything about what makes a particular premetric "good"? Are there principled reasons someone would choose the diffusion distance over the biharmonic distance? Are spectral distances chosen in Section 3.2 primarily for practical reasons, or are there other aspects that make the corresponding premetrics desirable? Is there a compelling reason spectral distances use the spectrum of Laplace-Beltrami operator, rather than some other operator?

### Summary
This work presents a Flow matching framework for generative modeling on Riemannian manifolds, where the paper proposes a novel and simple conditional flow defined on general manifolds through the premetric. Experimental results show that the proposed approach can effectively model data on diverse manifolds and can scale to higher dimensions which previous diffusion models failed.

### Strengths
- The paper is well-written and easy to follow with sufficient background and related works. 

- The proposed framework provides important advantages over previous methods: (1) does not require divergence computation for training and is thereby scalable to higher dimensions and (2) readily adaptable to general manifolds.

- Especially, the construction of the conditional flows using the premetrics is novel which makes the proposed method applicable to general geometries.

- This work presents the application to data on general manifolds such as manifolds with non-trivial curvature (triangular mesh) or manifolds with boundaries (maze), whereas previous diffusion models were limited to simple manifolds (e.g., sphere, torus) and their product manifolds.

### Weaknesses
 - The advantage of simulation-free training on simple geometries is not clear. How fast is the training of the proposed approach compared to the training of previous diffusion models? As RSGM (Riemannian Score-based Generative Model) observes that they achieve similar test NLL with only 5 in-training simulation steps (Section O.1), I think that the simulation-free training does not provide significant time efficiency.

- The reason for the outperformance of the proposed framework is not clear. Why does the proposed method outperform the Riemannian Diffusion model? Further, why does CNF Matching show superior performance on Earthquake and Flood datasets over the proposed method?


### Questions
- Please address the questions in the Weakness.

- Why is the result of the proposed method for Flood dataset in Table 2 highlighted in bold even though CNF Matching shows better result?

- Can the other diffusion models applied to general manifolds such as the triangular mesh? For example, RSGM seems to be applicable when using the denoised score matching with the Varadhan approximation.

### Summary
The authors propose a method Riemannian Flow Matching for finding continuous normalizing flows on manifolds. The main idea is to construct flows from noise samples towards samples from the training distribution in such a way that the entire flow concentrates around the specific training example. The flows can be constructed by flowing along gradients of the Riemannian distance, or, as the authors show, gradients of a premetric. Such premetrics can be constructed to give flows that are efficient to evaluate.

### Strengths
- well-written and clearly presented paper
- I believe the main idea with the conditional flows arising from premetrics is both interesting and efficient
- the method avoids some of limitations of other approaches including being simulation-free in some cases and avoiding divergence computations

### Weaknesses
I have not identified substantial weaknesses.
