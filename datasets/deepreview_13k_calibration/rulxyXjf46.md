## Abstract
Conformal prediction (CP) for regression can be challenging, especially when the output distribution is heteroscedastic, multimodal, or skewed. Some of the issues can be addressed by estimating a distribution over the output, but in reality, such approaches can be sensitive to estimation error and yield unstable intervals.~Here, we circumvent the challenges by converting regression to a classification problem and then use CP for classification to obtain CP sets for regression.~To preserve the ordering of the continuous-output space, we design a new loss function and make necessary modifications to the CP classification techniques.~Empirical results on many benchmarks shows that this simple approach gives surprisingly good results on many practical problems. \looseness=-1

### Summary
The paper proposes a new way to do conformal prediction for regression based on conformalizing a regression-to-classification method. It is claimed that the new method offers higher flexibility compared to using a traditional regressor, making it more suitable for heteroscedastic or multimodal data.

### Strengths
- The paper tackles a traditional conformal problem, but still seems to offer improvements to the state-of-the-art. 
- The method proposed is interesting; I had not previously seen this regression-as-classification setup in literature and appreciate the authors providing a number of references to the broader framework. 
- The paper is easy to follow, although there are some issues which I will point out in weaknesses. I also noticed the choice to not state and/or highlight the conformal coverage guarantee, which is often oversold nowadays. (I still think you should state the guarantee at least in the Appendix so that readers unfamiliar with conformal prediction are aware of it.)

### Weaknesses
## Writing 
Some parts of the paper were difficult to follow: 
- The proposed method was not easy to understand before seeing Algorithm 1. I felt Section 3 had too many comments on "motivation" that do not focus on the actual method and are a bit counterproductive to a quick read. E.g., Sec 3.1, "We  aim to compute... classification context" does not add much. In the end, you have a traditional neural network with softmax output, which everyone understands. Similarly the comment "This approach is both straightforward and efficient ... information or structure." does not add anything substantial. Sec 3.2 "It would be desirable to be able to use similar methods for both classification and regression conformal prediction". This is a somewhat subjective (and distracting) claim that I believe is best avoided. The paragraph starting with "These values yˆ ∈ Yˆ f..." is unnecessarily verbose. Sec 3.3 introduces a loss function without giving an example of what it could be. It would be beneficial to explicitly state the form of the loss function used in the experiments, as this is crucial for reproducibility and understanding the method's behavior. The current description is too abstract.
- Table 1 is very hard to understand since (i) the methods are not connected to the acronyms, (ii) it is not clear what is inside the brackets, (iii) length and coverage is not defined in the paper. The lack of clear definitions for these terms makes it difficult to interpret the results and compare them with existing methods. Furthermore, the acronyms should be defined in the caption or in the text, not just in the table itself.

## Technical concerns
- Most results are not reported with error bars making them less reliable. For instance, in Table 1, CHR does worse than CQR but it should not? (both methods are proposed by similar authors and CHR comes later). The absence of error bars makes it difficult to assess the statistical significance of the results and to determine whether the observed differences are meaningful. It is crucial to report standard deviations or confidence intervals to properly evaluate the performance of the proposed method.
- Have you considered a baseline where you learn a regressor directly using the same neural network architecture, treat that regressor as \bar{q}, and apply the same conformalization? It is similar to the "optimal prediction sets" in Appendix F here: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1910.10562.pdf . This baseline is important to establish the advantage of the proposed method over a more straightforward approach. Without this comparison, it is hard to determine if the complexity of the R2C method is justified.

I am not familiar with the regression-as-classification (R2C) literature. The main concern I have is that it is unclear which aspects of the R2C method are novel and which ones directly derive from previous work. Have you made significant changes to previous R2C methods to adapt them to the conformal problem? The key relevant technique seems to be smoothing; has these been proposed before?

### Questions
- Could you elaborate on what linear interpolation is used to go from q_\theta to \bar{q}_\theta? It is not clear to me at all. 
- You have pointed out a number of papers which advocate for regression-as-classification. However, it is still not convincing as to why we should first destroy the ranking structure of reals, and then reinstate it using the entropic regularization. Why not just do usual regression?
- Which aspects of the R2C method are novel and which ones directly derive from previous work? Have you made significant changes to previous R2C methods to adapt them to the conformal problem? The key relevant technique seems to be smoothing; has these been proposed before?

### Summary
The paper proposes to see a regression problem as a classification one, and then to apply ideas issued from conformal prediction in order to derive predictions regions that may not be compact sets (here, union of intervals).

### Strengths
+: an interesting view of the problem, especially as this allows the conformal predictions to be easily something else than intervals, something that may indeed be of important interest for regression. No other conformal regression methods that I know of achieve this kind of things, with maybe the exception of "Conformal prediction in manifold learning" (not cited by the authors, but the paper is only weakly related to the present work), since intervals on the manifold may well turn out to be non-compact in the original space. 

+: a quite well written paper, and a method simple enough to be applicable in a wide range of settings. 

+: experiments that are convincing enough to show the interest of the method.

### Weaknesses
 -: the way authors frame the regression problem as a classification is very, very close to the standard ordinal regression problem, and I really missed some positioning with respect to this literature. There is a huge literature on ordinal regression (maybe look at a general paper, e.g., "Tutz, G. (2022). Ordinal regression: A review and a taxonomy of models. Wiley Interdisciplinary Reviews: Computational Statistics, 14(2), e1545."), but also a couple papers using ordinal conformal classification (see questions).



### Questions
- Could you position the current paper with respect to papers dealing with ordinal conformal regression? Two I know of (there could be others, but not much more) are "Xu, Y., Guo, W., & Wei, Z. (2023, July). Conformal Risk Control for Ordinal Classification. In Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (pp. 2346-2355). PMLR." and "Lu, C., Angelopoulos, A. N., & Pomerantz, S. (2022, September). Improving trustworthiness of ai disease severity rating in medical imaging with ordinal conformal prediction sets. In International Conference on Medical Image Computing and Computer-Assisted Intervention (pp. 545-554). Cham: Springer Nature Switzerland.". 

- It seems to me that the conformal scores used in Algorithm 1 mostly rely on modal values. In ordinal regression, it is much more common to use the average rank (under $L_2$ loss) or the median (under $L_1$ loss) as predictions. Could you comment on such options? 

- It would be nice to have an idea of how often the output predictions regions are not interval, to have an idea of how often we depart from classical methods. Would it be possible ot have an idea (in the appendix or main paper).

- Could you display full coverage curve (say, from 90% to 99%) rather than table for a fixed value? (side remark: there is a double ?? in appendix B). 

- Bonus question for myself: do you have an idea of how the present method could be adapted to multi-variate output settings?

### Summary
The paper proposes to convert 1D regression problems into K-class classification problems by partitioning the label space into K bins.  This
allows leveraging known techniques for classification CP. Like Lei et al. 2004, the authors use the conditional density produced by the classification model as a conformity score. On top of it, a regularization model is trained to enforce smoothness when the discrete distribution is converted back to a continuous one.

### Strengths
I like the idea of learning the conformity score is interesting.  Works like [1] also use density estimation to adjust the conformity score. But the authors' approach is intrinsically different.  The proposed objective function seems a good alternative to optimizing the efficiency of the prediction intervals.

### Weaknesses
The role of the discretization step may be explained better. The authors could emphasize the difference with other techniques for estimating conditional densities or explain why the proposed approach does not suffer from the usual instability of standard estimators.

- Is the smoothness-enforcing penalty new?
- How were K and Tau chosen? Is part of the data used for training the conditional distribution?
- Why should the entropy regularization be expected to be good at learning bi-modal distributions?
- The size of the prediction intervals is a good measure of efficiency. Another one is the correlation between the test errors and the corresponding intervals. It would be interesting to see a scatter plot of the absolute residual versus the prediction intervals in a couple of data sets where R2CCP is or is not the best algorithm.
- Is the proposed approach equivalent to training a parameterized conformity function (see for example in [2] or [3])?

### Summary
This paper presents a new method to model the conditional density in heteroscedastic regression problems. The idea is to convert metric regression to an ordinal regression problem, in which the conditional density is approximated by a number of fixed bins. This is in essence a histogram approach. Unlike most ordinal regression methods, the authors do not consider an underlying latent continuous variable, but they model every bin via a separate neuron propagating from the embedding layer. A softmax operation is used to guarantee that a valid probability density function is returned, but, unlike classification methods, a loss function that incorporates the order in the bins is used during training. 

In a conformal prediction type of experiments, the authors show that this new model results in better prediction sets compared to some baselines for modelling the conditional density, such as quantile regression and kernel density estimation.

### Strengths
- The paper is well written and easy to follow
- The paper has some novelty, although I would argue that the core idea is just an application of reference Stewart et al. 
- I enjoyed reading this paper, and I am convinced that the method can work relatively well for regression problems with multimodal conditional density distributions
- I liked that some limitations of the method are discussed at the end. However, I do see other limitations as well.

### Weaknesses
I do see several important weaknesses. 

1. Contributions:
After reading the introduction it was not clear to me what the contributions are. This only became clear to me after reading the experiments. Contributions should be clear from the beginning. To my opinion, the main contribution is proposing a new nonparametric method for modelling the conditional density. However, I don't see any contribution w.r.t. conformal prediction. In the experiments, the authors only consider the standard split conformal prediction, which is arguably not the most useful type of evaluation for heteroscedastic regression problems. I would argue that conditional coverage guarantees need to be analyzed in such cases. This can be established via Mondrian conformal prediction or normalized nonconformity scores, such as normalized absolute residuals. Estimates of the variance could be obtained with any method that models conditional densities, or with methods that directly estimate the variance, such as mean-variance neural networks. So, in that regard, I find the scope and the experimental setup quite limited. 

2. Baselines:
The authors consider a few other methods for estimating the conditional density, such as kernel density estimation and quantile regression. However, many other methods exist for estimating the conditional density. Since this is the key contribution of the paper, I would like to see a more thorough experimental and theoretical comparison with such methods. Examples of such methods are mean-variance neural networks, conditional transformation models and methods based on normalizing flows. The proposed method estimates the conditional density via a specific histogram. Methods based on nearest neighbors and regression trees also produce histogram-style conditional densities. Another approach to model multimodal distributions is via Gaussian mixtures. So, there is a lot out there already... Where should we situate the new method is this diverse landscape? I would classify the new method as yet another way of modelling the conditional density. Not better or worse than others, perhaps useful in specific situations, such as multimodal distributions, but more discussion is needed.  

3. Limitations of the method:
- By modelling the conditional density as a histogram, one obtains a very non-smooth approximation of the density. So, that's why interpolation is needed to obtain good nonconformity scores. Some of the other methods that are described above don't have this limitation. 

- The number of bins looks like a very tricky hyperparameter to tune. The performance probably highly depends on that hyperparameter. What would be a good way to tune this hyperparameter? Another tricky hyperparameter is the level of entropy regularization. I would assume that the results are also very sensitive to that hyperparameter.

- I believe that the proposed method might work reasonably well for multimodal distributions that are not too complex, but I would not recommend this method for unimodal regression problems. For such problems, there are too many degrees of freedom.

4. Unclear aspects of the experiments
- In Table 3 a lot of standard deviations are zero, or close to zero. How is that possible? What is randomized? With randomizations of the testset these numbers are unrealistically small I would say. 
- Table 1 versus Table 3: normally one would see that the length of the intervals increases when the coverage increases. So, the two criteria highly depend on each other. Any comparison of two methods should always make the trade-off between those two criteria.

### Questions
See above.
In addition, what's novel in this paper compared to reference Stewart et al.?
