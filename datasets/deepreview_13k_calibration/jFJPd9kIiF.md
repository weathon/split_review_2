## Abstract
This paper introduces \emph{Least Volume}---a simple yet effective regularization inspired by geometric intuition---that can reduce the necessary number of latent dimensions needed by an autoencoder without requiring any prior knowledge of the intrinsic dimensionality of the dataset. We show that the Lipschitz continuity of the decoder is the key to making it work, provide a proof that PCA is just a linear special case of it, and reveal that it has a similar PCA-like importance ordering effect when applied to nonlinear models. We demonstrate the intuition behind the regularization on some pedagogical toy problems, and its effectiveness on several benchmark problems, including MNIST, CIFAR-10 and CelebA.

### Summary
This paper proposes the least volume regularization method for autoencoder training. It reduces the geometric mean of standard deviation of latent vectors, while imposing Lipschitz continuity on the decoder to prevent trivial solutions. By applying this regularizer, latent representations become sparser, effectively reducing latent dimensionality while preserving reconstruction capabilities. It is shown that employing the least volume regularization in linear autoencoder results in PCA. Numerical experiments are performed to compare the least volume regularization with other sparsity-inducing methods.

### Strengths
- The mathematical derivations are sound, and minimizing volume while setting an upper bound on the decoder’s Lipschitz constant seems a clever approach.
- The connection established between PCA and the least volume regularization for linear autoencoders is intriguing and serves as a compelling rationale for this method.
- The notion of “explained reconstruction” seems convincing for investigating the importance of each latent dimension in the autoencoder.

### Weaknesses
 - The practical applicability of the proposed regularization method and the usefulness of the obtained low-dimensional latent spaces seem quite limited. The appendix contains some experiments of k-NN prediction in the latent space, but the accuracy is much lower than state-of-the-art methods. This raises concerns about the practical value of the learned representations beyond simple reconstruction tasks. The paper does not adequately demonstrate that the learned latent space offers any advantages for downstream tasks compared to existing dimensionality reduction techniques.
- The analysis of latent dimensions is primarily centered around reconstruction error, but the paper could explore other ways to assess the properties of obtained latent dimensions. For example, investigating the impact of small variations along each dimension on images would be insightful. Such an analysis could reveal whether the learned dimensions correspond to semantically meaningful features or are simply abstract representations optimized for reconstruction. Furthermore, the paper lacks a comparative analysis of the disentanglement properties of the learned latent space compared to other methods.
- Certain algorithmic details, such as the hyperparameters for the power method in spectral normalization of decoders, are missing. This lack of detail makes it difficult to reproduce the results and assess the sensitivity of the method to these parameters. The paper should provide a more thorough description of the implementation details to ensure reproducibility and allow for a more complete understanding of the method's behavior.

### Questions
- If the data sets are composed of distinct clusters, would this least volume regularization provide meaningful cluster structures?
- Can this method be used to estimate the intrinsic dimensionality of a data set? How are the obtained latent set dimensions close to the exact data set dimensions (if known)?
- How do the overall outcomes, such as latent set dimensions, reconstruction losses, and the correlation between explained reconstruction and the standard deviations of latent dimensions, change when the dimension of the encoding latent space is altered?
- Is the regularizer computed on minibatch? If so, how is the minibatch estimate reliable? How is this method scalable?
- What is the meaning of ‘Raw Data’ in Tables B.7 and 8? Does it represent the performance without regularization? Moreover, why does volume regularization show distinct performance compared to other methods in CIFAR-10 experiments, even if they have similar latent set dimensions and similar reconstruction loss?
- Is this regularization method only effective in the autoencoder setting? How can this regularization method be extended to other applications?

[Minor comments]
- $\mathcal{H}$ is not defined in Section 2.3.
- There is a discrepancy between the loss function described in Section 5.1 (binary cross-entropy) and the loss types shown in the figures (L2 reconstruction loss).

### Summary
The paper proposes a regularization scheme for autoencoders that allows for automatic determination of the latent dimension. This is achieved by measuring the product of axis-aligned standard deviations of the latent codes. This is simple and seems to work well for its purpose. The proposed regularizer is studied extensively theoretically which shows links to the ordering of latent dimensions known from PCA.

### Strengths
* The presented regularizer is simple, intuitive, and seems easy to implement (this is very good).
* The proposed approach is well-studied theoretically
* Experimentally, the approach appears to work well.

### Weaknesses
* To me, it seems like the main weakness is that the approach relies on several tuning parameters ($K$, $\eta$, $\lambda$) and it is unclear how to set these and how they interact with each other. Specifically, the interplay between $K$ (related to decoder complexity) and $\eta$ (which interpolates between geometric and arithmetic means of standard deviations) is not sufficiently explored. How does changing $K$ affect the optimal $\eta$ for a given dataset? Furthermore, the paper does not provide a clear methodology for selecting $\lambda$, the regularization strength. A more detailed analysis of the sensitivity of the model's performance to these parameters is needed.
* The experiments are somewhat limiting. They basically show that the approach can succeed in reducing latent dimension while retaining good reconstruction. It would have been nice with experiments showing that the resulting models then were more useful for some task, such as downstream classification or anomaly detection. Demonstrating improved performance on a downstream task would strengthen the claim that the method learns a more meaningful latent representation.
* I miss experiments on the interaction between tuning parameters. For instance, how does the optimal $\lambda$ change as a function of $K$ and $\eta$? A grid search or other systematic exploration of the parameter space would provide valuable insights into the robustness of the method.
* The approximation $L = J + \lambda L_{vol}$ should be more prominent (it's easily missed). This approximation is central to the proposed method, and its implications should be discussed more thoroughly in the main text.

### Questions
* How do you tune the free parameters?
* On page 5, what is $\pi$? I couldn't figure it out from the context.
* The error bars in fig 2 are quite small. Does that imply that things are stable wrt choice of $\lambda$ or that the studied $\lambda$-range was too small?

### Summary
The authors introduce a method called "least volume" that regularizes an autoencoder to minimize the volume of the hypercube spanned by the standard deviations of its latent representations.

They directly minimize this product to via an additional loss term. The authors identify a necessary constraint for the latent representation volume to correspond to disentanglement, namely the K-Lipschitz constraint on the decoder network. Additionally the authors identify the possibility of exploding gradients under vanishing standard deviations and address this via an additional regularization parameter to their loss, which smoothly interpolates between minimizing volume and L1 regularization of the standard deviations. The authors prove that least volume is equivalent to PCA in the case of a linear autoencoder and show empirically that the disentanglement effect also persists for non-linear autoencoders. LV is compared to three other sparsity-inducing loss functions on the latent representation and shown to lead to the best reconstruction error when pruning latent dimensions. The appendix contains additional ablation studies and their interpretations.

### Strengths
Introduced Method:
- LV constitutes a simple and universal objective for disentanglement in autoencoders
- The authors show that latent dimensions are incentivised to tend towards exactly 0, which additionally benefits pruning
- The introduced objective operates in the metric of the latent space, which, if the latent space is structured well, can lead to improved soundness over methods that operate on data space

Writing:
- The authors explain their method in detail and provide many illustrating examples


Experiments:
- Extensive ablation studies are performed in the appendix

### Weaknesses
Introduced method:
- LV requires the autoencoder to be K-Lipschitz, which can be a large constraint in some cases.
- Although the method is novel, the idea of minimizing the volume of the learned latent representations is not, see [PCA-AE](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10851-022-01077-z), [IRMAE](https://ar5iv.labs.arxiv.org/html/2010.00679). LV significantly differs from the mentioned papers, as it directly acts on the latent codes and does not require multistage training. Nonetheless, they should be mentioned.
- The authors mention [Sparse Feature Learning for Deep Belief Networks](https://papers.nips.cc/paper_files/paper/2007/hash/c60d060b946d6dd6145dcbad5c4ccf6f-Abstract.html), but do little to point out the similarities/differences to their method. The regularization term of the latent codes in that work is  
$L_\text{vol} = \sum\limits_{i=1}^{m} \log(1 + h^2(z_i))$,  
where $h$ is defined in Eq. 6 of the paper (notation was adjusted to fit the notation of the paper under review).
When we regard $h$ as a homeomorphism that just produces new latent codes and center those new latent codes to 0 we get  
$\sqrt[m]{\exp(L_\text{vol})} = \sqrt[m]{\prod\limits_{i=1}^{m} (\sigma_i + 1)}$.  
This is equivalent to LV with $\eta = 1$. 
If the authors can point out what their contribution with regards to that already published regularization term is, it would in my opinion severely strengthen the case for this work.



Writing:
- In the related work section the authors describe the invariance of their method to translation of the latent codes. However in the next sentence it is stated that: "This equivalent latent set is then one that has zero-STDs along many latent dimensions, which is what this work tries to construct". It is not clear whether this refers to the translated latent set of LV or of aforementioned methods. In case it refers to LV, the zero-STDs are present also before translation (so it has *still* zero-STDs not only *then*). In case it refers to other methods the authors need to elaborate more on the claim that established methods already produce close to zero-STD latent codes in many latent-dimensions and how their method then differs from those established methods apart from allowing for translational invariance, which would not be a strong contribution by itself. In my opinion this would also generally be a good addition to the related works section.
- In section B.3.3 in the appendix the authors claim that latent STD still correlates well with explained reconstruction if no Lipschitz constraint is applied because the decoder is naturally a Lipschitz function. While this is correct the Lipschitz constant of the decoder can be arbitrarily increased. It is not clear whether the argument of small updates of gradient-based optimization preserving the Lipschitz constant holds after cumulative gradient updates and sufficient training time. The observed effect might well be due to specific training dynamics and model initialization and, while it is interesting to report, a clear conclusion is hard to draw.

Experiments:
- The autoencoders are trained with BCE loss on image datasets, but are evaluated in terms of L2 reconstruction. I do not see the justification for evaluating the trained models on a different metric than the training target. If there is a reason behind this the authors should clarify it.

In my opinion, the main weakness of this work is that there is not sufficient methodological comparision to established work in the field to separate the novel concepts from existing ones. If this is amended I would be willing to significantly change my rating in favor of acceptance.

### Summary
This work proposes Least Volume (LV) a method that prunes latent dimensions of deterministic auto encoders by the combination of a specific regulariser in the latest space and specific constraints in the decoder. The regulariser is the product of the (empirical) variances of each dimension of the latent code; by encouraging minimisation of this term, the encoder is forced to “collapse” / “prune” its representations on some dimensions of the latent space. In order for these dimensions to be properly ignored by the decoder, the authors propose to employ a Lipschitz constraint, effectively preventing the decoder from being able to scale up the values of those dimensions. The authors provide several theoretical motivations for LV. Firstly, they discuss how their regulariser connects to volume and how, even though the autoencoder is deterministic, its continuity allows it to learn a topological embedding of the dataset. Secondly, they discuss how a bound on the reconstruction error by pruning dimensions with LV and how LV relates to PCA in the case of linear models. Finally, the authors also generalise the concept of the importance ordering of dimensions from PCA to the case of nonlinear models and LV, by relating the variance on each dimension to the reconstruction error on the output. 

The authors perform some experiments on image tasks where they show how LV is able, for a fixed reconstruction penalty, to produce sparser latent spaces and furthermore perform ablation experiments to verify the importance of the components of LV, the Lipschitz constraint and the regulariser at the latent space.

### Strengths
- This work proposes a relatively simple idea that seems to work better than alternatives in practice. 
- The geometric interpretation of the deterministic autoencoder is, as far as I am aware, novel.
- The regularizer proposed is, also as far as I am aware, novel.
- The theoretical discussions are a nice add-on and provide useful insights.

### Weaknesses
 - Limited set of experiments; the authors mainly check reconstruction performance at a given sparsity level. As auto encoders are primarily used for their feature learning capabilities, it would be worthwhile to see how the features learned through LV fare in several downstream tasks. 
- It would also be nice to compare against stochastic approaches, such as variational auto encoders, which can also have their own mechanisms of “pruning” latent dimensions, e.g., [1].
- The Lipschitz constraint on the decoder is not a novel contribution per se, as it has also been proposed at [2] via the means of a gradient penalty term. Furthermore, in light of this existing work, LV can be seen as employing a different regulariser in the latent space (compared to e.g., the squared L2 norm employed at [2])

### Questions
Overall, I am a bit on the fence about this work. I like the theoretical discussion, but the paper lacks on the practical side and method-wise, given prior works such as [2], there is only the novelty of the regulariser in the latent space. My questions and suggestions are the following
- It seems that the only downstream task considered is a KNN classification where the results were a bit underwhelming. I would encourage the authors to do a more comprehensive evaluation of the feature learning capabilities of LV by expanding upon the classification task with linear probing (i.e., learning a classifier on top of the encoder) or other tasks considered in unsupervised models , such as semi-supervised learning, object detection and segmentation. 
- In the experiment discussion, the authors mention that they use binary cross entropy for training, which deviates from their theory, but they perform evaluation with the L2 reconstruction error. Why is there this discrepancy? Furthermore, how is the binary cross-entropy used when you do not have binary data (e.g., CIFAR 10 and CelebA)? 
- The authors argue that the CelebA results do not fit in the main text due to space constraints, however, there is almost half a page empty, so I would suggest that the authors use the empty space to move some more results in the main text.
