## Abstract
Subset or core-set selection offers a data-efficient way for training deep learning models by identifying important data samples so that the model can be trained using the selected subset with similar performance as trained on the full set. However, most existing methods tend to choose either diverse or difficult data samples, which is likely to form a suboptimal subset, leading to a model with compromised generalization performance. One key limitation is due to the misalignment with the underlying goal of subset selection as an optimal subset should faithfully represent the joint data distribution that is comprised of both feature and label information. To this end, we propose to conduct diversity-difficulty Balanced One-shot Subset Selection (BOSS), aiming to construct an optimal subset for data-efficient deep learning. Samples are selected into the subset so that a novel balanced core-set loss bound is minimized, which theoretically justifies the need to simultaneously consider both diversity and difficulty to form an optimal subset. The loss bound also unveils the key relationship between the type of data samples to be included in the subset and the subset size. This further inspires the design of an expressive importance function to optimally balance diversity and difficulty depending on the subset size. The proposed approach is inspired by a theoretical loss bound analysis and utilizes a fine-grained importance control mechanism. A comprehensive experimental study is conducted on both synthetic and real datasets to justify the important theoretical properties and demonstrate the superior performance of BOSS as compared with the competitive baselines.

### Confidence
5: You are absolutely certain about your assessment. You are very familiar with the related work and checked the math/other details carefully.

### Summary
The proposed method tackles the problem of data efficient subset selection. They claim that existing methods underperform in terms of generalization since they aim to find subsets that are either diverse or difficult. They propose a new technique called BOSS (diversity-difficulty Balanced One-shot Subset Selection) which aims to find an optimal subset that faithfully represent the joint data distribution which is comprised of both feature and label information. They do so by optimizing a novel balanced core-set loss.

### Strengths
- The paper is well written and clearly illustrates the underlying problem and the proposed solution.
- The paper covers a good chunk of related work in Sec 1
- The experiments are on multiple datasets
- Ablations studies help answer trade offs between diversity, difficulty and cutoff.

### Weaknesses
My main concern is the novelty of the work which can be improved by reinforcing the effectiveness of the proposed method. A few questions and suggestions are as follows:

- The proposed function is very similar to the standard facility location function, which is $\sum_{i \in V} max_{j \in A} Sim(x_i, x_j).$ The function additionally has the I(.) term which is the main contribution in my opinion. To fully understand the effect of the additional I(.) term, the authors should compare with the facility location submodular function. Specifically, it is not clear how much of the performance gain comes from the diversity component versus the difficulty component, and a direct comparison with the facility location function would help to isolate the impact of the I(.) term. It would be beneficial to see results where the I(.) term is ablated, and the performance is compared to the standard facility location function.

- The authors discuss multiple relevant papers in this work but do not add comparison with many of them in the experiments. It would be great to compare with a few more method, e.g., Grad Match. The current experimental evaluation does not fully contextualize the performance of the proposed method against other relevant baselines in the field, making it difficult to assess its true contribution.

- The 'balanced' aspect of the proposed loss is still not clear to me. It would be imperative to add some experiments to show how the selected subsets are balanced. It would be even better if the authors can show some experiments on class imbalanced data. Most datasets currently in the experiments barely have any imbalance, which makes this analysis difficult. The notion of balance needs to be more clearly defined and empirically demonstrated, especially in scenarios where class imbalance is present, as this is a common challenge in real-world datasets.

### Summary
One major drawback of standard subset selection is that the subset cannot accurately reflect the join data distribution. To tackle this drawback, BOSS aim to construct an optimal subset for data-efficient traning.
Samples are chosen for the subset with the goal of minimizing a balanced core-set loss bound.
A trade-off exists between feature similarity and label variability in the balanced core-set loss bound. To this end, it can take into account subset size, data type, variety, and difficulty.

### Strengths
- The proposed method is supported by prior evidence and is well stated.
- They balance the variety and difficulty of subset selection given a subset size.
- There are considerable performance improvements using the proposed methods

### Weaknesses
 - For a fixed number of epochs, the entire dataset must be used to train a model.
- Absence of variety in experiments. ResNet is insufficient on its own to verify the efficacy of the proposed method. To validate their approach, it is necessary to conduct experiments on more models.
- There is no comparison between the entire train duration and the time required to generate a subset. The problem with the proposed process is that all of the data must be trained so that authors should perform experiments with computation complexity.

### Questions
- It is difficult to discern what the author intended when they write, "missed some critical regions(upper middle area)", as Figure 1(a) on page 2. 
- What does the symbol gamma represent in Theorem.1 on page 4? 
- What is the rationale behind the paper's assertion that "CCS still does not strike the right balance between diversity and the difficulty of subset selection"?

### Summary
This paper inspects the coreset selection problem. A balanced core-set loss bound is first established to depict the generalization loss of the model trained on the subset. The authors claim that the bound is composed of two terms, one corresponds to the “diversity/coverage” of the coreset, and the other counts for the “difficulty” of the samples. The bound naturally unifies the diversity-based as well as the difficulty-based works developed previously, and the paper further provides an expressive importance function to optimally balance them. The authors find that the optimal balance is related to the subset size. In the data-scarce regime, the subset is supposed to be representative enough (diverse), while in the data-abundance regime, difficult samples are preferred. The resulting coreset selection strategy is named diversity-difficulty Balanced One-shot Subset Selection (BOSS), Experiments on both synthetic and real datasets are conducted to justify the effectiveness of the proposed method.

### Strengths
1.	Utilizing coreset selection to improve data efficiency is important for machine learning practices. The paper may be valuable to the community trying to address this problem. 

2.	The paper is clearly written, and the authors do a good job presenting their intuitions developing the method.

3.	I appreciate the efforts the authors made connecting the core-set loss bound, subset diversity, and sample difficulty, which naturally unified the diversity-based as well as the difficulty-based works developed in previous literature. 

4.	Experiments are conducted on both synthetic dataset and real-world datasets, validating the effectiveness of the proposed method in certain settings.

### Weaknesses
1.	Rather than rigorously derived from the balanced core-set loss bound, equation (5) seems to be simply a hand-crafted heuristic selection strategy combining the diversity-based method and the difficulty-based method. In theroem2, the authors claim that EL2N lower bound the label variability in difficult regions. I wonder if this holds for other regions as EL2N/difficulty is universally used in Equation (5). Besides, to minimize Equation (1), for the label variability term, we should minimize something upper bounds $|| \boldsymbol{y}_i -  \boldsymbol{y}_j ||$ instead of something lower bounds it like EL2N.

2.	The authors claim that the subset size will affect the optimal diversity-difficulty balance, in data data-scarce regime, the diversity dominates while as the subset budget increases, more difficult samples should be picked. While intuitively true and the authors give intuitive explanations, I can’t directly justify the statement directly from the core-set loss bound. More discussion will greatly strengthen the paper.
