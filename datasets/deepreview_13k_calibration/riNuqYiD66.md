## Abstract
Generating a set of text is a common challenge for many NLP applications, for example, automatically providing multiple keyphrases for a document to facilitate user reading. Existing generative models use a sequential decoder that generates a single sequence successively, and the set generation problem is converted to sequence generation via concatenating multiple text into a long text sequence. However, the elements of a set are unordered, which makes this scheme suffer from biased or conflicting training signals. In this paper, we propose a branching decoder, which can generate a dynamic number of tokens at each time-step and branch multiple generation paths. In particular, paths are generated individually so that no order dependence is required. Moreover, multiple paths can be generated in parallel which greatly reduces the inference time. Experiments on several keyphrase generation datasets demonstrate that the branching decoder is more effective and efficient than the existing sequential decoder.

### Summary
Often generative models use a sequential decoder that generates a single output sequence. For the tasks where multiple outputs are possible (for example, a set generation problem), a popular way is to train a sequential decoder concatenating all outputs in a long sequence. This setup suffers from several limitations. 

The paper introduces a branching decoder that can generate branch-out multiple generation paths. One very interesting contribution of the paper is the integration of the ZLPR loss (Su et al., 2022) that allows a threshold-based decoding algorithm (instead of heuristic approaches) for inference. During decoding the branching decoder generates new generative branches identifying  a dynamic set of tokens with logits exceeding a threshold (0 in this case). 

The experiments are mainly done on keyphrase generation tasks focusing on three different datasets focusing on different domains and keyphrase lengths (avg 1.3 to 2.2 words on average). The results demonstrate that the branching decoder performs considerably better than the sequential decoders.

Thank you for your response. Thanks for including Diverse beam search comparisons. I have updated my reviews accordingly.

### Strengths
The novel branching decoder that allows generating multiple target sequences in parallel, generating a dynamic number of tokens at each time-step. 

The integration of the ZLPR loss during training allows 1) training with both target and negative sequence, and 2) a threshold-based decoding algorithm (instead of heuristic approaches) for inference.

Solid results showing the advantages of the branch decoders for keyphrase generation tasks. 

The codes are made available.

### Weaknesses
I believe that there are two major weaknesses in the paper. Addressing them would improve the impact of the paper significantly.

Firstly, the sota comparisons are focused on pretrained models and sequential decoders. Diverse decoding and generation methods (see some relevant papers below)  would also potentially be good for set generation tasks, and it would be interesting to know how branching decoders perform against them. Specifically, methods like diverse beam search, which explicitly aims to generate a set of diverse outputs, should be included as a baseline to properly evaluate the performance of the proposed branching decoder. The lack of comparison with these methods makes it difficult to assess the true novelty and effectiveness of the approach in the context of set generation.

The other major weakness of the work is that the authors solely focus on the keyphrase generation problem, where the keyphrases are 1-3 words long which is very small compare to natural generation tasks. Natural language generation is inherently a set generation problem, for example, there could be multiple paraphrases for a sentence (paraphrase generation), same questions can be asked differently (question generation) and summary can be written differently (summarization). It would be very interesting to see how branch decoders perform on some of these tasks (see some relevant papers below). The current evaluation on short keyphrases does not fully demonstrate the potential of the branching decoder for more complex set generation tasks where the output sequences can be significantly longer and more varied.

### Questions
It would be great to hear the authors’ response to two main weaknesses raised above.

Minor: Also, in section 3.4, why do we need the minimum number of explored paths (k^min) given we are using the threshold-based decoding algorithm?

### Summary
This paper tackles the challenge of set generation which has been mainly formulated as a One2Seq problem. Bypassing the order bias induced in the latter, the authors propose instead a branching decoder that generates sequences in parallel that meet certain requirements. Experiments on keyphrase generation show the effectiveness of their method compared to sequential decoders.

### Strengths
- The paper is well-written and the presentation is clear.
- Experiments on keyphrase generation demonstrate strong performance on all datasets compared to SOTA as well as better OOD capabilities.
- Additional experiments show promises for other generation tasks e.g. MSQA.
- Ablation study is conducted on the impact of negative sequences during training.

### Weaknesses
 - I am not familiar with the multi-decoder technique, can you elaborate on what "a decoder with shared parameters" means or provide a reference ? In the text, you mention that "each sequence is input to a decoder independently" does that mean there are multiple decoders with shared parameters ? or it is the exact same decoder that the inputs are fed into, although independently ?
- What loss is the model trained on ? Is it only optimized on the ZPLR loss ? If so, what happens if only positive labels are considered ? How does your method compare with simply selecting the highest scoring sequences instead of selecting sequences that have positive scores in average ? During decoding, the $k_{min}$ highest-scored tokens are guaranteed to be selected at each iteration anyway. Does your proposed method work without the ZPLR loss ? 
- Is your negative sequence a contribution ? It would be insightful to have a pointer towards some negative contrastive learning literature that you drew inspiration from and indicate the differences.
- What value of $k_{min}$ is chosen for the computation of throughput / GPU memory usage ? How do they vary with different values of $k_{min}$ ?

**Typo**
- There seems to be a typo in the figure 2: dotted arrow should go from B to CB.

3: You are fairly confident in your assessment. It is possible that you did not understand some parts of the submission or that you are unfamiliar with some pieces of related work. Math/other details were not carefully checked.

### Summary
This paper proposes a branching decoder, which can generate a dynamic number of tokens at each time-step and branch multiple generation paths. In particular, paths are generated individually so that no order dependence is required. Moreover, multiple paths can be
generated in parallel which greatly reduces the inference time. The experiments are promising

### Strengths
*  The overall idea and motivation are novel for set generation tasks.
* Thorough experiments demonstrate clear benefits over established approaches.
* The training method and inference algorithm are well-designed.
* Strong results on multiple datasets make a compelling case for the branching decoder.

### Weaknesses
 * Little ablation to analyze the impact of different design choices.
* Limited analysis of how performance varies across different set sizes and domains.
* The factorization of decoder embedding seems unnecessary given modern hardware.

### Summary
The paper considers set generation with seq2seq models. The proposed solution dubbed One2Branch is a combination of parallel decoding and the ZLPR loss which allows for a dynamic number of hypotheses. For training, a stepwise version of the ZLPR loss is optimized for both positive and negative label sequences. For inference, path-level scores are used with min/max number of paths. One2Branch is shown to outperform direct linearization (One2Seq) on keyphrase generation.

### Strengths
- Substantially novel approach to seq2seq set generation
- Well-performing

### Weaknesses
 - The method yields a task-specific model specialized for set generation (i.e., it loses the generality of seq2seq, in contrast to One2Seq).
- The improvement is not very large, since the baselines are already pretty good.

### Questions
While parallel decoding is more efficient, does it not also lose the benefit of autoregressive reasoning as well? It seems reasonable to expect that a sufficiently powerful One2Seq model may ultimately perform better than a more specialized set generation model.
