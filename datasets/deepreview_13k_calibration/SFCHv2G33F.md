## Abstract
Accurate prediction of protein-ligand binding pockets is a critical task in protein functional analysis and small molecule pharmaceutical design.  However, the flexible and dynamic nature of proteins conceal an unknown number of potentially invaluable "cryptic" pockets.  Current approaches for cryptic pocket discovery rely on molecular dynamics (MD), leading to poor scalability and bias.  Even recent ML-based cryptic pocket discovery approaches require large, post-processed MD datasets to train their models.  In contrast, this work presents ``Efficient Sequence-based cryptic Pocket prediction'' (ESP) leveraging advanced Protein Language Models (PLMs), and demonstrates significant improvement in predictive efficacy compared to ML-based cryptic pocket prediction SOTA (ROCAUC 0.93 vs 0.87).  ESP achieves detection of cryptic pockets via training on readily available, non cryptic-pocket-specific data from the PDBBind dataset, rather than costly simulation and post-processing.  Further, while SOTA's predictions often include positive signal broadly distributed over a target structure, ESP produces more spatially-focused predictions which increase downstream utility.

### Summary
This paper introduces Efficient Sequence-based cryptic Pocket prediction (ESP), which is a method for predicting cryptic binding pockets on protein sequences using pre-trained protein language models (PLMs). The embeddings drawn from the PLM are fed into a prediction head, which is responsible for predicting the presence of a cryptic pocket at each residue. Optionally, a multi-task setting is also considered, where the secondary structure of the protein is also predicted using the PLM embeddings. Several popular PLMs and prediction heads are evaluated, and it is shown that with the right combination of PLM and prediction head, the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art PocketMiner baseline in cryptic pocket prediction performance.

### Strengths
The main strength of the paper is the significant performance boost over the SOTA PocketMiner approach. As the authors allude to, protein language models have shown great success in computational studies of protein structure and function, and this work is another example where pre-trained PLMs shine. The proposed method could potentially impact the design of drugs that could bind to proteins through cryptic ligandable pockets.

### Weaknesses
I believe the main weakness of the paper is that, in terms of the proposed method, the paper does not provide a significant novel contribution to the broader ICLR community. This is understandable since the purpose of the paper is to showcase that PLMs could be beneficial in identifying cryptic pockets in proteins, but I wonder whether ICLR is the best venue for such work to be published and gain visibility.

- The authors mention that ESP provides more localized positive cryptic pocket predictions as compared to PocketMiner, whose positive predictions are more broadly distributed. Given the knowledge that cryptic pockets tend to have local structures, could such prior knowledge be injected into the prediction model, for example, as a regularizer (where local positive predictions are encouraged during model training, while negative ones are discouraged)?

- Could you please provide more details on the secondary structure prediction (SSP) task? How many classes is this task composed of? Is there a separate prediction head for structure prediction on top of the cryptic pocket prediction head? Why and how is its weight in the objective function chosen to be 1?

- In Section 5.3, it is mentioned that the results are reported for the *best* model from 7 trials. I was expecting that for each specific configuration (i.e., PLM/head/task), the *average* performance (and its *standard deviation*) across the seven random trials would get reported, not the *maximum* performance.

- The number of parameters for ESP in Table 7, especially with the MLP 1024 and MHA heads, is orders of magnitude larger than the number of parameters of PocketMiner. This is not even taking into account the number of PLM parameters (which are taken to be frozen in this paper). How does ESP perform compared to PocketMiner for a comparable number of parameters?

- I may have missed these, but there are certain acronyms in the manuscript that are not defined anywhere in the paper (such as AUC, APS, LR, CLS). Please review the manuscript and make sure all acronyms are defined the first time they are used.

3: You are fairly confident in your assessment. It is possible that you did not understand some parts of the submission or that you are unfamiliar with some pieces of related work. Math/other details were not carefully checked.

### Summary
The text introduces a new method, ESP, that improves the prediction of protein-ligand binding pockets. It uses pretrained language models and the result is stronger than traditional SOTA method.

### Strengths
- It's interesting to see that PLMs have a stronger ability to predict cryptic binding sites than traditional SOTA methods.
- Sometimes, incorporating SSP for multitask learning can be beneficial for the task.

### Weaknesses
 - The novelty appears limited. The main technique in this study is "PLM as feature," which emerged in 2018 (BERT).
- Additional ablation studies are necessary. Why not fine-tune the language model?
- Incorporating SSP doesn't seem consistently better than other methods.
- There's still room for improvement in the writing. There are too many technical details that aren't informative, such as comparative discussions on LR, MLP with MHA-x, with or without CLS. Also, the results across the tables lack consistency. The organization of the paper (i.e., "Results -> Conclusion -> Method") seems unusual to the ML audience.

### Summary
This work presents a study of using pre-trained protein PLM models for cryptic binding pocket prediction tasks. The authors explored multiple pretrained models, fine-tuning strategies, architectures, and datasets. Some of the models achieved SOTA results.

### Strengths
- Cryptic ligand binding is an under-explored problem. This work could have important real word impact.
- The authors studied multiple settings and conducted many experiments.

### Weaknesses
From machine learning perspective, the technique contribution is limited. Using pretrained model on data-limited tasks is a well-studied approach. The combination of a PLM with MLP/MHA, or a SSP is not novel. The authors are encouraged to design some methods that are best for this specific task.

- The color in Fig 3 is confusing. In caption it says, "blue being negative prediction and red being positive." But in picture lots of area are actually green.

- Is this the first work that use the concept of "cryptic pocket"? Seems no previous work about this term is referenced in Sec 2.1. The authors should either (a) discuss more previous study of cryptic pocket, or (b) give more accurate definition and explanation about this concept.

### Summary
Prediction of protein-ligand binding pocket is essential in protein functional analysis and small molecule pharmaceutical design. Previous methods rely on MD to discover cryptic pocket, which has poor scalability and bias. This paper proposes to use pretrained protein language models (PLMs) to tackle this problem and state a significant improvement in this challenging task over existing baselines.

### Strengths
(1) This article tries to address an important question, namely, identifying hard-to-find or cryptic protein pockets. 

(2) The authors have considered the possibility of data leakage and made an attempt to remove similar structures in PDBBind from the training dataset. 

(3) The experimental results are convincing and easy to understand for comparison.

### Weaknesses
(1) First and foremost, the novelty is quite limited. As a reviewer of ICLR, one of the top AI conferences, I expect to see great contributions to the deep learning community. However, the PLM algorithms including ESM-2, AnKh, ProtBert, and others are very mature techniques. The multi-task training with a secondary structure prediction is kind of interesting but still trivial. The authors ought to provide more discussion and deeper insight regarding the benefit of this multi-task scheme in the main text, specifically how the auxiliary task improves the pocket prediction. To summarize, the author just examines an existing methodology (i.e., PLMs) on some publicly available datasets (PDBBind + ESM-2 SSP) with a straightforward training paradigm (fixed embedding and [CLS] for prediction). The lack of a novel methodological contribution is a significant concern.

(2) It really confused me that whether the author aims to predict ligand-specific or ligand-free pockets. To be explicit, can different small molecules bind to different pockets in the same protein? If so, should we predict pocket based on the information of ligand rather than solely on the receptor? If not, that is, all molecules bind in the same position of the protein. The author still needs to union the positions to obtain the final pocket. However, the approach did not utilize any ligand representations. The paper lacks clarity on the precise definition of a 'pocket' in the context of varying ligands and how the method addresses this ambiguity.

(3) PLMs have shown promise in solving biological problems. However, it utilizes no structural information. Since we do have structural data in PDBBind, it really cannot convince me that PLMs are the best solution to predict cryptic pockets. (i) Please examine and compare more baselines (I am not familar with this specific task, and the references listed may be wrong) [A][B]. Specifically, methods that incorporate structural information should be considered. (ii) Machine-learning-based docking method can be also transferred to predict the pocket, such as EquiBind, and DiffDock. Please examine them, or at least discuss why they are not suitable for this task. (iii) Please equip geometric networks (e.g., PocketMiner) with PLMs and verify the performance. See [C] for more details. I suppose PLMs + geometric models should outperform PLMs. The absence of structural information processing is a major limitation.

(4) As a machine learning paper, it is very necessary to offer adequate experimental details for readers to reproduce the results (at least in the Appendix). For instance, how many computational resources (e.g., GPUs) have been used in the training? What is the optimizer type and how high is the learning rate? The lack of these details hinders reproducibility.

(5) I believe it is better to clearly explain the types of PLMs that are used in the evaluation (at least in the Appendix). For instance, Ankh is new to me, and I have to search for details of this model myself. Besides, ESM-2 has no reference when the first time it appears. The paper should provide sufficient background on the models used for clarity.

(6) Make sure words are spelled correctly. For example, on Page 9 'PBDbind' should be 'PDBbind'.

### Questions
(1) In Section 5.2, the author uses the average embedding as a pseudo-[CLS] token for ProtT5-XL. However, in the official document of ESM-2, it is also recommended to use the average embedding as the representation of the entire protein. Have the author tried this style for training?

(2) A minor point is that the authors adopt an unusual arrangement to organize the sections, which accords with the template of Spring Nature Journals. From my humble point of view, a standard format of AI conference is to put the method section before the result and conclusion sections.
