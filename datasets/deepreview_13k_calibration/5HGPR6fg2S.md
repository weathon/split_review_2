## Abstract
We introduce a manifold analysis technique for quantifying the discrepancy between two representation spaces. Normalized Space Alignment (NSA) aims to compare pairwise distance between two point clouds. Our technique provides a robust means of comparing representations across different layers and models, with a particular focus on Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to explore their unique capabilities. We show that our technique acts as a pseudometric, satisfies the properties of a similarity metric, is continuous and differentiable. We also demonstrate that NSA can serve as an effective loss function by utilizing it in autoencoders to preserve representation structure for dimensionality reduction. Furthermore, our empirical analysis showcases that NSA consistently outperforms or matches the results of previous techniques while offering computational efficiency. Its versatility extends to robustness analysis and various neural network training and representation learning applications, highlighting its wide applicability and potential to enhance the performance of neural networks.

### Summary
This manuscript presents a novel approach for comparing two point clouds through the introduction of a Normalized Space Alignment (NSA) technique, aimed at assessing the pairwise distances between corresponding points as a means of quantifying the similarity between two representations. The authors show that NSA possesses the properties of a pseudometric and demonstrate its applicability as a loss function within the context of autoencoder models. A set of experimental studies is conducted, offering insights into the behavior and performance of various graph neural network representations when analyzed using this newly proposed method.

### Strengths
1. The authors have introduced a Normalized Space Alignment (NSA) technique, combining the computational efficiency of Centered Kernel Alignment (CKA) with the differentiability of Representation Tree Distance (RTD). 

2. The manuscript provides a theoretical demonstration, showcasing that NSA exhibits the properties of a pseudometric. Additionally, the authors have developed a differentiation scheme, enabling the integration of NSA as a loss function.

### Weaknesses
Concerns on Structure Preservation: 

   1.The authors posit that the Normalized Space Alignment (NSA) technique is structure-preserving, yet there is a noticeable gap in addressing the underlying data's graph structure. NSA primarily focuses on measuring distances between two point clouds, neglecting the crucial graph edges. This oversight brings its capability to preserve graph structure into question. Moreover, although the paper intends to underscore NSA's unique potential in the context of Graph Neural Networks, the actual exploration of these capabilities is missing.

Issues with Experimental Validation:
 1. Lack of Downstream Task Evaluation: Given that NSA is proposed as a loss function, it is critical to evaluate its effectiveness in downstream tasks. Unfortunately, the paper lacks such evaluations. Insights into how the latent embeddings from an autoencoder, shaped by NSA, could enhance downstream task performance are notably missing.

  2. Dataset Limitations: The paper’s conclusions are drawn from experiments conducted solely on the Amazon Computers dataset for node classification. Different graph datasets possess varied properties and can elicit diverse behaviors, making it imperative to extend the analysis to a broader set of datasets for more robust and convincing results.

  3. Inconsistency in Data Analysis: There is a puzzling contrast between the paper’s stated focus on Graph Neural Networks (and graph data) and the NSA-AE analysis, which is not applied to graph datasets. 

   4. Adversarial Attack Analysis Shortcomings: The attempt to correlate NSA values with misclassification rates, aiming to use NSA as a metric for evaluating GNN resilience, lacks conviction. NSA values exhibit significant variability across different GNN architectures, and potentially across various graph datasets. The observed discrepancy, where GCN shows the highest misclassification rate while GCN-SVD has the highest NSA value, further complicates any straightforward interpretation based on NSA values alone.

  5. Readability of Figures: The figures included in the paper suffer from readability issues, with some fonts being excessively small, hindering the reader’s ability to fully grasp and interpret the presented data.

### Questions
I have raised several points and posed various questions in the previous sections of my review. 

Additionally, I have a specific inquiry pertaining to Figure 3. Regarding Figure 3, could you please clarify which two representations are being compared to calculate the NSA values presented? The text does not seem to provide explicit information on this aspect.

2: You are willing to defend your assessment, but it is quite likely that you did not understand the central parts of the submission or that you are unfamiliar with some pieces of related work. Math/other details were not carefully checked.

### Summary
The paper proposes a new pseudometric as a way to measure the distance between two representation spaces. The authors then show how it can be used in various applications.

### Strengths
- The authors tackle a significant problem, with many downstream applications
- The metric is reasonably novel

### Weaknesses
 - The proposed pseudometric does not make any sense to me. One clear issue with it is the fact that it is not invariant to permutation between the vectors in the point cloud. This is a huge issue, in my mind, as there is no reason to assume the vectors are aligned so it is greatly impacted by a random permutation between them. The authors also don't give any sufficient motivation for this metric, besides the fact that it satisfies some basic properties like triangle inequality. 
- The paper is not well written and very confusing to read. Comparing representations and the proposed method is not specific to GNNs, yet the authors present it as one that is connected to GNNs. They also move between GNNs and point clouds making it hard to follow
- The use of NSA as a regularizer in the VAE part is not clear at all. Do you compare the reconstructed with the original? It was not stated clearly. If this is the case, then this does not prove the usefulness of the NSA as the representations are aligned.

### Summary
This paper presents 'Normalized Space Alignment' (NSA), a novel
pseudo-metric for comparing representations of high-dimensional
data via their (Euclidean) distances.

Next to mathematically proving relevant properties of a pseudo-metric
like symmetric and the triangle inequality, the paper also presents a
suite of experiments showcasing potential application scenarios. This
includes (a) an analysis of latent representations, (b) analyses of a
set of GNN architectures with respect to adversarial attacks, and (c)
correlation analyses of test accuracy and NSA.

### Strengths
- NSA is well-described and all proofs are accessible. The reader is
  guided nicely through the paper (for the most part).

- The paper attempts to cover a broad range of different applications
  for showcasing the utility of NSA.

- The focus on *fundamental* measures is a crucial endeavour for
  improving our understanding of latent representations, quality
  metrics, and much more.

The paper is thus on a good path towards making a strong contribution to
the literature, but, as outlined below, there are some major issues with
the current write-up.

### Weaknesses
While I see the contribution favourably, there are major weaknesses
precluding the presentation of the paper in its current form. The
primary one is a **missing analysis of fundamental properties**. While
I appreciate the broad range of different applications, this invariably
means that some depth is lost and analyses are relatively superficial.

Introducing a new measure and then showing its utility requires a more
in-depth view of data, though. For instance, when introducing the
latent representations in Table 1, readers are only shown the actual
scores, but the primary assumption is that the scores actually capture
the relevant properties of the data. Phrased somewhat hyperbolically:
I believe that NSA can be calculated as described, but I do not
understand whether it measures something 'interesting.' The fact that it
correlates with performance metrics is relevant, but immediately
suggests a more detailed comparison scenario, for instance in the form
of an early stopping criterion or regularisation term. Otherwise, most
of the analyses strike me as too speculative. I will provide additional
comments below.

- I'd suggest to shorten the RTD explanation or substantially extend it.
  Currently, it makes use of jargon like $\min G(R, Q)$, 'barcode,' and
  Vietoris--Rips filtrations that are not sufficiently explained (I am
  familiar with the work and I believe that a deep dive into topological
  methods is not required).

- To simplify the notation, I'd either use the actual Euclidean norm in
  the definition of NSA or write $x$ and $0$ as vectors.

- The autoencoders experiment is somewhat out of place since the
  introduction sets up a paper on GNNs. Given the broad scope of NSA,
  I think it might be best to stay with the autoencoder comparison,
  using data with a known ground truth. This could take the form of
  building confidence by starting with simple toy examples like a 'Swiss
  Roll' or other data sets and showing that NSA matches the intuition.

Overall, my **main concern** is that the measure is just too coarse, in
particular given large data sets. It essentially amounts to comparing
averaged distance representations, and more in-depth experiments and/or
theoretical analyses would be required here.

### Questions
1. NSA in its current form seems to generalise easily to other distances
   as well. What is the reason for focusing on the Euclidean distance?

2. How robust is the measure and how limited is it in case the 'ambient'
   distances are misleading (such as in the example of a Swiss Roll)?

3. Being based on distances, NSA should be invariant under isometries.
   Is this correct? (I'd overall suggest to simplify the exposition
   here; many of the properties discussed are a direct consequence of
   NSA being based on distances. It is good to be precise and spell that
   out in the appendix, but I'd not give it too much space)

4. How are the representations for Section 3.6 calculated? Is the NSA of
   a specific data set calculated here, i.e. mapping a (batch?) of
   graphs into the latent space? Please clarify!

5. The definition of NSA reminds me of MMD (but lacking the
   cross-comparison term). Could you briefly comment on this?

6. Please show representations of MNIST, F-MNISt, etc.

7. Given the correlation analysis, why not see whether NSA can be used
   to detect or predict a specific level of poisoning?

### Summary
This paper introduces a manifold analysis technique for quantifying the discrepancy between two representation spaces. The method is called Normalized Space Alignment (NSA).  NSA provides a robust means of comparing representations across different layers and models, a pseudometric that is both continuous and differentiable and an effective loss function for autoencoders. Empirical results show NSA consistently outperforms or matches previous techniques with high computational efficiency.

### Strengths
1. This paper is well-organized and easy to follow.
2. The proposed technique is sound. Building NSA upon Representational Similarity Matrix-Based Measures ensures both computational complexity and differentiability.
3. Comprehensive experiments are conducted to validate the proposal's effectiveness.

### Weaknesses
1. Can authors explain why it is important to compare the similarity of representations in graph neural networks?
2. Is NSA sensitive to the removal of low variance principal components from representations?
3. I understand NSA can measure the differences of normalized point-to-point distances in two representations. However, in the definition of Section 3.1, the point structure within representations seems to be not considered. I wonder if there exists a situation where the NSA of two representations is small but the two representations have totally different point structures. 
4. Why NSA only slightly outperforms or performs worse than previous methods in some cases in Table 1?

There are also two minor issues: 
1. "CKA" in paragraph 1 of Section 2 seems to be in the wrong font.
2. The font size of the text in most figures, especially in Figure 2 is too small.
