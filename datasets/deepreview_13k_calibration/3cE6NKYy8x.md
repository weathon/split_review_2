## Abstract
The Fair Graph Anomaly Detection (FairGAD) problem aims to accurately detect anomalous nodes in an input graph while ensuring fairness and avoiding biased predictions against individuals from sensitive subgroups such as gender or political leanings. Fairness in graphs is particularly crucial in anomaly detection areas such as misinformation detection, where decision outcomes can significantly affect individuals. Despite this need, existing works lack realistic datasets that encompass actual graph structures, anomaly labels, and sensitive attributes for research in FairGAD. To bridge this gap, we present two novel graph datasets constructed from the globally prominent social media platforms Reddit and Twitter. These datasets comprise 1.2 million and 400 thousand edges associated with 9 thousand and 47 thousand nodes, respectively, and leverage political leanings as sensitive attributes and misinformation spreaders as anomaly labels. We demonstrate that our FairGAD datasets significantly differ from the synthetic datasets used by the research community. These new datasets offer significant values for FairGAD by providing realistic data that captures the intricacies of social networks. Using our datasets, we investigate the performance-fairness trade-off in three existing GAD methods on five state-of-the-art fairness methods, which sheds light on their effectiveness and limitations in addressing the FairGAD problem.

### Summary
This paper presents FairGrad, two datasets with political leanings as sensitive attributes and misinformation spreaders as anomaly labels investigate the fair graph anomaly detection problem. Their performance analysis suggests a performance-fairness trade-off in nine existing anomaly detection methods on five fairness methods and identify limitations in addressing the fair graph anomaly detection problem.

Overall, this is a nice paper that investigates the performance-fairness tradeoff with new benchmark datasets, existing fairness and GAD methods, and performance and fairness metrics. However, the given two datasets may not be representative enough to study the fair graph anomaly detection problem to make strong conclusions. I propose authors to extend the benchmark data collection to more diverse real world datasets, and introduce different synthetic graph families (e.g., dK random, synthetic attribute graph generation) to study more on the impact of structural and attribute bias in the given problem domain.

### Strengths
* Important problem domain to evaluate biased and unfair anomaly detection outcomes
* Experiment with existing fairness and GAD methods.

### Weaknesses
 * Why not taking the distribution of nodes across sensitive classes in calculating the fairness metrics? For example, we need to be aware that predictions on the minority classes are highly represented and vise-versa.
* Data Coverage: Twitter datasets were collected from a set of authors, who posted COVID-19 related tweets that contain misinformation. Political leaning of users is defined as the sensitive attribute. Two users relate to a directed edge if users follow. Apart from the graph characteristics, how representative the given data sample to study the fair graph anomaly detection problem since the dataset focus on specific event such as COVID-19?
* Not sure whether calculating the structural bias from 2-hop neighborhood information is being the most optimal in this problem scenario. For example, Twitter and Reddit datasets are very different from the network structure but yet the structural bias remains comparable.
> structural bias (Dong et al., 2022) uses the Wasserstein-1 distance (Villani, 2021) while comparing adjacency matrices based on a two-hop neighborhood between them
* Given the definition of structural bias taken into account, it is hard to conclude that the limited performance of GAD methods due to only graph homophily or attribute bias.
> Given that our datasets manifest a lower degree of a structural bias when compared to existing synthetic datasets, the limited performance of GAD methods may be due to their prevalent reliance on graph homophily.
> Considering that the attribute bias of Reddit is significantly larger than that of Twitter while their structural biases are similar (see Table 1), we attribute the results of high SP and EOO on Reddit to its substantial attribute bias.

### Questions
* Apart from the common practices, are there any reasons not to consider graph anomaly detection problem as a (semi) supervised task?
> It is worth noting that since GAD is regarded as an unsupervised problem in most literature (Kim et al., 2022; Ma et al., 2021), the labels should only be used in the test step, not in the training step
* Does the sensitive attribute need to be predefined?
> FairGAD methods aim to accurately detect anomalous nodes while avoiding discriminatory predictions against individuals from any specific sensitive group.

### Summary
The paper presents two new datasets to foster fairness research in graph-based anomaly/outlier detection tasks. The first consists of Reddit data (approx. 10k nodes, average degree 122.5) created by connecting users who posted to the same subreddit within a 24-hour window, from a set of 110 politics-related subreddits. The second consists of Twitter data (approx. 48k nodes, average degree 9.8) created from "follower" relationships of a list of users who posted COVID-19 related misinformation (Verma et al., 2022). In the dataset curation, several node features were incorporated, including demographic attributes and political leaning. Labels were defined based on whether the user posted misinformation. These and other datasets lacking one of "graph", "anomaly detection" and "fairness" aspects are characterized. The authors formalize the FairGAD problem -- fair graph anomaly detection -- and propose performance (AUC and AUPR) and fairness metrics (SP, EOO) for evaluation. Using the new datasets, they evaluate three GAD methods (CoLA, CONAD, DOMINANT) in combination with a graph debiaser (FairWalk or EDITS) or with a fairness regularizer (FairOD, HIN or Correlation).

### Strengths
S1. Work includes a great data collection and dataset curation effort (including) data from two major social networks and may help to address the lack of datasets for studying fairness in graph anomaly detection.

S2. The methodology is relatively thorough w.r.t. the choice of GAD and debiasing techniques. 

S3. Proper documentation of the dataset using a Datasheet (Appendix A).

S4. The paper is well-written, the reading flows well and the appendices provide extensive results and details.

### Weaknesses
W1. Imbalanced classification with sensitive attributes could also be used for evaluating FairGAD methods by discarding labels. The paper below includes an NBA network of basketball players:
- Enyan Dai and Suhang Wang. Say no to the discrimination: Learning fair graph neural networks with limited sensitive attribute information. In WSDM ’21. URL https://doi.org/10.1145/3437963.3441752.

W2. Defining edges in Reddit based on users who posted to the same subreddit within a time window weakens the argument that this is a real graph. This choice bears some resemblance with "synthetic" graphs connecting all nodes that have some common property. Moreover, it creates extremely dense subgraphs which prevented the authors from running the EDITS fairness regularizer. The relatively low performance (AUCROC ~0.61) suggests that the edges may not be encoding useful information.

W3. Although demographic attributes of the users are inferred through M3, they were not considered in the experiments as alternative choices of sensitive attributes (which would seem very natural).  Note that this is part of the motivation in Section 2.

W4. Some parts of the text require clarification/revision.

W5. As raised by the AC, the new datasets require a suitability check.

### Questions
Q1. Is there a fundamental issue preventing the use of graph datasets introduced for classification tasks which have both imbalanced labels and sensitive attributes for FairGAD, assuming the labels are not used, or only partially used?

Q2. Have you considered more organic ways of defining edges in the Reddit network? For instance, users who replied to each other?

Q3. Have you considered setting age, gender or race as sensitive attributes? If not, why? If so, do you have preliminary results to comment on?

Q4.  Clarification questions:
- In the intro, "Jin et al., 2023a" does not seem related to cybersecurity.
- In the intro, which reference supports the use of GAD methods in loan applications?
- By "posted to the same subreddit", does that include comments or only submissions? Are you referring to the "same subreddit thread/submission"?
- Is the Reddit network weighted? If not, wouldn't that be important?
- What does Y=0 indicate? Unlabeled or normal?
- Using "Statistical Parity Difference" and "Equal Opportunity Difference" would be preferable since the current metrics (Eqs. 1-2) are "unfairness" metrics.
- In Section 4.2, the authors conjecture that the limited performance may be due to reliance on graph homophily. Can you provide a metric as evidence to back up this hypothesis? Alternatively, is it possible that the edge definition in the Reddit network is not capturing useful information?
- Review: "However, we believe that the gain *of improvement* is not substantial" -> in performance?
- In "none of the existing GAD methods fail to achieve the desired outcomes", isn't the desired outcome low EOO and high AUC?
- In Appendix C, it is not clear whether $A_{norm}$ refers to the symmetric normalized or the random walk graph Laplacian.

### Summary
This paper focuses on the fairness of unsupervised graph anomaly detection (GAD). The background is that fairness in GAD is vital yet under-explored in research, but there is a lack of real-world datasets containing graph structures, anomaly labels, and sensitive attributes for the research. To handle the issue, this paper builds two graph datasets for fair GAD. Besides, it also conducts empirical evaluation: (1) investigating the effectiveness of the nine GAD methods w.r.t accuracy and fairness, and (2) exploring the performance of some fairness methods on the GAD methods. The codes and datasets are publicly available.

### Strengths
The contribution of this paper is significant. It customized two real-world GAD datasets for fairness concerns. I believe the datasets would inspire future work. 

This work conducted extensive experiments to analyze the datasets and GAD methods. Specifically, it presents detection effectiveness and comprehensive analysis of fairness, e.g., the analysis of accuracy-fairness trade-off.

The whole paper is generally of great readability and well-organized.

### Weaknesses
1. I suggest the authors use case studies to introduce more about the datasets, illustrate the practical meanings of graph anomalies on the two datasets, and show why it is important to care about fairness. 

2. This paper is about GAD on attributed graphs, but it only considers the fairness of unsupervised GAD methods, ignoring the semi-supervised ones. Hence, it shows limited impacts.

3. The adopted GAD methods are unsuitable. First, it does not involve the recently proposed GAD methods that were proposed in 2023 [1, 2]. Hence, it is unsuitable to claim that SOTA GAD methods are exploited. Second, the adopted three GAD methods are not diverse, i.e., both DOMINAT and CONAD are reconstruction-based methods and quite similar. Please add more GAD methods with diverse working mechanisms, e.g., community-analysis methods [3-5]. It is also suggested to add non-deep learning GAD methods, e.g., Radar [6]. 

4. The results in Table 2 seem weird. Why does the EDITS significantly boost the detection performance of CONAD and DOMINAT while showing trivial impacts on CoLA? Specifically, the results on CONAD and DOMINAT may indicate that the sensitive attributes (political leaning, gender, and age) are closely related to the “anomalies”. Intuitively, the performance of CoLA (Table 2) and other GAD methods, e.g., VAE and ECOD (Table III), should also be boosted since EDITS changes the characteristics of the graphs. 

5. Although Table 1 partly summarizes the related works, I suggest the authors add a related work section and briefly summarize the mainstream methods about fairness in GNNs.

6. Please check the correctness of the reference information. For example, the paper of the GAD method CoLA was published in 2021 rather than 2022. The paper "Contrastive Attributed Network Anomaly Detection with Data Augmentation" has been cited twice.

### Questions
I wonder whether the fairness concern can be eliminated by directly removing the sensitive attributes (political leaning, gender, and age) while using the remaining attributes for GAD model learning. Because the “anomaly” on the two datasets represents whether a user is a real-news or misinformation spreader, which is purely determined by the “correctness of the news’ content”. Removing the sensitive attributes may not affect detecting “anomaly”, e.g., fake-news spreader.

### Summary
This work tackles the novel fair graph anomaly detection problem. The authors present two graph datasets constructed from Reddit and Twitter. They investigate the performance-fairness trade-off in nine existing GAD and non-graph anomaly detection methods on these datasets with extensive experiments. The results are impressive and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

### Strengths
1. The paper is well-written, structured and easy to follow. The authors provide sufficient implementation and experimental details in the Appendix. The authors provide a clear motivation for the problem. 
2. The graph datasets constructed from Reddit and Twitter are contribution to the field. 
3. The experiments are extensive and the results are presented in a clear and concise manner. The discussion of future directions is a plus.

### Weaknesses
1. The paper could benefit from a more detailed and faithful discussion of the limitations of the proposed approach. The authors only mention that the approaches they examined leverage unsupervised learning but not semi-supervised methods, which is not deemed as a “limitation.”  This is a missed opportunity to discuss the inherent challenges of unsupervised methods in fair anomaly detection, such as the difficulty in defining what constitutes a 'fair' anomaly without any labeled data. Furthermore, the paper does not address the potential for bias amplification when using unsupervised methods, where existing biases in the data could be exacerbated by the anomaly detection process.
2. Additionally, the paper could benefit from a more detailed discussion of the implications of the results for real-world applications. The current discussion is quite high-level and lacks concrete examples of how the observed performance-fairness trade-offs might manifest in practical scenarios. For instance, in the context of social network analysis, what specific types of anomalies might be missed or misclassified due to fairness constraints, and what are the potential consequences of these errors?
3. It would be great if you provide more details in the captions of Figure 1-3. For example, in Figure 1 and 2, “increasing $\lambda$ leads to a decrease in EOO. ” Then what is its implication? You should give more intuitive information about what these plots suggest. The current captions are too brief and do not provide sufficient context for the reader to understand the significance of the observed trends. For example, how does the choice of $\lambda$ impact the overall utility of the anomaly detection system in a real-world setting?
4. What are the implications of the results for real-world applications of anomaly detection in social networks? This point is related to point 2, but it specifically asks for a discussion on the practical implications of the findings in the context of social networks. For example, how might these results inform the design of anomaly detection systems for detecting misinformation or malicious activity on social media platforms?
5. The datasets proposed are indeed a plus. What is the plan for releasing the dataset? How do you ensure the long-term accessibility of the dataset to a wide range of users? The paper should also discuss the potential limitations of the datasets, such as their size, representativeness, and the specific biases they might contain. It would also be beneficial to discuss the data collection process in more detail, including any steps taken to ensure the privacy of the users involved.
