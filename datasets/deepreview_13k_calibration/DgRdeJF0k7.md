## Abstract
In this study, we propose a novel framework for semi-supervised time-series classification based on masked time-series modeling, a recent advance in self-supervised learning effective for capturing intricate temporal structures within time series. The proposed method effectively extracts intrinsic semantic information from unlabeled instances by reflecting diverse temporal resolutions and considering various masking ratios during model training. Then, we incorporate the semantic information extracted from unlabeled time series with supervisory features, including hard-to-learn class information, learned from labeled ones to improve classification performance. Through extensive experiments on semi-supervised time-series classification, we demonstrate the superiority of our approach by achieving state-of-the-art performance.

### Summary
This study introduces a novel semi-supervised time series classification framework based on Masked Time Series Modeling (MTM). MTM effectively captures complex temporal patterns by combining supervised features with semantic information extracted from unlabeled time series. The method employs a Dual Temporal Autoencoder with a relation-preserving loss function, random masking ratios, and shows superior performance in semi-supervised time-series classification compared to state-of-the-art methods. It addresses challenges in label sparsity and sensitivity to self-generated labels, providing a promising approach for leveraging unlabeled time-series data.

The paper introduces a new framework for semi-supervised time series classification based on masked time series modeling. The authors provide a good description of their motivation and the proposed method seems to address the targeted problem. More investigation about some designs and parameters should be analyzed.

### Strengths
1. Overall, this paper is well-written and easy to follow.
2. This paper proposes a novel semi-supervised time series classification method based on masked time-series modeling, which combines semantic information in unlabeled time series with supervised information in labeled time series to improve classification performance. This is the first work to introduce masked time-series modeling to the task of semi-supervised time-series classification.
3. Through extensive experimental results, this method is significantly better than the SOTA methods in semi-supervised time series classification tasks.

### Weaknesses
1.Important and basic information about baselines and experimental settings should be placed in the main text, not in the appendix.

2. Random masking ratios is an important component of the method. However, according to Figure 5 and Table 2, when random masking ratios is replaced by different fixed masking ratios, MDTA exhibits the same or lower performance than some fixed masking ratios on some datasets, which makes it difficult to convince of the effect of random masking ratios. Although the computation cost of exploration is reduced, the gain from random masking ratios on each dataset cannot be guaranteed. So, the overall effect of MDTA may be less contributed by random masking ratios. Is there a better explanation or improvement?

3. There is a lack of investigation on the impacts of hyper-parameters, such as $\alpha$ and $\beta$.

4. Transformer-based sub-encoder $f_2$ is a key component in MDTA. The experiments do not compare with some SOTA transformer models.

### Summary
This paper proposes a novel framework named masked dual-temporal autoencoders (MDTA) for semi-supervised time-series classification. MDTA is the first masked time-series modeling framework for semi-supervised time-series classification. MDTA could captures relevant semantic information from unlabeled time series and incorporates it with supervisory features obtained from labeled ones to enhance model performance. Also random masking ratios during traing makes MDTA avoid the high-cost tuning process for finding optimal making ratios. The superiority of MDTA over baseline approaches is demonstrated by extensive comparative experiments.

### Strengths
1. MDTA is the first masked time-series modeling framework for semi-supervised time-series classification. 
2. And in fact, the paper's idea of predicting in unlabeled time series subsets to extract features and using the extracted features for classification is novel.
3. The writing and the overall logical arrangement of this paper are reasonable, so that readers can grasp the key points.

### Weaknesses
1. The biggest drawback of this article is motivation. From the expression of the article, motivation is that MTM has not been used to solve semi supervised time series classification.
2. In Section 4.1, the text "Figure 5 and Table 2 demonstrate that random masking ratios enhance classification performance without the high-cost tuning process for finding optimal making ratios." is not rigorous enough. Figure 5 and Table 2 can only demonstrate that random masking ratios performs better than fixed making ratios, as the experimental masking ratios 0.2, 0.5, and 0.8 may not necessarily be optimal making ratios for every dataset.
3. The superscript of unlabeled set in Section 3.1 should be n_u instead of n.

### Questions
1. What is the proportion of unlabeled and labeled data in each dataset?
2. From the model diagram Figure 3(a) alone, is the output one-dimensional? If it is one-dimensional, it does not match the description.

### Summary
The authors present the concept of masked dual-temporal autoencoders for the semi-supervised classification of time series data. In particular, they introduce a novel loss function known as the relation-preserving loss, which is designed to effectively capture intricate temporal patterns within time series. Empirical assessments conducted on a carefully chosen set of 15 UCR time series datasets conclusively demonstrate that the proposed method attains a performance level that is currently considered state-of-the-art in this domain.

### Strengths
1. The authors initially introduced the concept of dual-temporal autoencoders, utilizing a framework rooted in masked time-series modeling, as a foundation for their approach to semi-supervised time-series classification. 

2. The authors have incorporated a relation-preserving loss function into their methodology, aiming to enhance the capacity to capture temporal information within time series data in a self-supervised learning manner.

### Weaknesses
1. Typically, in semi-supervised learning, it's important to maintain consistency in the employed backbone model for a fair evaluation of different strategies. In this paper, the authors utilized a CNN+Transformer encoder to extract feature representations from time series data, while the baseline methods relied on a four-layer convolutional neural network as their encoder. This discrepancy in backbone architectures raises fairness concerns in the comparison.

2.  The concept of the dual-temporal encoder introduced in this paper lacks novelty. The utilization of a CNN+Transformer encoder for time series feature extraction was previously observed in TS-TCC [R1, R2], which has also been employed for semi-supervised learning of time series data.

3. The relation-preserving loss introduced in this paper shares commonalities with SemiTime [R3]. Both approaches employ binary cross-entropy loss to capture temporal dependencies within time series data. However, the distinction lies in the fact that SemiTime constructs the loss function using two subsequences from the time series, whereas the approach in this paper constructs the loss function using the outputs from a CNN encoder and a Transformer encoder.

4. Some graphs, like Figures 1&6, are too small in size to distinguish different classes.

5. The number of UCR time series datasets utilized for the experiments in this study needs expansion. The creator of the UCR archive [R4], including 128 time series datasets, recommends comprehensive testing and publication of results on all datasets to prevent biased selection unless specific data types are targeted (e.g., classifying short time series). In the context of semi-supervised time series classification, guidelines include not using datasets where the number of instances in the training/validation/test set is smaller than the size of its class labels [R5] and ensuring each category comprises a minimum of 30 samples on average [R6]. Consequently, this study evaluates results on 100 UCR datasets in adherence to [R5], and for [R6], 106 datasets out of the original 128 UCR datasets are utilized for experimental evaluation.

### Questions
1. In the appendix, the authors write that they used time-warping and magnitude-warping augmentations for all baselines during model training. Why should all baselines use data augmentation? Data augmentation represents merely one facet of semi-supervised learning strategies. If the method presented in this paper were to incorporate the aforementioned data augmentation technique, it would lead to an unfair comparison in experimental outcomes. This is because the primary focus of this study does not centre on data augmentation methods.

2. Setting masking ratio to random seems to be doubtful, the ablation experiment only contains the masking ratio of 0.5.

3. See the above weaknesses.

### Summary
This paper introduces the idea of Masked Autoencoders into semi-supervised time-series classification. The proposed method, MDTA,  effectively captures semantic information of time series by reflecting diverse temporal resolutions without temporal information loss and the authors further incorporate the extracted semantic information to enhance classification performance. Extensive evaluation on multiple datasets validates the effectiveness of this method.

### Strengths
1. The evaluation is extensive. The proposed method is empirically compared with recent competing approaches and the authors perform systematic ablation studies to validate each aspect of the proposed method's design.
2. Results seem promising. MDTA exhibits leading performance on multiple datasets compared with existing works.
3. Writing is clear. The presentation is clear and the method is easy to understand.

### Weaknesses
 1. Training/inference efficiency. Although MDTA obtains better performance compared with baseline methods, it still remains unclear whether it will cost higher training or inference costs. For example, the authors could compare the training time, number of parameters, GPU latency between MDTA and baseline methods.
2. Results on transductive inferences. It seems that the performance of MDTA in Tab. 6 is not as good as those in Tab. 5, the authors are suggested to summarize the average performance in another table and what are the possible reasons behind this.
3. Pretrain and fine-tuning results. One advantage of Masked Autoencoders is that the model can learn very general representations and the pre-trained model can be easily applied to other datasets or tasks with quick fine-tuning operations. The reviewer wonders whether MDTA can also be utilized for this strategy.

### Questions
1. Comparison with more recent works. The reviewer notices that the most recent baselines used in the paper were published in 2022. Are there any other recent works of semi-supervised time-series classification?
