## Abstract
Lifelong/continual test-time adaptation (TTA) refers to the problem where a pre-trained source domain model needs to be continually adapted at inference time to handle non-stationary test distributions. Continuously updating the source model over long horizons can result in significant drift in the source model, forgetting the source domain knowledge. Moreover, most of the existing approaches for lifelong TTA require adapting all the parameters, which can incur significant computational cost and memory consumption, limiting their applicability on edge devices for faster inference. We present FEATHER (liFelong tEst-time Adaptation wiTH lightwEight adapteRs), a novel lightweight approach that introduces only a small number of additional parameters to a pre-trained source model which can be unsupervisedly and efficiently adapted during test-time for the new test distribution(s), keeping the rest of the source model frozen. FEATHER disentangles the source domain knowledge from the target domain knowledge, making it robust against error accumulation over time. Another distinguishing aspect of FEATHER is that, unlike some recent approaches for lifelong TTA that require access to the source data for warm-starting the adaptation at test time, FEATHER does not have such a requirement. FEATHER is also orthogonal to the existing lifelong TTA approaches and can be augmented with these approaches, resulting in a significant reduction in the number of additional parameters needed to handle the lifelong TTA setting. Through extensive experiments on CIFAR-10C, CIFAR-100C, ImageNetC, and ImageNet3DCC Robustbench benchmark datasets, we demonstrate that, with substantially (85% to 94%) fewer trainable parameters, FEATHER achieves better/similar performance compared to existing SOTA lifelong TTA methods, resulting in faster adaptation and inference at test-time. The source code for FEATHER will be released upon publication.

### Summary
The paper focuses on the continual test time adaptation (CTTA), where the test input has a time-varying domain. The authors propose cost-effective CTTA method, called FEATHER, which mitigates the forgetting issue of previous methods in CTTA scenarios. The proposed method is particularly useful in practice as it does not require any access to the source dataset, whereas most of the existing ones do. The authors demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed method in various CTTA scenarios. In addition, they empirically show a comparative advantage over existing methods, even including ones requiring access to the source domain in a TTA scenario.

### Strengths
The proposed method, FEATHER, addresses the forgetting issue in CTTA with no access to the source domain, which is often limited in the practice of TTA yet is required for existing methods. Specifically, it proposes to employ a set of new parameters and clever initialization, that do not harm the performance at the beginning (without seeing the source dataset), while enabling an effective prevention of the forgetting issue. There was a similar approach (EcoTTA: Song et al. 2023) but it requires warm-up phase to find such a harmless initialization of additional parameters based on the source dataset. In addition, FEATHER is memory-efficient as it reduces the number of parameters to be updated in the procedure of TTA. Such benefit and efficacy of the proposed method have been demonstrated on a set of experiments (CIFAR10C, CIFAR100C, ImageNetC, ImageNet3DCC).

### Weaknesses
My major concern is the limited justification of the proposed method. In my understanding, the main selling point is to address CTTA problems at reduced computational complexity with no access to the training dataset. However, there seem no comparisons to SOTA algorithms in terms of CTTA performance and computational complexity, although they require some access to the training dataset. Specifically, the paper does not report the performance of methods such as Tent or CoTTA in a continual adaptation setting, where the domain of test data changes over time. While the authors claim parameter efficiency, they do not provide a detailed analysis of the computational cost, specifically wall-clock time per batch. The number of updated parameters is an incomplete measure of computational complexity, as different operations have different costs (e.g., backpropagation through a BN layer vs. a convolution layer). Lastly, the proposed method may have architecture-dependent effectiveness. Hence, it is also necessary to provide discussion or experiment with various model architectures, specifically if the method is easily adaptable to other architectures such as Vision Transformers (ViT) or other CNN-based models with different layer configurations.

### Questions
In my understanding, Table 7 reports the performance on the most basic TTA scenario (i.e., no continual setup). Please clarify the setting for Table 7. If my understanding is correct, please provide a fair comparison to existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods in CTTA, although SOTA methods need some access to the training dataset. This would help to understand the effectiveness of the proposed method.

The proposed method seems an architecture-specific solution. Is it possible to apply FEATHER to other model architectures (e.g., ViT or other CNN-based ones)?

Can you provide a comparison of TTA methods in terms of time complexity (wall-clock time) per batch? I do understand the time complexity would be proportional to the number of parameters. However, there can be other computational cost in TTA algorithms. For instance, in my understanding, COTTA is particularly slow due to the use of data augmentation to obtain a more robust pseudo-label.

In my understanding, it is straightforward to make a variant of COTTA, which updates only BN layers. Noting that adapting BN layers is parameter-effective in TTA, it is also interesting to compare FETHER to the COTTA variant, in terms of parameter complexity and TTA/CTTA performance.

### Summary
This paper proposes an adapter-based method for lifelong test-time adaptation. The authors assume that the given source model is a CNN and insert adapters composed of group convolutions and 1x1 convolutions between the layers of the model. During test time, only the inserted adapter and the batch normalization (BN) parameters of the source model are updated, while the remaining weights are fixed. The experiments demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art methods, despite updating a very small number of trainable parameters.

### Strengths
1. This paper is overall clearly clarified and well organized.
2. The use of adapters for lifelong test-time adaptation seems novel.

### Weaknesses
1. The proposed method is only applicable to CNNs.
2. The authors argue for the importance of preserving the information of the source model in online TTA tasks. However, the proposed method does not exhibit outstanding performance compared to the CoTTA, which involves full fine-tuning of the model. Therefore, the authors fail to sufficiently explain why the use of adapters is suitable for online TTA tasks, apart from the fact that it reduces the number of trainable parameters.
3. The authors claim that the proposed method excels in terms of parameter update costs; however, the cost of training the adapters inserted between the model's layers, in terms of memory and computation, is not significantly lighter compared to full fine-tuning.
4. While the authors claim that their method is novel, the specific adapter design and training strategy for TTA is not clearly differentiated from existing adapter-based transfer learning methods. The paper lacks a detailed explanation of why this specific adapter design is superior for unsupervised test-time adaptation compared to other adapter designs used in supervised transfer learning scenarios.

### Questions
1. Is it possible to apply the proposed method to Transformers?
2. Why does CoTTA generally outperform the proposed method?
3. Could you compare the proposed method with other methods in terms of memory and computation?

### Summary
This work presents a novel FEATHER method for lifelong/continual test-time adaptation problems. With the lightweight adapter and freezing the base model, FEATHER is able to adapt the source pre-trained model to the non-stationary test distributions without forgetting the source knowledge and eliminate the error accumulation. More specifically, FEATHER inserts learnable adapter in to the source pre-trained model and only updates them with the unlabeled test data. And the work designs zero and identity initialization for adapters to preserving source knowledge. Experiments show that the FEATHER can achieve comparable performance with SOTA by adjusting few parameters.

### Strengths
1. Leveraging adapters to address catastrophic forgetting and reduce the accumulation of errors is well motivated.
2. The paper is well organized.

### Weaknesses
1. How to determine where to insert adapter？In the work, a combination of PWC and GCO servers as a basic adapter. And adapters will be inserted in to the model between layers. However, there is no mention of where in the network the adapter should be inserted which is one of the most important aspects of method based on adapters. Where to add, from shallow layer to deep layer, or from deep layer to shallow layer, there is no specific experiment to analyze.
2. Why ZERO AND IDENTITY INITIALIZATION preserves the source knowledge? Maybe a residue architecture with zero initialization will be more simple and effective?
3. Difference with ECoTTA [1]. In fact, adding adapters between layers has already been proposed in ecotta, and in their analysis experiments, they tried a similar variation of the method in their paper (refer to Architecture design in Section 4.2 in ECoTTA [1]). The choice and novelty of adapter structure is still open to question.
4. What we should be noticed is that parameter efficient does not mean resource efficient! Inserting adapter into the original model will leads more computational resource including FLOPTS and memory of GPU. But there was little or no performance improvement. 
5. Over claim on the combination of other methods. Combined with tent and cotta, there is no performance improvement.
6. What is the objective function in the experiments of Table 1,2,3,4,5?
7. The formulation of Lifelong/Continual Test-time adaptation have some inconformity with existing literature. In CoTTA [2], it is define as adapting the model to the test samples and make predictions for them in an online manner. The description in section 2 seems like an offline fashion.

### Summary
This work tackles the problem lifelong Test-Time Adaptation (TTA): adapting on a sequence of domain shifts presented at test time. The authors propose FEATHER; an orthogonal approach to TTA methods in the literature.
Instead of adapting the weights of the pretrained model at test time, FEATHER inserts learnable adapters as additional modules in the network while keeping the original model parameters frozen.
The inserted adapters are initialized with identity mapping, so that the non-adapted model preserves its performance on source data.
Experiments are conducted on four standard TTA benchmarks: CIFAR10-C, CIFAR100-C, ImageNet-C, and ImageNet-3DCC.
The experimental results show that FEATHER achieves competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art methods while adapting smaller number of parameters.

### Strengths
This work has the following strengths:

- The problem this work tackles is both important and practical. Pretrained models are likely to experience domain shifts at test-time and adapting them on the fly is essential to ensure their reliability.

- The proposed approach is easy to understand and simple to implement.

- The experiments conducted in this work cover several standard benchmarks to prove the robustness of FEATHER.

### Weaknesses
Despite the strengths of this work, there are few weaknesses that should be addressed. 

(1) FEATHER lacks the strong objective. The proposed approach seem not improve performance nor efficiency. I will explain next.
- (1a) From the performance perspective, FEATHER does not provide performance improvement over other baselines (e.g. CoTTA). While the authors show comparable performance to CoTTA in some settings, it does not consistently outperform it, and in some cases, it underperforms. The core issue is that simply adding adapter layers, even with identity initialization, does not guarantee better adaptation to new domains. The method lacks a mechanism to explicitly encourage the adapters to learn features that are beneficial for the target domain, especially when compared to methods that directly optimize for target domain performance.
- (1b) From the efficiency perspective, while FEATHER updates a smaller percentage of network parameters when compared to CoTTA, FEATHER is less efficient than CoTTA. In essence, FEATHER adds extra parameters to the network making the forward pass more expensive. Further, the gradient calculation for conducting an update step of FEATHER and CoTTA are similar since FEATHER adds its adapters after every layer. Hence, the gradient will require a back propagation through the entire network. The claim that only adapter parameters are updated is not clear, as backpropagation will still compute gradients through the entire network, even if those gradients are not used to update the original model's weights. This makes the computational cost of FEATHER higher than methods that only update normalization layers, for example.

(2) Missing experiments. While the experiments in this paper covered 4 benchmarks, there are key experiments missing to validate the effectiveness of FEATHER.
- (2a) Performance comparison. Strong and efficient baselines such as EATA, ECoTTA, and SAR shall be included in the main evaluation comparison. Appendix D only provides the comparison under one setup (ImageNet-C). The lack of comprehensive comparisons makes it difficult to assess the true value of FEATHER against state-of-the-art methods. The paper should include a more thorough comparison across all benchmarks.
- (2b) Since FEATHER is an orthogonal approach to TTA methods, why is it assumed that it does not need accessing source data? For example, if FEATHER is combined with EATA, source data is necessary for the anti-forgetting regularizer. Having said that, I think it is necessary to compare FEATHER to TTA methods that leverage source data. The paper should explore the performance of FEATHER when combined with methods that use source data, to understand its potential in a broader context.
- (2c) Efficiency measures.  The efficiency comparison in this work is based on the percentage of parameters being updated compared to the total number of parameters. I am not sure if this is the right way to compare different TTA methods. First, FEATHER adds extra parameters to the network, and thus by construction, its forward pass is slower than the baseline (e.g. CoTTA). A comparison in terms of runtime and memory usage is more necessary. It is worth mentioning that methods like Tent and EATA only update the normalization layers making them even more efficient than FEATHER.

(3) Writing. The writing of this paper can be vastly improved in several places such as:
- The mathematical notation and problem description is not clear. In section 2 $f_\theta$ outputs the prediction $\hat y$ at the beginning, and later in the same paragraph it is assumed to output a probability vector. The distinction between the raw output and the probability vector is not clearly defined, leading to confusion.
- The notation in the last paragraph in Sections 3.1 and 3.2 are not clear. What is the element wise addition? how is that different from a regular addition? What is the input and output shapes of the adapting layers? The description of the adapter layers is vague, and it is not clear how the element-wise addition is implemented or how the shapes of the input and output are handled.
- Section 3.3 should mention that FEATHER leverages the same loss function as CoTTA. It was only clear in the experiments how exactly the adaptation is conducted. The lack of clarity in the methodology section makes it difficult to understand the implementation details of the proposed method.

### Questions
Suggestions: Here are some additional suggestions regarding the paper writing and organizing. Note that these comments were not taken into consideration in the paper evaluation.

- Both Figure 3 and section 3.2 are conveying a very simple message: Initialize the adapters with identity mapping. I would rather invest this space in more experiments with more insights (e.g. combining FEATHER with EATA).

- Formatting and writing: The proposed method is simple while the methodology section is not. I would try to simplify the writing of Section 3 and remove redundant paragraphs.

- Please consider reorganizing the tables in page 7 such that each table is presented with its own paragraph.

- For ImageNet-C experiments, please consider a similar setup to the CIFAR10/100-C experiments where the corruptions are ordered, similar to the continual evaluation in EATA.
