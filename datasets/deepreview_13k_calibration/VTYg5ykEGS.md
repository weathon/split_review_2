## Abstract
The task of out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is notoriously ill-defined. Earlier works focused on new-class detection, aiming to identify label-altering data distribution shifts, also known as ``semantic shift." However, recent works argue for a focus on failure detection, expanding the OOD evaluation framework to account for label-preserving data distribution shifts, also known as ``covariate shift.” Intriguingly, under this new framework, complex OOD detectors that were previously considered state-of-the-art now perform similarly to, or even worse than, the simple maximum softmax probability baseline. This raises the question: what are the latest OOD detectors actually detecting? Deciphering the behavior of OOD detection algorithms requires evaluation datasets that decouple semantic shift and covariate shift. To aid our investigations, we present ImageNet-OOD, a clean semantic shift dataset that minimizes the interference of covariate shift. Through comprehensive experiments, we show that OOD detectors are more sensitive to covariate shift than to semantic shift, and the benefits of recent OOD detection algorithms on semantic shift detection is minimal. Our dataset and analyses provide important insights for guiding the design of future OOD detectors

### Summary
This paper analyzes the capabilities of current OOD detection algorithms highlighting a bias towards covariate shifts. In consequence, the authors introduce ImageNet-OOD, a dataset that can assess the impact of semantic shifts without the influence of covariate shifts. 

The authors address the limitation of current benchmarks to correctly evaluate out-of-distribution (OOD) detection algorithms due to a missing clear separation between semantic and covariate shifts. 

For the proposed set, the corresponding in-distribution (ID) dataset is considered to be ImageNet-1K. 
ImageNet-OOD is a manually curated dataset, with 31807 images from 637 classes. 
When building ImageNet-OOD, the authors started from ImageNet-21K and curated it in order to address the following issues:
   - semantic ambiguity
   - visual ambiguity
   - unnecessary covariate shifts 
 
Curation steps:
   - **1 All ImageNet-1K classes, their hypernyms, and hyponyms** - remove classes corresponding to ImageNet-1k classes, their hypernyms and hyponyms  
   - **2 Hyponyms of "Organism"** - as there is an issue with the classification of natural beings in WordNet (classified by both technical biological levels and non-technical categories), all classes having 'organism' as a hyponym are removed 
   - **3 Semantically-grounded covariate shifts** - remove potential 'semantically-grounded covariate shifts'. If we train a binary classifier to differentiate between 'dog' and 'vehicle', it can also be understood as an 'animal' vs. 'vehicle' classifier => class 'cat' can be considered as a semantically-grounded covariate shift  and should be removed to avoid confusions. Considering each pair of classes from ImageNet-1K, the common ancestor is identified, and the classes are associated with the immediate descendants of this common ancestor (most general description). Further, exclude all classes from ImageNet-21K that are hyponyms of the general descriptions identified above
   - **4 Final Class Selection** - remove samples generating semantic ambiguity due to inaccurate hierarchical relations in ImageNet labels (e.g. violin and viola)

The authors perform extensive experiments on seven OOD detection algorithms across 13 network architectures highlighting that: 
 - OOD detection algorithms are more sensitive to covariate shifts than semantic shifts 
- the practical benefits of new algorithms vs. MSP (maximum softmax probability) disappear under both new-class detection and failure detection scenarios

### Strengths
**S1** Introduce ImageNet-OOD, a curated OOD dataset for ImageNet-1K. 

**S2** Highlighting the ambiguity between semantic and covariate shifts for the OOD detection problem. 

**S3** Extensive experimental analysis, considering 7 OOD detection algorithms and 13 model architectures.

### Weaknesses
 **W1** Introducing separate datasets for assessing semantic and covariate shifts is relevant for roughly understanding OOD detection capabilities. 
Yet, in a real-case scenario, both semantic and covariate shifts will be present, and whether we wish to ignore one of the two should be specified through the training set (e.g. using a multi-environment setup - see [1]) 
If both semantic and covariate shifts are to be considered, then it is expected that the OOD detection algorithm will first identify the one generating the highest shift.
(see question **Q1**)

**W2** The curation steps can benefit from an in-depth analysis
See questions **Q2**, **Q3**, **Q4** and **Q5**

**W3** Conclusion of Sec.4.2, where randomly initialized models are considered for testing OOD detectors. Here, the authors conclude that there is a bias towards detecting covariate shifts even for untrained models. 
This observed bias is most probably justified by the inductive bias of the considered ResNet-50 model. 
Randomly initialized models are more sensitive to specific covariate shifts, but this observation cannot be generalized to any covariate shift. (see question **Q6**)



### Questions
**Q1** When evaluating the sensitivity to covariate or semantic shift, apart from the distances towards the closest ImageNet-1K sample (Fig. 3 left), you can also consider distances between the considered datasets (e.g. OTDD [2])
This can help you understand if the sensitivity can be explained by dataset statistics or is simply a model / method bias. 
Have you considered such an analysis?
For example, in Table 1, the model trained on ImageNet-1K sees samples from ImageNet-C and ImageNet-OOD. Depending on the distances between those sets and ImageNet-1K, we can understand why covariate or semantic shifts are captured by the OOD detection algorithms.

**Q2**  If we first perform the third curation step "Semantically-grounded covariate shifts", is there any reason to employ step 1 "All ImageNet-1K classes, their hypernyms, and hyponyms"? 
By reaching the most general decision boundary for each pair of ImageNet-1K classes and further removing all the classes that fall under those broader decision boundaries from ImageNet-21K you remove both hypernyms and hyponyms. 

**Q3** Regarding the example with 'viola' and 'violin' from Figure 1. Is there any reason for this ambiguity to persist after the elimination of 'semantic-grounded covariate shifts'?

**Q4** For the 'Final Class Selection' step, have you considered the implementation of an automated process that exploits, for example, the CLIP embeddings? 
Instead of manually searching for those ambiguities, you can use CLIP zero-shot to classify images in both ID and OOD classes and understand potential similarities / confusions. 
This would be useful for having a receipt for curating OOD sets based on a considered ID set, without requiring human intervention.  

**Q5** Regarding examples from Figure 2: Images with similar visual contents are presented - this means that a certain threshold for visual similarity is considered when removing visually similar classes. How do you choose this threshold, considering that the selection is manually performed. Regarding **Q4**, it would be useful to use such an automatic approach in order to establish a relevant threshold. 

**Q6** Regarding Sec. 4.2 - The considered covariate shifts are restricted to image alteration techniques (blur, noise, etc.). But, covariate shifts can also appear when we observe objects in city backgrounds in ID, while in the OOD set, we observe objects on a forest background. 

*Q6.1* Have you considered this type of covariate shifts? I assume that the conclusion of this section will not hold in this scenario. Actually, it may be valid for a restricted set of covariate shifts, strongly related with the inductive bias of the considered model architecture. 

*Q6.2* Have you performed the same analysis considering semantic shifts? This would be useful in order to conclude that random models are more sensitive to covariate shifts.

### Summary
This paper introduces a new out-of-distribution (OOD) task dataset, primarily composed of data from ImageNet-1K and ImageNet-21K. The authors selected a portion of the data using specific rules and meticulous manual annotation for OOD tasks. The authors discovered that many state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods performed worse than certain baseline methods on this dataset, prompting further reflection on OOD tasks.

### Strengths
1. The motivation of this article is meaningful. Currently, available OOD detection datasets do have certain issues, and by using a more carefully selected dataset, it is possible to define the problem of OOD detection better.

2. The dataset proposed in this article has inspired the development of OOD detection tasks. The authors discovered that many state-of-the-art methods did not perform well on their dataset, and based on this, they made their findings, which are beneficial for further research.

3. The description in this article is clear, making it easy for readers to understand the characteristics of the dataset, its construction method, experimental results, and conclusions.

### Weaknesses
 1. The focus of this paper is primarily on the dataset and analysis, which are undoubtedly meaningful aspects. However, the author fails to provide their own methods to improve the effectiveness of OOD detection tasks, which results in a lack of depth and contribution in this paper.

 2. The author's comparison methods lack some of the latest approaches. In recent conferences such as CVPR 2023, new methods have been proposed. Including these methods in the comparison would make the article more comprehensive. Additionally, many methods may be sensitive to hyperparameters, so it would be beneficial to discuss the adjustment of hyperparameters when changing to new datasets.

### Summary
This paper introduces ImageNet-OOD, a new out-of-distribution (OOD) detection dataset that minimizes covariate shift compared to ImageNet-1K by manually selecting semantically different classes from ImageNet-21K. Using this dataset, the authors evaluate several recent OOD detection algorithms and find they offer little benefit over the maximum softmax probability (MSP) baseline for detecting semantic shifts. The key conclusions are:
1. Modern OOD detectors are much more sensitive to covariate shifts than semantic shifts.
2. On ImageNet-OOD, modern OOD detectors offer <1% AUROC improvement over MSP for new-class detection.
3. For failure detection, MSP still outperforms modern OOD detectors on ImageNet-OOD.
4. The benefits of modern OOD detectors come more from better separating incorrect in-distribution examples rather than improving on semantic shifts.

### Strengths
1. ImageNet-OOD appears to be a useful benchmark for evaluating OOD detection methods on semantic shifts. The careful data curation process is commendable.
2. The analyses on the susceptibility of modern methods to covariate shifts are insightful. The experiments are comprehensive across different datasets, algorithms, and metrics.
3. The finding that MSP remains a strong baseline is an important result for the OOD detection community. It helps calibrate expectations on recent progress.

### Weaknesses
1. While covariate shift robustness is desirable, the goal of semantic shift detection is also useful in many applications like open set recognition. The heavy focus on covariate shifts undervalues semantic shift detection.
2. More analysis could be provided on the characteristics of examples that lead methods to confuse covariate and semantic shifts.
The writing and organization needs polish in some areas. The high-level conclusions could be stated more clearly in the intro and abstract.
3. In summary, this is an reasonable contribution introducing a new dataset and providing useful experiments analyzing modern OOD detection methods. I suggest acceptance after revisions to clarify the presentation and provide additional analysis/discussion.

### Summary
This work introduces a new OOD detection benchmark for ImageNet-1K, namely ImageNet-OOD (IN-OOD for short). Compared to existing benchmarks (e.g., Species, OpenImage-O, SSB, NINCO), IN-OOD minimizes covariate shifts and operates at a large scale (in terms of # OOD categories and # images). With this new benchmark, the authors evaluate several recent post-hoc detectors under both 1) novel class detection and 2) failure detection schemes. The major finding is that existing detectors are (undesirably) much more sensitive to covariate shifts than semantic shifts, and most detectors do not provide practical benefits over the simplest baseline MSP.

### Strengths
1. Although not for the first time, this work does focus on and point out several crucial issues for OOD detection research (which unfortunately still haven't been paid enough attention by the researchers in this field). These issues include: 1) the lack of a semantic shift-only, clean, and large-scale OOD dataset for ImageNet-1K, 2) the sensitivity of existing methods to covariate shift, and 3) the mismatch between a) the ultimate goal of OOD detection and b) the "wrong" goal reflected by the current evaluation which is the result of issue 1) and 2).
2. The constructed IN-OOD would indeed be valuable, especially considering the rigorousness introduced by the several filtering processes and the final human inspection. I could imagine how big the human efforts involved in this process are, and I personally appreciate it.
3. Performing evaluations under both new-class detection and failure detection setting is good, which can provide a unified assessment.

### Weaknesses
1. An important reference, OpenOOD v1.5 [1] is missing (released on arXiv in June 2023). Their evaluation results in the full-spectrum OOD detection setting (considering semantic-shifted and covariate-shifted samples together [2]) are also concrete evidences that current OOD detection methods, not restricting to post-hoc methods, are very sensitive to covariate shifts. This is actually presented as one of their major observations, and thus I believe it is necessary to discuss this work at least in the Related Work section.

2. Like I said, I appreciate the efforts in constructing IN-OOD and I recognize the value in this new dataset. However, I wouldn't say that the observation of "OOD detectors are more sensitive to covariate shifts than semantic shifts", which is one of the claimed contributions, is new. Evidences include both [1, 2]. Another major observation of this work, "the practical benefits of these algorithms disappear under new-class detection", is also similar to one presented in [1], where they find the improvements in "near-OOD" (which essentially has less covariate shifts than "far-OOD") detection is limited.

3. This is not really a weakness. I like the example in Figure 1 where "Animal, Vehicle" are ID, and training images of "Animal" is dog while test images could be cat. This actually points to a type of covariate shift called Subpopulation Shift [3]. I think the discussion on this example could be made more clear by explicitly discussing the relationship between OOD detection and Subpopulation Shift (although I agree that this could often times be application-dependent).

4. Lastly, again this is not technically a weakness, but part of me feels that this work might suit dedicated dataset & benchmark track better.

### Questions
As demonstrated by NINCO work, human inspection is necessary for constructing clean OOD datasets (which is also recognized in this work). However, human inspection could be extremely costly, which I believe is the reason why NINCO itself is limited in size (a few hundreds or at most thousands of images). IN-OOD in comparison has a total of 31,807 images. I was wondering how thorough and rigorous the human inspection was for the "final review" of IN-OOD at this size. How many human inspectors were involved and how long did it take for the final review?
