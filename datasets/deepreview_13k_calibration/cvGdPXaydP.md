## Abstract
Motion planning is of critical importance for safe navigation in complex urban environments. Historically, motion planners (MPs) have been evaluated using procedurally-generated simulators like CARLA. However, such synthetic benchmarks are not reflective of real-world multi-agent interactions. nuPlan, a recently released MP benchmark, addresses this limitation by augmenting real-world driving logs with closed-loop simulation logic, effectively turning the fixed dataset into a reactive “gym” simulator. We evaluate the quality of nuPlan’s Default-Gym and find that it does not accurately reflect real-world human behavior, particularly for cities with unique driving behaviors (e.g., Boston drivers tend to be more aggressive than Pittsburgh drivers). Therefore, we propose city-specific gyms (e.g., a Boston-Gym and Pittsburgh-Gym) to evaluate planning performance. Evaluating a state-of-the-art planner with our proposed ensemble of gyms yields a drop in performance, suggesting that a good planner must adapt to different environments. Leveraging this insight, we present City-Driver, a model-predictive control (MPC) based planner that unrolls a city-specific world model that adapts to different driving conditions. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that City-Driver achieves state-of-the-art results on the nuPlan benchmark, reducing test error from 6.4% to 4.8%.

### Summary
This paper introduces a novel approach to enhance motion planning in autonomous vehicles by using city-specific simulations. It addresses the limitations of standard simulators, which often fail to mimic real-world driving behaviors accurately, particularly in different urban contexts. The paper proposes the creation of city-specific gyms, such as Boston-Gym or Pittsburgh-Gym, that better capture the unique driving characteristics of each city. This approach leads to more realistic and effective training of motion planning algorithms. Additionally, the paper introduces 'City-Driver,' a model-predictive control-based planner that adapts to various driving conditions by using these city-specific world models, showing significant improvements in performance on the nuPlan benchmark. The research highlights the importance of considering local driving behaviors for accurate and efficient motion planning in autonomous vehicles.
Extensive Testing: Demonstrates through extensive experiments that the City-Driver model achieves state-of-the-art results on the nuPlan benchmark, suggesting that adapting to city-specific driving characteristics is crucial for accurate motion planning.

### Strengths
Innovative Approach: The paper introduces a novel concept of city-specific simulations for motion planning in autonomous vehicles, addressing a crucial gap in existing simulation methodologies.

Realistic Simulations: By creating city-specific gyms, such as Boston-Gym and Pittsburgh-Gym, the paper significantly enhances the realism of autonomous driving simulations, ensuring that they better reflect unique local driving behaviors.

Improved Accuracy: The introduction of the City-Driver model, a model-predictive control-based planner, demonstrates notable improvements in motion planning accuracy and performance, as evidenced by its results on the nuPlan benchmark.

Practical Application: The research directly addresses a practical challenge in autonomous vehicle development, offering solutions that could be integrated into real-world systems.

### Weaknesses
Complexity and Scalability: The approach of creating city-specific simulations could be complex and resource-intensive, potentially challenging to scale across numerous cities with distinct driving behaviors. The computational cost of generating and maintaining these city-specific environments, including the detailed modeling of road networks, traffic patterns, and pedestrian behaviors, could be substantial. Furthermore, the process of adapting the simulation to new cities might require significant manual effort and expert knowledge, limiting the scalability of the proposed approach.

Generalization: While city-specific models offer increased accuracy, they might limit the generalizability of the motion planning algorithms. A system trained in one city might not perform as well in another without significant retraining. The reliance on city-specific driving behaviors could lead to overfitting to the training environment, making the model less robust to variations in driving styles and road conditions in unseen cities. This could pose a challenge for deploying the system in new urban areas without substantial adaptation.

### Questions
The reviewer really likes the perspective the authors propose regarding the intrinsic different distribution for driving among different cities. Several minor concerns are:
- The nuplan dataset is not well balanced (more data collected in Las Vegas compared to the others). Is this going to affect the results to some extents (e.g., LV driver seems to be better than other cities)?
- While the geolocation would impact the overall driving behaviors, it is quite implicit in some sense. Do the authors have an idea of how to measure this driving behavior distribution shift in a better way?

### Summary
The paper proposes an approach in which datasets that are turned into simulators can be evaluated for realism, for  motion planning experiments. To this end, the work presents a way to measure how different the simulated environment is from real-world situations, and suggests the use of an adaptive planner for a reactive environment. The specific datasets and simulators here are CARLA and nuPlan, used for navigation in traffic.

### Strengths
The question / problem the paper is addressing is interesting and useful. It starts from an investigation of statistical differences between places, and finds the nuPlan simulator doesn't reflect real-world human behavior.

I also like the work helps to spotlight city-specific insights, and ways to deal with such differences.

The formal presentation of the work is good.

### Weaknesses
The delineation of contributions seems somewhat ambiguous, particularly concerning the novel aspects beyond the insights into nuPlan. The introduction cites the development of an "adaptive-planner" as a major contribution. However, upon reading the paper, it appears that the problem is addressed using an existing planner rather than introducing a new one. This discrepancy between the stated contribution and the actual content may benefit from clarification.

As a result, presentation of the work itself is a probably one of the main weaknesses.

Additionally, the paper could be strengthened by discussing various methodologies to assess realism. Incorporating statistical measures such as summary statistics, event counts, time intervals between events, or probability distributions could offer a more comprehensive evaluation. The current approach might inadequately capture infrequent but significant events. It is also possible that the methods employed are not described in sufficient detail to fully convey their scope and impact.

As a more general idea I'm wondering if it would be worthwhile looking at the individual distributions more closely to investigate the performance of the default behaviors as a result of averaging out multiple modalities; potentially could be solved by combining GMM/MPC where the GMM model the behavior of the traffic. There's quite a bit of work on stochastic MPC in the context of autonomous driving, including non-gaussian trajectory planning, and insights into how this work applies to the given problem would be interesting.

Minor comments:
- I don't think introduction of the "Gym" terminology is necessary
- If I understand correctly, the plots in figure 1 are from 2 simulators and the real world. The caption says using three different simulators. I assume that is a mistake.
- the references in related works (trajectory optimization paragraph) should be in parenthesis (citep not citet).

### Questions
Is "city-driver" as the 2nd listed contribution mainly the objective function? I have the feeling I misunderstood this point.

### Summary
This paper focuses on motion planning for autonomous vehicles (AVs). 

The contributions are as follows. 

First, it identifies a limitation/bug of the nuPlan simulator, a data-driven reactive simulator for motion planning for AVs. The limitation is that in the simulation, when controlling other vehicles with rule-based planners, they are always projected to the road, including the parked cars. This makes the simulation unrealistic. They address the limitation by allowing the other vehicles to follow their ground-truth trajectories while still being reactive. Experiments show that this makes the simulation more realistic, based on the metric to what extent can the simulator reproduce the behaviors of other vehicles when the ego-vehicle follows the ground-truth trajectory. 

Second, the authors argue that each city has its own dynamics and challenges. As such, for better evaluation of the planners, we should make city-specific benchmark scenario. To do so, they optimize the behaviors of other agents for each city using city-pecific data. Experiments show that without surprise, the planner that uses a generic model performs in city-specific benchmark scenarios. To improve the performance, the authors propose to learn a classifer to identify the current city and use the corresponding model to do rollouts during planning. Experiments are performed to verify the effectiveness of this approach.

### Strengths
The presentation of the ideas is good, with illustrating plots and examples. 
The paper is easy to read. 
Extensive experiments are performed to verify the claims.

### Weaknesses
My main concern is on the contributions of this paper.

The first contribution, which is to test and improve the existing simulators, is very limited. It focuses on a single pre-existing simulator. The realism of simulation is measured and improved on a single metric: accuracy of other agents if the ego-vehicle follows ground-truth. This metric ignores other important factors regarding the realism of simulation: what happens if the ego-vehicle does not follow ground-truth. For example, does the improved simulator still produce realistic interactions when the ego vehicle deviates significantly from its recorded path? Does the improved simulator capture the cascading effects of such deviations on other agents? The evaluation is too narrow and does not sufficiently validate the simulator's overall realism.

The second contribution, making a number of models for a number of scenarios and using a classifer to learn to use which model for the current scenario during planning, is also not novel. Moreover, I don't find this method promising. First of all, there is an issue of scalabilities. When there are more cities, you need to make more models, and the classifer needs to be bigger. Second, there is an issue of generalization. What if the vehicle is running in an unseen city. Third, apart from the city, there are many other factors that could affect the dynamics, such as if it is peak hour. The approach seems overly specific and lacks a clear path for generalization to new environments or conditions. The reliance on a classifier to select pre-trained models introduces an additional point of failure and complexity without a strong justification for its effectiveness in diverse scenarios.

### Questions
1. I understand that compared to C3, C4 allows the other agents/vehicles to traverse on the ground-truth trajectory without being projected to the road while remaining reactive. But how? I cannot find the details.

### Summary
This paper introduces the discrepancy problem regarding the realism of a public motion planning simulation environment. The author argues that the existing simulation environment cannot accurately replicate city-specific driving behaviors and proposes to assess realism by measuring the planning performance when replaying recorded human driver logs within the simulation. While the behavior of agents in the existing simulation environment is governed by a set of hyperparameters, such as maximum acceleration and deceleration, the author proposes a city specific environment by tuning these hyper-parameters according to human motion planning performance.   Then, a MPC based city-specific motion planner is introduced by identifying the city through map classification and utilizing city-specific world models. The authors conducted an evaluation using a public motion planning benchmark.

### Strengths
This paper raises a valid problem on the lack of behavior realism in the NuPlan reactive simulation environment with statistics support their claim (Figure 1). 

The city-specific NuPlan environment could be beneficial for the community.

### Weaknesses
Quantify the realism of driving behaviors for non-playable agents in simulation is a challenging problem. I can not agree with the author on measuring realism of the simulator using replayed human driving logs. The simulated agents may just behave more diversely in the simulation which could cause the replayed human driving logs to have a poor planning performance due to collisions. In fact, some could argue that realistic simulation requires the non-playable agents to be flexible and diverse while behaving realistically in distribution[1]. Extensive clarification on the reason for using replay human logs as a measurement of realism would be needed. 

I think the proposed work depends heavily on the previous success of PDM-C planner which is not carefully discussed in this paper.

I am not sure if I would say the author proposed city-specific gyms "closely model real-world behavior statistics" in Figure 1. Maybe a KDE plot would help to see the difference. The current evaluation focuses solely on the NuPlan benchmark, which limits the generalizability of the findings. The paper does not adequately explore alternative metrics for evaluating the realism of the simulation beyond the performance of replayed human logs. This narrow focus on a single benchmark and evaluation method raises concerns about the robustness of the conclusions. Furthermore, the paper lacks a detailed analysis of the action distribution of non-ego agents and the number of non-parked agents, which are crucial for assessing the realism of the simulation environment. Without these analyses, it's difficult to ascertain whether the proposed city-specific environments truly capture the nuances of real-world driving behavior.

### Questions
Question mentioned in the weakness section would help clarify the reason for using replayed human driving logs to measure realism of the simulator. 

Figure 2, are the blue lines represent the center line of each lane?

At the end of section 3, the author mentioned simulating "Boston-like driving behavior for driving logs collected in Pittsburgh." Could the author please explain in detail how this simulation was achieved?
