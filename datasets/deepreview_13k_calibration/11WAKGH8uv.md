## Abstract
<- trailing '%' For backward compatibility oF .sty File
There is a significant relevance of federated learning (FL) in the realm of Artificial Intelligence of Things (AIoT). However, most of existing FL works are not conducted on datasets collected from authentic IoT devices that capture unique modalities and inherent challenges of IoT data.
To fill this critical gap, in this work, we introduce \texttt{FedAIoT}, an FL benchmark for AIoT. \texttt{FedAIoT} includes eight datasets collected from a wide range of IoT devices. These datasets cover unique IoT modalities and target representative applications of AIoT. \texttt{FedAIoT} also includes a unified end-to-end FL framework for AIoT that simplifies benchmarking the performance of the datasets. Our benchmark results shed light on the opportunities and challenges of FL for AIoT. We hope \texttt{FedAIoT} could serve as an invaluable resource to foster advancements in the important field of FL for AIoT.

### Confidence
3: You are fairly confident in your assessment. It is possible that you did not understand some parts of the submission or that you are unfamiliar with some pieces of related work. Math/other details were not carefully checked.

### Summary
The paper introduces a new benchmark for Federated Learning (FL) specifically aimed at Internet of Things (IoT) applications. The contributions include the curation of eight (already available) datasets spanning different applications and modalities, an end-to-end FL framework for AIoT, some novel ideas on handling noisy labels and extending quantized training to the client side.

### Strengths
The main strengths and contributions of the paper are the following:

1) The limitation of existing benchmark datasets in their application to IoT applications is a real one, and the contribution of this paper is curating important publicly available datasets to create a single benchmark for evaluating FL algorithms is an important step.

2) The important FL issues of noisy labels in classification tasks and quantized training due to the resource constraint of IoT devices has been addressed.

### Weaknesses
The paper has the following weaknesses:

1) Although the paper does well in introducing a new benchmarking framework for FL for IoT, it still largely builds upon curating from existing datasets introduced by prior works.

2) The introduced end-to-end FL framework also seems to be a collection of standard machine learning and FL ideas such as non-IID data partitioning, normalization, etc. The novel contributions of addressing noisy labels (non uniform addition of noise) and quantized training at the client side seem limited.

3) The discussion on the details of non-IID partitioning using Dirichlet allocation seems limited, with no further details provided either in the main paper or in the supplementary material.

### Questions
Below are some comments and questions:

1) The authors mention that in real-life settings, individuals may not carry a smartphone and wear a smartwatch at the same time, and hence WISDM dataset was partitioned into two. However, this conclusion does not always hold true and better partitions of the WISDM dataset can be made that include both smartphone and smartwatch data in some realistic manner.

2) For non-IID partition over output distribution that implements quantile binning, how is the value 10 for the number of groups chosen? This seems arbitrary or heuristic.

### Summary
The authors describe a new IoT FL benchmark suite based on several datasets they have curated and demonstrate that it can be used to compare FL optimizers.

### Strengths
+ Benchmark curation work doesn't receive the credit it deserves, given its impact on advances in the field. The authors are doing something important, here.

### Weaknesses
+ The writing quality is poor, even in the abstract.

+ The authors claim this is the first IoT FL benchmark but a Google Scholar search turns up "FLBench: A Benchmark Suite for Federated Learning" by Yuan Liang, Yange Guo, Yanxia Gong, Chunjie Luo, Jianfeng Zhan, and Yunyou Huang, which includes an AIoT benchmark domain. It isn't clear whether this is competing work, or work by the authors of the submitted paper. In either case, it seems highly relevant but does not appear to be cited. One way to deal with this problem within the blind review process is to cite the work, but use an entry such as "Redacted for blind review" in the bibliography during the review process. Another paper, "FedML: A Research Library and Benchmark for Federated Machine Learning" claims to support IoT devices. I am not claiming that those papers are identical to this work, but they seem close enough to merit contrasting them with the author's benchmark. I view this as a substantial weakness, but one that might be resolved via rebuttals and simple revision.

+ The modifications to the curated datasets are not well justified. They are reasonable, but explicit justification or basing the approach on well justified approaches from prior work would be best.



### Questions
1) Does the similarity matrix used for noisy labeling depend on the particular centralized learning approach? If so, does that mean that centralized training and evaluation must be redone to enable noisy labeling whenever an algorithm changes? Or is there something fundamental about the confusion matrix, i.e., is it unlikely to change much when models change?

 2) Why not leave the sounds in raw format instead of converting to the frequency domain with particular parameters? Isn't this sort of raw data to feature conversion part of the approaches your benchmarks will be used to evaluate? If so, why build one particular approach to feature extraction into the benchmarks?

3) What is the purpose of Section 4? To demonstrate that the benchmarks can be used to compare optimizers? Enabling comparison doesn't imply enabling comparison yielding correct ranking of optimizers. If you could demonstrate that the findings using your benchmarks differ from those using the most closely related existing (perhaps even non-IoT) benchmarks, and your benchmarks are more typical of applications in the IoT domain, that would support your claim that your benchmarks are more useful in this domain than prior work.

### Weaknesses
Abstract and Introduction
The paper proposes a unified end-to-end Federated Learning (FL) framework for Artificial Intelligence of Things (AIoT) named FedAIoT. The framework is benchmarked across multiple IoT datasets and incorporates a variety of data partitioning schemes, preprocessing techniques, models, and FL hyperparameters. Despite its comprehensive approach, the paper lacks a comparative study with existing state-of-the-art solutions. Moreover, while the paper mentions the inclusion of popular schemes and models in its framework, it doesn't substantiate why these were chosen over other potential candidates.

Equations and Mathematical Formulations
The paper briefly touches upon the Dirichlet distribution for creating non-IID data partitions and mentions metrics like accuracy and Mean Average Precision (MAP-50). However, it lacks mathematical rigor. For instance, the Dirichlet distribution is mentioned but not defined. A formal definition, perhaps along with its probability density function, would have given more depth. Furthermore, there are no equations to represent the FL optimizers like FedAvg and FedOPT, which makes it difficult to appreciate the nuances or compare them.

Tables and Figures
Table 1: While useful for a cursory comparison, this table lacks depth. For example, it could include a comparison based on performance metrics to provide an analytical foundation for its claims.

Figure 1 and 2: These figures provide an overview but lack detail. For example, Figure 2 could be improved by including the types of IoT-specific preprocessing techniques or by detailing the architecture of the proposed IoT-friendly models.

Table 4: This table summarizes the performance metrics but lacks confidence intervals or p-values, which are essential for ascertaining the statistical significance of the results.

Table 5: While this table attempts to show the impact of client sampling ratios, it doesn't explain why only two ratios (10% and 30%) were chosen for comparison.

Dataset and Experimental Design
The paper includes a wide range of datasets, which is commendable. However, it doesn't provide any rationale for the specific choice of datasets. Furthermore, no information is given about the train-test split methodology. Was it random or stratified? The partitioning schemes for these datasets are discussed, but there is a lack of empirical justification for why these schemes are effective or superior to existing methods.

Algorithms and Techniques
The paper discusses various FL optimizers, data partitioning schemes, and IoT-friendly models, but there is a lack of justification for the chosen methods. For example, why were FedAvg and FedOPT selected as FL optimizers? Are they computationally less expensive or do they converge faster?

Results and Discussion
The paper presents a broad range of results but lacks a discussion comparing these results to existing benchmarks or state-of-the-art methods. The paper would benefit from including such a comparative analysis.

Insufficient Empirical Validation
The experiments conducted are somewhat limited in scope and scale. Only a few datasets are considered, and they seem to belong to similar domains. This raises questions about the model's generalizability. Moreover, the paper lacks ablation studies, making it difficult to understand the contribution of each component of the proposed method.

Actionable Insight: Include a broader array of datasets from varying domains to validate the model. Conduct ablation studies to quantify the impact of each component or parameter.

Absence of Comparative Analysis
While the paper aims to introduce a novel methodology, there is an absence of a comparative analysis with state-of-the-art methods. Without this, the paper falls short of convincingly establishing the proposed method's superiority or novelty.

Actionable Insight: Include comparisons with state-of-the-art methods in both qualitative and quantitative terms. This could be in the form of performance metrics, computational efficiency, or even qualitative assessments based on real-world applicability.

Mathematical Rigor
The paper would significantly benefit from a more rigorous mathematical treatment of the proposed algorithm. Currently, it seems to rely more on empirical observations. Given your stated goals of developing proper mathematical models, this is an area that requires attention.

Actionable Insight: Introduce formal proofs or derivations that can substantiate the algorithm's properties, such as stability, convergence, or robustness. Include theoretical justifications for the choices made in the algorithm's design.

Lack of Discussion on Limitations
Every model has its limitations, and acknowledging them not only adds credibility but also helps in guiding future work.

Actionable Insight: Devote a section to discuss the limitations of the proposed method and potential avenues for future research.

### Questions
Data Assumptions: Could the authors clarify the specific assumptions made about the data distribution? How do these assumptions align with the real-world scenarios where the model is expected to be deployed?

Methodological Choices: What was the rationale behind the selection of specific hyperparameters and architectural elements in the proposed model? Some clarification on this could strengthen the paper's methodological grounding.

Evaluation Metrics: The paper uses a particular set of metrics for evaluation. Could the authors elucidate why these metrics are most suitable for assessing the model's performance? Are there any other metrics that were considered but not used?

Computational Complexity: How does the computational complexity of the proposed method compare with existing state-of-the-art methods? Could the authors provide a detailed analysis in this regard?

Scalability: The paper does not discuss how well the proposed method scales with the size of the dataset. Could the authors provide insights or supplementary experiments that address this?

Ablation Study: The absence of an ablation study leaves some questions about the necessity of each component of the proposed model. Could the authors provide such an analysis in the rebuttal or an extended version of the paper?

Theoretical Guarantees: Are there any theoretical guarantees, such as convergence or bounds, that can be associated with the proposed algorithm? If yes, this would be a valuable addition to the paper.

Limitations: Every model has its shortcomings. Could the authors elucidate the limitations of the proposed model and how they plan to address these in future work?
