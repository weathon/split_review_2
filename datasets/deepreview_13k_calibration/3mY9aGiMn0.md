## Abstract
Static sparse training aims to train sparse models from scratch, achieving remarkable results in recent years. A key design choice is given by the sparse initialization, which determines the trainable sub-network through a binary mask. Existing methods mainly select such mask based on a predefined dense initialization. Such an approach may not efficiently leverage the mask's potential impact on the optimization. An alternative direction, inspired by research into dynamical isometry, is to introduce orthogonality in the sparse subnetwork, which helps in stabilizing the gradient signal.  In this work, we propose Exact Orthogonal Initialization (EOI), a novel sparse orthogonal initialization scheme based on composing random Givens rotations. Contrary to other existing approaches, our method provides exact (not approximated) orthogonality and enables the creation of layers with arbitrary densities. 
We demonstrate the superior effectiveness and efficiency of EOI through experiments, consistently outperforming common sparse initialization techniques. Our method enables training highly sparse 1000-layer MLP and CNN networks without residual connections or normalization techniques, emphasizing the crucial role of weight initialization in static sparse training alongside sparse mask selection.

### Summary
In this work, the authors propose a novel approach to sparse training, a technique aimed at training models with sparse structures from the beginning. The key element in sparse training is the sparse initialization, which determines which parts of the model are trainable through a binary mask. Existing methods often rely on predefined dense weight initialization to create these masks. However, such an approach might not efficiently harness the potential impact of these masks on the training process and optimization.

Inspired by research on dynamical isometry, the authors take an alternative route by introducing orthogonality into the sparse subnetwork. This orthogonality helps mitigate issues related to the vanishing or exploding gradient signal, ultimately making the backpropagation process more reliable.

The authors introduce their novel method called Exact Orthogonal Initialization (EOI). Unlike other existing approaches, EOI provides exact orthogonality, avoiding approximations. It also allows for the creation of layers with various densities.

### Strengths
The paper is well-written with a clear structure, making it easily readable for the audience.

### Weaknesses
However, it appears that the authors are more dedicated to highlighting the advantages of sparsity and orthogonality than proposing and demonstrating an efficient algorithm. There is a shortage of comparisons with similar algorithms in the experiments. The EOI algorithm does not seem to exhibit a significant advantage. The comparison results in Figure 3, along with the author's analysis, raise questions about whether the AI method could replace EOI. It's not clear where the innovation lies.

In Figure 5, it's unclear if the time curves represent that EOI significantly underperforms the SAO algorithm as matrix size and density increase.

In summary, the paper is well-structured and easy to read, but it lacks extensive comparisons with similar algorithms in the experiments, and the advantages of the EOI algorithm are not convincingly demonstrated. Clarity is needed in the interpretation of the results, especially in Figures 3 and 5. The meaning of bold and underlined entries in Table 3 requires clarification.

### Questions
P4L3: Is the k of W_{ijkk} same as the k from dimension 2k+1?
The meaning of bold and underlined entries in Table 3 is unclear, such as why some values in the 'VGG-16-GraSP-LReLU' column are bold in the middle.

### Summary
Authors have proposed a method to achieve exact orthogonal initialization for training very deep neural models with sparsity constraints. The approach is built upon recent advancements achieved via tools from the Random Matrix theory to improve initialization and achieve training acceleration.

### Strengths
The proposed method is simple, mathematically grounded, and addresses an important issue of sparsity-aware training in DNNs.
The flow of the paper is nice and structured.

### Weaknesses
Overall, the paper is well-written, but often, critical details are missing, which might make it difficult for a new reader to understand and appreciate the ideas discussed and their connection to prior art. For instance, the majority of readers will not be able to under the SAO method. The paper should be self-contained.

The link between sparse training and sparse initialization is not clear. It is well understood that within a larger dense network, a small subnet is usually contributing the most. This contribution is different for different settings, e.g., one might want individual subnetworks to perform a task within a multi-tasking/meta-learning setting.

I request authors to support the claim that post-pruning performance is better than sparse initialization-based training. IMHO, if the parameter mask is learned or adaptive during training, the performance is usually better. The depth and architecture of the network also play a significant role in deciding up to what levels a network can be pruned, which essentially connects to the idea of effective dimension/degree of freedom given the constraint local structure imposed by the architecture.

Orthogonal initialization (sparse/non-sparse) just ensures effective signal propagation and not generalization. In the end, if the goal is effective training and achieving the best performance, how crucial is Exact Orthogonality? Unless we regularize the network, which might impact the stability, memory requirements and compute complexity.

### Questions
Literature:
A few missing references
- Sun et. al, Low-degree term first in ResNet, its variants and the whole neural network family
- Thukur et. al, Incremental Trainable Parameter Selection in Deep Neural Networks
- Larsson et. al, Fractalnet: Ultra-deep neural networks without residuals
- Shulgin et al, Towards a better theoretical understanding of independent subnetwork training

What are indices ijkk on page 4 in the top paragraph? A diagram of how H is embedded in a convolutional kernel of shape BxCinxCoutxHxW would help the readers.

Delta orthogonalization assumes cyclic consistency for the convolutional layer. This assumption is not discussed in the paper and might mislead the readers.

With respect to sparse static training methods, please clarify whether the pruned connections/nodes that are not updated during backward pass are used for forward pass calculation or not. In addition, it seems Masks in GraSP/Synflow are adaptive over iterations, contrary to the setting introduced by the authors. 


The construction of EOI for conv kernels using random entries in the mask to achieve the desired density is not explained in detail. Is it guaranteed to be exactly orthogonal in this case, too?

Most results are empirical, and I wish authors have focused on theory to derive expressions for Dynamical Isometry in the proposed setting. Currently, the paper has half theory half numerical aspects, with both being incomplete.

Table 1: which numbers belong to MNIST and CIFAR-10?

It will be good to show the exact parameter count of each model to get a sense of how much the 10% parameters? 
Then, a fair comparison would be models of the same size with different width and depth configurations.

Also, I would encourage authors to consider the full imagenet benchmark or consider a multi-task/meta-learning setting for establishing the practical benefits of the method.
In general, it looks like only the favourable experimental settings have been chosen to show the effectiveness of the approach. This is not a major issue if the main focus of paper was on theoretical aspects on the proposed initialization (which is not the case.)

### Summary
This paper introduces a new method to achieve exact (and not approximated) orthogonal sparse initialization for the weights of a (deep) neural net.  
The method relays on a straightforward idea of using givens rotations, which apply an orthogonal transform on two dimensions (essentially, a 2D rotation) out of the feature dimensions. This process is repeated on random pair of dimensions, with random rotation angle, until the desired sparsity (or, density) is achieved.
The authors provide an exact formula for the expected density after a given number of rotation, which allows a precise design of the resulting initialization.

The authors provide a thorough evaluation of the method for different activation functions, under different static sparse training methods, and show compelling results when compared to *approximate* initialization.
Another comparison in done over a 1000 layer MLP with no residual connections nor normalization layers.
When trained on MNIST and CIFAR10 the proposed method achieves performance comparable to a dense network with only 12% of the weights.
Finally, the authors perform a comparison of several modern architectures on the mini-imagenet. 
With the sole exception of EfficientNet, the proposed method supersedes the existing sparse approaches, and narrows the gap to dense training with only 10% of the weights.

### Strengths
The paper was very easy to follow and understand, the main idea is straightforward but with a clear impact.
Expected density formulation makes this method more appealing for practical usage.
The experimental section positions the method well w.r.t. existing methods.

### Weaknesses
While the impact is clear, it leave some questions about the price to pay for sparse networks.
For example, the reader might enjoy an analysis of the price (in performance) on the mini-imagenet for different sparsity levels.

### Questions
* Are some rotation angles better than others? I can't imagen that using only 1 degree Givens will perform similarly to using only 80 degree Givens
* How can one gain sense of the price (in performance) for a given sparsity level?
* One may assume that some sparsity patterns result in better performance - is that true? if so, can one guide the Givens dimensions to such a pattern
