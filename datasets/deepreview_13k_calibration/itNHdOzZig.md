## Abstract
Predictor-based methods have substantially enhanced Neural Architecture Search (NAS) optimization. The efficacy of these predictors is largely influenced by the method of encoding neural network architectures. 
While traditional encodings used an adjacency matrix describing the graph structure of a neural network, novel encodings embrace a variety of approaches from unsupervised pretraining of latent representations to vectors of zero-cost proxies. 
In this paper, we categorize and investigate neural encodings from three main types: structural, learned, and score-based.
Furthermore, we extend these encodings and introduce \textit{unified encodings}, that extend NAS predictors to multiple search spaces. 
Our analysis draws from experiments conducted on over 1.5 million neural network architectures on NAS spaces such as NASBench-101 (NB101), NB201, NB301, Network Design Spaces (NDS), and TransNASBench-101. 
Building on our study, we present our predictor \textbf{\GN}: \textbf{Fl}ow \textbf{A}ttention for \textbf{N}AS. 
\GN{} integrates critical insights on predictor design, transfer learning, and \textit{unified encodings} to enable more than an order of magnitude cost reduction for training NAS accuracy predictors.

### Summary
This paper conducts a comprehensive study of encodings for NAS, as well as introduces a new NAS performance predictor that utilizes a GNN-based encoding which can be supplemented with other encodings such as zero-cost proxies. The new encoding is unified across search spaces, which enables transferrability of the pretained predictor to new spaces and more sample efficiency when finetuning it compared to training from scratch. The authors evaluate their predictor on a plethora of search spaces and release a dataset containing all their hardcoded and learned encodings for 1.5 million architectures across all their evaluated spaces.

### Strengths
- The motivation to have an unified encoding across NAS spaces is important and as the authors mention, this is relevant when it comes to transfer learning across spaces and tasks.

- The authors propose a new hybrid encoder that outperforms prior encodings and allows transferrability  of predictors to new search spaces. This leads to improved sample efficiency compared to training predictors from scratch on a new search space.

- Large-scale study of NAS encodings over 13 NAS search spaces with 1.5 million architectures in total across different tasks and datasets.

- The authors provide the code necessary to run their methods and reproduce their experiments. Moreover, the authors also release the dataset containing the encodings (both hard-coded and learned), which is very useful for future research on the NAS field.

- The paper is really well-written and easy to follow. I enjoyed reading it.

### Weaknesses
 - It seems that the performance predictor is transferable across search spaces, and can relatively predict the ranking good. However, as far as I saw this is done only on CIFAR-10, right? That means that if one wants to transfer a learned predictor on a new dataset, that would not be feasible with FLAN, or otherwise one would need to train FLAN on the said dataset from scratch.

- Other than this, I do not have any major weaknesses regarding this paper. I think that this is an important work for the NAS community.

**Minor**

- it would be great to refer to [1] and [2] that compares performance predictors for NAS on a variety of benchmarks. In [2] the authors also study the transferrability across spaces, though somehow orthogonal to this work since that transferrability is for predictors' traning hyperparameters.

### Questions
- Can the authors provide some experiments where they demonstrate the runtime of their performance predictor?

- In the unified encodings, the authors concatenate a unique search space index to every operation. As far as I understand this requires to know apriori the number and type of search spaces that you are training FLAN with. Maybe I understood this wrong, but would the choice of operations index for a search space impact the predictions when transferring to a new search space? For example, if search space A and B are similar, while search space A and C more distinct, would using index say 1, 2 and 10 for A, B and C, respectively, be a more reasonable choice than using 1, 10 and 2? Or is this invariant to the index choice?

- Did authors evaluate their simple NAS method in section 5 (Table 5) on other search spaces except NAS-Bench-101?

- In Table 4 it seems that the performance of FLAN + ZCP, almost in all settings, especially ENAS -> DARTS and vice verca, deteriorates as you increase the number of samples. Do the authors have any intuition why this is the case? Did they try with more number of samples (say up to 50 as in Table 5?

### Summary
This paper introduces a hybrid architecture performance predictor (FLAN) based on GCNs which improves sample efficiency. FLAN combines DGF with GAT, and further introduces a backward graph flow. It includes learnable operation embeddings and allows for concatenation of additional encodings, including score-based and unsupervised learned encodings. FLAN further enables transfer learning across cell-based search spaces, by appending unique numerical indices to cell encodings of each space.

The paper demonstrates both efficacy and sample efficiency in performance prediction, as well as sample efficiency in sample-based neural architecture search (NAS). Furthermore, the authors conduct transfer experiments, revealing the transferability between certain search spaces.

### Strengths
The paper is well-written and demonstrates an integration of ideas from prior work, further enhancing them to achieve SOTA sample efficiency in performance prediction and in sample-based NAS. Additionally, it shows superior Kendal tau correlation in performance prediction. The method also permits integration of new encodings, and hence allows to take advantage of developments in architecture encoding, such as new ZCPs. Furthermore, the unified encoding facilitates transfer learning across different cell-based search spaces.

### Weaknesses
- The Authors state that improvements gained in sample efficiency by pre-training FLAN on a source search space do not include the cost to pre-train the model. However, this makes sense only if the pre-training is done on a single source space and then transferred to any other space. From table 4, this doesn’t seem to be the case, and each target space has its own source space.

- Experiments on sample-based NAS are limited to NB101. Extending this (for example to NB201) would give a better assessment of the performance of FLAN. 

- The applicability of the method is limited to cell-based spaces.

- In the experiments of Table.2 (or Table.16) the number of trials for FLAN seems to be 3. It is unclear if this is consistent with the number of trials used for TA-GATES reported in the tables, and if not, this could lead to an unfair comparison.

- In the line above Table.4, “Over baseline FLAN, incorporating ZCP encoding improves predictor accuracy by 64% on average”, it is not immediately clear how this is derived from the table, and a more detailed explanation is needed.

- In Table.4, it is not specified if the entire source space is used for pre-training, or if a subset is used. This is important to clarify since the size of the source space can significantly impact the pre-training process and the resulting transfer learning performance.

- In the NAS paragraph of page 9: “Our FLAN^T_{CAZ} is able to improve the sample efficiency of end-to-end NAS on NB101 by 2.12× over other methods”, it seems that there is a typo and it should read FLAN_{CAZ} instead.

- In Table.5, the search method Zero-Cost NAS (W) is not described and is not cited (is this Zero-Cost Warmup?). Furthermore, the space DARTS_{LRWD} in Table.15 is not described, making it difficult to understand the experimental setup and reproduce the results.

### Questions
Clarification questions and comments:

- To make a better comparison with TA-GATES, NB301 would be a natural choice to include in table 2.

- In Figs.5,6 the source search spaces used for pre-training are not clearly specified. Are these the same as Table.4?

- In Table.15, for Amoeba, NB301 and TB101, what are the source search spaces used for pre-training FLAN^T?

- Is Table.15 supposed to generalize Tables.3,4 (or Tables.17,18)? If so, why don’t the numbers match? See e.g. FLAN_ZCP for 128 samples on NB101.

- In the experiments of Table.2 (or Table.16) the number of trials for FLAN seems to be 3. Is this consistent with the number of trials used for TA-GATES reported in the tables?

- In the line above Table.4, “Over baseline FLAN, incorporating ZCP encoding improves predictor accuracy by 64% on average”, how can we see this from the tables?

- In Table.4, is the entire source space used for pre-training?

- In the NAS paragraph of page 9: “Our FLAN^T_{CAZ} is able to improve the sample efficiency of end-to-end NAS on NB101 by 2.12× over other methods”, shouldn’t this be FLAN_{CAZ}?

- In Table.5, the search method Zero-Cost NAS (W) is not described and is not cited (is this Zero-Cost Warmup?).

- In Table.15, the space DARTS_{LRWD} is not described.

### Summary
This paper proposes FLAN, or FLow Attention for NAS, a neural predictor that incorporates a unified architecture encoding scheme to enable prediction across different NAS search spaces. The unified encoding is a mix of several unsupervised methods, like Arch2vec, CATE, and Zero-Cost Proxies, while the GNN predictor incorporates new mechanisms to potentially overcome the oversmoothing problem. Several design components of FLAN are ablated, and transfer tests are performed with an emphasis on sample efficiency.

### Strengths
Generalzing NAS predictors to cover multiple search spaces is essential and an important step forward.
For the most part, the paper is easy to read and follow early on. Figures 1-3 especially are nicely done.
There is detailed ablation on the design aspects of FLAN. Transfer experiments are performed, as is search.

### Weaknesses
The are issues with the contributions and statements made in this manuscript:

First, DGF: The author's point out that "GCNs are prone to an over-smoothing problem", although really this issue affects Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) in general. The author's then attempt to validate the efficacy of FLAN's predictor using the DGF and GAT in Table 1. I am not convinced by these experiments. GCN was proposed in 2016 and since then other GNN-types like GAT, GIN [1], GATv2 [2], etc., all of whose manuscripts demonstrate a superiority over GCN, so its no surprise that for FLOW, GAT > GCN. Also, it is unclear whether the DGF module used actually solves the oversmoothing mechanism at all. A simpler explanation is that adding skip-connections and more weights simply leads to better performance. Thus, results in Table 1 are inconsistent and do little to alleviate this concern, and it seems this paper cannot decide if it wants to be about correcting GNN problems or neural predictors in NAS.

Second, Unified Encodings for transferable NAS prediction. The author's cite Multi-Predict and GENNAPE. Given the focus on cell-based NAS, there is related work in this field called CDP [3] that is older than Multi-Predict/GENNAPE (both recent 2023 papers), but the authors seem unaware of. The form of encoding in this paper is weaker than related work for three reasons: First, there is no guarantee an architecture encoding will be unique as it possible for two different architectures to have almost the same ZCP scores/latency/FLOPs/etc. but be different structurally. 'Score-based' is a better descriptor for this encoding and I think the authors would be better off emphasizing that term to describe their method. Second, the use of "unique numerical indices" limits FLAN to a small number of predetermined search spaces so it cannot address the need to "validate NAS improvement without incurring the large compute cost of performing NAS on a new search space". Finally, the statement "However, search on a global graph structure—one that encompasses all NNs—can be an intractable search problem due to its size." is very weak. Large search spaces have never been an impediment even for early NAS methods [4][5], and it is still possible to perform search within cell-based NAS-Benchmarks even if using transferable encodings like CDP or GENNAPE.

Third, experimental inferences are not supported by the tables/figures. E.g., Fig. 4 t-SNE plots, specifically "In contrast, CATE doesn’t exhibit such distinct clusters, instead scattering NNs according to their computational complexity." Actually, the CATE plot shows a large number of individual clusters per search space, and the clusterings for each search space are close to each other. I am skeptical of making strong claims like that on a t-SNE plot as its very hard to interpret what each axis is measuring. Also, in Sec. 5, "Score-based encodings typically help prediction with low sample count but there are diminishing returns with more training samples". In Table 2 FLAN_{ZCP} sweeps performance for NB101 and ENAS, yet loses to TAGATES at the lowest data percent; also, the ZCP row itself does not boast impressive performance, but still monotonically increases with %samples.

Results in Tables 3/4 do not instil confidence given the goal this paper is trying to solve. For Table 3, On NASBench-101, DARTS and ENAS (FixWD) FLAN+ZCP dominates all the time, less so on NASBench-201 and DARTS_{FixWD}, and for Table 4, it only dominates on ENAS<->DARTS. For a method that targets transferability when few samples in the Target search space are available, you would expect it to either dominate quite conclusively, or be able to provide reasoning why the best setting changing depending on the transfer target. That is, when the method is deployed in an actual scenario where you actually do not have a lot of labeled data (whereas here, you are just artificially limiting the amount), some inference can be made about which predictor configuration (+Arch2Vec, +CATE, +ZCP or +CAZ) is the best fit, given the Target dataset.
The lack of either of these mutes the usefulness of FLOW.

Next, NAS search results are not impressive. The author's deliberately limit themselves to cell-based benchmarks where there is a wealth of literature, but mostly on CIFAR-10. Unlike CDP they do not even evaluate on ImageNet, much less other tasks where the utility of NAS should be aimed.

Finally, the presentation in mixed. The introduction and related work are easy and nice to read, but beyond that, the writing is subpar, especially in Section 4.1 when describing the GNN/DGF. Floats from Table 1 onwards (DF+GAT x NB201 typo) leave a lot to be desired.
E.g., Figure 4 is a mess: Text is way too small and there are red dots which seemingly have no label in the legend. If the author's are that insistent on plotting out these many search spaces they should make use of different colors and marker shapes to help distinguish search spaces. Figures 5 and 6 use different marker shapes but its too small, some are the same color, and just generally difficult to make stuff out. Also, less is more - plots should have fewer entries, only several important variants so the viewer can actually see what is going on. 

In summary, this paper starts off good with its writing, only to start making incorrect/unsupported statements/inferences in the methodology and results sections. This culminates in a very dense results section that fails to instill confidence in the efficacy of the proposed method should it be used down the line. For these reasons I recommend rejection of this manuscript.

### Questions
- Page 6, just above section 4.2: "We train predictors on these search spaces by keeping separate DGF-GAT modules for the normal and reduce cells, and adding the aggregated outputs" - why this design choice? In graph frameworks like DGL and PyTorch-Geometric it is entirely possible to have single data samples (e.g., one prediction) that consist of multiple disconnected graphs. 

- Section 5: "Contrary to prior work, we generate encodings for all architectures in the search space for evaluation." Then why does Table 2 list "Proporations of 7290 samples" for NAS-Bench-101?

- Not a question but I would suggest updating the bibliography entries as some influential works like NAS-Bench-301 were only on ArXiv for years but have now been formally published.
