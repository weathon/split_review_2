## Abstract
This paper studies a fundamental network optimization problem that finds a network architecture with optimal performance (low losses) under given resource budgets (small parameter size and/or fast inference). Different from existing network optimization approaches such as network pruning, knowledge distillation (KD), and network architecture search (NAS), in this work we introduce a novel self-evolving pipeline to perform network optimization. In this framework, a simple network iteratively and adaptively modifies its structures by using the guidance from the teacher network, until it reaches the resource budget. An attention module is introduced to transfer the knowledge from teacher network to student network. The splitting edge scheme helps the student model find an optimal macro architecture. The proposed framework combines the advantages of pruning, KD, and NAS, and hence, can efficiently generate networks with flexible structure and desirable performance. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100 and ImageNet demonstrated that our framework achieves state-of-the-art performance in this network architecture optimization task.

### Confidence
4: You are confident in your assessment, but not absolutely certain. It is unlikely, but not impossible, that you did not understand some parts of the submission or that you are unfamiliar with some pieces of related work.

### Summary
This paper proposes a self-evolving framework to perform network optimization, which iteratively refines the architecture by identifying and addressing network bottlenecks under the guidance of a teacher network. The framework adjusts the structure by widening or deepening the network at the bottleneck to improve network capacity. This iterative process continues until the resource budget is exhausted. The framework is evaluated on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet datasets and achieves better performance compared to other KD and network pruning methods. Abalation studies are also conducted to show the effectiveness of bottleneck identification and edge splitting in the framework.

### Strengths
1. The bottleneck identification and edge splitting techniques are interesting and intuitive.
2. The proposed framework combines techniques from KD and network pruning, offering a fresh angle to NAS.

### Weaknesses
1. Most of the experiments are conducted on small datasets (CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100) with only a single experiment performed on the larger ImageNet dataset. The authors may conduct more experiments on large and diverse datasets.
2. The comparison with KD and pruning methods is limited to slightly outdated works, with the most recent being from 2021 (Table 2, 5) and 2020 (Table 3, 4). More recent works should be included for comparison.
3. The method for determining the channels and strides for each layer, and for matching the size of feature maps to the teacher network, is not explicitly described. The attention module can be used to match channels, but not height and width.
4. Some important experimental settings are missing. For instance, the authors do not mention whether data augmentation was used for retraining on CIFAR. Additionally, the experimental settings for ImageNet appear overly simplified.
5. The authors measure network efficiency based on the number of parameters and FLOPs. However, these two metrics may not accurately represent the network's actual latency or throughput. The extensive use of separable convolutions might yield a small number of parameters and FLOPs, but it could potentially increase latency, especially when compared to normal convolutions.

### Rating Number

### Confidence
3: You are fairly confident in your assessment. It is possible that you did not understand some parts of the submission or that you are unfamiliar with some pieces of related work. Math/other details were not carefully checked.

### Summary
This paper proposed SEArch for neural architecture optimization. Based on a teacher model's supervision and a base architecture, SEArch gradually optimizes the architecture through 2 operations: 1) widening and deepening. The paper claims the proposed method is computationally efficient and can achieve SOTA performance.

### Strengths
1. The proposed method, SEArch, is new to me. The bottleneck identification part is interesting and different from the existing pruning method. 
2. The presentation is clear and easy to follow.

### Weaknesses
1. The experiments are not convincing. The paper has compared SEArch with the pruning methods. However, SEArch used extra KD supervision while other pruning methods may not use such supervision. Additionally, how does the computational overhead of SEArch compare to pruning methods or NAS approaches? I think a thorough comparison of NAS, pruning, and KD methods in terms of accuracy and computation is needed. 
2. The application of the proposed method seems to be quite limited.  1) The architecture choice is limited. The paper only uses ResNet for experiments while more advanced mobile architectures are not considered such as MobileNet or Transformers. 2) The operation set is limited. We can only widen and deepen the base architecture.

### Questions
1. What Eq1 exactly means? You don't define the Atten operation in the paper and I can't find the definition from the referred paper (Lin et al. (2022),). 
2. In your experiments, you use the ResNet architecture as the base network. As the proposed method can only widen and deepen the network (increase the parameters/flops), how do you reduce the parameters/flops of the base network?

### Summary
This paper proposes a self-evolving framework called SEArch to optimize neural network architectures in an efficient manner. The key ideas are to start from a simple network and iteratively identify bottlenecks and refine the structure under guidance from a teacher network through knowledge distillation. The approach leverages the strengths of network pruning, knowledge distillation, and neural architecture search.

### Strengths
1. The proposed SEArch framework combines insights from multiple areas in a novel way.

2. The approach of starting from a simple network and iteratively identifying bottlenecks to evolve the architecture is an interesting idea.

3. The experiments demonstrate that SEArch achieves better performance compared to baseline methods.

### Weaknesses
1. The single convolutional operation used may limit the expressivity of the generated architectures. In these days, more advanced models are dominated by self-attention and transformers models. It would be much better to use some transformer models for validation, like ViT.

2. The guidance from the teacher network could potentially constrain the optimized student network's performance, as stated by the limitation by the authors. A kind suggestion is that the teacher models could be ViT Large to be a stronger guidance.
