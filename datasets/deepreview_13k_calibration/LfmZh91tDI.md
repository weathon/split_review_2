## Abstract
Averaging neural network parameters is an intuitive method for fusing the knowledge of two independent models.
It is most prominently used in federated learning.
If models are averaged at the end of training, this can only lead to a good performing model if the loss surface of interest is very particular, i.e., the loss in the midpoint between the two models needs to be sufficiently low. 
This is impossible to guarantee for the non-convex losses of state-of-the-art networks.
For averaging models trained on vastly different datasets, it was proposed to average only the parameters of particular layers or combinations of layers, resulting in better performing models.
To get a better understanding of the effect of layer-wise averaging, we analyse the performance of the models that result from averaging single layers, or groups of layers. % only in the end or throughout training.
Based on our empirical and theoretical investigation, we introduce a novel notion of the layer-wise linear connectivity, and show that deep networks do not have layer-wise barriers between them.}

### Summary
This paper studies the idea of combining neural networks by averaging only certain layers of the model through the lens of the loss landscape.  If averaging the layers does not result in a model with error significantly above the average error of the two initial models, the the two networks are said to be layer-wise linearly mode connected (LLMC). The paper studies for several different networks/datasets the evolution of the error barrier of the full model as well as the error barrier in each layer.  (Note that layerwise error barrier is not "symmetric" as you can use either model 1 or model 2 as the base model; the paper presents plots for both.)  The general conclusion is there is often no layerwise error barrier even when there is a barrier for the full model.

The paper then makes several further contributions.  LLMC is studied for groups of layers instead of just individual layers, and a toy example of a deep linear network is given to demonstrate how there can be no layerwise error barrier when there is a barrier in the full model.  Some attempts at further understanding this phenomenon are presented by looking at the effect of random perturbations in the loss landscape and perturbations in directions related to the training subspace.  Finally, some results are presented in relation to averaging models in federated learning.

### Strengths
The results on LLMC for single layers and groups of layers across models and datasets is thorough and provides generally interesting results.  I did want to confirm that LLMC is the barrier with respect to *the average error of the two full models* not the average error of one full model and that model with a specified layer swapped.  The latter would not be very informative if this significantly increased the error, but Definition 2 seems to imply the authors used the former.  I would emphasize this before the definition in the paper because readers coming in with intuition from LMC will assume it's the average of the two end points of the interpolation; a figure might also be clarifying, similar to Figure 3 but illustrating how the barrier is computed.

Section 4 and 5.2 are also strong sections in my opinion.  They do a good job of emphasizing the idea that certain layers may provide better directions in the loss surface as compared to averaging the full model (e.g. Fig 4).

### Weaknesses
 **Section 5.1:** I found the conclusions of this section hard to parse.  I assume in Fig. 4 the intent is to compare the rows of the left 2 plots to the right 2 plots.  One would then see that the full model has less curvature along the averaging direction as compared to a random perturbation, but a few of the layers have the opposite trend.  The paper states:

```
Moreover, the networks are much more robust to random perturbations compared to the direction of interpolation between models. This suggests that averaging directions are special in the sense of having much higher curvature than random ones.
```
Are the authors referring to just the layerwise results here?  If so this should be made clear because my reading of the plot is this does not hold for the full model.

Second, is the random perturbation for each layer the size of the norm of the layer-wise interpolation for that particular layer?  This raised the question for me if the results on LLMC were actually better averaging directions in the loss landscape or simply much smaller perturbations to the model. (Also the build up of the error barrier over groups of layers could be increasing the size of the perturbation).  The results in Fig. 4 seem to point to the latter, and *I think this would be an important baseline to include for the other results, i.e. what would the barrier be for a random perturbation of the same size as $\alpha =0.5$.*  If you get the same result from randomly perturbing the layer there seems to be minimal benefit to doing the averaging.

**Section 6:** In Table 1, these are just the results for different groups of layers, not layers chosen based on the LLMC results.  Is the takeaway just evidence that averaging a subset of layers can be more effective?

In an application, how would you suggest choosing the layers to average? It seems it would be inefficient in some applications to compute the each layer's barrier every few epochs throughout training.

### Questions
Repeating the questions from the review for emphasis:

* The LLMC is the barrier with respect to *the average error of the two full models* not the average error of one full model and that model with a specified layer swapped, correct?

* In Table 1, the results are for different groups of layers the authors think would be interesting, not groups selected by layerwise barriers?

### Summary
The paper "Layer-wise Linear Mode Connectivity" presents an in-depth exploration of barriers on the loss surface observed during model averaging, introducing the concept of layer-wise linear mode connectivity (LLMC). The authors investigate the behavior of individual layers, concluding that the averaging barrier at this level is consistently minor compared to the full model. A significant finding is the propensity of middle layers to create cumulative averaging barriers, suggesting potential connections to existing studies on the neural network training process. The research also examines personalized federated averaging, highlighting the inherent challenges in distinguishing between layers that carry local knowledge versus those that carry common knowledge.

### Strengths
- The narrative construction is good, and the literature review is comprehensive and informative.
- The reviewer appreciates the bold conjectures made throughout the paper. Although these may not always be rigorous, such daring speculations can be beneficial in stimulating further research.
- Certain experimental outcomes are intriguing, for instance, the most sensitive layers of ViTs are the early attention and fully-connected weights; averaging directions exhibit a peculiar characteristic of having a much higher curvature than random ones of the same norm.

### Weaknesses
### Weaknesses
- The reviewer acknowledges some insightful observations in this paper. However, from the reviewer's perspective, while the findings are interesting, they may not introduce profound novelty. The core observation of layer-wise linear mode connectivity (LLMC) seems to be a natural consequence of averaging fewer parameters, and the paper does not sufficiently demonstrate that the observed behavior is unique to layer-wise averaging rather than simply a result of reduced parameter averaging.
- The presented phenomenon of smaller layer-wise barriers may not be surprising. For instance, if we consider a situation where all layers are created equally, the averaging of only $\frac{1}{s}$ layers would typically result in approximately $\frac{1}{s}$ of the loss increase induced by averaging all layers. It is plausible that the observation of Layer-wise Linear Mode Connectivity (LLMC) is due to the averaging of a smaller number of layers rather than a unique layer-wise structure. If the loss increase from averaging $\frac{1}{s}$ layers is significantly less than $\frac{1}{s}$ of the loss increase induced by averaging all layers, then this observation would lend more credence to the LLMC conjecture. The paper does not provide a rigorous comparison to this baseline, making it difficult to ascertain the true significance of the LLMC phenomenon.
- The theory is for single layer interpolation, whereas the experiments have been conducted on a subset of layers. This discrepancy between the theoretical setup and the experimental validation weakens the theoretical claims. The theoretical analysis should be extended to multi-layer interpolation to better align with the experimental findings.


### Questions
- The reviewer is unclear as to why Fig. 2 indicates that "neither the shallowest nor deepest layers cause the barrier, but the middle ones do". In Fig. 2 (a), both middle and deep layer averaging seem to result in high losses, and Fig. 2 (a) implies high losses upon averaging both middle and shallow layers.
- The layer-wise convexity appears straightforward since the single-layer interpolation $\boldsymbol{X} \boldsymbol{W}^{(1)} \ldots\left(\alpha \boldsymbol{W}^{(k)}+(1-\alpha) \boldsymbol{W}^{\prime(k)}\right) \ldots \boldsymbol{W}^{(L)}$ is a linear function of $\alpha$. The reviewer questions whether interpolating two layers would render $L(\alpha)$ non-convex.
- Does "non-iid" in Table 1 represent less severe non-i.i.d., and does 'path.' signify pathological non-i.i.d? Why does partial averaging perform better in the pathological non-i.i.d setting than in the less severe non-i.i.d. setting? Shouldn't higher degrees of non-IID reduce performance?

### Summary
This paper studies layer-wise linear mode connectivity (LLMC) and finds that in most cases, there are no barriers in LLMC. The authors also study the learning dynamics behind LLMC  from the perspectives of robustness and loss landscape. Also, implications are given regarding the partial personalization in federated learning.

### Strengths
* The motivation for studying layer-wise linear mode connectivity (LLMC) is novel and interesting. It contributes new ideas in the community of linear mode connectivity.
* The authors study LLMC from different perspectives which are thorough.
* The experiments are solid. The ViTs and LLMs are also studied to show the prevalence of the findings across a large range of model architectures.
* The findings and takeaway insights are intriguing.

### Weaknesses
Despite of the strengths listed above, I think this paper should be improved in the following aspects.
* The analysis of cumulative LLMC (LLMC about the group of layers) needs further investigation. The authors should study the LLMC of $l$ consecutive layers on different parts of the models. The authors can conduct an experiment with a moving window of $l$ layers to show the group-layer-wise connectivity. For instance, given a 20-layer network with $l=5$; the experiments should be conducted: LLMC of 1-5 layers, LLMC of 2-6 layers, LLMC of 3-7 layers, ..., LLMC of 16-20 layers. Current experiments cannot jump to the conclusion that the middle part of layers will cause barriers because you didn't control the variable of the number of aggregated layers $l$. 
* For the convexity of LLMC, I think the current Theorem is not enough and is far from the practice. Theorem 4.1 didn't consider the non-linearity of the neural networks, i.e., the activation functions. I think a more solid theorem should be derived to verify the convexity of LLMC. Specifically, the theorem should incorporate the impact of common activation functions like ReLU or Sigmoid, as these introduce significant non-linearities that are crucial to the behavior of neural networks. The current theorem is limited to linear transformations and does not reflect the complexities of practical neural network architectures.
* The discussions on personalized federated learning should be given more focus and I think this is an important point for this paper to have a broader audience and be more applicable to practices. However, I think current implications, experiments, and discussions are not enough.
    * The methods of personalized layers or layer-wise aggregation in personalized federated learning should be implemented and compared.
    * Based on the findings of this paper, a new method should be devised, but the paper didn't showcase the applicability by proposing a simple method.
    * Experiments on feature shift non-iid in federated learning should be conducted to verify the claim that personalized-layer-based techniques can work in feature shift federated learning. It is essential to demonstrate that the proposed layer-wise connectivity analysis can be leveraged to address the challenges posed by feature shift in federated learning, such as domain adaptation across clients. Without such experiments, the applicability of the findings to real-world federated learning scenarios remains unclear.

### Questions
See the above weaknesses for details. I suggest the authors provide additional results according to the weaknesses and I am happy to raise my scores once my concerns are relieved.

### Summary
The presented paper proposes a new concept, layer-wise linear mode connectivity, and shows that it's possible to explain it from a robustness perspective.

### Strengths
- The presented paper is well-written and is easy to follow. 
- The proposed phenominon is interesting and worth furthur study. 
- The paper provides specific practice guidance for federated learning.

------
After reading the authors' responce, I decide to keep my current rating unchanged.

### Weaknesses
I don't see how robustness is possible to explain the proposed LLMC, since the LLMC is concerning the relationship of two models while robustness concerns more about the relationship of a model with a random perturbation. The authors claimed in Section 5.1 that "the networks are much more robust to random perturbations compared to the direction of interpolation between models". This is not surprising to me, because when togetherly trained with sufficiently many epochs, the two models should be in the same basin (as the original LMC suggests), and the direction of interpolation between models is towards the basin while a random direction might not. I don't see how the proposed robustness explaination goes furthur than the same-basin explanation in original LMC paper.



### Questions
- In Section 5.1, how is "robustness to random perturbations" exactly calculated? 
- There are two competing definition of LLMC, namely the single layer one and the cumulative one. Which one is used in Section 5.1?
