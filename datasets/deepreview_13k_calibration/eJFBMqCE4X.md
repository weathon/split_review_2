## Abstract
Self-supervised representation learning is a powerful paradigm that leverages the relationship between semantically similar data, such as augmentations, extracts of an image or sound clip, or multiple views/modalities. Recent methods, e.g. SimCLR, CLIP and DINO, have made significant strides, yielding representations that achieve state-of-the-art results on multiple downstream tasks. A number of self-supervised discriminative approaches have been proposed, e.g. instance discrimination, latent clustering and contrastive methods; though often intuitive, a comprehensive theoretical understanding of their underlying mechanisms or what they learn eludes. Meanwhile, generative approaches, such as variational autoencoders (VAEs), fit a specific latent variable model and have principled appeal, but lag significantly in terms of performance. We present a theoretical analysis of self-supervised discriminative methods and a graphical model that reflects the assumptions they implicitly make, providing a unifying theoretical framework for these methods. We show that fitting this model to the data improves representations over previous VAE-based methods on several common benchmarks (MNIST, FashionMNIST, CIFAR10, Celeb-A), narrowing the gap to discriminative methods. We illustrate how generatively learned representations offer the promise of preserving more information than discriminative approaches.

### Confidence
5: You are absolutely certain about your assessment. You are very familiar with the related work and checked the math/other details carefully.

### Summary
The authors propose a hierarchical latent variable model for self-supervised representation learning. The lower-level latent variables correspond to the learned representations while the higher-level latent variables correspond to class/clusters. The authors propose an ELBO to the marginal log-likelihood and propose an algorithm to optimize the ELBO. The authors demonstrate that the resultant representations outperform representations learned by VAE.

Other than that, the authors propose variational approaches for performing instance discrimination, deep clustering etc.

### Strengths
The primary strength of the model is that it follows from first principles.  The learned features are diverse and preserve stylistic information as compared to discriminative approaches.

### Weaknesses
There are several weaknesses in this paper:

1) The paper is very hard to read. The primary contribution of the paper is equation (7) defined over J semantically related samples. The rest of the paper is filled with a lot of claims that do not belong to the paper. For instance, section 4.1 has a latent variable approach to instance discrimination. It is neither interesting nor surprising that a latent-variable version of instance discrimination or any other model can be created. Unless it serves some purpose or offers extra insights, it should be removed. Everything except 4.2 needs to be removed from section 4. 

2) Having an entire section for representation learning is again wasteful. The representation learning section needs to be moved to related work.

3) The authors should include the algorithm in their main paper rather than keeping it in the appendix.

I have put other issues in the Questions section

### Questions
1) What is the purpose of adding equation 9) since J=6 is used during training and J=2 is never used?
2) Which equation is used during training? Which equation corresponds to Algorithm 1? If it is equation 8), what is q(y|z1, ..., zJ). Infact it is necessary to show how  each of the distribution is represented.

### Summary
This article is placed in the context of representation learning using self-supervised learning (SSL) algorithms. It insists on the distinction between discriminative and generative SSL algorithms. The authors claim that while the former are generally easier to implement & train, and seem to generally produce better latent representation, they are actually very opinionated on which information is kept in the latent representation and which is discarded. The author argue that this is a result of the discriminative nature of the training process, which tends to only keep information necessary for the discriminative task and discard the rest. On the other hand, generative algorithms must retain as much information about the data as possible to fulfill their reconstruction training objective, and thus are theoretically capable of producing richer representation that contain more of the information from the data.

To try and bridge the empirical gap between those two families, the authors propose a graphical model representation that generalize the structure of many discriminative SSL algorithms, and use it to build a generative SSL model: SimVAE. It uses a hierarchical latent structure to encode the information that some training examples are related to each other without encouraging the model to discard information differing between them.

The proposed SimVAE is show to improve over other generative SSL models for downstream classification from their learned representation, in some cases being competitive with discriminative algorithms. Evidence is also given to the fact that SimVAE does learn richer representations than discriminative models, allowing better classification performance on secondary characteristics of the data.

### Strengths
This article seems rather solid. The proposed model is well motivated and theoretically sound.

The proposed latent construction for SimVAE is well adapted to problem of interest, and is and adequate answer to the claim that discriminative SSL tends to discard any information not relevant to the implicitly assumed class of downstream tasks.

The empirical evaluation of the proposed SimVAE is detailed, and performed against many relevant models. I am overall confident in the correctness of the results and relevance of the model.

### Weaknesses
 **Observation model:**

As is unfortunately very common in the VAE literature, barely any discussion is done regarding the probabilistic model of the decoder, $p(x|z)$ (in this case, that would be the variance associated with the MSE loss). It has been shown that it controls the signal/noise trade-off of the model, and thus how much information is stored in the latent representation of VAEs, which is of particular interest here (see for example [Dosovitskiy and Brox, 2016](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper/2016/hash/371bce7dc83817b7893bcdeed13799b5-Abstract.html), [Rezende and Viola, 2018](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.00597), [Loaiza-Ganem and Cunningham, 2019](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper/2019/hash/f82798ec8909d23e55679ee26bb26437-Abstract.html), [Berger and Sebag, 2020](https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.01972), or [Langley et al, 2022](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.12533) for discussions about the observation model).

As a result, I believe that this parameter has potentially a large impact on SimVAE's performance as a representation learning method, and leaving it to $1.0$ (according to appendix A.4.3) is likely to be too large a value, causing the model to discard significantly more information than appropriate.

**Hierarchical VAEs:**

The idea of hierarchical VAEs built on a chain of latent variables is not new, and there is a wealth of models build on latent structures similar (if not identical) to SimVAE. While as far as I remember SimVAE is not redundant with these works, I find it lacking that they are not mentioned in the paper, and that SimVAE is not positioned relative to them. A few non-exhaustive examples: [Rolfe, 2016](https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.02200), [Dilokthanakul et al, 2017](https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.02648), [Edwards and Storkey, 2016](https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.02185), [Bouchacourt et al, 2018](https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/AAAI/article/view/11867) or [He et al, 2019](https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJgsCjCqt7).

**Minor points:**

I think it would be an improvement to explicitly state what models of $p(y)$ and $p(z|y)$ are used in your experiments among the various possibilities that are suggested in Section 4, and how the training loss given in Algorithm 1 is derived from them.

### Summary
This paper started with the motivation of a principled understanding of the latent processes of self-supervised learning and then argued that common SSL models learn representations that “collapse” in latent semantic clusters and lose the nuanced information such as style. To improve this, the authors presented SimVAE to enhance SSL. It is a hierarchical VAE by further factorizing the latent $p(z)$ into $p(z|y)p(y)$, where $y$ is the “semantic content” such as different classes (e.g., different dog breed classes) or different instances (different dog image samples). The choice of $p(y)$ is Gaussian or uniform, and $p(z|y)$ is a low variance Gaussian. The authors derived the ELBO bound for SimVAE and showed promising results on MNIST and FashionMNIST while also showing results not as competitive as other SSL methods on Celeb-A and CIFAR-10.

Despite good efforts, the current shape of the paper lacks many sound technical details to be accepted at ICLR.

### Strengths
Originality: using VAE for self-supervised learning is not particularly new [1-3], but the idea of building a VAE for SSL by considering semantic latent variables in a higher hierarchy and then using it to explain existing SSL algorithms seems new to the reviewer. The authors seem to design the method from first principles.

Quality: there are some promising empirical results on small datasets, such as MNIST and FashionMNIST, where the proposed method surpasses or reaches close to SSL methods such as SimCLR, VicReg, and MoCo. The derivation of the SimVAE method (Eqs. 1-8) is correct despite minor errata (the details are in the Questions section.) 

Significance: bridging together generative and discriminative representation learning is an important topic, and the authors show their effort toward this step by trying to explain the underlying mechanisms of different SSL methods using a hierarchical VAE.

### Weaknesses
Originality: the authors did not discuss prior VAE SSL work, such as [1, 4].

Quality: this is the biggest weakness of this paper. Despite the good efforts shown by the authors, many important technical details are missing. The details are in the Questions section.

Clarity: coupled with the last point, reading certain parts of the draft can be challenging as some terms are not clearly defined or certain steps are missing. The details are also in the Questions section.

### Questions
1. *Page 1, “but do not fit its posterior due to their discriminative nature”*
* It is unclear how to define “fit” and why due to the discriminative nature.

2. *Page 5, “and for any $z \in \mathcal{Z},$ a distribution $p(x|z)$ is implicity defined by the probabilities of samples mapping to it $\{ x \in \mathcal{X} | f(x) = z \}$”*
* It is unclear what it means to be “implicitly defined by the probabilities of samples mapping to it”. This is a vague statement without mathematical backing.

3. *Page 5, “Hence geometric properties of representations implicitly correspond to latent probabilistic assumptions.”* 
* The authors could have shown theoretically rigorous proof to show this. And it is unclear what specific geometric properties the latent probabilistic assumption induced.

4. *Page 5, “And $z$ may be only identifiable up to certain symmetries”* 
* The authors may specify what “symmetries” mean exactly in terms of the identifiability results and may cite related works.

5. *Page 5, “and insight into the information captured by representations from their regenerations”*
* The reviewer is not sure this claim is valid without further explanation; why do generative models have better insights into the information captured by the representation? It is better to define the “information” here, as in SSL literature, there are numerous works studying the information the representation captures (some of which the authors rightfully cited) [5-9].

6. *Page 5, “Note that if the variance of each $p(z|y)$ is low relative that of $p(z)$, this fits with the notion that contrastive methods ‘pull representations of related samples together and push those of random samples apart.’”* 
* It would be much more valid if the authors showed proof of this. Also, it is not clear how to define rigorously “fits with the notion,” e.g., via asymptotic analysis. And how to quantify “low relative that of p(z)” is unclear.

7. *Page 5, “Thus, the model (Equation 4) justifies representation learning methods that heuristically perform clustering”.*
* It is unclear how it is justified. Factorizing $p(x)$ into the form of Equation 4 is a good start, but it did not justify why heuristic clustering methods are working well or necessarily capturing $p(x)$ well, e.g., through a tight error bound.

8. *Page 6, “samples of each class differ only in style (and classes are mutually exclusive) this collapse leads to style-invariant representations.”* 
* Despite correct intuition, this statement is, in general, very strong; Dosovitskiy et al. did not explicitly claim anything about the style vs. semantic information in the representations, and the authors did not cite any other work supporting this claim nor specify any assumptions.

9. *Page 6, “Under softmax cross entropy loss for mutually distinct classes (cf mixed membership), all representations of a class $y$ converge to class parameter $w_y$.”*
* It is quite unclear what “representations converging to class parameter” means without any additional context. Also, the authors did not show any convergence analysis.

10. *Page 6, “In expectation, $z^T z’$ for stochastically sampled $z’$ of the same class approximates $z^T w_y$, without the need to store $w_y$.”*
* It is not mentioned at all why it $z^T z’$ approximates $z^T w_y$, and what “store $w_y$” means.

11. *Page 6, “In effect, representations are comparable to those learned by softmax, subject to unit length constraint.”: the authors may clarify how to define “comparable.”* 
* It may be helpful to at least cite related work directly, or show empirical evidence to show under what tasks the representations are comparable.

12. Typos: Eq.(5) the support could be simply $y$ for the last integral, and in the paragraph below Eq.(5) the lower bound should be $\log p_{\theta}(z) \geq \int_{y} \mathbf{q_{\phi}(y|z)} \log \frac{p_{\theta}(z|y)p(y)}{q_{\phi}(y|z)}$ (the main result in Eq.(5) is correct).

### Summary
The paper provides a Bayesian perspective on self-supervised learning making an explicit connection to VAE-based models, thus enabling to incorporate properties inherent to both discriminative and generative approaches. The proposed framework highlights an underlying probabilistic graphical model for self-supervised learning (SSL) and a corresponding ELBO-like objective. Experiments are conducted on MNIST, FashionMNIST, CIFAR10 and Celeb-A, against SSL and VAE-based baseline models. The results highlights (i) that the proposed approach is competitive on simple datasets in terms of discrimination performance with SSL, with the advantage of retaining both information about content and style thanks to the generative aspect and (ii) that there exists a gap in discriminative performance between the proposed approach (also VAE models) and SSL on natural images (CIFAR-10).

### Strengths
1. The problem of unifying SSL and generative approaches is relevant and timely (**Relevance**)
2. The paper is clear and well-written (**Clarity**)

### Weaknesses
1. The paper omits important related work [1-6]. At a minimum, a discussion about the similarities and differences should be included (**Quality**).
2. Parts of the paper, especially on the background of self-supervised learning, are overly simplified and imprecise (for instance regarding the classes of SSL approaches), please refer to [3] and [7] (**Quality**).
3. Some of the main claims of the paper are not well-supported, especially the ones about the unification between SSL and generative approaches. Please refer to the general analysis in [3] and [4]. The novelty and theoretical contribution is somewhat limited, perhaps lying in specializing the existing framework (GEDI in [3] and [4]) to the VAE setting (**Novelty**).
4. While the experimental analysis provides evidence on the benefits of the proposed unification, the conclusions drawn from the experiments are rather limited confirming what has been already observed partly in [8] and in [3,4] (**Significance/Novelty**). Perhaps, the authors should focus on deepening the analysis on the existing gap observed on natural images (CIFAR-10), in order to improve in terms of significance and novelty.
5. The experimental analysis is missing a comparison with other existing generative and discriminative models [3] and [4] (**Quality**).

**MINOR**

In Section 4.2, all conditional densities should be explicitly defined.

### Questions
1. Can you please discuss the similarities and differences between the above-mentioned references, especially [3] and [4]?
2. What are the main reasons behind the existing gap between VAE-like and SSL models observed on CIFAR-10?
3. What is the equivalent of the notion of “content and style” in natural images?
4. Can you please provide the definition of the conditionals introduced in Section 4.2?
5. What is the advantage of having a decoder compared to [3], [4], as this introduces additional computation?
