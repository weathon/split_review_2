## Abstract
In this work, we introduce a novel evaluation framework for generative models of graphs, emphasizing the importance of model-generated graph \emph{overlap}~\citep{chanpuriya2021power} to ensure both accuracy and edge-diversity. We delineate a hierarchy of graph generative models categorized into three levels of complexity: edge independent, node independent, and fully dependent models. This hierarchy encapsulates a wide range of prevalent methods. We derive  theoretical bounds on the number of triangles and other short-length cycles producible by each level of the hierarchy, contingent on the model overlap. We provide instances demonstrating the asymptotic optimality of our bounds.  
Furthermore, we introduce new generative models for each of the three hierarchical levels, leveraging dense subgraph discovery~\citep{gionis2015dense}. Our evaluation, conducted on real-world datasets, focuses on assessing the output quality and overlap of our proposed models in comparison to other popular models. Our results indicate that our simple, interpretable models provide competitive baselines to popular generative models. Through this investigation, we aim to propel the advancement of graph generative models by offering a structured framework and robust evaluation metrics, thereby facilitating the development of models capable of generating accurate and edge-diverse graphs.

### Summary
The paper discusses the introduction of a novel evaluation framework for generative models of graphs centered around model-generated graph overlap to capture both accuracy and edge diversity. It is based on the theoretical analysis of a hierarchy of graph generative models that analyze the theoretical bounds on short-length cycles (though the paper focuses on triangle counts in the theoretical analyis and other cycles in the experiments) production based on model overlap. This analysis is done concerning three types of models: node-independent, fully independent, and node-independent models. The paper also introduces new generative models. The experiments measure the quality and overlap of the proposed models and a comparative evaluation against six models over 8 characteristics is performed using 8 real networks and 1 synthetic scenario. The proposed models show competitive performance.

### Strengths
The paper is interesting from at least three perspectives. First, it is good to have a formalization for independence, independence that is not reliant on the mechanics of the generative model and thus could be applicable in a broader sense. However, this is not totally new as there are existing approaches such as exchangeability (node and edge) that provide insights concerning sampling order. Another interesting aspect of the paper is the idea of linking (in the theorems) the expected number of triangles with the overlap of two sampled graphs (expected number of shared edges). This could be very useful to provide greater control in clique generation on synthetic graphs (which is what is evaluated in the paper as well) among other benefits. A third interesting contribution is the proposed models. Although more clarity could be beneficial to the generative process. More specifically, the process of association probabilities to the locations within the graph (either adjacency matrix, locations, or edge lists) needs to be spelled out and better described.

### Weaknesses
There are a few things that could improve the paper. First, I am concerned about the cubic nature of the bounds. These seem to be very loose and it is hard to see how these can be used in practice, or even to provide insight about how to structure the generative process. Specifically, the bounds on triangle counts, which are central to the theoretical analysis, scale cubically with the number of nodes and linearly with the overlap, which seems quite loose. Given this subtlety, something that could facilitate seeing the applicability of the bounds would be to see some synthetic verifications but no experiments show the application of the bounds to verify their veracity of them. This issue is especially important for the case of edge-independent models (cubic in the product $n \cdot Ov(\mathcal A$)). Other things could be done to improve the paper. For instance, I think it is important to highlight the methodological complexity of using the bounds to achieve the target structure in the sampled graphs. Currently, Algorithm 1 has one line that describes MCDF and a couple that describes MCEI and MCNI while most of details are not fully detailed in the main body of the paper.  That is, as I mentioned before, the process of association probabilities to the locations within the graph could be further clarified. Finally, identifying cycles can be computationally expensive and a scalability analysis of the method could be useful.

### Questions
In addition to the questions I wrote in the weaknesses section, I have the following doubts:

What is the cost of a growing number of nodes to the technique proposed for bounding the number of triangles?

What is the cost of the proposed models as the number of nodes grows?

How do you link the bounds to determine what edges have to be sampled to achieve a target structure?

### Summary
This paper presents an evaluation framework for graph generative models leveraging the graph overlap, which ensures both accuracy and edge-diversity. Also, they provide proofs the bounds of number of triangles and other short-length cycles based on the model overlap. Finally, they categorize graph generative models into three categories: : edge independent, node independent, and fully dependent models and provide new generative models for each category.

### Strengths
1. Proved the triangle count bounds for each generative model category leveraging overlaps.
2. Presented simple graph generative models without using complex deep generative model architecture.

### Weaknesses
1. Three categorizations for graph generative models cannot include the most recent generative models. Can you give more examples of recent generative models (e.g., GDSS, GraphARM, DiGress, etc.) that fit the proposed categorization?
2. The definitions for EI, FD, NI models are vague, and a more formal definition for categorization is needed. For instance, is the definition of FD model formal? It’s hard to understand what “the generative models allow for any possible distribution A” means.
3. A detailed explanation of the strength of using overlaps for graph generative models is missing. The authors emphasize that accuracy and diversity are key characteristics to evaluate the graph generative models but it’s hard to understand why overlap can be a good evaluation framework.
4. Lack of comparison to commonly used metrics such as MMD or V.U.N. MMD and V.U.N is the most popular evaluation metric for graph generative models. Still, I cannot find any comparison of overlap to current evaluation metrics for graph generative models.

### Questions
1. Why do we need bounds or theoretical limits on the number of triangles and other short-length cycles? I cannot understand the reason for the existence of the boundary and their proofs.
2. Hard to understand the key contribution of this paper. Is it right that the proposed evaluation framework is to compare the overlap between generated graphs and test graphs?
3. Is triangle-based evaluation limited to the models that contain many triangles? For instance, for grid graph generation, can the proposed method capture the graph generation quality well?
4. What does the x-axis mean in Figure 2? I can briefly understand that the lines following the dotted line (True) are desirable but cannot understand what Figure 2 means exactly.

### Summary
This paper proposes a new framework for generative models for graphs. Given an input graph $G_i$, this framework provides three model types such that, for a fixed planting probability $p$ and a fixed model type, it outputs a random graph $G_p$ with the degree sequence that is expected to be the same with $G_i$. $G_p$ is expected to have as many as similar statistics to $G_i$, e.g., normed number of small cliques and small cycles, while keeping the edge diversity that is measured by the overlap of this random graph model. The model types include edge independent (EI), node independent (NI) and fully dependent (FD) models, which is a hierarchical categorization of random graph generative models. Theorems 1-3 provide upper bounds of the expected number of triangles in terms of overlap parameter for these three models, respectively. The experimental results on several real datasets and a synthetic dataset demonstrate the superiority of this method.

### Strengths
(1) The three hierarchies of graph generative model are interesting and worth further study.

(2) The theoretical results for the upper bounds and the tight examples of expected triangle counts for three model types are novel.

### Weaknesses
 (1) Overlap seems not to be a good meausre for diversity of small graphs since it does not take isomorphism of graphs into account. Specifically, two graphs could have a high edge overlap but be structurally very different if their nodes are permuted. This makes the overlap metric insufficient for capturing the true diversity of graph structures.

(2) The effectiveness of this method on large graphs is unknown. The current experiments are limited to relatively small graphs, and it's unclear how the proposed models would perform on graphs with tens of thousands or millions of nodes and edges, which are common in real-world applications. The computational cost of finding maximal cliques could also become prohibitive for large graphs.

(3) The practical use of these models such as those introduced in the first paragraph of this paper is not clear. While the paper presents a theoretical framework, it lacks concrete examples of how these models can be applied to solve real-world problems. The connection between the theoretical results and practical applications needs to be strengthened.

### Questions
(1) How do you select maximal clique one by one in Algorithm 1? Is there overlap between two max cliques?

(2) If the input graph is sparse enough such that the connectivity is weak (for example, most node degrees are 1 or 2), then intuitively, the sampled graph $G_p$ will be broken up seriously. Even after adding a sampled second graph $G_r$, how does Algorithm 1 guarantee the statistics of $G_u$?

(3) Why the statistics results of GraphVAE are missing in Figures 3-6 and 9?

(4) How do you generate the small subgraphs of benchmarks in Table 2? Is there a unified approach for this?

(5) How large a graph can this method apply to? Do the experiments not use large datasets just because it is difficult to verify the results?

(6) Is there manifest applications of your framework in practical use, e.g., spread in social for financial networks or drug discovery?

### Summary
The paper categorizes generative models into three types of complexity: edge independent, node independent, and fully dependent. For each type and given the overlap of the graph model, the paper analyzes the upper bound in the number of triangles, obtaining a relation among them (EI, NI, and FD). The paper also proposes new generative models for each type of model based on a common algorithm.

### Strengths
The paper is original and of high quality. It proposes theoretical bounds considering the overlap of edges in generative models. The demonstrations of the theorems seem fine. The paper is also well-written and clear, especially the introduction. It is also significant regarding this specific topic.

### Weaknesses
The first phrase of the paper is misleading. It says: "we introduce a novel evaluation framework for generative models of graphs", but there is no evaluation framework. 

Regarding the theoretical proposition, I do not have major concerns, but the generative models and results can be improved.

It is not clear the relation between the generative model with the theoretical contribution. The paper mentions: "We shift our focus towards empirically evaluating the real-world trade-off between overlap and performance across several specific models on real-world networks.". So, it seems a completely different paper. 

The proposed models are trivial, so it does not seem to be an important contribution.  There is no training algorithm for p, and the search of the hyperparameter is a grid search. 

As can be observed in the results, the models can not replicate the characteristics with low overlap. So, it does not seem to fulfill the second characteristic mentioned in the paper "A should exhibit low overlap". This is even worse with the other networks. 

The details of the experiments are in the appendix, rather than the main paper.

### Questions
I suggest separating the two contributions. Personally, while I enjoy the first part of the paper, the generative model seems to be something that could lead to the rejection of the paper.
