## Abstract
Reliably capturing predictive uncertainty is indispensable for the deployment of machine learning (ML) models in safety-critical domains. The most commonly used approaches to uncertainty quantification are, however, either computationally costly in inference or incapable of capturing different types of uncertainty (i.e., aleatoric and epistemic). In this paper, we tackle this issue using the Dempster-Shafer theory of evidence, which only recently gained attention as a tool to estimate uncertainty in ML. By training a neural network to return a generalized probability measure and combining it with conformal prediction, we obtain set predictions with guaranteed user-specified confidence. We test our method on various datasets and empirically show that it reflects uncertainty more reliably than a calibrated classifier with softmax output, since our approach yields smaller and hence more informative prediction sets at the same bounded error level in particular for samples with high epistemic uncertainty. In order to deal with the exponential scaling inherent to classifiers within Dempster-Shafer theory, we introduce a second approach with reduced complexity, which also returns smaller sets than the comparative method, even on large classification tasks with more than 40 distinct labels. Our results indicate that the proposed methods are promising approaches to obtain reliable and informative predictions in the presence of both aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty in only one forward-pass through the network.

### Summary
This paper presents a new approach to conformal prediction that makes use of non-conformity scores derived from the Demster-Shafer (DS) theory of evidence. Specifically, the authors train a network to minimize a loss based on matching DS-based plausibility and belief scores, that are assigned to all sets of possible outcomes (i.e., $2^{|\mathcal{Y}|}$ for classification). They also derive a more computationally friendly variation, that only assigns plausibility scores directly to $n$ singleton outcome sets. Empirically, the authors show that these scores can achieve smaller set sizes when plugged into a conformal prediction framework.

### Strengths
I found the discussion of the Dempster-Shafer theory of evidence interesting, and an appealing approach to disentangling aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty. It is also nice that it is relatively simple to implement for any low-cardinality classification problem (or higher cardinality with the authors' proposed simplification in Eq. (9)). The empirical results seem strong with respect to reducing set size, especially when exposed to perturbations at inference time. That said, I'm still not exactly clear as to what the true factors leading to its success are (see questions), and they are not compared to the strongest baselines.

### Weaknesses
I find the motivation of the paper hard to follow throughout, and lost the thread somewhat when it took a turn to considering CP and evaluating the reduction in set size vs. distinguishing epistemic from aleatoric uncertainty. While I liked the basic idea of Dempster-Shafer theory and its interpretation w.r.t. epistemic vs. aleatoric uncertainty, these advantages seem lost when only measuring set size. It seems that such an uncertainty framework is better used when epistemic vs. aleatoric uncertainty quantification is explicitly called for, such as in applications like active learning.

With respect to only measuring set size, this plausibility function simply reduces to another conformity measure, and it would be good to compare it to more competitive measures like RAPS, APS, conformalized bayesian outputs, or conformal methods such as jackknive+ that can adapt to changes in the calibration set by training.

Some other minor comments:
- In line citations are poorly formatted (should use \citep)
- The shadow fonts for p(A), p(B), P(C) are fairly strange (use normal font?)

I'm a bit confused as to why the n-dim DS classifier handles epistemic uncertainty better than the softmax classifier, especially as demonstrated in Figure 3. As noted in the text, the n-dim classifier loses the ability to distinguish between aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty (since uncertainty is only able to be measured on the singletons, vs the larger sets). I understand that the softmax classifier would be at least a normalized version of this, but I'm not sure why it would completely switch its predictions in a way that assigns mass to a class completely ignored by the n-dim one (i.e., the {1} set).

This also seems intimately related to why it does worse in noised settings, as rather than being equally distributed between classes {0} and {2} (which would be the case if the logits of the n-dim classifer where simply softmax'd), it significantly reduces the mass on {0} in favor of {1} for some reason---and this should be what results in the $(1 - \alpha)$ quantile being poor. So I'm still not clear on why exactly this model "can be expected to frequently attribute high probability to incorrect labels", and the n-dim one is not (which will also lead to large set sizes if all labels have high scores).

### Summary
This paper leverages the Dempster-Shafer theory of evidence (DST) to build a probabilistic set predictor from any classifier architecture. A probabilistic set predictor is a model that assigns probabilities to all possible subsets of outcomes. Two new losses to train such neural networks are introduced. Those are based on the concepts of belief and plausibility from DST. The output of such a model is combined with conformal prediction to produce calibrated set predictions. It is empirically shown that sets constructed with this method are on average smaller than those constructed with a basic classifier and conformal prediction suggesting that probabilistic set predictors from DST are better at quantifying uncertainty than basic classifiers.

### Strengths
* The paper is very clearly written and easy to follow. In particular, the background allows a reader who is not familiar with the Demptser-Shaffer theory of evidence to easily get in.
* The method is novel to me but I have limited knowledge of related works.
* Experiments are convincing.
* Developing new methods for efficient uncertainty quantification is of high significance. 
* The methodology is sound and I did not identify any flaws.

### Weaknesses
I didn't identify strong weaknesses in this paper.

A minor remark would be that in equation (2), there is a $\sum_{A \subseteq \Theta}$ and a $\forall A \subseteq \Theta$. Should the $\forall A \subseteq \Theta$ be removed? Also, should it be a sum over $2^\Theta$ ?

### Questions

### Summary
The paper introduces a new reliable set-valued classification approach. It is based on the Dempster-Shafer Theory, which aims to train a prediction function mapping from the sample space to a set of class labels (with dimensional $2^n$ where $n$ is the number of classes). A conformal prediction procedure is then applied to the so-called "plausibility" of singleton set of the ground true label to obtain the set-valued predictions.

### Strengths
The framework that the paper studies is new and has been understudied.

### Weaknesses
There is no study of the theoretical properties of the proposed method.

Some claims are not fully justified (see questions below.) This may be improved with a better presentation and an ablation study.

Some presentations are unclear (see questions below.)

1. On page 6, section 4: It stated "Our method promotes a basic classifier of any kind into a probabilistic set predictor h: X →2^Y that outputs a mass vector from DST, cf. Fig. 2. The function ˆh is expected to have the property that it assigns higher mass to larger sets for instances x with high epistemic uncertainty. In cases of high aleatoric uncertainty, ... For low predictive uncertainty, ..." How to enforce an off-the-shelf machine learning classifier to have these properties? Moreover, how to make sure that the resulting function has the property that $h(A)\le h(B)$ when $A\subset B$? It seems that a basic classifier has to be tailored to achieve this property. Later on it stated that the approach "is applicable to arbitrary network architectures". I am afraid that I am entirely sold on this.

2. On page 7, it stated that "Here, we propose a restriction useful for the common case of false negative control by interpreting
the outputs of the model as the plausibilities of the singleton sets directly and hence do not need to compute them in a post-processing step." I am confused on two fronts.

    2.1 The loss function in (8) involves the plausibility and belief outputs, which are computed from the mass (output of the basic classifier). To update the network, the gradient of the loss function has to be computed, which necessarily have to take the mass to the plausibility/belief computation into consideration. So it is not really a post-processing step, but rather a fairly integral step. Correct me if I am wrong.

    2.2. For the second approach, it stated that "The only adjustment to standard models in our second approach is that outputs are not normalized to 1." But later on the loss function is replaced as well. Do you mean that the basic classifier still has a $2^n$ dimensional output, but only $n$ components are used in the loss function (the rest are discarded), or do you mean that basic classifier has an $n$ dimensional output to begin with? If it is the latter case, then the difference between the two approaches are more substantial. Moreover, the second approach would not be related to the Dempster-Shafer Theory at all.

Moreover, if the "post-processing step" is removed for the second approach, then an updated graphic representation is needed in addition to  Figure 2, instead of the two approaches sharing the same figure. A dedicated figure may help clarify any confusion.

3. More to the second approach: I do not quite understand the role of the $\lambda$ parameter in loss function (9). Shouldn't both CE and MSE have a somewhat same/similar goal? If $\lambda=0$, then wouldn't the second approach reduce to a typical classification method? In this case, the only novelty in the second approach would be a half-new loss function with the CP in the end.

4. The procedure ends with the CP applied to the plausibility. Here the plausibility is used merely as a conformity score. One can't help wonder if the result is due to CP or due to the choice of the score. Can we achieve similar performance if CP is applied to the softmax score or any other score of a standard $n$-dimensional classifier ($n$ is the number of classes)? In reverse, an ablate study is needed to see how the methods perform without the CP method in the end.

### Summary
This paper proposes to perform the learning of calibrated belief functions, through the combination of an evidential classifier and conformal prediction. Adapted loss functions are proposed, and experiments show that the set size for a given confidence level is better for DS approaches.

### Strengths
+: an potentially important topic, which is combining the assessments of various facets of uncertainty with the idea of calibration, or in other words how to obtain well founded estimation of both so-called epistemic and aleatoric uncertainties. 

+: rather well-written as a whole.

### Weaknesses
- (*)Semantic positioning: the authors are not always really clear as their interpretation of belief functions, and this should definitely be clarified, as in the current work the semantic and the resulting belief functions can have an important impact in practical application. for instance, it is suggested in the manuscript that obtained belief functions may be subnormalised, but it is also mentioned that decision rules issued from a probability set interpretation could be used to deal with decision oriented problems. Clearly, these two statements (without further clarification about the positioning) are logically inconsistent, as one cnanot use the imprecise probabilistic interpretation with sub-normalised BF.

- (*)Focus on recent works on BF published in ML venues: the authors mention (multiple times) that BF was only recently applied to ML. This is rather true if authors means "have recently appeared in ML focused top-tier venues", but rather untrue if authors consider ML and statistical learning/inference as a field (and do not filter by venues). There is a huge literature on learning belief functions, and I would even argue that this is one of the main topic (with information fusion) on which belief functions has been applied (as opposed to other uncertainty theories, e.g., possibility theory that has mainly been considered for logical reasoning). The same is true for the "uncertainty quantification" community mentioned in P3, especially since "uncertainty quantification" or UQ for short covers a large group including classical risk analysis. My perception is that authors mean "Uncertainty quantification in ML top-tier venues for the past 5 years"... which is rather restricted as a span, IMHO.

- (*)Lack of connection with potentially relevant streams of work: I would say that the current proposal should at least make a clear positioning with respect to two lines of work: the first one is about obtaining calibrated belief functions, a topic currently championed by Ryan Martin (who recently linked his work to CP), and the second one is that of adapting loss functions to credal labels, i.e., labels described by a probability set (see recent works, including some published in top-tier AI venues, by Julian Lienen on this topic).

- (*)P1: authors mention instance-risk wise control, yet it is known (see "The limits of distribution-free conditional predictive inference") that obtaining full conditional coverage in a distribution-free setting is impossible. Whether authors are chasing that should be specified. 

- (*)P1: the part about epistemic/aleatoric is a bit loose. Imprecise data can definitely belong to epistemic uncertainty (and could be reducible in principle, as well as noisy data in the case where better sensors/measurement tools can be found), and I would question the idea that "non-optimal training" or "ill-chosen" hypothesis can be reduced by obtaining more data (even an infinite amount of data would not allow to change the hypothesis space, nor the fact that a learning procedure is sub-optimal).

- P2: I am a bit skeptical about the use of set-vaued predictions in real-time setting, as set-valued predictions typically beg for a post-processing of some kind, rather than e.g., pessimistic decisions that can be directly plugged in uncertainty estimates. So the argument/connection looks at least a bit weak/irrelevant to me.

- P3: it is strange to cite reject (Herbei/Wegkamp) just after a plea for conformal approaches, as if I am correct, the reject option proposed in this paper does not deal with calibration?

- P4: strictly speaking, a Bayesian approach would put a prior over every possible proability values (typically a Dirichlet distribution), who would be uniform in case of no experiments, and rather skewed in case of presence of observations. The critic done there rather corresponds to the need to consider second-order models (mention after by the authors), of which Bayesian approaches constitute an instanciation. So here again, I would say that the argument is not very well crafted.

- P5: while I agree that the full class set is always conservatively valid, it is not strictly valid in the sense sought by conformal prediction, that aims at turning equation (7) into an equality.

- (*)Whole section 4: this whole section is not detailed enough so as to make the whole approach reproducible (and a look at the appendices indicate that the information cxannot be found in them either). For instance, I cannot really understand from the text 1. what is the quantity that is conformalised and 2. what are the used scores to conformalise it. In particular, if the conformalised quantities are the belief function (as I think it is), how are obtained the necessary ground-truth allowing to guarantee calibration? What is the random quantity against which we conformalise? What are the links between these loss functions and the recently introduced credal loss functions?

- (*): P7: the claim that using belief could lead to a control of false positive would need to be exposed much more lenghtly. The connection is definitely not direct for the average reader, and I would say also for an expert reader.

- (*)Experiments: experiments mainly shows that the proposed approach results in sets of smaller sizes, however there are at least two critics about them. The first is that they do not compare to all the recent works aiming at producing set-wise predictions (and referenced by the authors), the second is that it is not possible to find in the current publication (including in the appendices) graphs showing whether the proposed methods do actually produce caibrated predictions (in the sense of Equation (7)).
