## Abstract
The success of recent text-to-image diffusion models is largely due to their capacity to be guided by a complex text prompt, which enables users to precisely describe the desired content. However, these models struggle to effectively suppress the generation of undesired content, which is explicitly requested to be omitted from the generated image in the prompt. In this paper, we analyze how to manipulate the text embeddings and remove unwanted content from them. We introduce two contributions, which we refer to as \textit{soft-weighted regularization} and \textit{inference-time text embedding optimization}.
The first regularizes the text embedding matrix and effectively suppresses the undesired content. The second method aims to further suppress the unwanted content generation of the prompt, and encourages the generation of desired content. We evaluate our method quantitatively and qualitatively on extensive experiments, validating its effectiveness. Furthermore, our method is generalizability to both the pixel-space diffusion models (i.e. DeepFloyd-IF) and the latent-space diffusion models (i.e. Stable Diffusion).

### Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of controlling the generation of unwanted content in text-to-image diffusion models by introducing two methods: soft-weighted regularization and inference-time text embedding optimization. These techniques effectively suppress undesired content and encourage the generation of desired content, with positive results demonstrated through quantitative and qualitative experiments on both pixel-space and latent-space diffusion models.

### Strengths
1. The introduction of "soft-weighted regularization" that effectively removes negative target information from text embeddings, improving the control over undesired content generation.

2. The method is more efficient than previous methods: no need for fine-tuning the generator and no collection of paired images.

3. An interesting and inspiring analysis is conducted in Section 3.2.

### Weaknesses
1. This work introduces some new matrix computations, such as the SVD in soft-weighted regularization and the attention map alignment in ITO. However, the authors do not discuss the additional computational overhead of these computations, specifically regarding the time and memory complexity introduced by these operations. The SVD, for instance, can be computationally expensive, especially for large matrices, and the attention map alignment process may also require significant resources, depending on the size of the feature maps. A detailed analysis of these costs is essential for understanding the practical applicability of the proposed methods.

2. In Tab. 1, the proposed method is outperformed by baselines on some metrics under certain settings. It would be better to analyze why this occurs, particularly in the real-image editing setting where the negative prompt baseline achieves a better IFID score. A more thorough investigation into the trade-offs between different metrics and the specific conditions under which the proposed method underperforms would be beneficial. Furthermore, the reasons behind the performance differences in the generated-image editing setting, especially when compared to ESD, should be explored in more detail.

### Summary
This paper focuses on a sub-question of image editing, suppress the generation of undesired content, and proposes improvements from two aspects. Firstly, after conducting an analysis on text embeddings post text encoder encoding, it is concluded that EOT is low-rank and contains a large volume of prior information. Therefore, it also includes the information desired to be suppressed during the image editing process. Consequently, the first improvement proposed is to suppress the negative information in the text embedding to restrain its expression during the generation process. The second enhancement optimizes the attention map during the inference process to be as close as possible to the information to be preserved, while distancing from the unwanted information. Judging by the results, optimal outcomes were achieved on most datasets.

### Strengths
1. The analysis of the information components within text embedding provides certain guidance for subsequent T2Anything related research.
2. Judging by the results presented in the paper, it has achieved a rather precise suppression of information from the text, also outperforming previous works on numerical indicators.
3. There is no need for additional data training; any existing T2I model can be utilized.
4. The logic of the work is clear, and the exploratory part of the experiment is plentiful.

### Weaknesses
1. From the algorithmic perspective, both improvement points are existing methods, and thus lack a certain level of novelty.
2. This method requires gradient back-propagation during the inference process. Considering memory and time consumption, it doesn't seem as efficient as truly training-free methods like P2P.

### Questions
1. In the comparative experiments, it would be beneficial to specifically list the time and memory consumption ratios of this method compared to other methods, as this is necessary for a more application-oriented task.
2. In the first phase, this method uses coefficients to adjust the size of the negative information matrix to suppress the expression of negative information. If the singular value decomposition method is not employed, but instead, the entire matrix is multiplied by an attenuation factor, how would that affect the image editing results?
3. From Table 3, it seems that 'the negative target prompt suppression loss' plays the most significant role. What would be the effect if only this loss is considered without incorporating any other improvements?

### Summary
Aiming at supressing specific subjects from generated or real images, this work explores the hidden information of [EOT] embeddings in depth. Base on the discoveries, the soft-weighted regularization and inference-time text embedding optimization are proposed, enabling image editing without training or fine-tuning any large diffusion model. This light-weighted methology is effective and can be adapted to many applications, thus I believe it gives a solid and valuable contribution. The organization and phrasing of the article is also clear and easy to understand.

### Strengths
This light-weighted methology is effective and can be adapted to many applications, thus I believe it gives a solid and valuable contribution. The organization and phrasing of the article is also clear and easy to understand.

### Weaknesses
The diffusion model is a hot topic in machine learning and computer vision community. The differences should be further highlighted.

### Questions
With this methodology, we can remove subjects from an image or add subjects to it. Is it possible to change one subject to another in one go? For example, can we change the “toothbrush” in “Girl holding toothbrush” image to a “pen”?

### Summary
This paper proposes a method to eliminate side effects from padding promt tokens. 1. First it reveals that some side effects are hidden in the padding tokens, then it proposes an SVD based method to remove the side effects from the padding tokens. 2. It proposes a negative target prompt suppression loss to weaken the attention of the negative target in the prompt, 2. It proposes a positive target prompt preservation loss to avoid mistakenly suppressing positive targets in the prompt.

### Strengths
1. The analysis of the hidden semantics in padding tokens is interesting. 
2. The design of the positive preservation and negative suppression losses are intuitive to understand.

### Weaknesses
1. I'm not totally convinced that semantics in padding tokens have so much impact. My own empirical experience is that the padding tokens usually have very small attention scores (=> close to 0 attention probabilities) compared to meaningful tokens, and thus their semantics, if any, add little to the image features. Though, due to the large number of padding tokens, it might accumulate to somewhat significant impact, esp. when the prompt is short. This needs more systematic experiments to confirm, e.g. a diagram of the padding token impact w.r.t. the prompt length, where the prompts are randomly drawn from a pool.
2. All the padding tokens are derived from the same input word embedding, and only differ in the positional encoding added to the word embedding. If you want to extract the main semantic component, why not take a simple mean of the padding embeddings? Why using SVD is advantageous?

### Questions
1. We know cross attention consists of the attention map and the value recombination (output = v*attn). Even if the attention map values are largely suppressed, the undesired semantics may still slip into the image features through the value recombination. Have the authors tried to address this issue?
2. CLIPscores in Table 1 are a bit confusing. Are they the similarity between the images and negative prompts?
