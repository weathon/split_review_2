## Abstract
Multi-source domain adaptation (MSDA) addresses the challenge of learning a label prediction function for an unlabeled target domain by leveraging both the labeled data from multiple source domains and the unlabeled data from the target domain. Conventional MSDA approaches often rely on covariate shift or conditional shift paradigms, which assume a consistent label distribution across domains. However, this assumption proves limiting in practical scenarios where label distributions do vary across domains, diminishing its applicability in real-world settings. For example, animals from different regions exhibit diverse characteristics due to varying diets and genetics.

Motivated by this, we propose a novel paradigm called latent covariate shift (LCS), which introduces significantly greater variability and adaptability across domains. Notably, it provides a theoretical assurance for recovering the latent cause of the label variable, which we refer to as the latent content variable. Within this new paradigm, we present an intricate causal generative model by introducing latent noises across domains, along with a latent content variable and a latent style variable to achieve more nuanced rendering of observational data. We demonstrate that the latent content variable can be identified up to block identifiability due to its versatile yet distinct causal structure. We anchor our theoretical insights into a novel MSDA method, which learns the label distribution conditioned on the identifiable latent content variable, thereby accommodating more substantial distribution shifts. The proposed approach showcases exceptional performance and efficacy on both simulated and real-world datasets.

### Summary
This manuscript studies the multi-source adaptation where the shifts occur in the latent space. The authors introduced two latent variables $z_c$ and $z_s$ as the causes of $x$ and $y$. They assumed that the conditional distribution $p_u(y\mid z_c)$ is invariant across domains while other distributions are allowed to be variant. Under this setting, they showed that the joint observed distribution is unidentifiable without further assumptions. Additionally, they proved that the latent variables are identifiable up to an invertible mapping under some regularity conditions. To estimate the components, they proposed a variational autoencoder type algorithm to learn each conditional distribution.

### Strengths
Overall, I think this is an interesting topic and agree with the authors’ opinion that most domain adaptation techniques have strict assumptions on the distribution shifts. This manuscript proposes a more general setting that allows the distribution of $p(y\mid x)$ and $p(y)$ to change across domains. In contrast, the Covariate Shift assumes $p(y\mid x)$ to be invariant across domains and the Conditional Shift assumes $p(y)$ to be invariant across domains. The proposed method outperforms the baseline models on the TerraIncognita dataset.

### Weaknesses
The main concern is that the justification of graph 1(c) is not clear. While the authors justify partial edge directions in Section 3, e.g., $z_c\rightarrow y$ and $z_c\rightarrow z_s$, it is not clear whether there is a real-world setting that fits this graph. Specifically, it would be nice to give a motivating example that clearly explains what each variable $(u,z_c,z_s,y,x)$ refers to and when $p_u(y\mid z_c)$ is invariant and other distributions are variant. The difference of $z_c$ and $z_s$ is not clear as well.

Proposition 4.2 shows the identifiability of $z_c$. However, from the result, it is not clear whether $p_u(y\mid z_c)$ is identifiable. Hence, it is not clear whether true $p_u(y\mid z_c)$ can be recovered from data.

$g_c$ and $g_{s_2}$ in Equation (2) are invertible function. In this case, it seems trivial to introduce variables $z_c$ and $z_s$ since Equation (3) can be rewritten as
$$
x=f(g_c(n_c), g_{s_2}(g_{s_1}(g_c(n_c)) + n_s))+\varepsilon
$$
It is not clear why introducing $z_c$ and $z_s$ is necessary if $g_c$ and $g_{s_2}$ are invertible. One could potentially merge $z_c$ and $n_c$ (and $z_s$ and $n_s$) and still perform the adaptation task. The intuition and technical reasons for introducing these additional latent variables are not well-justified. It is unclear if the graph would still be identifiable without them.

### Questions
what does the index $i$ and $j$ in Equation (1) refer to?

From Figure 2(b), it looks like $n_c$ and $n_b$ are observed variables as they are shaded. Seems like a typo?

### Summary
In practical scenarios, label distributions often exhibit variations across different domains, thereby constraining the applicability of existing methods that rely on covariate shift or conditional shift. In this paper, the authors introduce a novel paradigm called latent covariate shift (LCS), which brings about increased diversity and adaptability across domains. From a causal perspective, the paper presents a method to learn the invariant conditional distribution p_u(y|z_c), aimed at achieving a more nuanced representation of observational data. The method is shown to deliver remarkable performance and effectiveness on both simulated and real-world datasets.

### Strengths
1. The proposed paradigm, i.e., LCS, allows variable distributions to vary across different domains while ensuring that p_u(y|z_c) remains invariant, is interesting and also seems sound.
2. Empirical evaluation on synthetic and real datasets confirmed the theoretical results and the effectiveness of the proposed method, outperforming existing methods.

### Weaknesses
1.	The contributions of this paper are limited. While this paper introduces a different paradigm, it appears to still be a latent representation disentangle mechanism from a causal perspective.
2.	The authors propose a more versatile domain adaptation paradigm and construct iLCC-LCS based on it. However, the feasibility of their latent variable modeling approach relies on conditions made in Proposition 4.2, which are not adequately explained and ensured against potential violations. Specifically, the assumptions of non-linear ICA, while used in other contexts, require careful justification in this specific application, and the paper does not provide sufficient detail on how these assumptions are met or validated within their framework. This lack of justification weakens the theoretical foundation of the proposed method.
3.	Table 3 in APPENDIX underscores that the proposed method exhibits limited performance when confronted with smaller label distribution shift across domains. Some commonly used datasets, such as Digits-five, Office-Home, and DomainNet, were omitted. If the method struggles with simple cases, i.e., D_{kl}<0.3, it raises concerns about its applicability and effectiveness. The absence of results on these standard datasets makes it difficult to compare the proposed method with existing approaches and assess its generalizability.
4.	Recommend that the authors provide an overview diagram or a detailed description of the implementation of iLCC-LCS to enhance its intuitiveness and readability. The current description lacks sufficient detail for a clear understanding of the practical implementation.
5.	t-SNE can distort the high-dimensional geometry of embeddings. While it can help visualization, it's not suitable for evaluating the quality of embeddings. Could the authors consider employing numerical measures for this purpose?

### Summary
This paper proposed a causal generative model in the Multi-source domain adaptation scenario, which was based on a latent covariate shift paradigm that contains two latent variables, a content variable, and a style variable. Compared to existing methods, the proposed method additionally modeled the causal generation from the content variable to the style variable. The authors then provided the identifiability analysis regarding the content latent variable and implemented a VAE-based method for learning. Experiments on PACS and Terra Incognita data were conducted.

### Strengths
The considered problem is interesting.

### Weaknesses
This paper is highly incremental, and moreover, suffers from many technical flaws.

First, its causal graph, learning method, and identifiability analysis are very similar to existing works [1, 2]. The only difference may lie in the addition modeling of the causal generation from $z_c$ to $z_s$. However, this assumption may not be widely applicable. Particularly, in the Terra Incognita data and PACS data considered, the authors failed to elaborate why $z_c \to z_s$ (this is important, since without this edge, the causal graph is the same as [1]). Besides, the identifiability analysis is also a simple application of [3].

Second, I am not sure the identifiability result is right for me. In the derivation of Eq. (19), the authors exploited the d-separation between $n_s$ (or $\hat{n}_s$) and $y$ given $u$, however, this separation does not necessarily means $n_c$ only depends on $\hat{n}_c$, since the inclusion of $\hat{n}_s$ does not violate the dependency between $n_c$ and $y$ (given $u$). Besides, the parameterization of the variational posterior does not follow the dependency constraints implied in Fig. 2 (a). Specifically, given $x$, $n_c$ and $n_s$ are no longer independent, since $x$ is the collider in the path between $n_c$ and $n_s$. 

Last but not least, the compared baselines do not rely on the unlabeled data in the target domain (such as IRM), while it has been exploited in the term of $L_{ENT}$ (Eq. (9)). Without the ablation study, it is not clear whether the advantages come from this additional term. Besides, as the theoretical results have proven the identifiability of $z_c$, this term seems redundant.

### Summary
The authors propose a latent covariate shift paradigm to perform multi-source domain adaptation. They refer to a specific causal structure involving latent content and latent style variables, and demonstrate partial identifiability of the latent content variable. This then allows to adapt to a new target distribution, using the unlabaled target data. The authors show that their method performs well across simulated and benchmark data.

### Strengths
- Relaxing the assumptions of adaptation or generalization methods is an important problem. 
- The specific latent covariate shift proposed is novel, and the causal framing allows to corroborate prior experimental findings (e.g. the entropy term helped).
- The paper is overall clearly written.
- Multiple datasets are used to demonstrate the method.
- Multiple baselines are considered.
- The work is overall well situated in the literature.

### Weaknesses
 **Update**: I have read the response but still find the justification of the assumptions lacking. This is a common comment across multiple reviewers, and I believe I was a bit too optimistic on my score. I would suggest to include an impactful real-world application to show that these assumptions indeed make a difference (but I understand this was not feasible in the response timeframe).

- I found that one main piece missing related to the assumptions this specific graph is making. For instance, the authors try to relate $n_c$ to an original label $\hat{y}$. However, they use a specific distribution for $n_c$, and don't discuss the impact of this assumption on how applicable the graph is to real-world applications. Specifically, the assumption of a two-parameter exponential family for the latent noise variables $n_i$ is quite strong and its impact on the identifiability of $z_c$ is not thoroughly explored. The practical implications of this choice, especially when the true noise distribution deviates significantly from this family, needs further discussion. Moreover, the assumption that such noise can be automatically separated by the model needs more justification, especially considering the complexities of real-world noise distributions.
- Similarly, it is unclear to me how this graph relates to the causal or anti-causal tasks typically defined. For instance, how would the graph map to a segmentation task? I believe this relates to the assumption of a lack of direct influence between $X$ and $Y$. In particular, the absence of a direct edge between $X$ and $Y$ is a strong assumption that may not hold in many real-world scenarios, such as segmentation where the input image $X$ directly influences the segmentation mask $Y$. The authors need to address this limitation and explain how their model can be adapted or justified in such cases. The current explanation, which suggests interpreting graph nodes as distinct regions, lacks the necessary technical depth and practical examples to be convincing.
- I found the discussion missing, with no mention of limitations.
- While the obtained method is different, the current work can be related to that of Alabdulmohsin et al., 2023 [1], which also investigates latent shift. It would be great to discuss the $n$ and $z$ variables compared to the proxies in [1] and whether some cases would be more adapted to one method or the other, or whether the authors believe their method would be superior (and why).

### Questions
- I would suggest to frame the graph as a set of assumptions, rather than as another "view" of the MSDA problem. This would make the limitations of the work clearer.
- This could include the clarification on how this graph relates to typical causal and anti-causal tasks.
- Please add a discussion and mention the limitations of the work. For instance, how easy is it to train the VAE with the complex loss designed? Given that the entropy loss seems important, how much target data is needed to achieve a good model?

nit: please refrain from using superlatives. I felt that some of the adjectives describing the method were a bit optimistic, especially in the absence of a proper discussion.
