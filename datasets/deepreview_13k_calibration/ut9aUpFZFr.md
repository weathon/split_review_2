## Abstract
We introduce **CO**mmunity **IN**formed graph embedding**s** (COINs), for accelerating link prediction and query answering models for knowledge graphs. COINs employ a community-detection-based graph data augmentation procedure, followed by a two-step prediction pipeline: node localization via community prediction and then localization within the predicted community. We describe theoretically justified criteria for gauging the applicability of our approach in our setting with a direct formulation of the reduction in time complexity. Additionally, we provide numerical evidence of superior scalability in model evaluation cost (average reduction factor of 6.413 $\pm$ 3.3587 on a single-CPU-GPU machine) with admissible effects on prediction performance (relative error to baseline 0.2389 $\pm$ 0.3167 on average).

### Summary
The draft presents a method to accelerate the knowledge graph single-hop tail query answering by hierarchical prediction from community detection. It shows that predicting relations between communities/clusters can be pretty accurate (for some embedding methods). So, to predict a tail query, we can avoid querying every node and instead predict the cluster and the node inside the cluster. Further, the authors decompose the embedding to model into "inside-cluster," "outside-cluster," and "inter-cluster" and blend them in the loss function. They show that the proposed method is pretty promising: when well-configured, it didn't decrease the evaluation metrics and is times faster than the naive all-node prediction.

### Strengths
The draft verifies the assumption that cluster hierarchical prediction may be much easier than node prediction and has commercial potential to accelerate tail query answering. It compares multiple embedding methods in the framework and does a set of ablation studies on the hyper-parameters, including the resolution parameter used in the modularity maximization. It is good to see that the community detection algorithm works in knowledge graph domains. Hierarchical prediction methods are well-known and sometimes required in extreme classification and nearest-neighbor queries. In knowledge graph prediction, it's mostly considered an engineering hack, but the draft verifies the assumption in the selected datasets.

### Weaknesses
However, the paper is not polished enough in mathematical rigor, typos, and organization. More possibly, it wasn't proofread before a hasty conference submission. This happens, but there are too many bugs to fix. And even if we remove all the mathematical-related parts, the experiments need to be stronger to be a pure evaluation paper. Thus, I suggest to reject the draft, and the detailed weakness is listed below.

First, The proposition doesn't prove the author's remark. For proposition 1 (equation 2), proving the lower bound on runtime didn't prove that your algorithm is better. I may show a lower bound of zero, and it says nothing. You need to prove the tighter upper bound for your optimized cluster size. The current upper bound is simply trivial, and I see it's possible to make your lower bound an upper bound (just substitute the values). For proposition 2, equation 3 simply moves the left-hand side to the right-hand side. You need to specify the scenario and quantify the "expected time to a correct answer" in your proposition. Also, I need clarification on why the derivation is related to Prop 1 (with a missing constant 2). It should be simply "Our method is better when ratio A is better than ratio B" in the derivation.

Second, you cannot control the cluster size of the community detection algorithm. Tuning the resolution parameter changes the number of clusters, but the size of each cluster depends on the graph structure and cannot be easily homogenized. There might be communities of a few nodes, and there might be a community consisting of 1/4 of the nodes. So, the analysis is actually "acceleration at the best case." The result is okay from a practical perspective, and showing good acceleration results is good enough.

Finally, the experiments don't support your claims in the introduction. All the 3 traditional datasets the authors tried can be run within hours or minutes on a single desktop. The experiments did show acceleration (in terms of vector evaluations), but the result doesn't support scalability compared to the scales in experiments from DistDGL or SMORE.

### Questions
Major questions:
1. (Algorithm 2 line 11) The $L$ function is actually implicitly parameterized by the graph structure and the negative-sampling methods. However, there are now three graphs: the community graph the intra- and inter-community graph. So when will each be used in the loss function? And what's the difference in sampling? For example, the node $\omega$ won't appear in the testing set but has many edges. How are they integrated?
2. (item 4 in page 5) Usually, the loss function is not convex to the embeddings. And there's no info on the refinement used.
3. (item 2 in page 5) The big-O notation is wrong. We always need to sweep through all embeddings.
4. (Sec 2.3.3 must have... be minimal) Modularity maximization (the Leiden method) doesn't purely minimize the inter-group edges.
5. (Sec 3.1) What's the purpose of adding the $\omega$ node?

Minor issues:
1. (Definition 3) citation.
2. (Definition 4) $\subseteq$ instead of $\in$
3. (Def 4 & 5) The "maximized" argument conflicts with the loss function.
4. (Sec 2.3.1) citations.

### Confidence
2: You are willing to defend your assessment, but it is quite likely that you did not understand the central parts of the submission or that you are unfamiliar with some pieces of related work. Math/other details were not carefully checked.

### Summary
This paper studies a graph representation that takes clustering/coarsening information into account. The proposed algorithm partitions the vertices into a smaller number groups, and builds the embedding from a combination of inter and intra cluster objectives. The paper gives some bounds on the performances of this scheme, and experimentally shows a speed up factor of 4~10 plus slight improvements in prediction qualities.

### Strengths
The proposed scheme is natural, and the performance gains obtained are significant. Most other high performance embedding schemes I'm aware of directly go to continuous / geometric representations. Having a more graph theoretic intermediate stage feels useful for both designing faster algorithms and better leveraging graph structures.

### Weaknesses
The theoretical justifications are mostly limited to the running times, and don't seem to go into details about why the prediction estimates obtained are also better. Specifically, the paper lacks a rigorous analysis of how the clustering step impacts the quality of the final embeddings. While the speedup is significant, it's unclear if the improved prediction quality is a direct result of the proposed method or an artifact of the specific datasets used. A more detailed analysis of the objective function, showing how the inter- and intra-cluster objectives interact to improve prediction, would be beneficial.

The data sets for the experiments are a bit different than those used in the graph embedding literature. For me it was a bit difficult to compare the experimental results here with other embeddings that I'm familiar with. More context on how to make such comparisons, especially on the importance of these benchmarks in the knowledge graph literature, would have helped a lot. It would be useful to see results on more standard graph embedding benchmarks, or at least a detailed explanation of why the chosen datasets are more appropriate for this specific task.

### Questions
As someone unfamiliar with knowledge graphs (my backgrounds are more in optimization / numerical methods), a direct comparison of the overall objectives optimized in the Leiden algorithm and this algorithm would be quite helpful. Otherwise I was only able to piece together the overall objective function from the pseudocodes, and had difficulties identifying the (black box) interactions with it.

### Summary
This paper proposes a clustering-based approach to accelerate knowledge graph inference tasks such as link prediction. The basic idea (like prior work) is there must be a clustering of entities that makes most of the relations intra-cluster. The proposed method learns embeddings for clusters and nodes, and at inference time compares the embedding for the query node to all cluster representatives, picks the best cluster and then compares against all the entities in that cluster.

The authors show significant speedup on some KG inference tasks with decent quality losses.

### Strengths
- Formalizes the clustering-based approach and shows that it has decent performance.
- Attempts at explaining when the new algorithm is helpful.
- The new method speeds up training because not all weights are updated in each training step.

### Weaknesses
Experiments are limited:
- More datasets should be evaluated, especially bigger ones like WikiKG90M-LSC. The current datasets, while standard, do not fully demonstrate the scalability of the proposed method. Evaluating on larger, more complex knowledge graphs is crucial to validate its performance in real-world scenarios.
- Trade-off between error, speedup and number clusters should be investigated. The paper lacks a systematic analysis of how the number of clusters affects both the computational speedup and the accuracy of the model. A detailed study is needed to understand the optimal number of clusters for different graph structures and sizes.
- Static min-cut algorithms (outside the end-to-end training) could be compared. The paper should compare the proposed end-to-end clustering approach with traditional graph partitioning algorithms like METIS, which could provide a baseline for evaluating the effectiveness of the learned clustering. This comparison is essential to understand if the end-to-end approach provides a significant advantage over existing methods.
- What's the relationship between cut size, speedup and performance? The paper does not explore the direct relationship between the size of the cut (number of edges between clusters), the resulting speedup, and the overall performance of the model. A detailed analysis of this relationship is needed to understand the limitations of the approach.

Missing literature
- Minimum cut literature studies the problem of reducing the number of inter-cluster relations. The paper should discuss and compare its approach with existing minimum cut algorithms and their applications in graph partitioning. This is important to contextualize the novelty of the proposed method.
- tf-GNN is another scalable GNN framework which uses sampling for large datasets. The paper should discuss and compare the proposed approach with other scalable GNN frameworks, such as tf-GNN, which also address the challenge of training on large graphs. This comparison is crucial to understand the advantages and disadvantages of the proposed method.



### Questions
- For dense graphs, the cut will be really poor. FB15K is the densest graph you considered. How dense is it per relation type? Is the cut quality poor here? Does that explain some of the results?
- Did you consider producing different clusters for different relation types? Are the "optimal" clusters correlated?
- What's the breakdown of speedup for training and inference?
