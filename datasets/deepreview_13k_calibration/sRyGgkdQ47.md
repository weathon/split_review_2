## Abstract
Batch Normalization (\BN) is widely used in {centralized} deep learning to improve convergence and generalization.
However, in {federated} learning (FL) with decentralized data, 
prior work has observed that training with \BN could hinder performance and suggested replacing it with Group Normalization (\GN).
In this paper, we revisit this substitution by expanding the empirical study conducted in prior work. Surprisingly, we find that \BN outperforms \GN in many FL settings. The exceptions are high-frequency communication and extreme non-IID regimes. We reinvestigate
factors that are believed to cause this problem, including the mismatch of \BN statistics across clients and the deviation of gradients during local training. We empirically identify a simple practice that could reduce the impacts of these factors while maintaining the strength of \BN. Our approach, which we named \Ours, is fairly easy to implement, without any additional training or communication costs, and performs favorably across a wide range of FL settings. We hope that our study could serve as a valuable reference for future practical usage and theoretical analysis in FL.

### Confidence
4: You are confident in your assessment, but not absolutely certain. It is unlikely, but not impossible, that you did not understand some parts of the submission or that you are unfamiliar with some pieces of related work.

### Summary
This work focuses on the popular batch normalization method in FL, especially when the data is non-IID. Authors investigate the case where frequent communication is made between servers and clients, and reveal the biased gradient issue in local training. Experiments on BN and GN are conducted to show the empirical evidence. In the meanwhile, authors proposed a two stage training method to improve the performance of BN in various FL problems. Further, it is pointed out that the issue of BN does not occur when communication frequency is low.

### Strengths
1. This paper studies an important phenomenon in FL. It is widely observed in literature that BN can degrade performance in FL setting. However, most of the works find fix to the issue through changing the normalization method, e.g group normalization. This work focuses on the original method and conducts a comprehensive investigation on the vanilla BN, which provides a deep insight to the issue itself.
2. The experiment results are convincing and encouraging. Authors focus on two aspects of BN in FL: Biased gradient and communication frequency. It is pointed out that BN fail to have reasonable performance only when communication between server and clients is frequent. The experiment directly verify the conclusion.

### Weaknesses
1.  Some recent work also notices BN can degrade the performance of FL as well, e.g, Wang, Yanmeng, Qingjiang Shi, and Tsung-Hui Chang. "Why batch normalization damage federated learning on non-iid data?." arXiv preprint arXiv:2301.02982 (2023). This work contains comprehensive theoretical analysis of issue of BN and emphasizes that there exists deviation of gradient. However, authors do not include theoretical comparison with this work. Authors also mention that biased gradient can cause the failure of performance in FL, which is similar to the above work. Theoretical analysis is required to validate the conclusion.
2. Table 2 is an extreme case where single step of mini-batch SGD is performed. It is not surprising that such kind of high variance update can degrade the performance in distributed setting. More general setting should be considered to illustrate the issue of BN.
3. It is strongly suggested that specific algorithm is written in this paper. It is difficult to refer to equations to see the details.
4. The fix method is not novel. It sounds like an early stop for the local BN statistics and replacement with aggregated statistics in the second stage.

### Questions

5: You are absolutely certain about your assessment. You are very familiar with the related work and checked the math/other details carefully.

### Summary
In this paper, the authors try to investigate the reason why batch normalization cannot work well when integrated into training of Federated Learning. They find that the data heterogeneity would lead to unstable gradient estimation. A new batch normalization method named FixBN is proposed for federated learning. A series of experiments are conducted to evaluate the performance of the proposed method.

### Strengths
1.	The authors conduct extensive experiments to evaluate the performance of the proposed method. 
2.	This paper is well written and easy to read.

### Weaknesses
1.	This identified reason that “data heterogeneity would lead to unstable gradient estimation in federated learning” is to be expected and is also not new to the community.
2.	The proposed method is too straightforward and lacks technical depth. To be precise, adopts the original BN in the early stage of training and then fixes the BN layers. The authors are recommended to submit this paper to some workshops instead of the main conference. 

Therefore, the contribution of this paper is limited.

### Summary
This work investigates the performance degradation of Federated Learning (FL) when coupled with Batch Normalization (BN). Contrary to the belief that this degradation results from mismatch in BN statistics between training and testing, the study claims that the problem lies in the sensitivity of backward gradients to the mini-batch composition. To address this issue, a two-stage training strategy is proposed, which involves fixing BN statistics after an initial normal training phase. This approach is shown to yield consistent improvements over Group Normalization (GN) across various FL scenarios.

### Strengths
- The two-stage BN training strategy introduced in this study is noteworthy for its simplicity, while proving to be highly effective in enhancing FL performance.

- The empirical results presented offer substantial support for the superiority of BN/Fixed BN over GN in a wide spectrum of FL setups.

### Weaknesses
 - The study's exploration of the performance degradation in FL with BN remains primarily empirical. It would greatly benefit from a theoretical analysis of how FL aggregation influences the convergence of FL with BN, particularly in non-IID settings.
- The article falls short in providing a theoretical basis for the effectiveness of the two-stage BN training strategy in mitigating the degradation issue. A more in-depth examination of why the first stage's sensitivity to FL aggregation does not impede convergence and final performance would enhance the article's comprehensibility and credibility.

- The method's reliance on choosing when to fix the statistics during the remaining training is noted. However, the article does not address how this critical hyperparameter should be selected on the specific task.

### Summary
This paper aims to understand the failure of Batch Norm in federated learning and proposes a new fix for it.

--post rebuttal--

Thanks for your additional experiment! I'm just wondering why is FixBN better than FedBN in the non-iid case, and which non-iid case are you experimenting on? From FedBN if it's covariate shift then FedBN should perform quite well.

### Strengths
1. Batch normalization is a common technique in deep learning but it fails drastically in FL. This work proposes a simple fix using fixed global statistics.
2. The paper is clearly written and studies important problems in FL.
3. The experimental section is quite comprehensive covering several image and segmentation datasets.

### Weaknesses
1. This paper lacks theoretical analysis for why this simple fix would work for BN in FL. It only proposes intuitive explanation. The explanation provided, while plausible, does not delve into the mathematical properties of the optimization landscape or the convergence behavior of the proposed method. A more rigorous analysis, perhaps using tools from non-convex optimization theory, would significantly strengthen the claims.
2. Some references are missing. For example, [1, 2] study why BN fails in FL. [3] compares BN with GN and LN in with extensive experiments. Specifically, the paper does not discuss the nuances of how different normalization layers interact with varying degrees of data heterogeneity across clients, which is a key aspect explored in the missing references. The lack of discussion on the impact of local updates on the global model's convergence is also a significant oversight.
3. There is no comparison with FedBN (Li et al.), which also adapts BN to federated learning. Compared to all the previous works, I feel the contribution of this paper is limited. The absence of a direct comparison with FedBN, especially given its relevance, makes it difficult to assess the practical advantages of the proposed FixBN method. The paper should have included a thorough comparison, even if the methods are designed for slightly different settings, to provide a more complete picture of the landscape.
