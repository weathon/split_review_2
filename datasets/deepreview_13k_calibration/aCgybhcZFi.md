## Abstract
In this paper, we introduce and characterize the emerging area of representation engineering (RepE), an approach to enhancing the transparency of AI systems that draws on insights from cognitive neuroscience. RepE places population-level representations, rather than neurons or circuits, at the center of analysis, equipping us with novel methods for monitoring and manipulating high-level cognitive phenomena in deep neural networks (DNNs). We provide baselines and initial analysis of RepE techniques, showing that they offer simple yet effective solutions for improving our understanding and control of large language models. We showcase these methods can provide traction on a wide range of safety-relevant problems, including truthfulness, memorization, power-seeking, and more, demonstrating the promise of representation-centered transparency research. We hope this work catalyzes further exploration into RepE and fosters advancements in the transparency and safety of AI systems.

### Summary
This work introduces RepE, an approach for interpreting Neural Networks from a top-down perspective through their internal representations. It is two-fold: first, it explores how to read the internal state of a Neural Network, and second, how to control or edit its representation. The approach yields promising results in addressing safety-relevant problems, particularly in the field of Large Language Models (LLMs).

### Strengths
* The paper presents a well-motivated approach to enhancing the transparency and reliability of large language models (LLMs). The analogy drawn from neuro-imaging in cognitive science provides a fresh and insightful perspective.
* The proposed method is conceptually straightforward and intuitively appealing.
* The authors thoroughly investigate and improve their method through a series of carefully designed thought experiments and ablation studies. These experiments are both logically sound and firmly grounded in empirical evidence.
* The practical benefits of their method is clear. RepE can clearly improve the transparency of LLMs and prevent them from untruthful responses.

### Weaknesses
1. The paper's overall structure and order contribute to its poor readability. The content would benefit from a better balance between technical formality, such as formal definitions or problem formulation, and more intuitive explanations. Currently, the paper leans too heavily on motivations and visualizations.

* Specifically, Figure 2 takes up excessive space with repetitive examples. Moreover, the detailed methodology such as reading and controlling process is relegated to supplementary materials accessible through multiple layers of links. This makes it difficult to access and potentially hinders a reader's ability to gain a comprehensive understanding of the content. I suggest that the authors provide more detailed explanations of key concepts, such as reading vectors, controlling vectors and objective of reading and controlling process, both in a technical manner and in a more general, high-level way.

2. The paper's contributions are not clearly articulated. The Related Works section lacks a comprehensive technical comparison with prior works, making it difficult to distinguish the paper's unique contributions. I recommend that the authors clearly differentiate their work from existing approaches, particularly in terms of their methodology for reading neural networks' internal representations and controlling neural networks' outputs.

3. While the practical benefits of the proposed method are evident, the paper overlooks limitations of the approach. For instance, such as the general disadvantages of a "white-box" approach, such as the need for full accessibility to the LLM's, and the cost of collecting stimulus sets or generating contrastive examples, should be explicitly acknowledged. This limitation is particularly important given that the comparison is conducted against in-context, inference-only LLMs.

### Questions
1. Figure 1 (right) is unclear to me, and I did not find a satisfactory explanation in the paper. I would appreciate a clearer explanation from the authors.

2. In Table 1, I wonder the relative effectiveness of LAT compared to prior works on extracting internal representations of neural networks, not to the Heuristic method.

3. Additional related works that also involve research on editing the internal representations or weights of neural networks include [1] and [2]. I hope the authors can explain why these methods were not considered for use in RepE.

* [2] Inspecting and Editing Knowledge Representations in Language Models.

4. As mentioned in the Weakness section, I request a more detailed explanation and justification from the authors regarding the potential drawbacks of RepE compared to in-context learning (few-shots) methods. In particular, with reference to Figure 3, I question whether the performance gain over five datasets is significant, especially considering the assumption of accessibility to large language models (LLMs).

### Summary
This paper introduces an approach called representation engineering (RepE) which enables a better understanding of large language models. The authors showcase a wide range of applications of RepE, with a focus on honesty.

### Strengths
- As language models get larger, devising techniques that enable a better understanding of its dynamics are important for transparency and control. While most recent approaches have focused on mechanistic interpretability, this work breaks down the representation engineering approach which is top-down. The two approaches are contrasted in a clear way in the main text.
- A very extensive set of experiments are conducted, and the results support the authors' claims about the insightfulness of the proposed approach. The method provides clear boosts in accuracy on various benchmarks. 
- The Contrast Vector baseline is interesting and showcases an interesting ability to manipulate the model's honesty as well as other attributes. The demonstration of the lie detector monitoring tool is also interesting, and appears to be simple and practical.

### Weaknesses
1. While a lot of details are provided in the appendices, the method section is lacking and doesn't provide enough context to properly understand how the proposed methods are created, or how the method is applied. Specifically, the process of creating the contrast vectors is not sufficiently detailed. It is unclear what data is used to generate these vectors, how the positive and negative examples are selected, and what specific algorithms or techniques are employed to derive the final vector representation. The description lacks the necessary mathematical formulation or algorithmic steps to allow for replication or a deeper understanding of the method.
2. The authors focus on presenting the results from the honesty study in the main paper, and do a good job at dissecting them. However, providing a summary of the results from the numerous other applications could be helpful. The reader is left to navigate the appendix to understand the breadth of the method's applicability. A concise summary of the key findings and performance metrics across all applications would be beneficial for the reader to quickly grasp the overall impact of the proposed method.
3. There is no discussion of the limitations of the proposed method. This is a critical oversight, as every method has its constraints. For example, the method's reliance on a specific model architecture or the computational cost associated with generating the representation vectors should be discussed. Furthermore, the potential for the method to be sensitive to the choice of stimulus set or the possibility of introducing biases should be addressed. 
4. Figure 1 and 2 are not referenced in main text.

### Questions
- Given that representation engineering is an emerging approach, what are its current limitations? and what are future direction to improve this approach?

### Confidence
3: You are fairly confident in your assessment. It is possible that you did not understand some parts of the submission or that you are unfamiliar with some pieces of related work. Math/other details were not carefully checked.

### Summary
The authors propose to understand a network's computation and dynamics for honesty through representational analysis. Once the representation is characterized, the authors propose three tools to control or augment the model's output to improve its honesty.

### Strengths
- The motivation of understanding model's computation through representational analysis, similar to neuroscience, might benefit the deep learning community. 
- The approach to improve model performance using a lower dimension representation and developing suitable control techniques is novel.

### Weaknesses
 - Unclear implementation of RepE: While the authors have described the LAT and control baselines, it helps the reader to understand how these methods are implemented if the mathematical notations are included. Specifically, what model manipulations contribute to the performance increase in Table 1 & 2, and Figure 3? How do you exactly analyze the representations? What do the values as performance mean? The paper is written well as a descriptive or narration but omits details about how a pretrained model can be controlled "The tuned low-rank matrices can serve as controllers, which can be merged into the model weights." The exact mechanism of merging and how this affects the model's internal representations is not clear. For instance, are the low-rank matrices added directly to the existing weight matrices, or is there a more complex transformation involved? Furthermore, the paper lacks details on the specific layers targeted for manipulation and the rationale behind choosing those layers.


- Inappropriate manuscript style for ICLR: The conference manuscript is written in a style more suited for a journal publication rather than for ICLR. Most of the implementation details, results and network analysis are missing in the 9 pages and are left to the supplementary material. While the motivation of the manuscript is relevant, the manuscript is not informative enough as an ICLR proceeding. The core methodology, including the representational analysis and control mechanisms, should be detailed within the main body of the paper. The current structure makes it difficult to assess the novelty and validity of the approach without referring to the supplementary material.

- Minor: Figure 1 is unclear to describe the difference between the bottom-up (mechanistic) vs top-down (normative) approaches of explaining model computation. The classification of top-down as normative vs bottom up as mechanistic from computational neuroscience [1] seems to be in contradiction with the terminology used in the paper?


### Questions
- will the code to analyze pretrained models be publicly available?
