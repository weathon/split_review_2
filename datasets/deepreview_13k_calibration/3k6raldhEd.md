## Abstract
We study \emph{online learning} in episodic \emph{constrained Markov decision processes} (CMDPs), where the goal of the learner is to collect as much reward as possible over the episodes, while guaranteeing that some \emph{long-term} constraints are satisfied during the learning process.
    Rewards and constraints can be selected either \emph{stochastically} or \emph{adversarially}, and the transition function is \emph{not} known to the learner.
    While online learning in classical (unconstrained) MDPs has received considerable attention over the last years, the setting of CMDPs is still largely unexplored.
    This is surprising, since in real-world applications, such as, \emph{e.g.}, autonomous driving, automated bidding, and recommender systems, there are usually additional constraints and specifications that an agent has to obey during the learning process.
    In this paper, we provide the first \emph{best-of-both-worlds} algorithm for CMDPs with long-term constraints.
    Our algorithm is capable of handling settings in which rewards and constraints are selected either {stochastically} or {adversarially}, without requiring any knowledge of the underling process.
    Moreover, our algorithm matches state-of-the-art regret and constraint violation bounds for settings in which constraints are selected stochastically, while it is the first to provide guarantees in the case in which they are chosen adversarially.

### Summary
This paper studies the Markov devision processes with long-term constraints.  The paper formulates the constrained MDP as a linear programming problem based on the occupancy measure.  The reward and constraint matrix can be adversarially or stochastically chosen by the environment. A primal-dual algorithm is proposed to learn the policy under the long-term constraints under both adversarial and stochastic settings. The paper proves that for both adversarial and stochastic settings, the regret and constraint violation are all sublunar with $T$.

### Strengths
+ This paper considers CMDP with adversarial reward and constraints, which was not considered in other literature. 

+ A primal-dual algorithm is proposed to achieve sub-linear regret and constraint violation for CMDP under both stochastic and adversarial cases. The design of confidence set presents new challenges.

+ The paper is well-written and easy to follow.

### Weaknesses
 - The primal-dual framework is widely used to solve CDMP or constrained online optimizations. The sublinear regret and constraint violation can be proved in many adversarial settings of constrained online optimization [1].  Can the authors discuss more on the challenges to achieve provable regret and constraint violation bound in the considered setting?

- The paper only considers the tabular MDP which is simple. Can the authors discuss the possible generalization to continuous actions and/or continuous states?

- Although this paper has a theory taste, it would be better to have empirical results to evaluate the proposed algorithms.

### Questions
- The adversarial setting is about the adversarial reward and constraint matrices, but would it be possible to design an algorithm for adversarial transition kernel?

### Summary
This paper considers the online learning problem of episodic constrained MDP for T rounds, and provides the first best-of-both-worlds algorithm for CMDPs with long-term constraints. In other words, the proposed algorithm matches state-of-the-art regret and constraint violation bounds for settings in which constraints are selected both stochastically and adversarially. Specifically, the long-term constraints setting allows the agent to violate the constraints in a given episode while the cumulative violation is controlled by growing sublinearly in the number of episodes.

### Strengths
1. The online learning problem of CMDP is a fresh and important setting. And this paper achieves the first best of both worlds guarantee of such setting. 
2. The analysis of the parameter $\rho$ seems to be able to be applied in other best of both worlds problem. 
3. The mathematical proof (though I just skimmed several lemmas) is rigorous.

### Weaknesses
This paper does not have any specific weaknesses.

### Questions
1. Is it possible to achieve the best of both worlds guarantee for bandit feedback? Any conjecture? 
2. Is it possible to achieve the best of both worlds guarantee with logarithmic stochastic regret bound?

### Summary
The paper studies the online CMDP problem where the rewards and constraints can be selected either stochastically or adversarially. The authors propose a best-of-both-worlds algorithm for both settings. For the stochastic setting, the result matches the existing known result when a similar slater condition holds. When the condition doesn’t hold, all the bounds become $O(T^{3/4}).$ For the adversarial constraint setting, a competitive ratio result is provided, while the violation is $O(\zeta\sqrt{T}).$

### Strengths
The paper studies online learning in CMDPs with adversarial constraints. The proposed approach is well-presented, and the paper is easy to follow. The algorithm does not require knowledge of the Slater-like condition, and the theoretical results depend on the upper bound of the Lagrangian space, indicating the problem's difficulty under varying conditions.

### Weaknesses
 - The technical contributions appear somewhat limited, as the algorithm follows a standard framework in CMDPs, and its dependence on $\rho$ is highly motivated by prior work [1]. Specifically, the use of a primal-dual framework with projected gradient descent on the dual variables is a common approach. The novelty of the algorithm is not clearly established, and the dependence on the parameter $\rho$, which represents the feasibility slack, is a direct consequence of the Lagrangian formulation, as seen in prior work. The paper does not sufficiently demonstrate a significant departure from existing techniques.

- The term 'best-of-both worlds' is somewhat misleading. In the context of bandits and RL, 'best-of-both-worlds' typically implies achieving $\sqrt{T}$ regret in the adversarial setting versus $\log{T}$ regret in the stochastic setting. This paper only demonstrates a $\sqrt{T}$ rate in a fully stochastic setting when condition 2 holds. Furthermore, the 'best-of-both-worlds' literature in CMDPs is not discussed at all. Additionally, many algorithms can achieve zero constraint violations, or at least a violation that does not depend on T. Therefore it's unclear if this is the best achievable result. The claim of 'best-of-both-worlds' is not adequately supported by the results, as the stochastic setting only achieves a $\sqrt{T}$ rate under a specific condition, and the adversarial results are not significantly better than existing methods.

- All the theoretical results are standard, and the use of projection to bound the dual variable for boundedness is not surprising. The analysis relies on standard techniques for bounding the regret and constraint violation in online convex optimization. The use of projection to ensure the boundedness of the dual variables is a common practice, and the theoretical results do not offer significant novel insights into the problem. The analysis appears to be a straightforward application of existing techniques in the context of CMDPs.

- In the unconstrained case, several works have discussed bandit feedback and constraint violation without cancellation. However, the authors have not provided much insight into the challenges of removing these assumptions and studying the stronger setting. The paper does not address the practical challenges of bandit feedback and constraint violation without cancellation, which are important for real-world applications. The lack of discussion on these aspects limits the practical impact of the work.

### Questions
The regret bounds depend on condition 2. How is this related to the Slater condition, and which one is stronger? If they are not closely related, what happens if condition 2 doesn't hold but the Slater condition does? In such a case, your algorithm cannot achieve results of the same order as an algorithm using the Slater condition. How can we even say if it is the best of both worlds?

### Summary
This paper studies online learning in episodic constrained markov decision processes. They study the most general setting, where both the rewards and the constraints are chosen either stochastically or adversarially, and the transition is unknown to the learner. They provide the first best-of-both-worlds algorithm, where they can achieve optimal regret and constraint violation (in terms of the number of episodes) when constraints are selected stochastically, and provide the first guarantee when the constraints are chosen adversarially.

### Strengths
The paper is well written and easy to understand. The proposed algorithm is simple to implement and yet quite general and widely applicable. Moreover, their algorithm can achieve optimal regret bound and constraint violation (in terms of the number of episodes) when the constraints are chosen stochastically, which is the most common setting.

### Weaknesses
Both the algorithms and results in (Castiglioni et al., 2022b) and this paper look similar and the only difference I see is that this paper extends to MDP. So I am doubtful about the technical contributions of this paper. I would suggest the author highlighting the novelty of this work.



### Questions
1. What are the main technical contributions of this paper (other than extending (Castiglioni et al., 2022b) to MDP)?
2. Can your results be generalized to discounted MDP or Stochastic Shortest Path easily?
