## Abstract
\vspace{-2mm}

Diffusion models have attracted significant attention due to the remarkable ability to create content and generate data for tasks like image classification. 
However, the usage of diffusion models to generate the high-quality object detection data remains an underexplored area, where not only image-level perceptual quality but also geometric conditions such as bounding boxes and camera views are essential. 
Previous studies have utilized either copy-paste synthesis or layout-to-image (L2I) generation with specifically designed modules to encode the semantic layouts.
In this paper, we propose the \methodname, a simple framework that can flexibly translate various geometric conditions into text prompts and empower pre-trained text-to-image~(T2I) diffusion models for high-quality detection data generation.
Unlike previous L2I methods, our \methodname is able to encode not only the bounding boxes but also extra geometric conditions such as camera views in self-driving scenes.
Extensive experiments demonstrate \methodname outperforms previous L2I methods while maintaining 4$\times$ training time faster.
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to adopt diffusion models for layout-to-image generation with geometric conditions and demonstrate that L2I-generated images can be beneficial for improving the performance of object detectors.

### Weaknesses
Some results need to be discussed in more details. How to apply into the 3D domain deserves to be discussed. Please see questions below.

1. Inconsistent performance in some metrics. For example, FID with 512 setting is better in Table 2. The mAP metric for Ped and Cone is slightly lower in Table 3. Any discussions on this?

2. As claimed in Section 4.2.1, the proposed method achieves 4X acceleration in the training procedure, how is it measured?

3. The pipeline is quite straightforward with diffusion process in an encoder-decoder architecture. The results are impressive. What's the key ingredient? Why previous methods with more complicated design fail to achieve the performance?

Minor: catpion in Figure 2 (b), should be "utilized" to train.

### Summary
This paper proposes a method that utilizes a pretrained T2I diffusion model, e.g., Stable Diffusion, for generating images given the box layout. Also, the pair of images and provided box layouts can be used to train an object detector. They propose a technique to encode the box layout into the text prompt and fine-tune the whole network except the VQ-VAE. Furthermore, the authors propose a reweighting mask for balancing between foreground and background regions to generate small objects with higher quality. The experiments show the effectiveness of their methods in three aspects: fidelity, trainability, and generability.

### Strengths
1. The ablation study is done thoroughly including the parameter choices. 
2. This paper provides a clear metric for validating their results against other generative methods. For fidelity, trainability, and universality, this paper surpasses other methods by a large margin.
3. The authors show the effectiveness of this method in the aspect of data augmentation for training an object detector.

### Weaknesses
1. Given the fact that recent diffusion-based methods such as ControlNet, ReCo, and GLIGEN can also do Layout-to-Image tasks, the authors should include them in Table 2 (Comparison of generation fidelity on NuImages) and Table 3 (Comparison of generation trainability on NuImages). Current comparisons in Tables 2 and 3 are not up-to-date.
2. The proposed camera-dependent conditioning prompt is very similar to the view-dependent prompting in DreamFusion. The authors need to ablate more on why their method is novel compared to the one proposed in DreamFusion.
3. The idea of using synthetic images generated from the model to augment training object detectors is reasonable. However, the authors need to ablate how much data is needed to train GeoDiffusion (in the Trainability section), since if the number of real data (and box annotations) required to train GeoDiffusion is significantly larger than the numbers needed to train an object detector, the application of this paper is not realistic.
4.  The method is sensitive to the image size and aspect ratio of each dataset. In other words, the number of bins is different across datasets, therefore, greatly affecting the transferability of the proposed approach when trained on a dataset and tested on another dataset. In contrast, other baselines such as Copy and Paste Synthesis can use Stable Diffusion to generate the object of interest better in this situation.
5. Lack of experiments of long-tail (rare) object detection datasets such as LVIS and domain adaptation such as GTAV to Cityscapes or Cityscapes to Foggy Cityscapes. In these settings, the importance of synthetic data is more significant than in the domain where real images and box annotations are largely available. 
6. Among these two contributions, which one is more important?
7. It would be better to move the ablation study from supp (table 9, 10) to the main paper.

### Questions
1. Does the proposed camera-view conditioning work on other autonomous-driving datasets such as Waymo Open Dataset
2. Can the model generate rare cases in the dataset? For example, can the model generate diverse night-time, foggy, raining scenes in NuImages? Another interesting question is can the model generate more samples of rare classes on a long-tailed dataset (LVIS).
3. In Table 2 (Comparison of generation fidelity on NuImages), there is a version of GeoDiffusion with an input resolution of 800x456, how is this obtainable while Stable Diffusion input is 512x512?
4. How do the location bins resolutions affect generation in testing? For instance, if the location bins are trained at 256x256, can the model generate a prompt with a 512x512 grid in test time?

### Summary
This paper proposes GeoDiffusion that transforms locations/layouts of objects and view directions into a prompt which can be fed as input to text-to-image diffusion models. The generated data by the proposed GeoDiffusion is beneficial to improve object detection performance, especially for categories within the low-data regime.

### Strengths
The paper is written well. The method is simple and intuitive to understand.
The results are promising, especially in improving object detection performance.

### Weaknesses
Though the paper claims that the model supports flexible geometric conditions, the current model only supports location tokens and 6 view directions. However, geometric conditions may include depth, exact 3D locations and angles, etc. It is unclear whether the approach is “flexible” enough for these conditions.

It is unclear why the proposed method is better at trainability on object detection, compared to other layout-control synthesis methods such as GLIGEN. The authors mentioned that the method excels at low-data object categories but where does the advantage come from?

The paper exceeds the 9 page limit by ICLR, which violates the authors’ code of ICLR.

Minor typos. It should be “...embarrassingly simple…” rather than “...embarrassing simple…”

### Summary
This paper aims to generate high-quality detection dataset via text-to-image diffusion models. The main novelty lies in GeoDiffusion is that it encodes not only the bounding boxes but also extra geometric conditions such as camera views in selfdriving scenes.
To embed the bounding box locations, it discretizes the continuous coordinates by dividing the image into a grid of location bins, creates unique location tokens, and inserts the  to the text encoder vocabulary. To embed other conditions along with bounding boxes, it uses a prompt template “An image of {view} camera with {boxes}”. To enforce the model focus on foreground and balance the bounding boxes of different sizes during training, it proposes an area re-weighting method to dynamically assign higher weights to smaller boxes.
It is claimed that GeoDiffusion outperforms previous L2I methods while maintaining faster training time.

### Strengths
The paper is well written. Despite the missing of some important baselines, the paper contains very thorough experiments, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed method.

### Weaknesses
1. The baselines, such as ControlNet and GLIGEN are missing in Table 3 and Table 6. Similarly ControlNet is missing in Table 5. They are apparently more comparable than those GAN-based methods. The claimed improvement in the introduction (+21.85 FID and +27.1 mAP) is questionable and misleading as they are obtained by comparing with old GAN-based methods.
2. Related to 1), Stable Diffusion is not a good option for comparison of layout-based inpainting in Figure 5 as Stable Diffusion does not consume bounding box explicitly. I suggest to replace it with ControlNet and GLIGEN for a fair comparison.
3. Related to 1), the importance of camera views is not clearly due to the missing baselines. Furthermore, there are no qualitative illustration of the effect of camera views except a single example in Figure 1.

### Questions
In Table 4, the proposed GeoDiffusion outperforms other methods except in AP50. ControlNet significantly outperform all the other method at AP50 by a very large margin. I am quite curious what leads to this? I think it worths some discussion in the paper.
