## Abstract
In various real-world scenarios, interactions among agents often resemble the dynamics of general-sum games, where each agent strives to optimize its own utility. Despite the ubiquitous relevance of such settings, decentralized machine learning algorithms have struggled to find equilibria that maximize individual utility while preserving social welfare. In this paper we introduce Learning with Opponent Q-Learning Awareness (LOQA), a novel, decentralized reinforcement learning algorithm tailored to optimizing an agent's individual utility while fostering cooperation among adversaries in partially competitive environments. LOQA assumes the opponent samples actions proportionally to their action-value function Q. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of LOQA at achieving state-of-the-art performance in benchmark scenarios such as the Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma and the Coin Game. LOQA achieves these outcomes with a significantly reduced computational footprint, making it a promising approach for practical multi-agent applications.

### Summary
In this paper, the authors propose a decentralized multi-agent learning algorithm that fosters cooperation among agents even in adversarial settings, which they term as partially competitive environments. They provide experimental validation with Iterated Prisoners' Dilemma and Coin Game. Their key claim is that their proposed algorithm achieves state-of-the-art performance in these games with low computational cost. The authors here assume that each agent has access to the Q values of all other agents or can estimate them using the observations and rewards of all other agents.

### Strengths
The authors try to address the computational challenges faced by other MARL algorithms for sequential social dilemmas, by proposing an algorithm where each agent maintains an estimate of the Q values of all its opponents in order to determine its own policy improvement.

### Weaknesses
1. There are several papers in literature that provide decentralized algorithms to achieve individually and socially optimal solution in sequential social dilemmas. One of the criticism of these papers is the additional information needed by these algorithms, which is often not available in the real-world. This paper also has the same limitations. 
2. I think the novelty in the proposed method is limited based on the papers cited by it. The key idea is that each agent model the opponents policy using the rewards obtained by the opponents. Specifically, the approach of using opponent's rewards to shape one's own policy is not novel and has been explored in prior works. The paper does not clearly articulate the specific differences and advantages of their approach over these existing methods.

### Questions
1. Can the authors concretely define "partially competitive settings"?
2. What is the information structure assumed for each agent? If each agent can see the entire world state and also observe the actions of the other agent, then the policy for each agent should also depend on the history of the actions of the agents in addition to the current state for no loss of optimality.
3. How can the opponent's true Q function be replaces with an estimate by the agent? Are we assuming that opponent observations and rewards are common information in the game? This is often not the case in real-worls multi-agent settings.
4. It is not clear if LOQA will extend to all general-sum games. Also, the sub-optimality for each agent due to the modified objective function needs to be quantified and bounded. Are the authors proposing LOQA only for sequential social dilemmas?
5. Can the authors establish or reason about the solution concept achieved using LOQA? Will it be a socially optimal solution. In non-symmetric games what will be the extent of sub-optimality for each agent?
6. By modifying the objective function (returns) optimized by each agent, LOQA changes the underlying game. Can the authors show that a Nash equilibrium (or any refinement of it) of this modified game is a socially optimal solution of the original game?
7. Also, will decentralized REINFORCE algorithm lead to attaining a Nash equilibrium in the above-defined modified game?
8. How does this analysis extend to the case when all agents in a game are using LOQA?

### Summary
This paper introduces learning with opponent Q-learning awareness (LOQA) which optimizes cooperation in mixed-motive environments by assuming the opponent samples actions proportionally to Q values. This method is computationally lighter compared with prior works.

### Strengths
1. I like the idea of deriving some cooperative solutions in mixed-motive games without computing the meta-game solutions. There were many efforts in this direction but only a few paid off, the main limitation lies in the scalability of the multi-agent problems.
2. The paper is clear and easy to follow.

### Weaknesses
In general, the experimental part has room for improvement
1. When this line of research on LOLA has a few prior works, a comparison with a decent amount of previous works is necessary so that we know the proposed method is better. The good performance of a particular method under a particular environment is not the reason to abandon other methods, especially when POLA [1] did not compare with M-FOS [2]
2. Results on the IPD and coin environment may be a bit preliminary when we jointly consider the contribution of the algorithm (efficiency). More complex games like Meltingpot 2.0 [3] with some clearly diverse background agent policies (cooperating for different variations of time and defect afterward) can be a good benchmark for the completeness of the experiments

### Questions
1. (Comments) The authors should use \citep{} for (Author, Year) citations
2. Any intuitions on why the other work[1], meta-game + model-free opponent-shaping does not work on coin game?

### Summary
The paper proposes LOQA -- a new member of the LOLA family (next to COLA and POLA). Conceptually, LOQA is different in that it assumes that the opponent uses Q-leaning (more specifically, that the probability of its action in a state is proportional to the corresponding Q-value relative to Q-values of other actions). The advantage of this algorithm is that it can achieve performance comparable to POLA (previous state-of-the-art of the family) but faster, which also improves scalability to bigger environments. This claim is complemented by experiments in the Coin Game, which is a two-agent coin collection game on a small grid with 2 agents.

### Strengths
- Solutions to conditional (equilibrium-based) cooperation in general and improvements of LOLA in particular are relevant to MARL.
- The paper is straightforward and well-written.
- The experiments are sound, I especially like fig. 2.

### Weaknesses
 - Related work lacks discussion of MARL approaches to learning prosocial equilibria other than reciprocity-based or opponent-shaping-based, such as reward redistribution https://ala2020.vub.ac.be/papers/ALA2020_paper_45.pdf https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.13332, mediation https://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.08419.pdf, contracts https://arxiv.org/pdf/2208.10469.pdf, and similarity-based equilibria https://arxiv.org/pdf/2211.14468.pdf.
- Some limitations of previous LOLA-based approaches that LOQA does not fix are unmentioned in the Limitations section: e.g., it is only applicable to environments with 2 agents.
- The contribution is limited to modifying an existing algorithm and improving its speed, but not performance. The new algorithm is also quite complex. I do not think the contribution is sufficient for ICLR. A workshop would be a better fit.

### Questions
- I am not sure why in 5.1 the Q-value $\hat{Q}^2$ is approximated as an empirical return. Since we need access to the real $Q^2$ or its approximation through opponent modeling regardless, can we not use a 1-step or n-step temporal difference instead (which would give a better bias-variance)?

### Summary
This paper presents a method for decentralized learning in general-sum games, building on the assumption that adversaries sample actions according to their action-value function. The experiments demonstrate significant improvements in wall-clock time and performance against POLA in the coin game.

I am recommending borderline acceptance for this work, as the method is a useful contribution towards scaling LOLA-based methods. However, I would like to see the evaluation strengthened with more and increasingly complex environments, as well as more than one baseline (particularly M-FOS).

### Strengths
1. The related work is detailed, covering LOLA and meta-learning approaches to social dilemmas.
2. The method is clearly motivated and described. The underlying assumption is well explained and plausible.
3. The evaluation demonstrates a significant improvement in computational efficiency against POLA, with the analysis demonstrated in figures 3 and 4 showing this scaling behavior well.
4. Figure 1 presents a validation that LOQA is capable of learning tit-for-tat-like strategies in IPD.

### Weaknesses
1. The evaluation is limited in diversity, comparing LOQA to a single baseline algorithm (POLA) on a single environment (coin game). The selection of POLA vs alternative LOLA extensions is justified, but I am unsure how M-FOS is neglected when it has also been demonstrated to be effective at the coin game? Furthermore, the choice to only evaluate against POLA on the coin game is limiting, when full-history IPD and chicken would be equally interesting and strengthen the results. Specifically, the lack of comparison to M-FOS, which also addresses the computational cost of LOLA, makes it difficult to assess the relative performance and efficiency gains of LOQA. The absence of full-history IPD and chicken environments further limits the generalizability of the conclusions, as these environments have different strategic complexities and could reveal limitations of the proposed method.
2. The scaling performance of LOQA would be better demonstrated by including further, more complex environments, rather than just scaling up the grid size of the coin game. Since previous LOLA extensions have been prohibitively expensive, this has not been possible, but it appears LOQA runs in a very reasonable amount of time on the largest of these tasks. This gives the opportunity to demonstrate LOQA on a "more complex and realistic scenario", rather than just extrapolating from its scaling performance here. The current evaluation only shows that LOQA scales well with the size of a relatively simple grid world, but it does not demonstrate that it can handle more complex strategic interactions or higher-dimensional state spaces. A more complex task could reveal potential bottlenecks or limitations of the method that are not apparent in the coin game.
3. Whilst the training dynamics of POLA are consistent across seeds, LOQA seems to have significant variance (Figure 4). The number of LOQA seeds should be increased beyond 3 to handle this variance. The current number of seeds is insufficient to confidently assess the stability and robustness of LOQA. The high variance suggests that the method might be sensitive to initial conditions or stochastic elements of the training process, which needs to be addressed with a more thorough evaluation.

### Questions
1. Nitpick: The scaling of LOQA in figure 3 would be clearer with a log-scale y-axis.

### Summary
the paper presents LOQA, a decentralized reinforcement learning algorithm that optimizes individual utility while promoting cooperation among adversaries in partially competitive environments. LOQA is designed to achieve state-of-the-art performance in benchmark scenarios like the Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma and the Coin Game, making it a promising approach for practical multi-agent applications. The paper provides a detailed description of the LOQA algorithm, including its opponent Q-learning awareness assumption, and presents experimental results that demonstrate its effectiveness.

### Strengths
Quality: The paper provides a detailed description of the LOQA algorithm, including its opponent Q-learning awareness assumption, and presents experimental results that demonstrate its effectiveness. The experiments are well-designed and the results are statistically significant.

### Weaknesses
the LOQA algorithm assumes the opponent acts accordingly to an inner action-value function and is designed for environments with discrete action spaces. This means that LOQA is unable to shape other opponents that do not necessarily follow this assumption. The assumptions and dependencies of algorithms are strong, making it difficult to handle continuous action space problems and multi-agent issues.

### Questions
Q1: The IPD and coingame mentioned in the paper mainly refer to two general-sum games. Can the algorithm be applied to other types of environments, such as zero-sum games, or more complex gaming environments, such as StarCraft II?
