## Abstract
In learning with noisy labels, the noise transition reveals how an instance relates from its clean label to its noisy one. Accurately inferring an instance's noise transition is crucial for inferring its clean label.  However, when only a noisy dataset is available, noise transitions can typically be inferred only for a ``special'' group of instances. To use these learned transitions to assist in inferring others, it is essential to understand the connections among different transitions across different instances.
Existing work usually addresses this by introducing assumptions that explicitly define the similarity of noise transitions across various instances. However, these similarity-based assumptions often lack empirical validation and may not be aligned with real-world data. The misalignment can lead to misinterpretations of both noise transitions and clean labels.
In this work, instead of directly defining similarity, we propose modeling the generative process of noisy data. Intuitively, to understand the connections among noise transitions across different instances, we represent the causal generative process of noisy data using a learnable graphical model. Relying solely on noisy data, our method can effectively discern the underlying causal generative process, subsequently inferring the noise transitions of instances and their clean labels. Experiments on various datasets with different types of label noise further demonstrate our method's effectiveness.

### Summary
The paper proposes a graphical modeling approach for label-noise learning. It addresses the issue of manual assumptions regarding noise transition in previous work, so they design the generative process based on causal factors. These causal factors is latent, so they propose learnable generative models to establish relationships among data instances, clean labels, and noisy labels. The proposed method, GenP, shows better performances than existing methods.

### Strengths
The motivation and problem formulation are reasonable. Designing a graphical model is an effective approach to uncovering the connections related to unknown transitions. The manuscript is well-written.

### Weaknesses
1. Missing explanation and comparison with important baselines

* The paper states that there are "no existing methods that attempt to unveil these latent noisy data generative process". However, there are previous works that have addressed the generative processes for label-noise learning [1, 2, 3], and even they use [1] for the baseline in the experiments. The paper should provide a comprehensive discussion for these baselines. Specifically, the paper should clarify how the proposed method differs from these existing generative approaches, particularly in terms of modeling assumptions, identifiability analysis, and the specific causal structures being learned. A detailed comparison of the latent variable modeling techniques used in these baselines versus the proposed method is necessary to justify the novelty of the approach.

* Additionally, there is a lack of discussion regarding related work on label-noise learning. While they use the clean example distillation method via the small-loss trick, it is essential to also survey this related work, such as sample selection methods, for a more comprehensive view of the field. This should include a discussion of how the proposed method relates to and potentially improves upon existing sample selection techniques, and how the small-loss trick is integrated within the overall framework.

2. Lack of Experimental Support

* Some results, such as those for CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-10N, do not appear to be statistically significant, and the performance gain observed for Clothing1M is marginal. To further support the effectiveness of the proposed model, it would be beneficial to include experiments on various real-world datasets such as WebVision, ANIMAL-10N, and Mini-Imagenet, or to conduct repeated experiments on Clothing-1M. The current results do not provide sufficient evidence that the proposed method consistently outperforms existing methods across diverse datasets and noise conditions. The lack of statistical significance in some results raises concerns about the robustness of the method.

* The paper primarily presents the classification performance without conducting an in-depth analysis of the contributing factors behind the performance improvements. A more detailed examination of specific elements that have positively influenced the overall performance is needed. This could include: 1) an ablation study comparing model training with only $L_{semi}$ and with the entire loss, 2) a sensitivity analysis regarding hyperparameters (e.g., $\lambda_{ELBO}$ and $\lambda_M$), 3) a comparison between end-to-end learning and alternative learning approaches, and 4) an ablation study based on the number of latent variables, among other potential analyses. Without these analyses, it is difficult to understand the individual contributions of each component of the proposed method.

3. Minor Comments

* The first paragraph of Section 3 and the first paragraph of 'Intuition about Inferring Latent Generative Process' have significant overlap. Rephrasing these sentences would improve clarity and avoid redundancy.

* It would be helpful to include a citation when introducing the "small-loss trick" to provide proper credit and context.

* Some numbering in the 'Baselines' section appears to be missing (e.g., 5 and 11).

### Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of learning with noisy labels, particularly focusing on the critical aspect of understanding noise transitions—the process by which a clean label turns into a noisy one. Traditionally, most methods infer noise transitions based on assumptions about similarities across different instances. However, these assumptions often lack empirical backing and may not accurately reflect real-world data scenarios, leading to incorrect interpretations of both noise transitions and clean labels.

To overcome these limitations, the authors propose a novel approach that models the generative process of noisy data instead of relying on predefined similarity assumptions. This method uses a learnable graphical model to represent the causal generative process behind the noise in data. By doing this, the model can more effectively identify the underlying causal factors that lead to noise in labels.

### Strengths
The author's effective construction of a causal graph that aligns well with the research's motivation, as well as their adept development of the graphical model and Evidence Lower Bound (ELBO), signifies a robust approach in addressing the research problem.

### Weaknesses
Indeed, in the field of noisy label classification, using deep generative models (DGMs) to infer latent true labels is not a novel approach. Various studies have explored this concept, leveraging the capacity of DGMs to model complex data distributions and underlying noise patterns, including [1].

From a critical standpoint, this study distinguishes itself from the ICML 2022 paper "[1]" by proposing a graphical model that requires the generation of input instances. A significant advantage of the approach in "[1]" is that it does not require input generation. Generating high-resolution instances can be inherently challenging or demand computationally intensive models like diffusion models, making the combination of input instance generation with noisy label classification potentially impractical.

The primary focus of this study on low-resolution datasets such as MNIST and CIFAR-10 in their experimental evaluations is possibly due to these inherent difficulties. Although they report results for the higher-resolution Clothing1M dataset, the lack of specific mention of standard deviations casts doubt on the reliability of these findings. Furthermore, the performance improvement over DivideMix is marginal, raising questions about the necessity of employing a deep generative model for noisy label classification. This aspect warrants skepticism regarding the scalability and practical applicability of the proposed method, especially for higher-resolution, real-world datasets.

Incorporating a deep generative model in scenarios primarily focused on classification tasks can introduce a significant computational burden. The author should compare the increased computational requirements of this additional modeling with existing baselines to provide a clearer perspective on its practical feasibility. This comparison is crucial for assessing the trade-offs between the potential benefits of improved noise handling and the increased computational demands, particularly for applications where resources are limited or efficiency is a critical factor.

### Questions
Q1. The use of "distillation" in the paper seems unclear, as it traditionally refers to transferring knowledge from a complex to a simpler model. If this process is not evident in the methodology, the term may be inaccurately applied. The author should clarify or reconsider its use. Using a simply trained network initially does not necessarily constitute distillation, which typically involves transferring knowledge from a more complex model.

Q2. The authors should specify how their use of a DGM framework with causal graphs and inference differs in motivation and application from the work done in CausalNL, detailing the distinct aspects of their approach.

Q3. In the context of noisy label classification, it's not typical to specifically categorize noise types as "Worst," "Aggregate," "Random 1," "Random 2," and "Random 3" without clear definitions. These terms are not standard in the literature and require clarification for proper understanding.

Q4. As previously discussed, training a Deep Generative Model (DGM) for this task may impose a significant computational burden. In this context, could the methodology benefit from incorporating pre-trained DGMs to alleviate these computational demands?

### Summary
To deal with noisy labels, this paper models the generation process of noisy data using a learnable graphical model to understand the underlying causal relations, instead of directly defining and utilizing similarity of noise transitions across various instances in previous work. Experiments on various dataset with different types of label noise validate its effectiveness.

### Strengths
1.This paper gives an insight into the transition matrix that the instances have similar transition matrix only if the causal factors causing the label noise are similar, which does make sense.

2.Experimental results under various settings show the effectiveness of the approach.

### Weaknesses
1.The idea of modeling the generation process of label noise via exploiting the underlying causal relations has been proposed in [1]. Hence, it is suggested to highlight the differences between the two works in Related Work.

2.Figure 2 should be polished up. For example, in Figure 2, the difference between the blue arrow and black arrow should be explained. Meanwhile, the generative process related to Figure 2 in Section 3, the core of this paper, should be give more details about. 

3.The assumption that the generation process of causal factors Z is linear seems a bit unreasonable, which should be give more details on.

4.Eq.(1) is very confusing. It seems that $Z_i$ is the element in $\mathbf{Z}$ but also calculated by $\mathbf{Z}$, which provides an implicit constraint.

5.Some related works such as [2, 3] are missing.

### Questions
1. What is the meaning of $N_i$? In Section 3, it mentions that $N_i$ is the corresponding latent noise varibable. Could you take Figure 1 as an example to illustrate it?

### Summary
Although inferring noise transition is crucial, its inference is limited from assumptions of the relations between instances and its respective noise transitions. This relation should be trained as latent (by learning noisy data generative process). This paper learns this relation by introducing graph structure. Empirically, it shows good performance.

### Strengths
- The motivation which underlines the problems of the previous studies, the assumption of the similarity of noise transitions, is adequate.
- The structure is flexible.

### Weaknesses
 - To the best of my knowledge, BLTM (one of the baselines in the experiment part), which trains a instance-dependent transition matrix network using the distilled dataset, has no assumption for the similarity between noise transition for different instances. I think this study contradicts to author's proposal, which says, there are assumptions of similarity in the previous researches.
- Since Y is latent, there is no way to prove that Y is true (so that the authors relied on distillation). Therefore, it means the authors actually makes an another assumption saying that the distilled dataset is clean. Furthermore, the method's reliance on a distilled dataset introduces a potential bias, as the selection process for this dataset might not be representative of the overall data distribution, thus affecting the generalizability of the learned noise transition model.
- Since it should generate X (usually an image), time complexity and memory will be large. Why should we generate an image to classify? Also want to see the exact time and memory comparison over several baselines. The computational overhead of generating images, especially for high-resolution inputs, raises concerns about the practical applicability of this method in resource-constrained environments. A detailed analysis of the computational cost compared to other methods is necessary to justify the added complexity.
- Lack of any analysis. In the experiment part, nothing but the test accuracy are reported. Please show analytical empirical results for whether the training are processed as authors proposed. For example, at least whether the error of the inferred transition is small or not should be expressed. The absence of analysis beyond test accuracy makes it difficult to assess the validity of the proposed approach. Specifically, metrics such as the error in the inferred transition matrix, the stability of the learned latent space, and the sensitivity of the method to hyperparameter changes are crucial to understand the method's behavior.

### Questions
- Can authors show (at least, the empirical) evidences of the proposal saying that "noise transitions can be inferred of a special group of instances"?
- Why should we use graph structure? Can't this structure be changed to other structure?
- How can we be sure that the process the authors proposed improve the model performance?
- Why using the estimated clean labels from distillation is not enough? As the authors said, distillation methods are well studied. By pointing out that the model performance of the method the authors proposed should depend on the quality of the estimated clean labels, the distilled labels should be clean enough. If the estimated labels are clean enough, why should we do more process fundamentally?
