## Abstract
Quantum kernels hold great promise for offering computational advantages over classical learners, with the effectiveness of these kernels closely tied to the design of the quantum feature map. However, the challenge of designing effective quantum feature maps for real-world datasets, particularly in the absence of sufficient prior information, remains a significant obstacle. In this study, we present a data-driven approach that automates the design of problem-specific quantum feature maps. Our approach leverages feature-selection techniques to handle high-dimensional data on near-term quantum machines with limited qubits, and incorporates a deep neural predictor to efficiently evaluate the performance of various candidate quantum kernels. Through extensive numerical simulations on different datasets, we demonstrate the superiority of our proposal over prior methods, especially for the capability of eliminating the kernel concentration issue and identifying the feature map with prediction advantages. Our work not only unlocks the potential of quantum kernels for enhancing real-world tasks but also highlights the substantial role of deep learning in advancing quantum machine learning.

### Summary
This paper proposes an automated pipeline to design quantum kernels. The main innovation is an optimisation algorithm that solves the joint optimisation of quantum circuit and circuit parameters that produce the quantum feature map. This uses a neural predictor for the circuit architecture performance. The method is benchmarked on toy datasets.

### Strengths
- Well written, tackling relevant problem of joint quantum architecture and parameter optimisation
- Novel two stage optimisation algorithm
- Neural predictor to reduce computational time, evaluation of KTA as good surrogate for accuracy
- Benchmarks on multiple datasets against multiple baselines, finding good performance

### Weaknesses
 - The method is benchmarked against other quantum kernels and RBF. I think that a fairer benchmark would be against classical kernels that can also be adapted to data, such as [https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.04326], and choose similar number of tunable parameters. Also, I did not see how the parameters of the RBF were tuned.
- I did not see a clear benefit of the neural predictor. For each dataset one needs to train a new predictor, which requires M circuit layouts with their labels. Then M' layouts are sampled randomly and scored by the neural predictor. I assume that $M'\gg M$. It would be good to see whether sampling M layouts and scoring them with the actual labels would be worse than using the neural predictor. Also, I would expect that an active learning approach like Bayesian optimisation for the architecture search could be more beneficial since it guides the sampling rather than sampling randomly which can be very suboptimal in this large search space.

### Questions
- What is M' (number of sampled layouts) used in the experiments?
- Can you try against better classical baselines to give a sense of how hard these tasks are and quantify the quantum advantage?

### Summary
The paper proposes QuKerNet, a data-driven method to design quantum feature maps for quantum kernels. QuKerNet uses feature selection techniques to handle high-dimensional data and reduce the vanishing similarity issue. It incorporates a deep neural predictor to efficiently evaluate the performance of various candidate quantum kernels. QuKerNet jointly optimizes the circuit layout and the variational parameters of the quantum feature map, aiming to achieve the global optimal solution for the kernel design problem. QuKerNet demonstrates comparable performance over prior methods on real-world and synthetic datasets, especially for eliminating the kernel concentration issue and identifying the feature map with prediction advantages.

### Strengths
1. The paper is well-written and easy to follow. The paper demonstrates the superiority of QuKerNet over prior methods on various datasets, and shows the potential advantages of quantum kernels designed by QuKerNet for image/fraud classification tasks.

2. The paper employs feature-selection techniques to handle high-dimensional data and mitigate the vanishing similarity issue that affects quantum kernels on near-term quantum devices. Also the authors use a neural network to predict the performance of different candidate quantum kernels based on their circuit layouts and variational parameters, and selects the top ones for fine-tuning, which is sound and novel for enhancement of quantum kernel methods.

### Weaknesses
1. The author mentioned that part of the advantage of the quantum kernel comes from its being computationally hard to evaluate classically. However, the quantum kernel proposed in this paper relies on an explicit quantum feature map, meaning explicit quantum gates and quantum circuit encoding. From my view, on NISQ devices with fewer qubits and shallower quantum circuits, such a quantum feature map is not computationally hard to evaluate classically. Therefore, the reviewer believes that the quantum advantage of the proposed quantum feature map in this paper is not readily apparent. Providing a theoretical explanation rather than solely relying on empirical demonstration would make the argument more convincing.

2. In the field of quantum machine learning, optimizing both the circuit structure and the parameters of variational quantum gates for specific tasks has been previously studied. Papers [1] and [2] introduced a completely differentiable quantum architecture search (QAS) framework, avoiding the vast circuit structure search space, which the reviewer considers one of the issues faced by the proposed QuKerNet in this paper. 

3. While transfer some ideas of QAS to quantum kernel methods can be considered one of the contributions of this paper, the reviewer believes the methods of QAS utilized in the paper are somewhat outdated and lack timeliness. For instance, methods based on reinforcement learning [3] and sample-free approaches [1,2] might enable the model to learn better quantum feature maps.

4. In the experimental settings of this paper, the number of utilized quantum bits seems somewhat limited (up to a maximum of 8 qubits). While the reviewer acknowledges that simulating computing overheads on a moderately sized number of qubits can be computationally intensive (even supercomputers struggle to simulate just over 30 qubits in full amplitude simulation), it is believed that the use of only 8 qubits is insufficient to demonstrate the computational gap between quantum and classical kernels. The reviewer is pleased to see more experimental results on a larger number of qubits.

### Summary
This work exploits a discrete-continuous joint optimization framework to enhance the quantum kernel, namely QuKerNet, for machine learning problems. The QuKerNet enables the automatic design of kernels by jointly both circuit layouts and variational parameters. Moreover, the authors devise a surrogate loss to efficiently optimize QuKerNet.

### Strengths
1. The authors put forth a QuKetNet to enhance the quantum kernel, where a joint discrete-continuous optimization framework is expected to resolve. 

2. A new two-stage alternative optimization algorithm is proposed to find both the best quantum neural architecture and optimal model parameters. 

3. Comprehensive numerical simulations are conducted.

### Weaknesses
1. Since a randomized quantum kernel has attained outstanding quantum representations and exactly corresponds to a special quantum neural network, the motivation of using an enhanced quantum kernel with automatic neural architecture search is not a key topic. 

2. The computation cost of the two-stage optimization for the objective as Eq. (4) is such high that only a small subset of MNIST samples is tested for the experiments. However, the randomized quantum kernel can be simply incorporated into a quantum kernel learning architecture, which can be extended to large datasets. 

3. The performance gain in a selected MNIST data subset cannot be convincing enough to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed enhanced quantum kernel. 

4. For the empirical simulation, many hyper-parameter settings are configured, which can be particularly fitted to certain subsets but difficult to generalize to all data.

### Questions
1. Why does the quantum neural architecture search a key topic? 

2. Since the two-stage alternative optimization has to seek a locally optimal quantum architecture, the computational cost is significantly high. So, what is the trade-off between the performance gain and optimization overhead? Is it necessary to seek an optimal quantum neural architecture?

### Summary
The authors propose a neural auto-designer to automatically select quantum kernels and update the internal rotation parameters. However, the problem is only the subset of well-studied Quantum Architecture Search (QAS). The proposed method is highly similar to previous literature [1] (which is not even cited in this paper). Results on three datasets are provided with the results slightly better than the selected baselines. However, the numerical experiments are extremely weak with simple datasets and naive baselines.

### Strengths
The overall structure of this paper is ok.

### Weaknesses
 **The authors are twisting some basic ideas and missing some critical references.** 
1. The problem of quantum kernel auto-designer defined by the authors is only a special case of QAS. QAS has attracted continuous attention with numerous algorithms trying to solve this problem (see a small survey on this problem [1]). The state-of-the-art method [2] on QAS has thoroughly examined their algorithm on both VQE problems and quantum kernels (using MNIST as well). It is unclear why we should focus on only the quantum kernels instead of the general QAS problem.
2. [3] proposed a very similar QAS approach compared to this paper and [3] is not even mentioned in this paper. It is highly suspicious since the authors cite 7 other papers from the group (or more specifically from Yuxuan Du). The proposed approach is too simple with no novelty at all.
3. The experimental results are weak and lack a proper comparison. Not a single baseline from all the QAS methods is unacceptable since [2,3] and many other QAS papers all take quantum kernels as one of the testbeds for their QAS approaches. The authors constantly mentioned that the work aims to "greatly improve the power of quantum kernels under NISQ setting" but they are not considering noise models or quantum devices.
