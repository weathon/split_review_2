## Abstract
Embodied AI models often employ off the shelf vision backbones like CLIP to encode their visual observations. Although such general purpose representations encode rich syntactic and semantic information about the scene, much of this information is often irrelevant to the specific task at hand. This introduces noise within the learning process and distracts the agent's focus from task-relevant visual cues.
Inspired by selective attention in humans—the process through which people filter their perception based on their experiences, knowledge, and the task at hand—we introduce a parameter-efficient approach to filter visual stimuli for embodied AI.
Our approach induces a task-conditioned bottleneck using a small learnable codebook module. This codebook is trained jointly to optimize task reward and acts as a task-conditioned selective filter over the visual observation.
Our experiments showcase state-of-the-art performance for object goal navigation and object displacement across $5$ benchmarks, ProcTHOR, ArchitecTHOR, RoboTHOR, AI2-iTHOR, and ManipulaTHOR. The filtered representations produced by the codebook are also able generalize better and converge faster when adapted to other simulation environments such as Habitat. Our qualitative analyses show that agents explore their environments more effectively and their representations retain task-relevant information like target object recognition while ignoring superfluous information about other objects. Code is available on \href{https://embodied-codebook.io/}{the project page}.

### Summary
This paper proposes an adaptive feature modulation module for embodied AI.  The core idea is to create a task-conditioned representation bottleneck, based on a learnable codebook, to select useful features for each robotic task.  The codebook is jointly trained to optimize the task reward.  This paper demonstrates superior efficacy of the proposed method, and conduct thorough ablation study / visualization of the proposed method.

### Strengths
1. Good ablation study.  Table 3 clearly shows the selected information of the codebook. Grad-CAM visualization also makes sense.

2. The paper is well written.  It's easy to follow especially that readers are primed with some high-level ideas from human vision.

3. The performance gain is significant compared to the baseline.

### Weaknesses
1. Learning codebook as information bottleneck helps discriminative mapping of observations to task outputs.  Meanwhile, throwing away information means that there's little knowledge shared among different task.  It'd be interesting to see if the performance comparison on zero-shot/few-shot learning of novel tasks.  My guess is that EmbCLIP would adapt toe the novel task faster and better than the proposed codebook method.


2. The paper does not provide comparison to other bottleneck-based baselines.  For example, one can learn a self-attention modules atop CLIP feature maps.  Also, learning an auto-encoder, where the bottleneck is low-dimensional latent feature, seems to be another reasonable baseline.  Both self-attention modules and the auto-encoder will condition on the goal task description and previous action.

### Questions
1. What's the performance of fine-tuning entire model on Habitat and adaptation module on HMD semantics (table 2)?  Also, what's the before-finetuning results of EmbCLIP+codebook on both benchmark?  Right now the comparison is conducted over different dataset, not apple-to-apple.

2. The nearest neighbor probably should be done by treating learned codes as query.  In stead of using the pooled/weighted sum features, the authors can use a one-hot vector to select each code and upsample it to 1568 dimension.  It'd be more interesting to see what are learned in the codebook and what do the retrievals look like for each task.

3. Perhaps the authors should compare with other information-bottleneck baselines, e.g. self-attention / autoencoder.  Such results could clarify if codebook / information bottleneck is the key.

### Summary
The paper presents a parameter efficient approach to filter out task-irrelevant information encoded by visual encoders, such as CLIP, in embodied AI tasks. This approach leverages a compact, learnable codebook module to establish a task-specific filter for visual observations. The codebook is trained to optimize task performance, serving as a filter that directs the agent's attention toward task-relevant visual cues. The experimental results demonstrate performance improvement in object goal navigation and object displacement tasks across various benchmarks. Qualitative analysis illustrates that agents become more proficient in exploring their surroundings, retaining task-relevant information, and disregarding irrelevant visual details.

### Strengths
1) The paper proposes a simple parameter efficient approach for adapting representations which leads to consistent performance improvement on multiple benchmarks. 
2) Because the model learns to ignore the irrelevant parts of the visual inputs, it is able to do more efficient exploration and navigation.. 
3) The proposed finetuning approach of the codebook module is clever.

### Weaknesses
1) Given that the proposed approach is about the codebook module, it would have been good to see if this approach could be applied to other pretrained visual encoders, for eg ViT based models. 
2) It's not clear how their approach compares against a full-scale visual encoder fine tuning baseline? Finetuning of the visual encoder should also allow it to forget information that is not relevant to the task. While finetuning is computationally expensive, it will still be interesting to see how EmbCLIP-codebook performs with respect to it. 
3) It is also not clear how important is the use of the codebook vectors compared to just the introduction of a bottleneck in the architecture? To test this, I recommend the authors try using their proposed bottleneck architecture without the codebook vectors.

### Questions
I have listed my main concerns in the weaknesses section. I will be happy to increase the score if the authors can answer those with relevant experiments. Other than that, I have some other questions and suggestions that I list below:
1) What is meant by “Samplers”, which is mentioned in the experimental details?
2) Why is RobotTHOR missing some metrics in Table 1?

### Summary
Visual encoders like CLIP capture general purpose scene information which includes details not relevant to the task. The paper proposes to learn a codebook module that selectively filters information from visual representations specific for a task. They demonstrate the approach on a wide range of Embodied AI tasks across several large-scale benchmarks. Additionally, they present qualitative analysis showing that the codebook module better encodes task information which lends to more robust navigational policies.

### Strengths
Approach is simple, easy to follow, and well motivated. 

Codebook representations and policy are learned end-to-end.

Results are shown across a diverse set of tasks and benchmarks. Improvement over EmbCLIP seems significant. Also report a comprehensive set of metrics including a new metric Success Weighted by Episode Length which accounts for actions like changing viewing angles that also requires time and effort. 

Interesting experiments showing that with minimal finetuning of the Adaptation Module with a frozen codebook can help transfer to new visual domains.

Saliency visualizations are informative of where the model is paying attention to and highlights relevant tasks objects.

Nice set of ablation studies on codebook latent size and linear probes.

### Weaknesses
Does the codebook work for other types of general purpose visual encoders? This work seems to only show the codebook module applied to EmbCLIP.

### Questions
Could the codebook be learning to localize the goal information in the scene? The input to the codebook contains both the visual observation and a language description of the goal. It could be possible that the codebook is simply acting as a bridge between the two input modalities.

What are some of the failure cases of the EmbCLIP + codebook method? Are there instances where codebook fails to identify task objects?

Are there cases where two objects of the same class are present in the scene, but the task requires the model to pick one of the objects.

### Summary
This work starts from a very attractive motivation: redundant information will blind people to making correct actions. The authors utilize a simple yet effective trick, i.e., adding a parameter-efficient codebook, and expecting it to filter out the unnecessary information in the embeddings. The method significantly boosts the performance of the baseline EmbCLIP on several benchmarks.

### Strengths
I am quite appealed by the introduction, which I believe illustrates a very interesting motivation and will inspire the community. The method is also very simple and effective. Simply incorporating a codebook module is able to improve the baseline EmbCLIP by a large margin on several benchmarks. Overall, I believe this paper makes a good contribution, especially in terms of motivations and methods.

### Weaknesses
One of the weaknesses is also related to its strengths, i.e., motivation. I was quite attracted by the example of Figure 1, in which the authors describe the situation that the keys would only lie on a flattened surface, not a corner or somewhere else. I do like the motivation and expect the authors to incorporate such a human prior into the method yet I did not find it in the paper. I would suggest the authors consider incorporating a text prompt on the CLIP text model such as "the chair is usually on the floor" etc. Not necessarily for all the benchmarks but I think it would be interesting to see whether several cases can be improved. The lack of explicit incorporation of such priors, which are central to the paper's motivating example, feels like a missed opportunity to fully realize the potential of the proposed method. The current approach relies solely on the codebook to implicitly learn these priors, which may not be as effective as explicitly guiding the model with textual knowledge.

The second weakness is about codebook collapse, this is a good motivation and interesting problem that is also related to interpreting what codebook really learns. I would expect whether the current method exists codebook collapse without dropout during training. This means the authors may need to conduct ablation studies and provide illustrations about collapse or not. Specifically, it is crucial to understand the distribution of codebook usage during training. If a small subset of codes is heavily favored, it suggests that the codebook is not effectively filtering redundant information. An ablation study should examine the codebook usage with and without dropout, and visualize the code usage distribution to confirm the effectiveness of the proposed method in preventing codebook collapse.

### Questions
Should adding a skip connection between \hat{E} and E help improve the current version, i.e., \hat{E} = theta(E)+Code Module(E)? I think bottleneck representations such as ResNet etc will usually do so.

For the other questions please see weakness.
