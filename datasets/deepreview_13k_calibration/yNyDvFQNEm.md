## Abstract
Data clustering, the task of grouping observations according to their similarity, is a key component of unsupervised learning -- with real world applications in diverse fields such as biology, medicine, and social science. Often in these fields the data comes with complex interdependencies between the dimensions of analysis, for instance the various characteristics and opinions people can have live on a complex social network. Current clustering methods are ill-suited to tackle this complexity: deep learning can approximate these dependencies, but not take their explicit map as the input of the analysis. In this paper, we aim at fixing this blind spot in the unsupervised learning literature. We can create network-aware embeddings by estimating the network distance between numeric node attributes via the generalized Euclidean distance. Differently from all methods in the literature that we know of, we do not cluster the nodes of the network, but rather its node attributes. In our experiments we show that having these network embeddings is always beneficial for the learning task; that our method scales to large networks; and that we can actually provide actionable insights in applications in a variety of fields such as marketing, economics, and political science. Our method is fully open source and data and code are available to reproduce all results in the paper.

### Summary
This paper proposes a node attribute clustering method by considering the graph structure to measure the distance between node attributes. The authors claim that the contribution of this paper is that they are the first to cluster node attributes by considering graph structure.

### Strengths
This paper proposes a pipeline to reduce the dimensions of node features.

### Weaknesses
1. The biggest problem with this paper is that the model innovation is not enough. In short, the authors propose a distance metric that considers graph structure based on the scheme of Coscia et al. (2020) and apply it to t-SNE to reduce feature dimensions, thereby achieving the goal of clustering node attributes. From my perspective, this does not meet the standard of an academic paper that will be presented at a prestigious conference.
2. The expression in this paper is not concise enough. It is not until the fourth paragraph of the introduction that the main objective of this paper is revealed. The main contribution of the method is the generalized Euclidean proposed in Section 2.3, and many other redundant contents need to be deleted.
3. The expression in this paper is not clear enough. For example, why clean noise, and why can AE clean noise? Why don't other models consider this, and what is the motivation for choosing AE? These are not explained clearly.
4. Even the title is not clear enough. Unsupervised learning is too broad and cannot represent node attribute clustering.
5. The authors should have a section introducing related work.

### Summary
This paper proposes that data clustering be done in a manner that combines knowledge of a network connecting nodes and a set of observations O assigning a value to each node. Other than that, the problem definition given and the aim of this paper is unclear.

### Strengths
The paper appears to propose a novel way to generate clusters through embeddings.

### Weaknesses
The main idea in itself is hardly novel, as embedding-based clustering has been around for a long time. In the experimental study, the paper compares to preliminary embedding methods like node2vec, which have been superseded by other more recent works in the literature. Thus it is hard to judge the success of the method in experimental terms.

More importantly, it is hard to judge this paper because the problem definition is written in a manner that is hard to make sense of. It is claimed that the proposed method clusters node attributes rather than nodes. It is hard to understand what that means, since nodes are represented by their attributes and the method claims to take the network connections in consideration as well.

The problem definition says that we look for a function f : G × O → P returning the partition P such that arg minO δ = f(G, O), δ being the function calculating the distance between pairs of observations on G. Nothing is clear in this definition. For example:

- What is mean to apply a function f on the whole of G and O?
- Where is the pair of observations on which the function δ is applied?
- What exactly is the stated objective expressed as arg minO δ = f(G, O)? Are we looking for a set O or a member of O?
- What should the entity we are looking for minimize?

The explanation offered in words is a bit better than the mathematical statement, yet still unclear: "we want to find the partition P of O such that the graph distance δ over G of observations within the same group in P is minimized – excluding trivial solutions that put each observation in a singleton cluster. This definition hinges on δ: the ability to calculate the graph distances between two o1, o2 ∈ O." The following questions emerge:

- What is the definition of a partition?
- What is the newly named graph distance δ?
- Which exact distance, out of all pairs in a group, would be minimized?
- How are trivial solutions to be excluded?

Given this incompleteness, the paper is unready for publication.

### Summary
The authors introduce an attributed-graph clustering scenario where it is of interest to cluster the attributes of the graph rather than the nodes. They propose a pipeline that involves a graph-based attribute distance metric, a graph auto-encoder, dimensionality reduction via TSNE, and a final clustering step. They devise a synthetic benchmark framework to stress-test their approach vs baselines and ablations. They also evaluate the pipeline & alternatives on three real-world datasets from a variety of domains.

### Strengths
(1) The paper's main strength is the novelty of the problem setting. I am not aware of any other approach to clustering that attempts to use an explicit graph over the dimensions. This is an interesting setting and worth exploring.

(2) The paper's simulation study and real data studies are (each) thorough, well-described, and appropriate for evaluation.

### Weaknesses
(1) The paper lacks a clear understanding of how each of the individual modules are used. In some places, there is reason to question the soundness of the modules that are proposed.

(2) The proposed pipeline has unclear efficacy on the real-world datasets. It is not clear to practitioners whether the proposed approach should be used in general, or whether the baselines would suffice.

(3) The authors discuss a scalable estimation of the inverse Laplacian, but they do not check the performance of the approximation in their results.

It is very unclear how the graph auto-encoder (GAE) is applied in the pipeline. A graph autoencoder for attributed graphs performs node feature convolutions over the graph to arrive at a $n \times d_a$ representation of the graph, where $n$ is the number of nodes and $d_a$ is the size of the inner hidden dimension. It is possible to reconstruct an $n\times n$ low-rank estimated graph from this latent representation. We must consider this in light of the authors' statements:
 * Q1: The authors describe the GAE baseline as follows: "GAE: clusters $O$, after passing it through our graph autoencoder, described in Section 2.4". It is not at all clear how one can "cluster $O$" from the output of the GAE. To cluster $O$, you need to cluster the columns of some matrix with column dimension $d(O)$. Since the output of a GAE is either $n\times d_a$ or $n\times n$, it is not at all clear how one can "cluster $O$" after "passing it through" a GAE. Can the authors elaborate?
 * Q2: In S2.4.2, the authors write "We could apply tSNE directly to the GAE output." As above, this lacks a formal description, and it is ambiguous how this could actually be achieved. Again, we would need to apply tSNE to some $k \times d(O)$ matrix, which would result in a tSNE-estimated $2 \times d(O)$ matrix. How does the GAE output allow for this?
 * Q3: Figure 2 implies that somehow the GAE output is used in the distance metric computation. However, this is never described (even vaguely). The formula for the distance metric (given in Section 2.3) includes only the original attribute data $O$ and the inverse laplacian $L^{+}$, which is derived from the original graph $G$. How does the GAE output feed into this?
 * Q4: The authors write "We could apply tSNE directly to the GAE output. However that would mean that tSNE is seeking for the best representation of the data in an Euclidean space, which is not appropriate because we know the dimensions of our observations are related to each other in $G$". The plausibility of this reasoning is hard to evaluate because we don't know how the GAE is being applied. It is quite possible that (depending on how the GAE fed into the tSNE module), tSNE is actually *not* being applied in a "Euclidean" space, because the output of the GAE directly convolves the node features with the graph structure. Can the authors please clarify this statement, as well as the application of GAE itself?

Q5: The only justification the authors give for their distance metric, which is arguably a core part (if not *the* core part) of the contribution, is very weak:

"Previous work shows that this formula gives a good notion of distance between $o_1$ and $o_2$ on a network Coscia (2020). For instance, it can recover the infection and healing parameters in a Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) model by comparing two temporal snapshots of an epidemic."

To the best of my understanding, there is no immediate connection between a metric's ability to estimate SIR parameters and a metric's ability to cluster data well. Can the authors please elaborate their justification for this choice?

Q6: While the approximation to $L^{+}$ seems efficient (see Section 3.4), the authors did not explore how the approximation affects the performance of the algorithm. Could the authors please replicate the simulations and real data analyses using the approximation to $L^{+}$ rather than the exact solution? This would be a welcome addition to the appendix.

Q7: From a methodological perspective, the conclusions that a practioner can draw from the empirical study is very limited. This is because the baselines of the proposed pipeline do almost as well as the pipeline on the real-world data. In particular, for each dataset, two out of the top-3 scoring approaches do not use the proposed graph distance at all. Again on each dataset, ablations that *do* use the graph distance have at-most middle-ranks, and one of the scores for the full pipeline (GAE+GE+tSNE) is near-random performance (see Fig 4(a)). Can the authors further justify the use of their pipeline in light of these results?

If the authors can answer these questions satisfactorily and provide a substantial revision, I might be able to raise my score.

### Summary
This paper proposes a method to cluster a set of network node attributes generated from the same network instead of clustering network nodes.
They measure the network-aware distance between node attribute vectors by the generalized Euclidean distance using the pseudoinverse of graph Laplacian as proposed by Coscia (2020).
Then they perform dimensionality reduction by using tSNE and perform clustering by using DBSCAN. They also propose to apply GAE to clean noise.
Experiments demonstrate that the combination of the generalized Euclidean distance with tSNE improves the quality of clustering obtained from DBSCAN.

### Strengths
- The authors tackle the rather unique problem of clustering node attribute vectors rather than clustering nodes of a network.
- The proposed method is simple and efficient. If the noise is not strong enough then GAE is not needed.

### Weaknesses
 - The theoretical ground of the good clustering performance of GE+tSNE is not clear. It may be to much to say GE+tSNE is a good choice for clustering while still you can say that GE+tSNE is a good choice to visualize graph attribute vectors. 
- The clustering with DBSCAN is performed in two dimensional space. If clustering in such a low dimensional space works, then the data may be too simple and too easy to solve. In fact, the true number of categories, which is the target number of clusters, in LittleSis data is small -- just two: either Republican or Democrat. The true number of categories in Trade Atlas and Tivoli are not reported but may be small as well. 
The findings here might not generalize well to other more complicated datasets.

### Questions
The tSNE has a tunable parameter called perplexity. I would like to know whether the results are robust with different perplexity parameter values.   

It is unclear tSNE is the best choice. The use of tSNE into low, 2 or 3, dimensions may be good for visualization but not for clustering. For clustering,  the use of UMAP into relatively higher dimensions can be a better choice.

### Summary
This paper proposes an effective clustering approach for graphs with node attributes. To clean noise, the proposed approach uses Graph Autoencoder. It then uses t-SNE to reduce the dimensions of attributes. After these processes, it computes clusters by using DBSCAN. The paper conducted experiments to show the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

### Strengths
- The clustering for attributed graphs is an important research problem in the field.
- This paper is well structured and easy to follow.
- The related works are well presented in the paper.

### Weaknesses
 - The proposed approach is a combination of existing methods. 
- The technical depth of the proposed approach is not so deep.
- Simple model to be easily implemented.
- The computational cost of t-SNE and DBSCAN are quadratic to the number of data points, which could be a bottleneck for large graphs.
- The paper lacks a comparison with GNN-based clustering approaches, which are relevant to the problem.
- The experiments use only two real-world datasets, limiting the generalizability of the results.
- The paper does not provide detailed parameter settings for the proposed approach, making it difficult to reproduce the results.

### Questions
I like the paper's motivation; it is quite a fundamental research problem to improve the clustering accuracy of attributed graphs. However, regarding technical depth, the proposed approach is a combination of the previous approach; it is technically somewhat shallow. This paper should show theoretical analyses of the proposed approach. Does the proposed approach have any theoretical properties on the clustering result?

The computational costs of t-SNE and DBSCAN are quadratic to the number of data points. What is the theoretical computational cost of the proposed approach? In addition, from the results shown in Section 3.4, the running time of the proposed approach is less than |V|^2. Please tell me why this happens. 

Although several GNN-based clustering approaches are listed in Section 1, none of them are compared in the experiment. Is the proposed approach more effective than the other approaches? 

The experiments use only two real-world datasets (the Trade Atlas and the Little Sis datasets). Is the proposed approach effective in other real-world datasets?

Even though the proposed approach is a combination of the existing approaches, such as autoencoder, t-SNE, and DBSCAN, their parameter settings are shown in the paper. Please describe the detailed parameter settings.
