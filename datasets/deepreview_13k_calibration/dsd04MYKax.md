## Abstract
An explanation of a machine learning model is considered "faithful" if it accurately reflects the model's decision-making process. However, explanations such as feature attributions for deep learning are not guaranteed to be faithful, and can produce potentially misleading interpretations. In this work, we develop Sum-of-Parts (SOP), a class of models whose predictions come with grouped feature attributions that are faithful-by-construction. This model decomposes a prediction into an interpretable sum of scores, each of which is directly attributable to a sparse group of features. We evaluate SOP on benchmarks with standard interpretability metrics, and in a case study, we use the faithful explanations from SOP to help astrophysicists discover new knowledge about galaxy formation.

### Summary
The authors begin by demonstrating how explanations based on singular feature attributions are not always "faithful" in that the attribution does not actually explain the model's reasoning. The authors propose using groups of features to achieve proper feature attribution. Their proposed technique is SOP (Sum-of-Parts). The authors prove that feature attribution has shortcomings in regards to deletion and insertion errors due to their singular nature and thus feature interaction (which isn't captured). The authors compare their results against four different baselines and provide a case study using their technique to make new discoveries in cosmology.

### Strengths
The approach makes intuitive sense to me. It is very strong in that it can be applied to any sort of backbone model. The theoretical results (not my strong suit) are easy enough to follow. The comparison to other approaches and case study are very persuasive.

### Weaknesses
I found Table 1 very confusing. Certain numbers are bolded and italicized without any explanation as to why (it isn't bolding the best scores). I wish more attention was given to the Group Generator section.

### Questions
1. Please elaborate on the Group Generator portion.

### Summary
A new way to combine predictions of an existing model so that feature attribution is easy. The method uses an existing model to predict the outcome over a subset of features and then aggregates the individual outcomes to get the final prediction. Results show that the method does not lead to accuracy loss compared to the existing model.

### Strengths
- A fresh idea (as far as I can tell) on designing a new way to form model predictions that are interpretable by design. Rather than post-hoc interpretability.
- Results using a cosmology case study that show the practicality of finding groups of features necessary for the algorithm.
- An analysis of insertion and deletion tests that can be used to evaluate interpretability methods.

### Weaknesses
 - The writing can be improved a lot. It took me a long time to figure out whether the paper is proposing an interpretation technique or a model fitting technique. A simple sentence in the abstract, "we modify an existing model to become interpretable, by using its predictions over a subset of features and then aggregating them", will be useful to readers.

- I have many questions about the SOP model since the writing is unclear. Listing them in the questions section.

- While inspiring, the cosmology evaluation feels incomplete. Without a comparison control set (where cosmologists used LIME or some other method), it is not clear whether the benefits from SOP are unique. Also, there is a subtle problem in the conclusion of results: the results only show that _one_ predictive model tends to weigh voids higher than clusters. It does not say anything about the true process. It is possible that there is another model with same accuracy that weights voids and clusters differently. So I'm not sure what is the goal of the cosmology case study--is it to explain a ML model, or is it to understand the DGP/true model?

### Questions
- It is not clear whether the sum-of-parts model requires any weight updates. Will it be better if aggregation parameter C is learnt? Is the backbone model same as an existing model to be explained, or is it a new model? Is the SOP model trained end-to-end or only the backbone is trained and SOP weightes can be inferred?
- Can you take a concrete example (e.g., ImageNet) and describe to readers how exactly you will create the SoP model? 
- Can you recreate Figure 5 using LIME or an existing feature attribution method on a standard non-SOP model? How different are the results?
- Regarding Thm 1 and Thm 2, can you comment on counterfactual explanations? Since they are designed for deletion (but can also be defined for insertion), would they work better for Thm 1 and Thm 2? Would the feature attributions from CF explanations be better than other attributions? (for a discussion on CF explanations versus feature attributions, this paper may be helpful: https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3461702.3462597)

### Summary
This paper proposes a model that aims to operate in an interpretable way on representations extracted by a deep learning model, for the purpose of image classification. The motivation for this model is presented through a few theorems on approximation error of linearized explanations against the underlying functions they seek to approximate, in particular in settings where there are feature interactions. The model itself is a sparse attention-based model on hidden states extracted by a vision model backbone. Experiments are conducted with standard input ablation metrics to compare the “explanations” (automatically generated during the sparse model forward pass) with post-hoc explanations obtained by methods like SHAP. Results on ImageNet and VOC 07 data are favorable to the proposed method, though the margins are slim. Finally, a case study is conducted for deep learning in cosmology, and it is suggested that the method is reliable for uncovering new scientific knowledge.

### Strengths
- Important: The focus on feature interactions is valuable. We should be moving on from linearized feature attributions, and the proposed method aims to do that.
- Important: The case study is ambitious and a great downstream use case of the proposed method. We should see more papers include case studies of their XAI method. It appears that the XAI method suggests conclusions that are consistent with theoretically known results in cosmology, and this is evidence in favor of the proposed method.
- Important: The paper is clearly written and the results are all well presented. Individual design choices are generally well-motivated, e.g. limitations with linear feature attributions pointing toward feature attribution, and the reasoning for grouped feature insertion/deletion.

### Weaknesses
 - Very Important: The experiments should have compared with existing methods that attempt to capture feature interactions, including (1) the cited Tsang et al 2020, (2) prior work on integrated gradients with feature attribution (https://aclanthology.org/2021.acl-long.71/), and (3) non-parametric search methods for insertion/deletion metrics (https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.00786). It has been known for a while that local linear approximations don’t capture feature interactions, and several methods have been proposed for resolving this. The lack of comparison with these methods makes it difficult to assess the novelty and effectiveness of the proposed approach.
- Very Important: The primary quantitative metrics in the paper are not presented with sufficient detail, and this leads to the results being difficult to interpret. Is a .02 improvement of SOP over SHAP good or bad? It sounds very small. Sometimes the improvements are smaller or SHAP outperforms SOP. The paper needs to provide more context for these metrics, such as effect sizes, confidence intervals, or comparisons with baseline performance, to allow the reader to understand the practical significance of the results. The fact that the SOP method is supposed to be faithful by construction but still gets metric scores of .07 or .39, etc. also raises questions about the validity of the evaluation.
- Important: While I like the case study, the conclusions are somewhat mixed. (1) It is said that the method helps cosmologists see that voids are more important for predicting the omega constant than sigma, because the feature attribution is on average 55.4% for omega vs 54% for sigma. Surely this difference is so slight that we cannot conclude much from it. (2) The method’s explanations align with prior domain-specific knowledge (that’s good). (3) It’s said that explanations agree with conclusions from a 2020 study using gradient-based salience, and that it is “important that we find consistent results with our attention-based wrapper.” Why is it important to agree with a fundamentally flawed method from a previous study? The paper should clarify the purpose of this comparison and its implications.
- Important: The proposed method suffers an accuracy tradeoff with using the original deep learning model. The gains in explainability should be very clear in order to justify this. Since the gains in explainability are not very clear, this is a mark against using the proposed sparse attention-based model. The paper should provide a more compelling argument for why the accuracy tradeoff is worthwhile.
- Of Some Importance: I just want to note that I do not think the theoretical analysis adds much to the paper in its current state. We have seen strong impossibility theorems for rich model classes in the past year (e.g. the cited Bilodeau et al 2022 paper). A result showing that a linear model is not a good approximatation of a very nonlinear model, especially in high dimensions, is not very novel. The theoretical analysis should be more focused on the specific limitations of linear feature attribution in the context of feature interactions, and should provide more insight into the proposed method's ability to overcome these limitations.

### Questions
- Do the experiments use the same amount of compute between different explanation methods? Why or why not?
- Another reason it is difficult to interpret the results is that SOP explanations are supposed to be faithful by construction but the explanations get metric scores of .07 or .39, etc. Why not evaluate faithful-by-construction explanations according to a criterion that gives them a perfect score? Then we could compare methods along a Pareto curve showing accuracy vs interpretability tradeoffs among the methods. (I also suspect the reason for this, however, is that a sparse-max attention-based model on deep learning representations is not really close to being as “inherently interpretable” as e.g. a decision tree on tabular data, and the need for automatic quantitative metrics reflects this.)

### Summary
This paper proposes a method for identifying groups of features (instead of individual features) which are important for a model’s prediction. The method trains an additional auxiliary model to reproduce the original model’s prediction. The auxiliary model learns to generate sparse masks (which subset the input’s features in different ways), and these subsetted features are fed into the original model, and output embeddings from each feature subset (mask) are projected and summed to the target. That way, one can see which masks were given a high weight in the prediction, and those masks contain groups of features which have high importance. The authors provide some theoretical justification for why (in certain specific situations), groups of features offer more faithful interpretations than individual features. The authors benchmark against several other local-interpretation methods, and also provide a real-world example from cosmology.

### Strengths
### Good comparison against other methods and use of different datasets

The authors do a good job of showing that their method (SOP) works well to minimize insertion and deletion errors in the face of correlated features using two image datasets. They also show an application of their method in a real-world example of cosmology.

### Weaknesses
### There should be more analyses on the quality/interpretability of the feature groups (masks)

Although the authors have done a good job on showing how their method offers improvements in insertion/deletion faithfulness, there is much less shown about the _quality_ of the feature groups/masks which are learned by SOP. The cosmology example is a good singular anecdote, but a more global analysis is needed to show that the interpretability of the feature groups is good. If the feature groups are very noisy and spread out all over an image (for example), then the method would not be very useful compared to another method which gives more contiguous or otherwise interpretable features. This is one of the core pieces that’s holding this paper back, in my opinion, and it would be great to see: 1) some examples of identified features (i.e. like saliency maps) for some examples of images, comparing SOP with other explanation methods; and 2) a global analysis quantifying the quality of the feature maps, comparing SOP with other explanation methods. It would be great to see if SOP is able to generate feature groups which are faithful but also interpretable (or at least, not significantly less interpretable than other methods).

### Theoretical justification is interesting, but it does not seem entirely applicable to motivate the work

The theoretical justification is certainly appreciated, but it does not appear entirely applicable to this work for a few reasons.

Firstly, Theorem 1, Lemma 1, and Theorem 2 attempt to motivate the identification of feature groups by showing that for some specific models (i.e. multilinear monomial or binomial), there exists an $x$ where for any attributions $\alpha$, there is a subset of features which has high error (exponential in the feature dimension). Importantly, these proofs always assume a fixed $x = \mathbb{1}$. This is just one value of $x$, and even if interpretability is poor for this one value of $x$, one could claim that other values of $x$ might be better, and so focusing on this single instance of $x$ (which is unlikely to appear in real data) is not very strong.

Additionally, even with some given $x$ ($\mathbb{1}$ or otherwise), it might not be realistic to consider the error of the worst possible subset. Not all subsets of features will be useful in interpretation, yet the error of all subsets is being summed together in the objective of the convex program. It may not be realistic to include all such subsets.

Furthermore, Corollary 1 is proven for the case where $x = \mathbb{1}$, and there is no formal justification for a general $x$ or general $p$. This is not a deal-breaker, but it should certainly be clarified that the theoretical motivation is over a toy example. Further justification should also be offered for why it is believed that this toy example can be generalized to real-world data and models. Otherwise, one could claim that all this theoretical justification is unrealistic and therefore inapplicable to the problem that SOP is trying to solve.

### Experiments are limited to images

There are many other data modalities, and it would be nice to see other things outside of image datasets, which have their own biases, and are much easier than other modalities in certain ways. The real-world example, however, helps reduce this limitation of the paper. However, if images are the only data type being considered, it would be more reasonable to adjust the focus of the paper in writing to clarify that the work is focused on image datasets (although it may be tweaked to be applied to other datasets in future work).

On a related note, the paper assumes that the baseline image is the all-black image (all 0), but this is not a general assumption, especially in non-image datasets. Many of the Shapley-value works for interpretability are motivated (in part) by this observation. I don’t expect it to be difficult to adjust the math and the implementation to account for non-zero baselines.

### Some areas in the writing and presentation could be improved
- Equation 1: it would be good to formally define feature attribution $\alpha$; also, the powerset $\mathcal{P}$ is not used anywhere in the equation
- Typo in Equation 8
- In Definition 3, $m_i$ is never used
- Although SOP is being presented as a model-agnostic method, there is some reliance on the model architecture because of the need for a good embedding layer
- The bolding can be misleading in Table 1; the meaning of the italics should be made clear in the caption, and Del of integrated gradients for ImageNet should be bolded
- I did not understand this sentence until the second read of the paper: “In practice, we can initialize the value weight C to the linear classifier of a pretrained model.”
- More details on the architecture would be appreciated in the supplement

### Questions
- In the convex program, what is the optimal $\alpha^{*}$ that is found? Because we are fixing $x = \mathbb{1}$ and $p(x)$, technically we already have a good idea of what the “right” attributions should be, and most configurations of attributions would be highly unreasonable (which general interpretability methods would not identify at all)
- There is certainly a connection to Shapley scores, which have the efficiency property; insertion and deletion error are closely related; having some background on this and explanation would be appreciated
- There may also be a connection to Novello, et. al., 2022 (Making Sense of Dependence: Efficient Black-box Explanations Using Dependence Measure), which identifies feature importances based on masks, as well, although feature groups is not a core focus there
- How does one choose the number of groups G? Once G is selected, are all of the G feature groups identified by SOP meaningful? Is there anything that prevents feature groups from being redundant? How can one select the most meaningful feature groups out of the G?
- More on the problem of redundancy, for a single input example, the same feature can be present in multiple masks/subsets; does this pose an issue for interpretability in this framework?

### Summary
The authors propose an attribution method — SOP — which is based on groupings of features rather than individual features. They first motivate SOP by demonstrating how attributions based on individual features have intrinsic shortcomings. They then described the SOP and showed its superiority over a few popular, existing methods. Finally, they described a case study of using SOP as an XAI method with expert cosmologists!

### Strengths
- The authors presented some theory to motivate their method.
- The method presented is technically sound.
- The real-world use case is worth applauding.

### Weaknesses
 (These are mostly about clarity.)
- The work’s level of novelty can be made much clearer if the authors could spell out the similarity and difference between SOP and some existing methods.
- While the authors explain the high-level rationales of the method and evaluation, I feel that descriptions of some important details are either missing or too terse.
- For the case study, it is unclear to me if the insights were more from SOP or simply from combining a priori knowledge and the outcomes of the model to be explained.

**On relation to existing methods:**

In general, I feel many methods share similar features with SOP’s Group Generator and Group Selector. Thus, it would be good to highlight the similarity and difference so that the reader can better judge the novelty of the approach. In particular, could the authors highlight in more detail how their method is similar and different to RISE and LIME. The masks in RISE seem to be equivalent to the groups in SOP, and RISE also combines the model’s prediction z’s (see Equations 1-6 in the RISE ref). LIME learns the weights on masked areas (see Section 3.4 in the LIME ref). Both methods seem to have some form of Group Generator and Group Selector. I think spelling out the similarities and differences would help a lot.

**On model and evaluation details:**

Reading through Sections 2—4, I gathered the following questions related to the implementation and evaluation of the model. Overall, I feel some important details are missing or unclear in the paper.

Questions on Section 2:
- The powerset P is not used in the equations. Should the last line of page 2 read \Sum{S \in P} instead of just S?
- In Definition 1, I don’t quite understand why the difference is between \Delta f and \sum a. A delta (difference) and a sum seem to be very different quantities to compare. Same question for Definition 2. 
- Why is the range of \alpha_i and f(x) R and not [0,1]? 
- How is the y-axis in Figure 2 calculated? The scale is not what I expected. I was expecting something between 0 and 1, assuming f(x) gives a probability.
- Is the exponential increase in Figure 2 simply a consequence of summing over a powerset of differences (and the size of the powerset grows exponentially with d)? 
- The paper mentions that a linear model achieves 0 error as defined. Is this metric only 0 for linear models? Can a non-linear model have 0 error? Does SOP have 0 error? Perhaps going through the calculation of a simple case would help.
- Could the authors clarify in what sense is SOP more faithful than LIME, RISE, and GradCAM? Perhaps theorems 1 and 2 give the answers already, but I am still not very clear after finishing reading the paper.

Questions on Section 3:
- How are the parameters learned? What’s the objective function and the learning algorithm? 
- How does the Group Generator affect the outcome? For example, does the method work less well if a random generator is used? How about a generator like that used in Bayesian Teaching saliency map (see Methods section in [1])?
- Want more clarity on the definition, construction, and intuition of the W’s, C’s, the sparsemax.
- What does the “, C z^T” (especially the comma) mean in Equation (4)?

[1] Yang, Scott Cheng-Hsin, et al. "Mitigating belief projection in explainable artificial intelligence via Bayesian teaching." Scientific reports 11.1 (2021): 9863.

Questions on Section 4:
- For the insertion and deletion metric, how did the authors choose the features to be removed one at a time from the SOP? Is some kind of averaging over groups done first?
- Similarly, for the group insertion and deletion metric, how did the authors make the groups from the baseline methods? I read Appendix C.2 and can guess what might have been done, but I think it can be described more precisely. In general, it would be good to describe the implementations of the metrics more precisely.
- It will be good to show the curves for the insertion/deletion metric and the grouped versions.

**On the case study:**

It seems to me that the Void and Cluster types are known things to begin with, so it’s unclear how the SOP groups helped provide insight. Also, what is the advantage of looking at the scores/weights c of the Group Selector compared to just using the backbone model’s output z as the scores? In other words, I am still not very clear how the Group Generator offered more insight than the a priori known Void and Cluster, and how the Group Selector offered more insights than just the backbone model’s prediction.

In general, while the SOP may have smaller group deletion and insertion error, it is more complex than a single attribution map. SOP is really also a ML model. This raises the question of how the user should use the SOP. Although the case study offers some indirect hints, it is not very clear to me how I should go about using it.
