## Abstract
Scientific discovery hinges on the effective integration of metadata, which refers to a set of 'cognitive' operations such as determining what information is relevant for inquiry, and data, which encompasses physical operations such as observation and experimentation. This paper introduces the Causal Modelling Agent (CMA), a novel framework that synergizes the metadata-based reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) with the data-driven modelling of Deep Structural Causal Models (DSCMs) for the task of causal discovery. We evaluate the CMA's performance on a number of benchmarks, as well as on the real-world task of modelling the clinical and radiological phenotype of Alzheimer's Disease (AD). Our experimental results indicate that the CMA can outperform previous data-driven or metadata-driven approaches to causal discovery. In our real-world application, we use the CMA to derive new insights into the causal relationships among biomarkers of AD.

### Summary
The paper introduces a novel framework that synergizes the metadata-based reasoning capabilities of LLMs with the data-driven modeling of Deep Structural Causal Models for causal discovery. The authors evaluated the performance on benchmarks and real-world tasks. Real-world tasks were related to modeling the clinical and radiological phenotype of Alzheimer’s Disease. The experimental results indicate that the CMA can outperform previous approaches to causal discovery and derive new insights regarding causal relationships.

### Strengths
- the paper proposes an original approach to causal modeling
 - the paper has a good quality: benchmark and real-world tasks are considered, showing promising results in both cases
 - the paper is well structured and written, making it easy to follow
 - the topic is a relevant topic on which much research is being invested, given the new capabilities and opportunities LLMs provide to causal modeling

### Weaknesses
 - we have not found strong weaknesses in the paper

 - While the authors do a good job regarding the related work, we consider this could be further enhanced by citing surveys that provide an overview of the relevant topics and domains. E.g., the authors may be interested on the following works: (a) for causal deep modelling: Li, Zongyu, and Zhenfeng Zhu.

 - When reporting results in Section 4.1, the authors measure average data likelihood and the deviation. It would be helpful to have some reference value to understand whether the reported values are good or not and why.

 - How is the threshold for DAG-GNN selected?

 - Table 1: align results to the right so that differences in magnitude are quickly visualized.

 - Table 2: add up/down arrows near the reported metrics, indicating greater/lower is better.

 - Table 2: for some algorithms (TCDF, NOTEARS (Temporal), NOTEARS (Temporal)), the authors report results only for the Arctic sea ice dataset, but no clarification is provided as to why no results are reported for the Alzheimer’s disease and Sangiovese datasets.

### Summary
This paper proposes to integrate large language models into causal discovery algorithms for multi-modal data and shows superiority of this model is shown in a number of examples.

### Strengths
The model architecture is convincing and the extensive numerical experiments show strong promise of the proposed method.

### Weaknesses
The generalization performance/robustness of the proposed method is not completely clear. One challenge in causal discovery is the sensitiveness of the learned causal graph towards perturbation of the distributions, in the presence of weak causal link.

### Questions
It could be more convincing to analyze the sensitivity of the proposed model in accordance to perturbation of the input parameters, in particular in the presence of weak causal link.

### Summary
In this paper, the authors devised a causal discovery algorithm that utilizes LLM’s ability on causal reasoning using meta-data. In particular, they proposed Causal Modeling Agent (CMA), which iteratively updates a causal graph through: i) asking LLM for updates on current prediction of edges with previous graph update information; and 2) fitting a model constrained over the intermediately constructed causal graph (using deep learning to model causal mechanism for each variable). Through experiments on benchmark datasets (e.g., Kıcıman et al. (2023)) and a case study of Alzheimer's disease, they empirically demonstrated a potential of their framework outperforming some of causal discovery algorithms and LLMs.

### Strengths
Paper is overall written concisely due to multiple modules involved in the framework. The idea of encoding intermediate results in a JSON format and feeding them into an LLM seems clever.

### Weaknesses
- The use of LLM to tweak intermediate results seems clever but it is hard to assess its technical contribution. 
- It is unknown how LLM is doing with respect to its memory. Does LLM always try to update edges in order to maximize data fitting? If the data fitting is based on the currently predicted causal graphs, how can it improve its causal graph? It does not work like an EM algorithm. Does LLM ‘regret’ its previous decision if fitting becomes worse? Considering developing a causal discovery algorithm that is based on local search (incrementally updating causal graph based on its likelihood), how would you compare their learning trajectories?
- Use of data only to fit the intermediate graph seems not using available dataset in full. Such as conditional independence and other information is all unused.
- LLM’s stochastic nature is ignored. LLM may answer differently for the same question.
- It is essential to thoroughly examine the behavior of LLM. How does it adjust the result based on its belief (GPT-4 etc) and intermediate results passed. There are more questions remained than answered.

- Given that cases with no edges outnumber those with edges, not predicting edges may lead to an increase in accuracy. Thus, a qualitative analysis is necessary since not predicting edges might lead to an increase in the score. Other metrics such as TPR or FDR can be reported.
- Given the abundance of similar papers [1,2] in the field, the contribution is not clear.

I noticed discrepancies between what was mentioned and the results such as the performance of gpt-4 in the table 7 in Kıcıman et al. (2023). For example, NHD of GPT 4 in Kıcıman et al. (2023) was reported as 0.22 but you reported 0.35 for GPT 4 in the table 2 in your paper.

### Questions
The word “metadata” is somewhat used in a mixed manner between domain knowledge already encoded in LLM and memory passed through JSON format. It should be more formally defined. 

Results
Given that cases with no edges outnumber those with edges, not predicting edges may lead to an increase in accuracy. Thus, a qualitative analysis is necessary since not predicting edges might lead to an increase in the score. Other metrics such as TPR or FDR can be reported.

Novelty
Given the abundance of similar papers (Long, S., Piché, A., Zantedeschi, V., Schuster, T., & Drouin, A. (2023). Causal discovery with language models as imperfect experts. arXiv preprint arXiv:2307.02390., Ban, T., Chen, L., Wang, X., & Chen, H. (2023). From query tools to causal architects: Harnessing large language models for advanced causal discovery from data. arXiv preprint arXiv:2306.16902.) in the field, the contribution is not clear.

### Summary
The paper combines the meta-data driven Large Language Models (LLMs) and data-driven Deep Structural Causal Models (DSCMs) to construct a novel framework called Causal Modeling Agent for causal discovery. The framework leverages the LLMs' state-of-the-art capability to capture domain knowledge to discover the causal relationship in DSCMs. The framework is tested against a number of benchmarks on the real-world task of modeling the clinical and radiological phenotype of Alzheimer's Disease (AD), which has a ground-truth causal relationship between the vertices. The experimental results suggest that the CMA outperforms purely data-driven and metadata-driven benchmarks. New insights into the causal relationship among biomarkers of AD have also been obtained by CMA.

### Strengths
1. The idea to combine LLM and SCM is interesting and novel.
2. The experimental results are encouraging.
3. New insights on the causal relationship between biomarkers have been obtained.

### Weaknesses
The contribution would be stronger if further evidence from experimental or observational data can be provided for the discovered causal relationships with the CMA.

### Questions
Can the authors provide further evidence from experimental or observational data for the discovered causal relationships with the CMA?
