## Abstract
Open-vocabulary dense prediction tasks including object detection and image segmentation have been advanced by the success of Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP). CLIP models, particularly those incorporating vision transformers (ViTs), have exhibited remarkable generalization ability in zero-shot image classification.
However, when transferring the vision-language alignment of CLIP from global image representation to local region representation for the open-vocabulary dense prediction tasks, CLIP ViTs suffer from the domain shift from full images to local image regions. In this paper, we embark on an in-depth analysis of the region-language alignment in CLIP models, which is essential for downstream open-vocabulary dense prediction tasks. Subsequently, we propose an approach named CLIPSelf, which adapts the image-level recognition ability of CLIP ViT to local image regions without needing any region-text pairs. CLIPSelf empowers ViTs to distill itself by aligning a region representation extracted from its dense feature map with the image-level representation of the corresponding image crop. With the enhanced CLIP ViTs, we achieve new state-of-the-art performance on open-vocabulary object detection, semantic segmentation, and panoptic segmentation across various benchmarks.

### Summary
The paper proposed to address the problem of adapting vision Transformers pre-trained with image-language alignment (e.g., CLIP) for dense prediction tasks (e.g., object detection, semantic segmentation). The key idea is to distill features from the pre-trained Transformer model itself, in which region representation from a dense feature map matches those from cropped regions (using the pre-trained model). The proposed method was evaluated on multiple open-vocabulary object detection and semantic segmentation benchmarks. The results are solid.

### Strengths
* The paper addressed an important and trendy topic on adapting large-scale pre-trained vision-language models (i.e., foundation models). 

* The paper is well written. Key concepts are clearly described. Technical details are easy to follow. 

* The core idea is well motivated and quite intuitive. 

* The experiments are extensive (three open-vocabulary dense prediction tasks across multiple datasets + ablations). The results are impressive.

### Weaknesses
It is somewhat unclear why the proposed method, which is conceptually simple, can work well. My bet is that the proposed self-distillation encourages localized visual features, i.e., features on the dense map capture local region representations (instead of global image representations). This is partially backed up by Fig 1 (b). The gap between dense features and cropped image features is negligible for CNN (where the features are localized), yet rather significant for ViT. Part of the reason lies in the design of ViT using global attention, where the dense features are diffused in a way that each spot encodes a global image representation. There might be ways to validate this explanation. For example, one possibility is a retrieval experiment using features on the dense maps. Features on dense maps from pre-trained CLIP ViT might yield similar images instead of similar regions, while features after distillation may better retrieve regions. It will be great if the authors can comment on this reasoning here and discuss the key intuition in the paper.

### Questions
If the explanation described in the weaknesses section is true or partially true, it brings two additional questions. 

* First, do those new localized representations (after distillation) still preserve the zero-shot recognition capacity of CLIP? One interesting experiment is to evaluate those features directly for zero-shot object detection / segmentation (e.g., see Table 4 in RegionCLIP). 

* Second, is the proposed method a remedy to a particular design (ViT with global self-attention)? This question is perhaps more fundamental. What if a CLIP model is trained using ViT with local self-attention (e.g., using Swin Transformers)? Will they still benefit from the method? This is much harder to validate directly, as there is no pre-trained models available. Yet one possible alternative is to modify the pre-trained ViT by replacing global attention with local ones, and then train for those open-vocabulary tasks. (Indeed, MaskCLIP can be considered as a special case of this modification, where the global attention at the end is replaced by a local attention of size 1x1.) It will be interesting to see how the proposed method compares to this alternative.

### Summary
In this work, the authors proposed a simple yet effective method for learning fine-grained visual-language representations for open-vocabulary detection and segmentation tasks. Given that the original CLIP-based VIT models have a great degradation of performance for zero-shot fine-grained image understanding, the authors explored a cheap way of refining the visual representation from the original CLIP vision encoder by distilling the image-patch representation to regional dense feature representations. Through such a simple strategy, the region-level visual-semantic representation ability is immediately unleashed. According to the extensive evaluations of different tasks and settings, the refined representations significantly outperform the original ones and other state-of-the-art methods. Overall, I think the proposed method called CLIPSelf is a very simple yet effective way to refine the existing models, which could be a good way of learning better representations for open-vocabulary tasks under low budgets.

### Strengths
1. The proposed method CLIPSelf, distilling CLIP models for fine-grained representation is simple yet effective. It is motivated by an interesting observation in the study of CLIP representation for image-level tasks to region-level tasks. The author also observed that cropping image patches significantly outperform feature pooling for ViT vision encoders. As a result, the authors proposed to distill the fine-grained understanding of visual content in image patches to the regional representations in the hidden feature space.

2. The authors conducted extensive experiments to validate the effectiveness of the proposed methods, spanning from open-vocabulary object detection to semantic segmentation and then panoptic segmentation. It shows that the refined visual-semantic representations by CLIPSelf bring significant gain over the baseline model and also outperform strong previous works.

### Weaknesses
1. There are some related works that already explored the way of distilling patch-level representations to regional feature-level representations, such as ZeroSeg proposed in "Exploring Open-Vocabulary Semantic Segmentation without Human Labels. Chen et al. ICCV 2023". The overall methodology proposed in this work resembles the one in ZeroSeg, in that both attempted to distill the CLIP knowledge from patch to feature map and for open-vocabulary segmentation tasks. The similarity in the core idea raises a concern about the novelty of the proposed approach. Specifically, both methods leverage the patch-level information from a pre-trained CLIP model to enhance the regional feature representations for downstream segmentation tasks. The distinction between the proposed method and ZeroSeg needs to be more clearly articulated, especially in terms of the specific distillation process and the loss functions used. The current explanation of the differences is not sufficiently detailed to fully address this concern.

2. It turns out that the authors only used the COCO training set for distillation. A doubt on this setting is that it is probably very favorable to downstream tasks like COCO detection and segmentation, and ADE20K as well. Though this in-domain distillation brings a significant boost, the authors should have more studies and evaluations on more downstream datasets from various domains and also try using non-COCO training sets for distillation, which seems to be more realistic. The strong performance observed might be a result of overfitting to the COCO dataset during the distillation process. It is crucial to investigate how the proposed method generalizes to other datasets with different characteristics. The lack of experiments on diverse datasets limits the conclusions that can be drawn about the robustness and general applicability of the approach. The authors should have explored datasets that are significantly different from COCO to demonstrate the true potential of the proposed method.

### Questions
Overall,I have two main questions:

1. How to distinguish this work from ZeroSeg regarding the core learning algorithm?

2. Are the improvements over CLIP baselines sourced from in-domain training? What if we use another dataset like CC3M for the distillation?

One minor question:

How to adapt the VIT models to different input image resolutions?

### Summary
This paper presents a simple approach to improve the transferability of CLIP ViT models to open-vocabulary object detection and image segmentation.
While CLIP ViT shows strong performance in image classification (as compared to CLIP ConvNets),
its region-level representation is known to underperform in dense prediction tasks.
The authors first demonstrate this shortcoming through a simple experiment,
then propose a self-distillation approach named CLIPSelf to remedy this.
In their experiments, the authors apply the CLIPSelf procedure to fine-tune the CLIP ViT checkpoints made public by OpenAI,
and then use the fine-tuned weights for open-vocabulary object detection and image segmentation.
Empirical results show that visual representations from CLIPSelf are better than CLIP for dense prediction tasks,
and CLIP ViTs fine-tuned by CLIPSelf procedure are highly competitive on open-vocabulary detection benchmarks like COCO and LVIS.

### Strengths
**Note:**
I reviewed this paper for the NeurIPS 2023 conference.
I will contextualize my current review based on the changes the authors have made since their previous submission.
The main idea of CLIPSelf has been unchanged since NeurIPS 2023 submission --
the authors have significantly revamped the experimental study with more suitable benchmarks and baselines,
and added more implementation details in the draft.

I identified some key strengths of the proposed approach in the NeurIPS 2023 submission, they still apply to the current submission:

- The proposed approach (CLIPSelf) is conceptually simple and shows large improvements over CLIP on multiple evaluations shown in the paper.
- CLIPSelf does not require any form of annotations beyond just images, this relaxation simplifies the data and modeling pipeline.
- Authors have performed comprehensive evaluations with multiple downstream tasks involving dense predictions to show the versatility of the proposed approach.

I find notable other strengths in the current submission:

- Empirical results on open-vocabulary detection are quite strong. CLIPSelf outperforms prior works that use equivalent frozen backbones (e.g. F-VLM, CORA).
- More notably, CLIPSelf outperforms the recent work of RO-ViT which proposes training a new backbone catered to downstream task _from scratch_.
  I find this result particularly appealing as it shows that CLIPSelf can lightly adapt a wide range of publicly available checkpoints that were trained with relatively less consideration for the particular task of open-vocabulary object detection.
- The writing clarity has also improved in this submission.

### Weaknesses
My review mainly contrasts the previous submission (NeurIPS 2023) with the current ICLR 2024 submission --
since the main story of the paper is mostly unchanged, I do not find any significant outstanding concerns.

I have a few outstanding concerns and suggestions, which may further improve the paper.
I am curious to hear the authors' thoughts on these and am willing to engage in the discussion:

1.  **Is self-distillation on task dataset (COCO) necessary?**
Main CLIPSelf experiments use images from COCO/LVIS dataset to perform self-distillation.
The authors should consider disentangling the impact of self-distillation in isolation,
as compared to self-distillation using images from the target downstream task.
If CLIPSelf does not _require_ COCO images, then it strengthens the contribution --
the authors may call for future works to "fine-tune" their CLIP ViT for an additional epoch to improve their out-of-the-box usability for dense prediction tasks.
It would be even better if CLIP ViTs retain their original zero-shot classification and retrieval performance after such self-distillation.
If the authors wish to do this experiment in the rebuttal, they may consider a large dataset of diverse unlabeled images
(e.g. images from datasets with approx. 10-20 million samples like Conceptual Captions, RedCaps, YFCC-15M, Segment Anything dataset, etc.)

2.  **Accounting for the 'padding' patches during distillation.**
Current state-of-the-art object detectors using plain ViTs (e.g. ViTDet and SAM) typically pad input images to a square.
Any non-square input images are made square by adding zero pixels to the right and bottom after color normalization.
Pre-trained CLIP ViTs have not seen such patches so they encounter a train-test mismatch if they are kept frozen in the object detector.
Have the authors considered randomly adding padding regions to image patches while performing self-distillation?
I believe that accounting for this detail will ease the adaptation of CLIP ViTs for open-vocabulary object detection.

### Questions
Minor questions and suggestions:

- Figure 3 (b) non-standard word use: "initiate" -> "initialize"
- Figure A2 caption is incorrect: "image segmentation" -> "object detection"

### Summary
This paper proposes CLIPSelf, which is a method to adapt ViT based CLIP model trained on full images to dense prediction tasks. CLIPSelf distill a student ViT model that has good region representation from its dense feature map from a teacher ViT model that only has good full image features. Specially, CLIPSelf aligns the dense feature maps with the teacher model at crops of an image. 

The proposed methods show good performance in standard benchmarks for open-vocabulary object detection, semantic segmentation and panoptic segment. It is reported to be stronger in the main metrics of the respective benchmarks to be stronger than many recent works, under the same or similar settings.

One interesting advantage of this work is that it does not need region-text pairs for training per se, unlike some recent methods such as RegionCLIP. Nevertheless, combining CLIPSelf (as pretraining step) with RegionCILP (region-text pairs for finetuning) results in further improvements for open-vocabulary detection on OV-COCO.

### Strengths
The main strengths of the paper are

* The paper is clearly written. It has sufficient details in the main text to reproduce the method.
* The motivation of the paper is clearly presented. The paper includes an interesting analysis on the zero-shot image classification capability using image feature and region features, using CLIP ViT and CLIP CNN, respectively. The analysis shows that CLIP ViT has much better image features for zero-shot classification, but much worse dense features for the same task. This suggests that CLIP ViT has the potential to be much stronger than its CNN counterpart, but requires additional work to adapt the full image features to dense features.
* The proposed CLIPSelf is fairly simple yet seems to be quite effective in improving the dense feature of CLIP models. This is evident in the various results on standard benchmarks from Table 3-7. The proposed CLIPSelf method seems to be among the strongest methods in standard settings in the listed benchmarks, and can improve existing methods when the CLIP pre-trained with the CLIPSelf target replaces vanilla CLIP models.
* The details in the design of CLIPSelf have been tested carefully by ablation studies. For example, the design to use randomly sampled patches in distillation is validated by the results of classifying stuff masks.

### Weaknesses
The main weaknesses of the paper are

* This paper does not include any studies on windowed attention based methods, such as Swin V2. This seems to have weakened the case for CLIPSelf, due to following reasons.

  * In a sense, the analysis that compares CILP ViT and CLIP CNN can also be interpreted as "CNN is more suited for dense prediction tasks". Recent empirical studies do overwhelmingly show that transformer based model outperforms CNN based models in many computer vision tasks, including dense prediction tasks. From the analysis, it appears that CILPSelf is most helpful with backbones that does not have translation equivariance built-in. But many (if not most) best models for dense predictions tasks still use backbones that have this useful properties for dense predictions (e.g. Swin V2). In fact, that is the choice for some of the best recent open-vocabulary detectors, such as GLIP (v2) and grounding DINO. The choice to only study ViT backbones leave two obvious questions open: (1) Can CLIPSelf similarly benefit Swin-based backbones? (2) How does the current method compare to SOTA methods based on Swin v2, such as GLIP and grounding DINO? 
  * The square focus on ViT backbones also makes it harder, in certain cases presented in the experiments section, to interpret the comparison with prior methods. For example, in Table 3, CLIPSelf uses either ViT-B/16 or ViT-L/14 backbones. However, most of the cited methods are either from CNN backbone or Swin V2. In a few instances where the prior methods are based on ViT, the particular ViT variant is different from the two with CILPSelf.

### Questions
- I would like to see comparisons with GLIP, GLIP v2 and Grounding DINO.
- I would like to see if the proposed method can only improve on ViT based backbones.
