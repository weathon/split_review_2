## Abstract
Generative models can be categorized into two types: explicit generative models that define explicit density forms and allow exact likelihood inference, such as score-based diffusion models (SDMs) and normalizing flows; implicit generative models that directly learn a transformation from the prior to the data distribution, such as generative adversarial nets (GANs). While these two types of models have shown great success, they suffer from respective limitations that hinder them from achieving fast sampling and high sample quality simultaneously.  In this paper, we propose a unified theoretic framework for SDMs and GANs. We shown that: i) the learning dynamics of both SDMs and GANs can be described as a novel SDE named Discriminator Denoising Diffusion Flow (DiffFlow) where the drift can be determined by some weighted combinations of scores of the real data and the generated data; ii) By adjusting the relative weights between different score terms, we can obtain a smooth transition between SDMs and GANs while the marginal distribution of the SDE remains invariant to the change of the weights; iii) we prove the asymptotic optimality and maximal likelihood training scheme of the DiffFlow dynamics; iv) under our unified theoretic framework, we introduce several instantiations of the DiffFLow that provide new algorithms beyond  GANs and SDMs with exact likelihood inference and have potential to achieve flexible trade-off between high sample quality and fast sampling speed.

### Summary
This paper introduces a unifying framework for score-based diffusion models and GANs. It relies on a stochastic differential equation, called DiffFlow, that incorporates the gradient of the log ratio between a noisy data distribution and the generated distribution. This term being associated to an optimal vanilla GAN discriminator, DiffFlow describes a discriminator-guided dynamics, assimilated to GANs in the paper. DiffFlow also directly encompasses standard score-based models, which can be obtained starting from the GAN dynamics via a smooth interpolation. This unifying framework allows the authors to introduce several new hybrid generative modeling algorithms, and to describe a convergence result for the general dynamics of DiffFlow.

### Strengths
The paper tackles a **well motivated and relevant topic**: the links between GANs and score-based diffusion models. Given the usual opposition between both methods in the literature, as highlighted in the paper through the prism of explicit vs implicit models, unifying both of them in a single framework is **interesting** as it opens up potentially fruitful areas of research.

The unifying equation DiffFlow and its dual interpretation between GANs and diffusion models is **novel**, providing a new non-conventional perspective on both models. Some of the introduced algorithms, like Diffusion-GAN, are original as well. To my understanding (up to mathematical details in the appendix that I could not thoroughly check), **the theoretical derivations seem correct**.

Finally, the derivations in the paper are, for the most part, **clearly written** (except Section 3.3, cf. weaknesses). The core ideas and intuitions of the paper are well presented, especially regarding the details of the particular cases of DiffFlow which are well articulated between each other.

### Weaknesses
Unfortunately, this paper suffers from important weaknesses that, for some of them, would require significant changes for future acceptance, thus motivating my recommendation of a "reject". I look forward to discussing with the authors and other reviewers on this topic.

### Overclaiming Results

As it is currently written, the paper suffers from **strong overclaiming** of its results. Clarifying the claims and adjusting them so that they are properly supported by theoretical or empirical evidence is a necessity.

Let me recall the stated "research question" of p. 2, to which the authors provide a "positive response".
> Can we develop a unified theoretical framework for GANs and SDMs that allows for a flexible trade-off between high sample quality and fast sampling speed, while enabling exact likelihood inference?

The unifying framework does exist, but there is no element supporting the rest of the claim in the paper. While there are new introduced algorithms, **their properties are not assessed with any experiment**. Moreover, to my understanding, there is no concrete discussion as to why the framework enables exact likelihood inference in its general case (and in particular, for GANs).

Furthermore, the unifying framework only encompasses derivations of the vanilla GAN model from Goodfellow et al. (2014), and not all GANs (like Wasserstein GANs, for example). This should be explicitly stated, starting from the abstract.

### Incomplete and Unclear Link with GANs

An important weakness of the paper and presented framework is the link of DiffFlow with GANs in Section 3.3. While central in the paper's claims and contributions, **the link with GANs is loose and presented in an unclear fashion**.

Firstly, **the development of Section 3.3 is incomplete** to fully understand the presented contribution, as it misses in particular details on how to handle the generator. The development in Appendix Section B should be moved in the main paper for completeness.

Secondly and more importantly, even taking into account Appendix Section B, **the link with GANs remains loose**. The paper does establish that the gradient of the log ratio corresponds to an optimal vanilla GAN discriminator. However, how this can be articulated with GAN generators is left unfinished in the appendix: for example, Equations 27 and 28 only deal with the evolution of generator parameters w.r.t. training time. This does not correspond to Equations 12 or 13 in the main paper, hence to DiffFlow.

This problem is illustrated by Appendix Section K on framing TPDM (Zheng et al., 2022) using the DiffFlow equation. The authors split the generating equation of DiffFlow into two parts: one with discriminator-guided dynamics (assimilated to the first step of TPDM), and one with score-guided dynamics (the second step of TPDM). Yet, in TPDM, the first step is not a discriminator-guided dynamics, but simply a forward pass through a generator, which is not encompassed in the proposed framework.

### Overclaiming Novelty

While the theoretical results seem correct, their presentation is flawed as **it lacks contextualization w.r.t. already existing works**, making them appear more innovative than they actually are. I detail this issue in the following.
- Proposition 1, to my understanding, is similar to results already obtained by Song et al. (2021) [3], who already needed to compute the variance of the marginal distributions.
- The noise-corrupting strategies for Vanilla GANs mentioned in Appendix Sections B and C are strongly linked to preexisting works leveraging noise to regularize the discriminator, e.g. instance noise (Sønderby et al., 2017) and diffusion GANs (Wang et al., 2023) [4].
- Proposition 2 is a direct consequence of the Fokker-Planck equation (see e.g. Jordan et al., 1998). The result may be lesser known in the generative modeling community, but, given the lack of technical novelty, this should be explicitly stated.
- By Proposition 2, I believe that the convergence results (minimization of the KL and Theorem 1) are direct consequences of the fact that the studied dynamics is equivalent to the well known Langevin dynamics; cf. Jordan et al. (1998) and the extensive literature on this topic.

### Minor Issues

Less importantly than the above weaknesses, the paper could benefit from further polishing to improve its factualness and readability.
- In the abstract and later in the paper, the authors state that DiffFlow describes "the learning dynamics of both SDMs and GANs". This is incorrect since it does not describe the learning dynamics of SDMs, instead it does describe their generation process.
- It is not clear to me how Remark 1 makes the convergence result of Theorem 1 directly applicable to the general DiffFlow equation.
- The organization of the paper is difficult to follow as some of the main contributions listed in the introduction are relegated to the appendix. All contributions should clearly appear in the main paper. The appendix should also appear in the same file as the main paper.
- The authors state in Section 2.2 that "the training dynamics of GANs are unstable due to the high non-convexity of the generator and discriminator". Explaining instabilities in the training dynamics of GANs remains an open problem, so this statement should be supported with a reference.
- It is not clear how the drift term $f$ can be assimilated to regularization / weight decay.
- It seems that the first two equations of p. 7 are the same.
- Remarks on the form:
  - subsubsection 3.3.1 should not exist as it is the only one of its subsection;
  - all equations should be numbered;
  - the acronym SLCD is not explained in the main paper;
  - the paper Song et al., marked as 2020b in the paper, was actually published in 2021;
  - the name diffusion GANs is already taken by Wang et al. (2023) [4], cf. the "novelty" section of this review.

### Post-Rebuttal

I thank the authors for their response. This response was posted very close to the end of the discussion period, so I will not be able to discuss it with the authors. Nonetheless, I would like to state how and why their response does not affect my recommendation.

#### Overclaiming Results

I acknowledge that the authors clarified their scope on GAN models and removed claim (iii). However, I still contest claim (ii). No part of the introduced framework provides fast sampling, as the generator is left out of the discussion; cf. the next section.


#### Incomplete and Unclear Link with GANs

The authors did not address my concern. The paper assimilates the inference of a GAN (pushforward generator) with its training dynamics (related to the discriminator-guided particle dynamics as already noted by Monoflow, but which cannot be seen as fast sampling) to support their claims. This assimilation is misleading and leads to an incorrect interpretation of TPDM as following a single inference dynamics.

Moreover, the link with GANs remains incomplete both in the main paper and in the appendix. If this link is already supported by Monoflow, I would suggest the authors to precisely describe this link in the main paper instead relying on an incomplete discussion in the appendix. In the current state of the paper, the link remains loose and its articulation with Monoflow is unclear. More generally, the paper relies too much on its appendix; the main paper should be more self-contained.


#### Overclaiming Novelty

The authors acknowledged parts of my concerns regarding overclaiming of novelty. However, they maintained their claim on Langevin convergence, which I have to contest. Langevin dynamics have been extensively studied outside the scope of generative modeling, and, to the best of my knowledge and without further clarification, the presented result is a straightforward application of the literature in Langevin sampling; see for example Proposition 1 by Durmus & Mouline (2018). The smoothing of the data distribution to ensure convergence already existed in the first iterations of score-based diffusion models as well. Furthermore, it is still unclear how this convergence results can be easily extended to more general dynamics; the added comment in the revision should be more explicit.

### Questions
Cf. the *Weaknesses* part of the review for questions related to paper improvements.

Without consequence on my opinion of the paper, for future versions, I would suggest the authors to discuss the differences with the contemporaneous work of Franceschi et al. (2023) as both this paper and their work have overlapping contributions.

### Summary
This work provides a unfied formulation of the data generation process of GAN and score-based diffusion model using a SDE, named DiffFlow; variants of score-based diffusion model, langevin algorithm, and GAN simply correspond to specific choice of weighting function presents in DiffFlow. Moreover, a big contribution of this DiffFlow framework is that it naturally leads to several new algorithms that can potentially obtain the advantage of both GAN (fast sampling) and diffusion models (exact likelihood inference and high-quality samples). Finally, several theoretical results are provided to show the convergence of the marginal distributions of the SDE.

### Strengths
- The formulation and motivation of the unified SDE is clear.

- The proposed DiffFlow formulation leads to a natural design of DiffFlow-GAN algorithm; based on the discussion provided by the authors in appendix C, this formulation also offers explanations and solutions on the instability of vanilla GAN trainning.

- This work contain an extensive set of theoretical analysis to the SDE.

### Weaknesses
 - Presentation: Even though the overall formulation of DiffFlow is clear, the reasoning of why such formulation is useful requires is not comprehensive. In particular,  the presentation about the diffusion-GAN algorithm and convergence analysis of DiffFlow is not well structured; many insightful discussions about the trianing of GAN, psudocode of the actual algorithm, further theoretical results, and etc. are deferred to appendix, making readers questioning the real contribution of the proposed algorithm and theory.

Although I understand that the current organization of materials are largely due to the page limiation, it is possible to make the presentation more complete by emphasizing on important contributions.  In my prespective, this work can benefit siginificantly from the following strategies: (1) rearrange the material in Section 3 heavily, e.g, move the majority of 3.2 into the appendix, and dedicate more space for the Diffusion-GAN algorithm; (2) It might be better to just state the informal versions and offer intuitive explanations of major theorems in maintext without getting into details about technical lemmas and assumption, and defer the formal statements and conditions to appendix. 


- Lack of experiments: it is generally not fair to ask for experiments on theory-oriented paper. However, a major selling point of such formulation is that it leads to a natural design of the diffusion-GAN method. Pariticularly, given the extensive discussion of the advantage of DiffFlow over vinilla GAN in appendix C, it is important to provide empirical verification on the performance of DiffFlow-GAN.

### Summary
They proposed Discriminator Denoising Diffusion Flow (DiffFlow), which unifiies the explicit generative model and implicit generative model. They theoretically showed that single noise-level Langevin dynamics, score-based diffusion models, and generative adversarial networks can be expressed with the general framework they propose.

### Strengths
Originality: They proposed an object function that theoretically integrates GANs and SDMs.

Quality: Written in detail so that even unfamiliar readers can understand.

Clarity: Very well written and easy to read.

Significance: While there have been many studies attempting to integrate GANs and SDMs, theoretical explanations have been lacking, but this paper's theoretical part is very rich.

### Weaknesses
It is true that it was expressed very well in theory, but it failed to show the experimental results. If the object of the proposed DiffFlow model was truly an integration of GANs and SDMs, confirmation was needed through experimental results.

### Questions
Are there any experimental results that can be shown through this object?

### Summary
The goal of this paper is to unify the benefits of GANs and Diffusion models into a single model. In particular, GANs are efficient samplers, requiring only one pass of a neural network whereas diffusion models require multiple steps of denoising. Thus, this work derives a stochastic differential equation that encompasses the unification. In particular, there are weighting parameters that yield a smooth transition between GANs and diffusion models. Asymptotic convergence guarantees are also provided along with showing explicit instantiations such as TDPM as special cases.

### Strengths
- This paper provides an elegant unification of diffusion models and generative adversarial networks, which are two dominating methods for deep generative modelling, both of which are of great practical significance.
- The unification is more than just a simple weighted combination as exemplified by the marginal preserving property.
- Existing frameworks are demonstrated to be instantiations of this unification such as TDPM, VP SDE, DDPM etc. attesting to the generality of the claims made.
- Convergence guarantees are then given.

### Weaknesses
 - It seems the instantiation to GANs is given via the coarse approximation which is not as direct and also is based on the density ratio. Some more popular GAN methods do not admit a density ratio perspective such as IPM-based GANs such as Wasserstein GAN, etc.

Minor weaknesses:
- Convergence rates are not given and only an asymptotic guarantee. While this would be difficult to achieve in general, it would be interesting to see how the weighting parameters play a role in the convergence rate.
- There are no experimental studies on more novel / unique choices of weighting parameters. Due to the space requirements however, this is understandable.

### Questions
- Is there a way to consider more general GAN frameworks beyond the vanilla GAN? such as Wasserstein GANs or non-saturating GANs.
- There are other methods that use discriminators with diffusion models as a refining process [1]. Can you comment on how such a method relates to the unification provided in this paper?
- Is there any comment you can provide about how different weighting parameters will affect convergence?
- Can you provide more concrete guidance for practitioners willing to use this method and how the weighting parameters inform various choices in practice for different domains?
