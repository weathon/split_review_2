## Abstract
Memorization with neural networks is to study the expressive power of neural networks to interpolate a finite classification data set, which is closely related to the generalizability of deep learning. However, the important problem of robust memorization has not been thoroughly studied. In this paper, several basic problems about robust memorization are solved. First, we prove that it is NP-hard to compute neural networks with certain simple structures, which are robust memorization. A network hypothesis space is called optimal robust memorization for a data set if it can achieve robust memorization for any budget less than half the separation bound of the data set. Second, we explicitly construct neural networks with O(N n) parameters for optimal robust memorization of any data set with dimension n and size N . We also give a lower bound for the width of networks to achieve optimal robust memorization. Finally, we explicitly construct neural networks with
O(N n log n) parameters for optimal robust memorization of any binary classification data set by controlling the Lipschitz constant of the network.

### Summary
The paper studies the complexity and necessary conditions of robust memorization for ReLU networks. Since it is NP-hard to decide whether there exists a small network which is a robust memorization of a given dataset with a robust budget, studying necessary conditions is very important. Two important results are given in the paper. Let n be the input dimension and N be the number of datapoints. First, under a reasonable setting, a network with width smaller than n can not be robust memorization for some dataset and robust budget. Furthermore, there exists a network with width $3n+1$ and depth $2N+1$, and $O(Nn)$ nonzero weights such that a robust memorization is achieved. However, in this case, the values of the parameters can go to infinity when the robust budget is increased. To address this case, the second important result of this paper utilizes a deeper network to guarantee a bounded Lipschitz constant of the network, provided that the underlying classification problems are binary. The depth in this case is increased by a factor of $log(n)$.

### Strengths
- Originality: Most existing memorization bounds are derived without optimal robustness. Given that importance of robustness, the proposed necessary conditions for ReLU networks are novel and interesting.

- Quality and clarity: This paper gives a comprehensive presentation on the existence of of ReLU networks that have robust memorization. The background knowledge is well-organized, and the theoretical results are presented in a flow that is easy to follow and understand.

- Significance: The family of ReLU networks is an important architecture and understanding the limitations of memorization is crucial. The new estimate $O(Nn)$ is an improvement over Theorem 2.2 in (Li et at., 2022) in the sense that it achieves stronger robustness with less number of parameters without assuming binary classification.

### Weaknesses
 - The paper is mainly dedicated to the existence of robust training. No results on optimization or robust generalization are derived. Given that, the scope seems to be quite limited.

- Since overparameterization can often lead to powerful memorization and good generalization performance, the necessary conditions may have stronger implications if they are connected to generalization bounds. It is not clear in the paper that the constructions of ReLU networks for robust memorization would lead to robust generalization. I know the authors acknowledge this in the conclusion, but I think this is a very serious question.

- The main theorems 4.8 and 5.2 only guarantee the existence of optimal robust memorization. These results would be more useful if an optimization or constructive algorithm is given to find the optimal memorization.

### Questions
1. The Theorem 2.2 in (Li et al., 2022) is derived for $p>=2$. However, the bound given in Theorem 4.8 is only valid for the infinity norm. The authors may want to point out that in the paper. The bound given by Theorem B.3 seems to be a bit worse than the bound given by Theorem 2.2 in (Li et al., 2022). I think it would be also helpful to compare such a case in the main text. What are the main difficulties for deriving bounds under $p$-norm?

2. Given that the existence of optimal robust memorization is guaranteed under a ReLU network with bounded size, would it be possible to arrive at such a solution using any optimization algorithm? What would be the complexity of such an algorithm?

### Summary
The authors study memorization with neural networks and its connection to deep learning. It emphasizes the significance of "robust memorization," which hasn't been thoroughly explored. The passage mentions the NP-hardness of computing certain network structures for robust memorization and introduces the concept of "optimal robust memorization." It highlights the explicit construction of neural networks with specific parameter counts for optimal memorization. There's also a mention of a lower bound on network width and controlling the Lipschitz constant to achieve robust memorization in binary classification datasets. It is a technical paper addressing these aspects of neural network memorization and generalization. However, it does not provide a clear path for interested readers to understand them.

### Strengths
The strengths of the provided passage are its technical depth, problem formulation, explicit solutions, and mention of a lower bound. It delves into the complexities of neural network memorization, introduces a significant problem in deep learning, provides practical solutions, and hints at valuable insights for network design.

### Weaknesses
It is highly technical and requires a strong background in readers to grasp the meaning of this paper.



### Questions
The authors may think about the organization of this paper. ICLR may not be a suitable conference for this paper.

### Summary
The paper studies the problem of robust memorization, namely exactly fitting the training data while keeping the same prediction in a small neighborhood of each training data. In its first result, it shows that it is NP-hard to compute a robust memorization of the simple network of depth 2 and width 2. It then provides a necessary condition on the width, depth and number of parameters for the existence of robust memorization. It further constructed a neural network which is a robust memorization.

### Strengths
It extends the prior results (Li et al 2022) on robust memorization from $\lambda/4$ to any value strictly less than $\lambda/2$.

The number of parameters in the constructed neural network which is a robust memorization does not depend on the separation bound $\lambda_D$ or the robust budget $\mu$.

The paper is well-organized and clearly written.

### Weaknesses
1. The term “optimal robust memorization” is inappropriate, and might be misleading and over-claims the significance of the work. Note that robust memorization with radius $< \lambda_D/2$ is not significantly different from that with radius $< \lambda_D/4$, except it is a bit larger neighborhood. This is because $\lambda_D$ is just the minimal distance, not necessarily the distance for every pair of data samples. Hence, even in the case of the so-called “optimal” $\lambda_D/2$-robust memorization, there are still many regions that are not covered by the robust-neighborhoods, and it can be non-robust in those areas. Therefore, $\lambda_D/2$-robust memorization does not really make much difference than the  $\lambda_D/4$-robust memorization. (The word “optimal” only reflects it is the largest radius in the minimal separation based analysis, however, as I mentioned above, it is far from an optimal robust memorization). Therefore, I would consider the contribution of this paper is on enlarging the robust memorization region, which is limited.

2. It seems to me that some results are not consistent. Proposition 4.7 part 2 already infers that depth 2 width 2 network is not a robust memorization. However, Theorem 4.1 claims that it is NP-hard. I hope the authors can clarify on this point. 

3. The discussion below Theorem 1.1 is not quite correct. It somehow avoided the case that the absence of memorization implies the absence of robust memorization. Hence, it is not totally “cannot be deduced from each other”.

### Questions
I would like to see some intuition on why the number of non-zero parameters does not depend on $\lambda_D$, $L$ and $\mu$. Especially, a comparison with the prior work of Li. et. al. 2022.
