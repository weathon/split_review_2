## Abstract
We study data distillation for auto-regressive machine learning tasks, where the input and output have a strict left-to-right causal structure. More specifically, we propose \sampler, which summarizes an event sequence dataset into a small number of \emph{synthetic} sequences --- \samplerdata \ --- which are optimized to maintain (if not improve) model performance compared to training on the full dataset. Under the hood, \sampler conducts memory-efficient data distillation by (i) deriving efficient reverse-mode differentiation of the Adam optimizer by leveraging Hessian-Vector Products; and (ii) factorizing the high-dimensional discrete event-space into a latent-space which provably promotes implicit regularization. Empirically, for sequential recommendation and language modeling tasks, we are able to achieve $98-120$\% of downstream full-data performance when training state-of-the-art models on \samplerdata of size as little as $0.1$\% of the original dataset. Notably, being able to train \emph{better models with significantly less data} sheds light on the design of future large auto-regressive models, and opens up new opportunities to further scale up model and data sizes.

### Summary
This paper proposes FARZI, a data distillation method for auto-regressive ML tasks/event-sequence datasets. The method summarizes a large dataset into a set of synthetic sequences in latent space which can be decoded later. They show that model performance is upheld/enhanced when compared to training on the complete dataset on the downstream tasks of sequential recommendation and language modeling. For data distillation, the paper shows Adam to be better than SGD as inner loop optimizer, and derives an efficient reverse mode differentiation of Adam such that its memory complexity is independent of the number of inner loop steps.

### Strengths
- Originality and Significance: The latent parametrization that makes FARZI optimization friendly, and the proposed trick that enables reverse mode differentiation of Adam such that its memory complexity is independent of the number of inner loop steps are great contributions and of practical value.
- Quality and Clarity: The paper is well written with extensive experiments whose details and evaluations are that are clearly described. The results are impressive. The method is able to achieve better performance on downstream tasks compared with using the full dataset.

### Weaknesses
 - It is not clear whether this method will be practical and scale for larger language models and larger datasets. Specifically, the paper does not address the computational cost associated with the inner loop optimization of the latent sequences, and how this cost scales with the size of the dataset and the complexity of the auto-regressive model. The memory requirements for storing and updating the latent sequences during the distillation process are also not discussed in detail, which is a crucial factor when dealing with large datasets and models.
- There is not a clear analysis of the total time gains of this method in comparison with training from scratch. While the paper demonstrates that the distilled dataset can achieve comparable or better performance, it does not quantify the actual time saved during the training process. It would be beneficial to see a breakdown of the time spent on the distillation process versus the time saved on downstream training, including the wall-clock time for both phases. This is important to understand the practical benefits of using this method.

### Summary
The paper introduces FARZI, a data distillation framework for machine learning tasks. The goal is to condense the original large dataset into a much smaller number of synthetic sequences, so that downstream performance on the synthetic data matches (or even improves) performance on the full real dataset. The authors cast the problem using a bi-level optimization formulation, similar to meta-model matching based dataset distillation. The naive formulation is infeasible due to the very large token vocabulary and the maximum sequence length. To address this, the authors propose to factorize the synthetic dataset into a latent data summary and a token-decoder matrix. This renders the optimization continuous (as opposed to discrete), while it provides flexibility to sample synthetic sentences from a distribution (as opposed to having a fixed small set of synthetic sentences). Furthermore, the authors suggest to replace SGD in the inner loop by the Adam optimizer. To mitigate the large memory footprint, they derive an efficient approximation for reverse-model differentiation of the Adam optimization. The authors assess FARZI on sequential recommendation and language modeling tasks, where they manage to match or even exceed the downstream full-data performance using as little as 0.1% of the original dataset. The authors conduct several experiments and ablation studies to shed light on various aspects of their framework.

### Strengths
The paper makes several interesting contributions. The meta-model matching based dataset distillation was originally proposed for continuous data (e.g., image data), as opposed to language data that use discrete tokens. The use of a latent space addresses this challenge by ensuring that the optimization can be performed in a continuous space, but by also allowing us to sample the synthetic sentences from a compact distribution. Furthermore, the observation that the Adam optimizer is a much better choice for the inner loop optimization (compared to SGD) is very interesting and dramatically improves downstream performance. To address the large memory footprint, the authors derive an efficient approximation of the reverse-mode differentiation of the Adam optimizer, which nicely complements their finding that Adam is better than SGD. Interestingly, this may be more broadly applicable in other bi-level optimization tasks (e.g., in a meta-learning context).

The paper is well written and the related work is covered quite extensively. The authors describe in detail the various insights of their framework. When it comes to the experimental evaluation, they provide a lot of information on the metrics, datasets, hyperparameters, objectives, and even architectures.

The experimental evaluation is quite convincing and supports the claims made by the authors. It is very interesting that FARZI can even outperform downstream performance on the full original dataset, which could indicate the improved robustness with dataset distillation. I liked the fact that the authors investigated various aspects of FARZI, such as the versatility of the synthetic data, the cross-architecture generalization, the performance of different meta-objectives, the cold start problem, and the impact of pre-trained trajectories.

### Weaknesses
1. Even though this paper makes interesting contributions to the DD literature for autoregressive tasks, it is not so obvious that it would be 
very helpful for much larger text corpora and large language models with millions or billions of parameters. The memory footprint might end up being very large, rendering the whole framework infeasible. Furthermore, a compression rate of 0.1% may not be extremely helpful for very large datasets consisting of billions of sentences. This may limit the applicability of FARZI to settings consisting of "reasonably large but not very large" language corpora.

2. It was not clear to me how time-consuming the FARZI dataset generation process is. For example, how long did it take to generate the synthetic datasets for the tasks considered in this work? In particular, did FARZI improve the total runtime? For instance, if generating the synthetic data takes very long, then there may be very little benefit (if any) from this process. Furthermore, it is not automatically obvious that a smaller dataset can be trained faster than a larger one. There is the added question of the number of epochs required to reach convergence. The synthetic dataset may require more rounds. This was not obvious in the experimental evaluation. If I am not mistaken, I feel that the subject of runtime was only superficially touched in this work, and a more thorough discussion (with detailed pros and cons) would be needed.
(Theoretically, this may not be a big issue if the same synthetic dataset could be successful used on several downstream tasks, but this is not immediately true. If we need dataset distillation for each separate task, then we may end up performing FARZI several times.)

### Questions
1. Could the authors elaborate more on the total runtime (total time for synthetic dataset generation + total time for downstream training with synthetic vs. full data)? It would be helpful if the authors could shed light on the various questions/comments raised in Weakness (2) above.

2. In Equation (2), \Omega is a set containing initializations for the inner loop, if I understand correctly. But instead of picking the initialization randomly, these come from a small number of training trajectories on the full dataset. If that is true, then the \theta_i in the definition of \Omega has nothing to do with the update rule for \theta_t in Equation (2). This may still be confusing to some readers though because the same symbols are used (theta with a subscript, so the authors may want to clarify this point (i.e., what exactly is in \Omega).

3. I was not clear how exactly the authors chose the final hyperparameters for each setting. Did they exhaustively try all corresponding combinations in the hyperparameter table and picked the best one?

4. Is a new synthetic batch created at the beginning of each outer-loop step based on the latent factorization?

### Summary
This paper proposes a method for distillation of "auto-regressive data", in this case meaning any data that is represented as event sequences. This can include natural language text, but also general time-series data. Their method aims to summarize a dataset into a sequence of latent embeddings (which can subsequently be decoded) given a downstream task such that they achieve similar performance to training on the complete dataset. They do this through a meta-learning procedure, optimizing directly through Adam for data which lowers downstream task loss.

### Strengths
My review comes from the point of view of someone familiar with training on natural language (and associated downstream evaluation), but not general event forecasting problems. I was not familiar with the benchmarks used by the author prior to reading this paper. 

**Originality and Significance**

- The paper seems original. Aspects of this work (e.g. using meta-learning/second order methods) for distillation have been touched on in the past, but usually for smaller datasets, and generally not for auto-regressive tasks. Most past works I have seen which work on large corpuses revolve around finding mixing coefficients for existing datasets [1]. This method doesn't work on datasets of that size, however this shows an improvement in scaling. 
- Getting a meta-learning approach to work on such dataset sizes is quite difficult, given difficulties with estimating second-order components over the full dataset. Scaling this to even larger language-style datasets would be an interesting (future) contribution.



**Quality and Clarity**

This paper is quite well-written. Experimental details are clear, and the method is properly motivated. Diagrams clarify the algorithm and the key difficulties to this method are highlighted appropriately.

### Weaknesses
 **Weaknesses**

- The authors touch on language datasets as a motivation, however do not study this (or other large-sequence tasks) due to practical model/sequence length scaling constraints. Are there reasonable paths forward that would allow this to scale to longer sequence lengths/larger models? Specifically, the method's reliance on backpropagating through the entire dataset in the outer loop, combined with the need for multiple inner loop iterations, raises concerns about its applicability to very long sequences common in language tasks. The computational cost of storing and processing gradients for such sequences could be prohibitive, making it unclear how this method could be adapted for tasks like document summarization or long-form text generation.
- Given that the outer loop evaluates across the full original dataset, and the inner loop needs to be run several times to get updated parameters (Figure 5), what's the overall cost saving versus just training a model on the original dataset for more time (until matching student performance), if any? It is unclear from the paper whether the distillation process provides a significant reduction in training time or computational resources compared to simply training a model on the full dataset, especially when considering the meta-learning procedure. A detailed analysis of the computational overhead of the outer loop and the multiple inner loop iterations would be necessary to understand the practical benefits of this approach.
- Have the authors thought about cases where there is significant noise in the training corpus? Given that the loss is computed with respect to the original dataset, it seems like this could be a problem if one ever tried to directly filter a noisy web-crawl. It's not clear how the method would handle datasets with high levels of noise or outliers. The optimization process might be unduly influenced by noisy data points, potentially leading to a distilled dataset that does not generalize well. This is particularly relevant in real-world scenarios where datasets are often imperfect and contain significant amounts of noise.

### Summary
The paper provides an extension of dataset distillation to sequence modeling along with a few other innovations, such as a low rank approximation of the distilled dataset and an efficient trick to save memory during meta-learning. Overall, the paper contains strong (albeit limited) empirical results on the sequence modeling (penn tree bank) and recommendation systems datasets.

### Strengths
* The high level motivation of the problem is quite the need of the hour, as with larger models we need to better understand their dependencies on the data
* Pursuit of this research direction could potentially yield methods that enable us to train SOTA transformer models for a fraction of the input cost
* Empirical results are thorough, although a bit limited in terms of number of datasets for sequence modeling (only PTB is used)

### Weaknesses
A number of points about the approach were unclear to me from the writeup, and I would appreciate clarifications from the authors:

* It is said that the complexity of the dataset distillation algorithm scales by the size of the vocabulary (page. 4) and the size of the sequence that we wish to model. I can see the latter to be the case, since the loss will now be summed over the entire sequence as opposed to one forward pass (so the complexity of the forward pass is increased). However, I do not see how the time complexity increases with the vocabulary size. Do we mean space complexity? Also, more than the forward pass the dominant factor in dataset distillation is the computation of a bunch of hessian vector products in the meta gradient. Those terms do not depend on the vocabulary size either… please clarify..
* It would be nice to provide an intuition for what is saving the memory, making things O(1) in memory.  Currently the big algorithm block does not provide an intuition for how this approach is O(1) in memory regardless of the number of timesteps of unrolling. This is important to clarify, since this is an important contribution, if clearly explained. If this approach is essentially gradient checkpointing, then it is worth noting that Deng and Russakovsky already implement a version of this in their code. 
* Looking at Eqn. 2, I am a bit puzzled as to how \Omega, namely the trajectories from the real data are incorporated in the DD process. From what I am able to understand, \theta_0 \sim Omega -- namely the init is sampled from the pretrained trajectories, and then from the right hand side of eqn. 2 I understand that the rest of the trajectory is obtained using Adam on the synthetic data. Where is the role of the pretrained trajectories then? Please explain..

* Rank regularization has been done in the previous work (Deng and Russakovsky) for dataset distillation. It should be cited that this has been done, and not be presented as a novelty..

### Summary
The authors introduce a dataset distillation (DD) method called Farzi Data for data with a "left to right" (autoregressive) causal structure. Their algorithm has two novel elements: 1) the parameterization of the synthetic distilled data, which allows them to apply it to discrete data (such as the tokens in language modeling); and 2) a method for computing the outer loop gradient for DD when the inner loop is performed with Adam, which has a constant memory footprint independent of the number of inner optimization steps. They conduct extensive experiments with their proposed method on language modeling and sequential recommendation tasks. Compared to existing DD methods (adapted to discrete data via their parameterization), they obtain improved performance across the tested datasets, often obtaining downstream performance better than training a model on the entire original dataset.

### Strengths
**Algorithmic Contribution.** Algorithm 1 for computing the gradient through the inner-loop optimization with Adam using constant memory is a significant contribution. Among existing dataset distillation methods, those which take into account the entire training trajectory on the distilled data tend to obtain better accuracy (as compared to other methods which use surrogates for this objective such as the gradient matching objective in dataset condensation). However, the computational burden of these methods (specifically the memory requirement, which necessitates keeping the entire computation graph) renders them infeasible for application to larger datasets. Farzi Data takes a significant step towards addressing this problem by introducing an algorithm for differentiating through an inner loop optimized with Adam, whose memory does not scale with the number of steps in the inner loop (see Fig. 5). This is an important improvement for DD to be practically useful in real ML applications.

**Empirical Results.** The empirical results are also impressive. The authors obtain better performance than competing methods across several different real-world benchmarks. There are even scenarios where their distilled data consistently outperforms training on the entire original dataset (cf. Table 1), indicating that Farzi Data implicitly promotes some sort of "data cleaning" whereby samples that *hurt* model performance are removed or discounted. This is similar to, e.g., removing mislabeled points or data with negative Shapley values, but Farzi Data is not explicitly trained for this task.

### Weaknesses
 **Presentation and Clarity.** While the actual prose of the paper was generally clear and easy to read, there are some major concerns with notation/presentation that limit understanding of some of the main contributions of the paper.

P1. There are many cases where important notation is not defined. For instance, $\mathrm{Rep}(\mathcal{F}, \mathcal{D})$ is defined in the Appendix, but not the main text, and is critical to interpreting Theorem 3.1. It is not stated what the terms $d\mathbf{m}$, $d\mathbf{x}$, and $d\mathbf{w}$ in Algorithm 1 are supposed to be, so it is impossible to determine if the expressions are correct or not. How to construct the output of the algorithm from these quantities is also not clear. What is the correspondence of the quantities in Alg. 1 to the DD problem, i.e., what will we actually update using the meta-gradient once we know how to compute it? Some (but not all) of these details can be found in the Appendix, but as they are critical to being able to understand the results, they should be moved to the main text and given appropriate explanations. The lack of clarity surrounding the meta-gradient calculation and its connection to the distilled data parameters makes it difficult to assess the validity of the approach.

P2. Stylistically, there is also some nonstandard notation. For instance, $\mathcal{O}(100)$ (3rd bullet point, pg. 2). I suppose the authors meant "on the order of 100x", but big-O notation has a mathematically precise meaning that doesn't make sense here. Another instance is Proposition 3.2. "Correctness of Algorithm 1, Line 13" is not a complete mathematical statement (or a complete sentence). The result should be stated completely and precisely. The use of imprecise language and notation detracts from the technical rigor of the paper.

**Theoretical Results.** There are also issues with the theoretical results.

T1. The most critical problem is that the proof of the main theorem (Theorem 3.1) is not mathematically sound. Specifically, the authors want to show that the expected representativeness of their low-rank synthetic data parameterization is strictly less than the expected representativeness of a naive synthetic data parameterization, under some suitable conditions and for quadratic classifiers: $\mathbb{E}[\mathrm{Rep}(\mathcal{F}, \mathcal{D}_F)] < \mathbb{E}[\mathrm{Rep}(\mathcal{F}, \mathcal{D}_N)]$. ($\mathcal{D}_F$ and $\mathcal{D}_N$ stand for Farzi and naive data, respectively.) In their proof in Appendix B.1, they show that $\mathbb{E}[\mathrm{Rep}(\mathcal{F}, \mathcal{D}_F)] < B_1$ and $\mathbb{E}[\mathrm{Rep}(\mathcal{F}, \mathcal{D}_N)]$ for some bounds $B_1$ and $B_2$. Then, since $B_1 < B_2$, they conclude the desired result. This is not valid: $a < b$, $c < d$, and $b < d$ does not imply that $a < c$. There needs to be a _lower_ bound on the representativeness for the naive parameterization. The proof strategy is fundamentally flawed, and the conclusion cannot be drawn from the given bounds. The absence of a lower bound for the naive parameterization makes the comparison invalid.

I remark that I believe the _result_ is (at least "morally") correct. The theorem essentially reduces to saying that the Rademacher complexity resulting from the low-rank parameterization is smaller than the Rademacher complexity from a general parameterization, which is intuitively obvious. However, the _proof_ has a fatal error and must be corrected somehow.

T2. For Lemma B.3 to hold, there must clearly be some assumptions on the loss function $l$; in order to apply the lemma from Shalev-Shwartz, the Rademacher complexity of the loss composed with the models in $\mathcal{F}$ must be considered, not $\mathcal{F}$ itself. As stated, I believe this lemma is not correct and the loss must be accounted for. Apart from the logical error, the motivation for the use of quadratic classifiers in the theorem wasn't clear to me. What connection do such models have to the auto-regressive tasks that Farzi Data is applied to? The lack of clarity on the loss function and the relevance of quadratic classifiers raises concerns about the theoretical foundations of the work.

T3. This is related to the presentation problems regarding the notation used in Algorithm 1, but the proof of Proposition 3.2 is also suspect. What is meant by $d\mathbf{m} = d\mathbf{m} + \frac{\partial w_t}{\partial m_t} \cdot d\mathbf{w}$? Is $w_t$ supposed to be $\mathbf{w}_T$, or is this expression meant to be a recursive formula? What about the formulas for the other quantities, and how are these combined to compute the meta gradient? The ambiguities in the notation and the recursive nature of the gradient calculation make it difficult to verify the correctness of the proposition.

### Questions
Q1. The authors mention that training with the reference trajectories $\Omega$ is important for obtaining the best performance, as compared with training only from randomly initialized networks. However, it wasn't clear to me if this might just have been the result of a greater number of training steps when learning the distilled dataset. That is, are the results in Fig. 6(b) with the total number of meta-gradient steps constant, or do the additional precomputed trajectories result in more meta-gradient steps?

Q2. On a related note, it was not clear to me exactly how the precomputed trajectories were used. My assumption was that instead of training the network in the inner loop only from random initializations, instead the network from the inner loop will be initialized with parameters from one of the training trajectories. Is this correct?

Q3. Why isn't FMLP also used as a teacher network in Table 1?
