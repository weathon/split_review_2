## Abstract
Fact verification aims to verify a claim using evidence from a trustworthy knowledge base. To address this challenge, algorithms must produce features for every claim that are both semantically meaningful, and compact enough to find a semantic alignment with the source information. In contrast to previous work, which tackled the alignment problem by learning over annotated corpora of claims and their corresponding labels, we propose SFAVEL ($\underline{S}$elf-supervised $\underline{Fa}$ct $\underline{Ve}$rification via $\underline{L}$anguage Model Distillation), a novel unsupervised pretraining framework that leverages pre-trained language models to distil self-supervised features into high-quality claim-fact alignments without the need for annotations. This is enabled by a novel contrastive loss function that encourages features to attain high-quality claim and evidence alignments whilst preserving the semantic relationships across the corpora. Notably, we present results that achieve a new state-of-the-art on FB15k-237 (+5.3\% Hits@1) and FEVER (+8\% accuracy) with linear evaluation.

### Summary
This paper focused on unsupervised fact verification --- verifying a claim based on a trustworthy knowledge base without a requirement of direct supervision. The author proposed to train a scoring model on top of embeddings produced by a pre-trained language model to determine whether a given claim can be aligned to a fact from knowledgebase. The scoring model is trained by leveraging positive and negative examples constructed based on triples from a knowledge graph. The author conducted experimental evaluations on FEVER, and showed that their method can yield a significant improvement over SOTA.

### Strengths
1. The author's idea of leveraging a knowledge graph to produce positive and negative examples of unlabeled claims to train a scoring model is creative. 
2. The paper is very well-structured, and easy to follow.
3. The experiments presented promising results on FEVER (~8% improvement on accuracy), and the method can work on a broad set of language models.

### Weaknesses
1. The technique proposed in the paper does not seem to be generalizable. Specifically, the positive and negative examples constructed through triples from knowledge graph are too simple, which makes this method difficult to generalize to more complicated claims. Specifically, triples can only represent who did what, while in reality, a claim can be who did what at where on when for why.  Any wrong information about these factors can make a claim false. While it is not clear to me how the current method can learn a model that can be effectively aware of some more fine-grained factual differences.
2. The experimental setup is limited. The evaluations are only based on FEVER, which is not convincing. FEVER is created through Wikipedia, and Wikipedia information is closer to triples, which is bias to author's method and training process. At least, an experiment to show the effectiveness of this method on other fact verification dataset would be very helpful.
3. Ranking may not be the best problem formulation for fact verification. For claim verification, it is important to help people decide whether they should believe the claim or not. Now the author formulates this problem as a ranking problem, which is not very useful from a fact verification perspective. it is not clear what does it mean to the user that a claim can find a piece of evidence with 0.9 score.

### Questions
1. How this method is different from a ranking/retrieval problem? Is fact verification equivalent to ranking/retrieval?
2. How would this method work on other datasets that are not created based on Wikipedia?

### Summary
The authors propose a new (contrastive) loss to train models for unsupervised fact verification. This allows to check claims without having to collect annotations, instead relying on unsupervised claim-fact alignment.

### Strengths
* The paper is very well written and well motivated.
* The results presented in the paper are impressive, outperforming FEVER SOTA even for supervised approaches.
* The authors compare the approach on 7 different models, including a variety of small to medium size models.
* The paper contains good ablation experiments, in particular analysing the different components of the loss on a small model.

### Weaknesses
 * No large models were included, the biggest model tested has 250M parameters. There is no strict definition of LLM, but the authors may overpromise in their title/intro when no model with more than 1B parameters is included. The absence of larger models limits the generalizability of the findings, as the scaling behavior of the proposed method with respect to model size remains unclear. It is possible that the observed performance gains might not hold for models with significantly more parameters, which are increasingly common in the field.
* The increase over the SOTA may be exaggerated, given that most of the systems the paper compares to are several years old, and do not include the latest generation of models. (This is not strictly a weakness, but context worth mentioning.) While the reported improvements are notable, the comparison to older baselines makes it difficult to assess the true advancement of the proposed method against current state-of-the-art techniques. A more rigorous comparison with recent, competitive models would provide a clearer picture of the method's actual contribution.

### Questions
* Have you considered including larger language models (given that the title mentions "Large Language Models")?

### Summary
The paper motivates the necessity of fact-verification specifically in an unsupervised way. Given that the recent works have focused on NLIs, this work focuses on a pre-training objective that includes claim-fact distillation loss, intra-sample contrastive loss, and scoring loss. These losses are determined based on the positive and negative samples and their embeddings from the knowledge-base conditioned on the claim. The overall goal is to pre-train this model in the context of available knowledge base to verify facts. The results show that the model performs well on FEVER dataset. 

Concerns of this work: 
1. Size of the models: Given the aspect of large language models where the sizes are in billions, the evaluation is performed on smaller models. Is there some conclusion that can be made with these smaller models instead of just mentioning that the results are good?
2. Datasets: The work has been evaluated only on one single dataset which begs the question of generalizability. Some works such as [1, 2] have evaluated on other datasets such as UKP and FEVER 2 etc. How does this work compare to those? This is particularly necessary because of the use of Wikidata5m knowledge-base that is used. If it is outside the context of Wikipedia, how can this approach work for other knowledge-bases?
3. Comparisons to other approaches: The top-k fact retrieval seems to play an important role, given that the recall in number of facts is improved based on the ranking your approach has, is it a fair comparison to other approaches that work on probably the only retrieved fact? If K=1 then the dev numbers are not comparable to any of the approaches mentioned in the paper. 
4. Self-supervision: There is a strong assumption that there is availability of a knowledge base - Wikidata5m and since Fever is derived from it, the losses are carried between facts from Wikidata and Fever claims. Would be good to clarify why the authors think this is self-supervised?

### Summary
The paper proposes an unsupervised method called SFAVEL for fact verification. The method aim is to distil knowledge from a language model into a knowledge model so that they produce similar vectors for fact in a formal form and in a natural language form. Besides to make the knowledge model distinguish facts, contrastive learning is employed. The paper shows that SFAVEL remarkably outperforms SoTA fact-verification models on the FEVER dataset (about 8% label accuracy higher than the best model in the literature).

### Strengths
The experimental result of SFEVEL on the FEVER dataset is remarkable.

### Weaknesses
First of all, the paper is confusing in using the term "unsupervised". The proposed method SFAVEL is unsupervised because it is for learning a knowledge model. However, the fact-verification model reported in section 4 is supervised. The model uses SFAVEL for mapping fact / claim to vectors and then uses a classifier trained in a supervised learning manner. The distinction between the unsupervised pre-training of the knowledge model and the supervised fine-tuning for fact verification is not clearly articulated, leading to potential misinterpretations of the method's scope and contribution.

Secondly, it is unclear about what is the used "linear probe". Fig 4b shows that the linear probe takes top evidence as input. But then how can we verify the input claim if we use only evidence (and their scores)? E.g. how knowing "Obama was born in Hawaii" and "Hawaii is in the US"  can reject a claim without knowing what the claim is? The paper lacks a clear explanation of how the linear probe integrates claim information with evidence embeddings to perform fact verification, raising concerns about the completeness of the proposed approach.

Thirdly, although the performance of the proposed model is remarkable, it is unclear why there's such a big gap between it and the existing models in the literature. What are cases that the proposed model can solve but the others can? Does the model find some crucial factors that the others miss? The paper does not provide a detailed analysis of the specific advantages of SFAVEL over existing methods, making it difficult to understand the underlying reasons for the performance gains and the unique capabilities of the model.

Last but not least, the proposed SFAVEL is for learning a knowledge model. But it is unclear whether that knowledge model is useful for other fact-verification cases (like on other FEVER dataset -- FEVER 2.0 for example). Also, whether that knowledge model is also useful for other downstream task requiring fact?

### Questions
In contrastive learning loss, e.g. eq 5, the denominator includes the numerator. However, it's not the case in eq 6. Why is that? What is the impact of excluding the numerator out of the denominator? 

In section 4.2, what would happen if more data are used (rather than only 1, 5, 10%)?

In table 3, as transformer-XL is used in the end, why the ablation is for T5-small instead?

### Summary
This work proposes an unsupervised framework for unsupervised fact verification. Specifically, three losses are designed to encourage the two models adopted in this framework to produce high-quality features for claim-fact matching. The authors conduct experiments on the FEVER dataet. Experimental results show that the proposed method can achieve good performance on the FEVER dataset.

### Strengths
1. Experimental results on the FEVER dataset show the advantage of the proposed method. The improvement seems very significant.

2. The unsupervised manner of conducting fact verification is encouraged and useful.

### Weaknesses
1. Though the experiments show the effectiveness of the method, I do not get how the framework solves the cold starting. For the scoring module, the claim embeddings from the LM are very different from those of Knowledge from the knowledge model. Then how does the framework pick the top-k evidence at the beginning? How does $L_{distill}$ work at the early iterations? This is an important prerequisite that should be clearly stated in the paper. Specifically, the paper needs to clarify how the initial, randomly initialized knowledge model embeddings are aligned with the language model embeddings to enable effective evidence retrieval and subsequent distillation. The paper should also discuss the impact of this initial misalignment on the training process and convergence.

2. Why does the paper only evaluate the effect of each loss on a smaller T5 model? Considering the best performance reported in the work is based on Transformer-XL, ablation studies based on it are desired. The ablation study should be performed on the Transformer-XL model to understand how each loss component contributes to the final performance of the best-performing model. This would provide a more complete picture of the method's effectiveness and the importance of each loss term.

3. The annotation in the methodology section makes me really confused. For example but not limited to:

    (1) In Section 3.1, what does the V and each $v_i$ mean? I cannot get it until I read through the whole methodology section. The definition of V and $v_i$ should be provided at the beginning of Section 3.1, to avoid confusion.

    (2) The use of subscript and superscript is messed up. I think embedding is presented as $X_F$ in Section 3.2, but it becomes $X^F$ in Section 3.3. The notation should be consistent throughout the paper. The authors should carefully check all the notations and make sure they are consistent.
    
    (3) Some annotations are not really necessary, e.g., $N_i$ in Equation 3 are not used anywhere else in the paper. Unnecessary notations should be removed to make the paper more concise.

### Questions
Please refer to the questions above in the weakness. Especially please make it clear how the model works at the beginning when the representations of the LM and the knowledge model are significantly different.
