## Abstract
While generative diffusion models excel in producing high-quality images, they can also be misused to mimic authorized images, posing a significant threat to AI systems. Efforts have been made to add calibrated perturbations to protect images from diffusion-based mimicry pipelines. However, most of the existing methods are too ineffective and even impractical to be used by individual users due to their high computation and memory requirements. In this work, we present novel findings on attacking latent diffusion models (LDM) and propose new plug-and-play strategies for more effective protection. In particular, we explore the bottleneck in attacking an LDM, discovering that the encoder module rather than the denoiser module is the vulnerable point. Based on this insight, we present our strategy using Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) to double the speed of protection and reduce memory occupation by half without compromising its strength. Additionally, we provide a robust protection strategy by counterintuitively minimizing the semantic loss, which can assist in generating more natural perturbations. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments to substantiate our findings and comprehensively evaluate our newly proposed strategies. We hope our insights and protective measures can contribute to better defense against malicious diffusion-based mimicry, advancing the development of secure AI systems.

### Summary
The paper introduced a faster attack method for encoder-diffusion style model. They find out that the encoder is a weak point of the whole model. Therefore, they specifically design an attack method by removing the gradient propagation from the diffusion parts. It makes the running speed faster. They evaluate against three latest methods and show competitive results.

### Strengths
+ There are some interesting observations including the different robustness regarding diffusion and encoding parts.
I believe this is a good observation which could make attack fast.
+ The methods are effective against latest benchmarks.

### Weaknesses
 - Missing details when comparing the magnitude of embedding change versus input change
The authors use absolute value to compare adversarial noise. While the embedding can be of different scale. The authors shall provide a relative scale of perturbation magnitude. Specifically, a comparison of the L-infinity norm of the perturbation in the input space versus the L-infinity norm of the perturbation in the embedding space, normalized by the respective ranges of these spaces, would provide a clearer picture of the attack's impact. Without this, it's difficult to assess the true effectiveness of the attack in the embedding space.

- Unclear math derivation
In equation 5, why can we approximately remove the gradient parts from denoiser? The justification for approximating the Jacobian of the U-Net as an identity matrix is not sufficiently explained. It is unclear under what conditions this approximation holds, and what the implications are if this approximation is not accurate. This approximation needs more rigorous justification, especially considering the complex nature of the U-Net architecture.

### Questions
The reason behind equation 5 and the relative scale of perturbation.

### Summary
This paper wants to protect images from unauthorized use by perturbing the images using projected gradient descent. It uses the existing score distillation sampling idea to approximate the gradient of the sample instead of backward propagation through the UNet to save resources and time. It also chooses to minimize the semantic loss (ie, the diffusion model's loss) instead of maximizing it to generate more natural perturbations. Experiments on different domains and tasks show it outperforms the existing baselines.

### Strengths
1. This paper targets an important issue of preventing unauthorized image use.
2. Reducing the time cost and resource requirement makes the method more affordable and practical.
3. Experiments show it's better than existing baselines.

### Weaknesses
1. From my understanding, this method needs the gradient from the misused models. That is, the protection perturbation is generated on the exact model used to maliciously manipulate the image. It's not clear if this generated perturbation is only effective on that model, or if it can protect the image from misuse by an unknown model.

2. No defense methods are evaluated. The malicious people may apply image transformations to remove the adversarial perturbations.

3. It's not clear why minimizing the loss (encouraging LDM to make better predictions) can protect the images. It's very counter-intuitive and needs a better explanation. I can understand that minimizing the loss with respect to certain targets as Photoguard can work because it encourages the LDM to generate an image different from the original image to protect. But why can encouraging the LDM to generate a better image of the original image (the opposite goal of AdvDM) can help? Maybe it's kind of trapping the sample into a local optimum so that the later optimization/editing is also stuck? But this also needs to be justified.

4. In Section 4.3, the conclusion of denoiser being more robust needs more evidence. Figure 2 shows the $\delta_z$ can be less than 10x $\delta_x$ for many cases. So I think the 10x budget (Figure 10 has even larger budgets) should be large enough to conduct some successful attacks. It's not clear why they fail.

5. Photoguard has a diffusion attack. Why is only the encoder attack mentioned in the related work and evaluated in the experiments?

6. The detailed setup for the experiments is missing. For example, how many iterations are used for the baselines and proposed method? What is the learning rate? What's the perturbation budget? How large is the fixed $\delta_x$ in Figure 2?

7. The pseudocode in Appendix A doesn't allow `x` to have gradients because `x=x.detach().clone()` detaches `x` from the computational graph.

8. I suggest briefly introducing the metrics and human studies and having a more detailed explanation of the experimental results in the main text.

9. To show the effectiveness of SDS approximation, one may visualize the loss changes and the gradient landscapes with the original loss function and the SDS loss.

### Questions
1. Can this protection effect transfer to different LDMs? That is, assume the image is protected using a LDM A, when the adversary uses another LDM B to edit the image, will it fail?
2. Can image transformations such as JPEG compression, cropping, rotation, and rescaling invalidate the protection?
3. Why can minimizing the loss (encouraging LDM to make better predictions) protect the images?
4. How are the $z$ and $z_{adv}$ visualized in the figures such as Figure 2?
5. Could you explain, why attacking the diffusion model via $\mathcal{L}_S$ outperforms $\mathcal{L}_T$ if the encoder is less robust than the diffusion model as claimed in the paper?

### Summary
The paper aims to generate adversarial examples to protect images from diffusion-based mimicry pipelines, such as image editing, inpainting, and textual inversion. Specifically, the authors explore the robustness of encoder and denoiser modules in the Latent Diffusion Model. And they conclude that the encoder is much more vulnerable than the denoiser. Therefore, they leverage the existing method, Score Distillation Sampling, to calculate the gradient towards minimizing the semantic loss.

### Strengths
1. This paper focuses on protecting images from diffusion-based mimicry pipelines, this research region is interesting.  
2. Motivated by the observation that the encoder is more vulnerable, the authors resort to Score Distillation Sampling to simplify the gradient update.   
3. The authors attack multiple tasks: image editing, inpainting, and textual inversion.

### Weaknesses
The major concern is the limited contribution of this paper.    
1. The observation that the encoder is more vulnerable than the denoiser only contributes to this region, it is limited in developing more secure LDM. Besides, the experiments empirically indicate this conclusion. It lacks theoretical proofs.   
2. The authors resort to the existing method, Score Distillation Sampling,  to fasten the backpropagation of the semantic loss.    
3. The authors find that applying gradient descent over the semantic loss leads to more harmonious adversarial images with the original ones. The authors should delve into this phenomenon.

### Questions
Given the fact that the encoder is more vulnerable than the denoiser, what is the performance when reducing the gradient of the denoising module?

### Summary
This paper investigates methods to protect images from unauthorized editing by diffusion models, referred to as "diffusion mimicry". The authors make the insight that the encoder module is more vulnerable than the denoiser when attacking latent diffusion models (LDMs). Based on this finding, they propose faster protection generation using score distillation sampling. They also explore minimizing the semantic loss for protection, obtaining more imperceptible perturbations. The experimental results on divers image datasets support the proposed techniques.

### Strengths
This paper reveals that the encoder is more vulnerable than the denoiser, which is novel and insightful.
The proposed SDS is a more efficient protection compared with prior works.

### Weaknesses
1. The major concern I have is that how to evaluate the diffusion model still works well after the perturbation? This paper only provides results that the proposed SDS can defend against adversarial attack, but does not show the perturbation does not affect the original function of the diffusion model. The paper lacks both analysis and experiments on this point.

2. The threat model is not clear. Based on my understanding, the core of this paper is adversarial attack and defense on diffusion model. However, the introduction of "diffusion mimicry" confuses the reader a lot. If authors really want to mention "diffusion mimicry", it should be explained that how diffusion model is used for mimicry and why the proposed method is a good defense? 

3. The paper lacks insight into why minimizing semantic loss works better.

### Questions
Please see the weakness.
