## Abstract
Distributed \glspl{dnn} have been shown to reduce the computational burden of mobile devices and decrease the end-to-end inference latency in edge computing scenarios. While distributed \glspl{dnn} have been studied, to the best of our knowledge, the resilience of distributed \glspl{dnn} to adversarial action remains an open problem. In this paper, we fill the existing research gap by rigorously analyzing the robustness of distributed \glspl{dnn} against adversarial action. We cast this problem in the context of information theory and introduce two new measurements for distortion and robustness.~Our theoretical findings indicate that (i) assuming the same level of information distortion, latent features are always more robust than input representations; and (ii) the adversarial robustness is jointly determined by the \gls{dnn} feature dimension and the generalization capability. To test our theoretical findings, we perform extensive experimental analysis by considering 6 different \gls{dnn} architectures, 6 different approaches for distributed \gls{dnn} and 10 different adversarial attacks using the ImageNet-1K dataset. Our experimental results support our theoretical findings by showing that the compressed latent representations can reduce the success rate of adversarial attacks by 88\% in the best case and by 57\% on the average compared to attacks to the input space.

### Summary
This work aims to evaluate the adversarial robustness of distributed DNNs. In this setting, latent representations of the DNNs are communicated among devices, and thus, an adversary could perturb the latent representations instead of the model's input. However, the work claims that attacks on latent representations are less effective than perturbing the input and presents theoretical information bounds supporting this claim. Standard adversarial attacks are then used to test this bound empirically over several distributed DNN architectures, and the results show that the attacks are less successful when employed on latent spaces than on the model's input.

### Strengths
The suggested information bound entails that standard adversarial attacks targeting only the latent representation of DNNs would be less effective than those targeting the input. This is relevant not only in distributed DNN but for side-channel attacks as well. Moreover, it greatly aids in evaluating the robustness of distributed DNN, as such attacks arise naturally in this setting.

### Weaknesses
1. The experimental setup is lacking and insufficient to support the authors' claims. Only attacks on several distributed DNN architectures were reported. Not only is this insufficient to support the claim that attacks on latent spaces are generally less effective, but it does not explain the phenomenon or the behavior of the suggested information bound. The experiments lack a systematic exploration of the latent space, focusing only on specific architectures used in distributed settings. This approach fails to provide a comprehensive understanding of how the information bound behaves across different layers and cardinalities within a single network architecture. Furthermore, the choice of architectures seems arbitrary and does not cover the diversity of possible designs, making it difficult to generalize the conclusions.
2. No novel attacks targeting latent spaces were suggested, or even settings in which both the input and latent space are attacked. Without testing such attacks and settings, the robustness of distributed DNN cannot be correctly evaluated. The absence of attacks specifically tailored to latent spaces is a significant oversight. Standard input-based attacks might not be the most effective way to evaluate the robustness of latent representations. Moreover, the lack of experiments combining input and latent space attacks leaves a gap in understanding the full vulnerability of distributed DNNs.
3. The second key finding of "DNN robustness is intrinsically related to the cardinality of the latent space" is not a phenomenon exclusive to latent spaces. There are several examples of attacks working better on larger input samples such as Imagnet, compared to CIFAR10/100. In addition, the effect of the l_inf norm bound is highly dependent on the input size. The claim that robustness is intrinsically linked to the cardinality of the latent space is not sufficiently supported by the experiments. The paper fails to adequately address the known relationship between input size, perturbation norms, and attack success, making it difficult to isolate the effect of latent space cardinality. The lack of normalization of the perturbation with respect to the input size further complicates the interpretation of the results.

### Questions
1. For a correct evaluation of the suggested bound on a given DNN architecture, the experimental settings should present attacks on all the latent spaces in the architecture and not only those available in specific distributed DNN settings. The results should be compared for the depth of the latent spaces in the network and their cardinality. Such experiments consider side-channel attacks on DNN and not only the distributed DNN setting.
2. Attacks targeting explicitly latent spaces should be considered; such attacks should be aware of the specifics of the latent spaces (e.g., depth and cardinality) and make use of them to improve the efficiency of the attack.
3. Adversarial attacks targeting input and latent representations should be considered to evaluate if such a setting presents a greater risk to distributed DNN. 
4. As the effectiveness of perturbations depends on the input size, the results should be normalized accordingly.

### Summary
This paper studies the robustness of distributed DNN against adversarial attack theoretically and experimentally. The authors analyze the robustness of latent features using information bottleneck theory and prove that latent space perturbations are always less effective than input space perturbations. Empirically, the authors conduct extensive experiments to verify their theoretic findings from multiple perspectives.

### Strengths
The paper is well written in general. The theoretical analysis from information bottleneck perspective is interesting and solid. Most of the claims are supported by ample experimental analysis.

### Weaknesses
1. In this paper, the attacker only has access to the latent representation provided by the mobile DNN from a mobile phone. While the authors successfully demonstrate that attacks on these latent representations exhibit a lower Attack Success Rate (ASR) than those on raw images—given the same level of information distortion—the appropriateness of imposing an identical distortion level in this context needs more clarification. In discussions around the adversarial robustness of image input, constraints are placed on distortion levels to ensure modifications are imperceptible to the human eye, yet potent enough to deceive the classifier [1]. However, when considering distortions applied to latent features, the rationale for enforcing the same constraint level is less clear. Given that the transmission in this scenario occurs between a mobile device and a cloud computer, with no human observer in the loop, the attacker might as well nullify all latent features, potentially achieving an ASR close to 100%. Comparing the ASR between attacks on raw input images (which are observable by humans) and attacks on latent features (processed by a cloud computer) under an equivalent distortion level seems illogical. The paper should more thoroughly justify why the same $l_p$ norm constraint is appropriate for both input and latent spaces, especially given the different semantic meanings and the absence of a human observer for the latent representations.

2. Although the authors posit that this study on the robustness of distributed DNNs in the face of adversarial actions is novel, I find the concept markedly similar to existing works on attacks targeting intermediate layers or latent features [2]. I would appreciate it if the authors could highlight the distinctions between their work and prior research, and attempt to apply the attack methods delineated in [2] where feasible. Specifically, the paper should clarify how its attack methodology differs from those that target intermediate layers of a network, and whether the proposed approach offers any unique advantages or insights beyond existing techniques. The paper should also consider directly comparing its results with those obtained by applying the attack strategies from [2] to the same distributed DNN setting.

3. I am confused about two terminologies in the paper: feature compression and bottleneck. Their relationship is not clear to me. In Table 1, it seems that only the first two feature compression methods contain a bottleneck layer. However, in Section 4.2 - DNN architectures, the authors write, '...the feature compression layer (i.e., the 'bottleneck').' Additionally, the authors use the same bottleneck design as Matsubara et al. (2022b) and denote the new architectures with feature compression as Resnet50-fc, etc. However, the specific design mentioned in Matsubara et al. (2022b) does not seem to belong to any of the six feature compression approaches in Table 1. Table A-3 is also confusing, as I cannot understand what the authors mean by 'JC and QT are DNNs without a bottleneck,' while JC and QT are feature compression approaches, and the authors claim that feature compression is the same as bottleneck. The paper needs to clearly define the relationship between feature compression and bottleneck, and clarify whether the term 'bottleneck' refers to a specific architectural component or a general concept of dimensionality reduction. The discussion should also clarify why JC and QT are considered 'without a bottleneck' when they are presented as feature compression methods.

4. The experimental results in Section 5.3 need further explanation. ResNet152-fc with 12 channels achieves a validation accuracy of 77.47%, while ResNet152-fc with 3 channels achieves 70.01% accuracy. On the middle of page 9, the statement 'decreases to 7.47%' should be corrected to 'decreases by 7.46%.' However, the fact that I∗(Y ; T) decreases by 7.46% cannot explain why the ASR increases by a much larger percentage than 7.46% in Table A-4. For example, when \epsilon=0.003, the ASR of PGD_2 increases by 19.9% when transitioning from 12 channels to 3 channels. According to the inequality in Key Theoretical Finding #1, since O(|T||Y|/√n) is smaller when transitioning from 12 channels to 3 channels, the ASR difference should be less than the difference in I∗(Y ; T), which is 7.46%. Please provide a detailed explanation. The paper needs to provide a more thorough analysis of why the observed ASR increase is significantly larger than the decrease in mutual information, and explain the discrepancy between the theoretical bound and the empirical results. The discussion should also clarify why the worst-case adversarial attack is not necessarily bounded by the change in mutual information.

### Questions
My primary concern is related to the validity of the problem setting presented in this paper (See weakness 1). Although the theoretical findings are intriguing and the experimental data is comprehensive, there is still uncertainty regarding the significance of defining the robustness of distributed Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) in the proposed manner.

### Summary
A distributed DNN can be regarded as a combination of two parts, namely, a mobile DNN and a local DNN, respectively. The mobile DNN is trained to learn the latent representations, which can reduce the amount of data that will be transmitted but suffers the risk of being attacked. Along this side, this paper investigates the robustness of the latent representations. Based on information theory, this paper claims that: 1) latent features are always more robust than input representations, and 2) the feature dimensions and the generalization capability of the DNN determine the adversarial robustness. Extensive experiments on ImageNet-1K are conducted to support the claims, considering 6 different DNN architectures, 6 different ways for distributed DNN, and 10 different adversarial attacks.

### Strengths
1. This paper is well-written, with clear explanations and illustrations. Section 2 is comprehensive, and someone interested in those related topics can learn from the article.
2. Based on Information theory, Section 3 provides a thorough theoretical analysis. Besides, the theoretical conclusions are supported by the experimental results in Section 4 with detailed experimental settings.

### Weaknesses
In the Conclusion section, this article claims that ``This paper has investigated adversarial attacks to latent representations of DNNs for the first time``. Through the lens of distributed DNNs, this work may be the first one, as it claims. However, I am concerned about whether the distributed DNNs are a necessary background as the motivation to investigate the problem. Since I think the local DNN and mobile DNN are very like the architecture of an autoencoder, and there are many works about the adversarial robustness of autoencoders. Specifically, the local DNN seems analogous to the encoder, and the mobile DNN to the decoder. While the paper focuses on the distributed setting, the core problem of adversarial robustness in latent spaces is not unique to this architecture. The paper's novelty claim would be stronger if it more clearly differentiated its contributions from existing work on adversarial robustness of latent representations in autoencoders, even if the specific application differs.

### Questions
As mentioned in the Weaknesses, my questions/concerns are mainly about the differences between the distributed DNNs and the autoencoders.
1. If we compare the architecture between a distributed DNN and an autoencoder, I think the local DNN is very much like the encoder part, and the mobile DNN is very much like the decoder part. Can I compare them like this?
2. If yes, I think some works have studied the adversarial robustness of the latent features, e.g., [1]. 
3. Therefore, I am a bit curious about whether distributed DNNs are a necessary background as the motivation to investigate the adversarial robustness of the latent features.

### Summary
The paper studies the adversarial robustness of deep neural networks (DNNs) in latent space and compares it with the more common adversarial attacks on DNN inputs. The target models are distributed DNNs where the network is splitted in two parts, one is running on a mobile device and sends the output features to other part of the network which is running in cloud. The authors build on top of Information Bottleneck (IB) theory and show that 1) latent features of DNNs are more robust to adversarial attacks than inputs and 2) the smaller the latent dimension, the more difficult it is for an adversary to attack the network successfully. Their results on a wide variety of attacks and networks support the theoretical hypothesis.

### Strengths
The paper is easy to follow, has good background sections and exploits the work of Shamir et al. 2010 (equation 3) in a natural way. The experiments are performed on a wide range of adversarial attacks, such as gradient-based, score-based and decision based, as well as white-box and black-box attacks. The results are clear and in line with the theoretical hypothesis.

### Weaknesses
There are a few weaknesses that I would like to point out:
1. the paper does not take into consideration attacking the latent representations of a DNN that was adversarially trained. To the best of my knowledge, the adversarial training [1] has an impact over the latent representations of a neural network and under certain settings (a perturbation budget $\epsilon$ not too large) the network is robust to adversarial input perturbations. I would be interested in the robustness of adversarially trained networks, would it be possible to perform such an experiment? I believe the paper is not complete without this experiment and I would really appreciate if you could include this.

### Questions
1. Related to the weakness point: how do you think the adversarial training would change the success rate of these attacks?
2. recently there was another adversarial attack introduced for slightly more particular DNNs architectures with multi-exits (or early-exits), called DeepSloth [2], which aims to make the early-exits ineffective. They show that this attack changes the latent representation of DNNs (for example, Figure 3 in the paper) to actually create delay.
3. Did think about analyzing the latent features robustness in LLMs? What do you think the challenges would be?
4. In Section 6 you mention about defense mechanisms for adversarial attack on latent features. What would be the key element in designing defenses for this attack?

### Summary
This paper uses information bottleneck (IB) analysis to study adversarial robustness in the split learning setting, consisting of a data encoder that gives the latent representations, followed by a local deep neural network (DNN) that takes the latent presentation for subsequent inference. The results show that the compressed latent representations can reduce the success rate of adversarial attacks, as also indicated by the theory.

### Strengths
1. Use IB to study adversarial robustness is a good angle.
2. The paper is well-written and easy to read

### Weaknesses
I have several major concerns about the technical novelty and empirical evaluation.

1. On the claim that "assuming the same level of information distortion, latent features are always more robust than input representations", does this hold even if the latent embedding dimension is larger than the input dimension?  If yes, why it can be more robust? Moreover, if the latent embedding dimension is lower than the input dimension, then it has been proven in the ICML 2019 paper "First-order Adversarial Vulnerability of Neural Networks and Input Dimension" that the minimal adversarial perturbation scales inversely with the data dimension. So if we treat the latent representations as the new "data" and they have lower dimensions than the raw inputs, the new insights are not clear.

2. The assumption on the same level of information distortion seems very strong and lacks justification. It's also not clear what is the threat model (what the attacker can do) that leads to a latent representation $T_{adv}$.

3. The evaluated attacks are naive input perturbation attacks, and no adaptive attacks that take into account modifying the latent representations were studied. It should be easy to add a regularizer to attack objectives to encourage finding adversarial examples that share very similar (or very different) latent representations as the original data, and therefore the claim on improved robustness may not hold.

### Questions
1. W.r.t. to W1, is there any implicit assumption that the latent embedding dimension is smaller than the input dimension? If so, the improved robustness is a direct consequence of the ICML 2019 result.

2. How to justify the assumption of "the same level of information distortion"? Does $T_{adv}$ hold for any arbitrary threat model? 

3. Does the result of improved robustness still hold against adaptive attacks, where the attacker can have access to the latent representations?
