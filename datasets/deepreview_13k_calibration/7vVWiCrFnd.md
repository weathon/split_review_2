## Abstract
Designing expressive Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) is an important topic in graph machine learning fields. Despite the existence of numerous approaches proposed to enhance GNNs based on Weisfeiler-Lehman (WL) tests, what GNNs can and cannot learn still lacks a deeper understanding. This paper adopts a fundamentally different approach to examine the expressive power of GNNs from a probabilistic perspective. By establishing connections between GNNs' predictions and the central inference problems of probabilistic graphical models (PGMs), we can analyze previous GNN variants with a novel hierarchical framework and gain new insights into their node-level and link-level behaviors. Additionally, we introduce novel methods that can provably enhance GNNs' ability to capture complex dependencies and make complex predictions. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approaches.

### Summary
The authors report a slate of new theoretical results regarding the expressive power of a variety of GNNs w.r.t. MRFs. Utilizing this theoretical basis, they then propose a novel extension of MPNNs utilizing so-called "phantom nodes/edges". These proposed algorithms are tested using synthetic and real world data, comparing against state-of-the-art algorithms. 

In node classification tasks, the phantom node lifting method improved state of the art when applied on GCN, and compared well to recent works when utilized with SAGE and GCNII methodologies. In link prediction, phantom edges proved to improve all compared results using standard datasets and metrics.

In summary, recasting GNN's expressibility via MRF, the authors were able to improve the understanding of MPNNs and used this probabilistic viewpoint to introduce a novel methodology that matches or outperforms the current state-of-the-art in standard tests.

### Strengths
The paper makes two contributions: (1) improving the theoretical understanding of GNNs utilizing a probabilistic viewpoint to classify expressibility with respect to (and beyond) Weisfeiler-Lehman tests and (2) utilizing this probabilistic viewpoint to propose a novel methodology to lift the expressive power of MPNNs.

Recasting the question of expressiveness from limited WL tests into a probabilistic frame is natural in the setting of ML, and as shown, lucrative.

### Weaknesses
While the results are compelling - I find the exposition of the novel phantom node/edge methodology lacking. While proofs are given on their approximation power, and one can assume motivation from framed previous works, the paper would be strengthened with the motivation driving the methodology.

Further, after the long theoretical exposition, the analysis of the proposed method is brief, and restricted mainly to results. A longer discussion of the modified properties (and potential limitations) of the graph would allow more informed adoption.

### Questions
1. Question: It seems that DropGNN (perhaps applied to a slightly modified graph) is closely related to the proposed PN method. How do the two compare in inference tasks?

2. Suggestion: I find the paper would be strengthened by a more direct discussion of the origins of the methodology (i.e., how does this differ/extend from previous works? E.g. node labeling)

### Summary
The paper proposes a new approach to evaluate the expressive power of graph neural networks from a probabilistic perspective instead of Weisfeiler-Lehman (WL) tests, which are generally used for evaluating the expressiveness of GNNs. By introducing the central inference problems of probabilistic graphical models (PGMs), the authors analyze GNNs. In addition, the authors design two methods (phantom nodes and phantom edges) for the expressive power.

### Strengths
- The paper is well written.
- The research topic about the expressive power of GNNs is important and interesting.
- The paper seems novel to me. Different from existing methods on the expressive power of GNNs, which use WL test, this paper analyze the expressive power of GNNs in the perspective of the probabilistic view.

### Weaknesses
 - Do you have any ideas for the graph classification tasks? Generally, the papers about the  expressiveness power of GNNs use graph classification tasks to demonstrate the effectiveness of their methods.
- Could you apply your methods on large-scale graphs?

### Summary
The paper studies the expressivity of the Graph neural networks from the perspective of probabilistic graphical methods. Although multiple works have previously established connections between GNNs and PGMs, this paper studies it from the perspective of expressive power of the GNNs. After formulating the correspondence between WL power with PGMs, the authors present several results in providing a new perspective of seeing the expressivity of GNNs in its ability to learn the complex higher-order distributions formalized as clique based MRFs.

### Strengths
1. The GNN’s connection to the PGMs is developed in an interesting and principled way.. Specifically, the formulation overcomes the permutation invariance inherent to the graph neural networks but missing in the PGMs.
1. The results progressively elaborate on the connections between GNN’s expressive power in terms of the learnable capacity of node marginals. 
1. Some of the results are surprising although many of them are intuitively known. The correspondence between k-wl and clique orders is intuitive and is 
1. The paper is well written and the presentation flow is reasonably clear.

### Weaknesses
1. The first paragraph is problematic. “implicitly assume that node representations learnt by GNNs are independent conditioned on node features and edges, thereby ignoring the joint dependency among nodes...” does not represent the related works accurately. These works do not ignore dependency among the nodes, which is captured via multiple rounds of message passing similar to loopy belief propagation. I find the first paragraph could be phrased in a different way to make the distinctions accurate.

2. The introduction of phantom nodes and edges is not a novel development and closely resembles the other methods like CIN. However, the problem of inefficiency remains in such methods i.e. the computational complexity of finding maximal cliques which can be used for phantom nodes to guarantee the inferential capacity.

3. Certain related works are missing in the paper. Recent works on Factor Graph Neural Networks (FGNN) [1] are highly related works in establishing connections between PGMs and GNNs. A small discussion on the relevance would be pertinent. 

4. The experimental section could be more elaborate to study the effectiveness of GNNs in learning higher-order distributions. For example, comparison with Zhen et al. (2023)  on inference of higher-order LDPC codes.

### Summary
This paper delves into the expressive power of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) within the context of approximate inference in graphical models, going beyond the common association of GNNs with graph convolutions and Weisfeiler-Lehman (WL) graph isomorphism tests. The paper challenges the prevailing notion that GNNs necessitate integration with graphical models to enhance their probabilistic inference capacity, asserting that GNNs intrinsically possess robust approximation capabilities for posterior distributions. The research introduces a new expressive power hierarchy using Markov Random Fields (MRFs) with increasingly complex distributions and inference targets, providing insights into various GNN variants, including MPNNs, higher-order GNNs, subgraph GNNs, and labeling tricks in the contexts of node classification and link prediction. Furthermore, the paper presents a systematic framework for extending the capabilities of GNNs in modeling complex distributions and inference targets, with a particular focus on phantom nodes and phantom edges, showcasing their empirical improvements in real-world applications of GNNs.

### Strengths
* Theoretical analysis is solid and reasonable on the inference capacity of various GNNs.
* The paper identifies that GNNs can do Probabilistic inference on its own, which has novelty than other methods combining GNN with graphical models.
* The paper proposes methods like phantom nodes and edges based on their inference analysis framework and show experiments of their methods.

### Weaknesses
 * Experiments on large link prediction datasets are lacked.
* While the theoretical analysis has included a lot of GNN methods, the experiments don't include them all.
* Experiments on various node classification datasets(including homogeneous and heterogeneous graphs) are lacked.
* Improvements of better GNNs(like GCNII) in node classification is limited.
* Experiments details are lacked, like how to choose hyperparameters.

### Questions
1. For link prediction tasks, how is the experiments done? Why don't choose metric of link prediction to be HITS@10 like in the BUDDY paper. Also, why not include other baselines in the BUDDY paper, especially the GNN ones? Also, maybe lack of other experiments on large link prediction datsets
2. For node classification task, why not choose traditional homogeneous datasets and heterogeneous datasets like previous works. How will phantom nodes have impact when meeting graphs with different heterophily? Also, why For GCNII it hardly work better than SPN?
3. What's the complexity of GNNs with phantom nodes or phantom edges, for node classification and link prediction ,respectively?

### Summary
The paper studies the expressiveness of different GNN variants from a probabilistic inference perspective. Specifically, under certain settings of PGMs and different ways to measure their complexity, the paper studies to what extent MPNNs can approximate node and edge marginals which are obtained from local minima of Bethe approximation. The analysis is also extended to other GNN variants. To equip GNNs with the power of estimating more complex node and edge marginals, phantom nodes and edges are proposed respectively, and experiments are conducted on several node and link prediction datasets to evaluate the proposed methods.

### Strengths
1. Analyzing how well GNNs can approximate marginals in PGMs is interesting (though there are limitations as will be discussed), and offers a new perspective for measuring the expressiveness of GNNs.
2. The paper is generally well written with clear background introductions and problem setup. Many details are given in the appendix, which is also appreciated.
2. A lot of analysis has been done with discussions on many different GNN variants and inference tasks. Results also seem solid (but I did not carefully check the proof).

### Weaknesses
1. Defining the discriminative power of potential function by WL test appears to be a somewhat contrived setup, whereby the problem still boils down to graph isomorphism. I am not sure how practically relevant this setting is, and whether it is truly “fundamentally different” with works on WL tests. A more comprehensive discussion about the connection may mitigate the issue.
2. Following the above point, the analysis does not take into account node features, whereas in many PGMs node and clique potentials are functions on node features. This further stresses the point that the setup might deviate from practice.
3. The proposed method seems not scalable as it requires identifying maximum cliques that is exponentially complex, and even relaxing it to cliques with size k has super-quadratic complexity O(n^k) (please correct me if I am wrong). This limitation has not been discussed in the paper, and experiments only include small datasets.
4. The experimental results are relatively weak. E.g. on PPI, best performance in most cases (4 out of 6 columns in the table) is achieved by GCNII+SPN. Improvement on synthetic dataset is also limited, and Planetoid dataset is outdated. Baselines are also limited. Particularly, many GNN variants are considered in the analysis but are not compared in experiments, and I wonder why? Moreover, the proposed methods are essentially based on data augmentation, but competitors in this category are missing.

### Questions
1.  In 3.1, while lemma 1 is straight-forward, I do not fully understand why the authors mention “in graph machine learning fields each instance corresponds to different graphs with possibly different structures”, as the paper does not address the case of graph classification? And what does “instance” present? (the authors might wanna refer to a graph as an instance, but in the context of paper where node- and edge-level tasks are considered, each node or random variable in the PGM correspond an an instance.)
2. What is the complexity of the proposed method, and are there any ways to scale it to large graphs?
3. If possible, please also answer to questions in the weakness section.

I decrease score from 6 to 5 due to my lingering concerns, and there has been no response from the authors to date.
