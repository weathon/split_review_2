## Abstract
Large-scale graph machine learning is challenging as the complexity of learning models scales with the graph size. Subsampling the graph is a viable alternative, but sampling on graphs is nontrivial as graphs are non-Euclidean. Existing graph sampling techniques require not only computing the spectra of large matrices but also repeating these computations when the graph changes, e.g., grows. In this paper, we introduce a signal sampling theory for a type of graph limit---the graphon. We prove a Poincar\'e inequality for graphon signals and show that complements of node subsets satisfying this inequality are unique sampling sets for Paley-Wiener spaces of graphon signals. Exploiting connections with spectral clustering and Gaussian elimination, we prove that such sampling sets are consistent in the sense that unique sampling sets on a convergent graph sequence converge to unique sampling sets on the graphon. We then propose a related graphon signal sampling algorithm for large graphs, and demonstrate its good empirical performance on graph machine learning tasks.

### Summary
This paper proposes a novel signal sampling theory on a type of graph limit called a graphon. The authors demonstrate a Poincaré inequality for graphon signals and show that the complements of node subsets satisfying this inequality are unique sampling sets for Paley-Wiener spaces of graphon signals. They leverage connections with spectral clustering and Gaussian elimination to prove the consistency of these sampling sets. They also design a graphon signal sampling algorithm for large graphs and validate its performance on graph machine learning tasks.

### Strengths
1. The paper introduces an innovative approach to signal sampling on large-scale graphs using graphons, a type of graph limit, making it a significant contribution to the field.

2. The authors successfully prove a Poincaré inequality for graphon signals and demonstrate that the complements of node subsets adhering to this inequality form unique sampling sets. These solid theoretical foundations enhance the reliability of their proposed methodology.

3. The authors make a critical contribution by relating bandlimitedness in graphon signal space to optimal sampling sets. This achievement not only generalizes previous findings on finite graphs but also offers a new perspective towards problem-solving in the field.

### Weaknesses
The paper does not compare the computational efficiency of the proposed method with existing techniques in the field. Such a comparison could show whether the new method offers improvements in terms of time efficiency.

### Questions
1. Given that the paper focuses on large graphs, how does the proposed graphon signal sampling algorithm scale with the size of the graph? While the paper discusses theoretical aspects and empirical performance, it does not delve into scalability and computational efficiency. Can the authors provide insights or discussions on how their algorithm performs as the graph size increases?

2. The authors have demonstrated the utility of their method on specific tasks. However, how broadly applicable is the proposed method across different graph machine learning tasks? Can the authors provide examples or discussions on how their method could be applied to other types of problems within the graph machine learning domain?

### Summary
This work considers the extension of sampling theory for bandlimited graph signals to signals on graphons, generalizing the notion of a finite sampling set for graphs to a measurable sampling set for graphons. With this notion in hand, the authors propose an algorithm for consistent sampling, as well as demonstrate its utility in training and inference with GNNs.

### Strengths
1. This paper reads very well: relevant background, theory, and results are presented clearly and in a logical manner. I can tell that the authors put a lot of thought into how this paper should be presented, which is very much appreciated.
2. The results offered by the authors are novel and interesting, while still fitting well with the literature on graph/graphon signal processing.
3. In studying this problem, the authors do not restrict to one single approach. Rather, they show two different solutions to Problem 2 via different methods, which makes for a very good discussion.
4. In Section 5, the authors make a concrete connection between their theory of graphon uniqueness sets and applications to large graphs.

### Weaknesses
1. Applying knowledge of the uniqueness set for a graphon to graphs sampled from that graphon is difficult without knowing about the latent position of the graph's nodes. The authors acknowledge this weakness at the end of Section 5, though, so I don't count this as too strong of a weakness.
2. It is not clear how robust the constructed uniqueness sets are to violations of perfect bandlimitedness. For instance, if a signal is only approximately bandlimited w.r.t. some cutoff frequency $\lambda$, I would hope that a reconstruction of that signal using a uniqueness set for $\lambda$ would be stable. Specifically, the paper does not address the stability of the reconstruction when the signal has spectral components beyond the assumed bandlimit. This is a crucial point, as real-world signals are rarely perfectly bandlimited, and the performance of the proposed method in such scenarios needs to be rigorously analyzed. Furthermore, the paper does not discuss how the size of the uniqueness set, $q$, affects the robustness to deviations from bandlimitedness. It is possible that a larger $q$ could offer better stability, but this is not explored.

### Questions
1. In the statement of Theorem 2, signals $X\in L^2(S)$ are considered, but then the operator $L$ is applied to $X$. It is not clear here which Laplacian $L$ is: I presume it is the scaled normalized Laplacian of $\Gamma(S)$. My question, then, is how is the Laplacian understood to act on $X$ when $X$ is not a signal in $L^2(D)$, but rather $L^2(S)$. Is there a canonical inclusion $L^2(S)$ in $L^2(D)$ that I am missing here? Please clarify the statement of Theorem 2. Could you please provide a comment on Point 2 in the weaknesses section above? In particular, I would like to see further justification for applying methods based on signal bandlimitedness to the datasets used in Section 6. It is not obvious to me if these signals are bandlimited, in which case I have no reason to believe that the uniqueness sets yield stable representations of the signals.

### Summary
This paper studies graph reductions from the perspective of graphons. It finds a subset of vertices such as a signal on them can be uniquely reconstructed on the rest of the graph, given that the signal comes from a limited family. When the family of signals are coming from the top few eigenvalues, it gives an algorithms based on sampling points from intervals that form graphons. The effectiveness of this method is then experimentally tested against node classification and eigenvalues.

### Strengths
The paper is closely connected with the extensive literature on graphons, as well as prior works on graph size reductions. It gives both theoretical bounds as well as experimental verifications of the approaches.

### Weaknesses
The algorithms as well as theorems in the paper feel more motivated by the theory of graphons than concrete applications. While there is a lot of general utility in such work, the amount of definitional work feels overwhelming to me, especially given that the end goal is to preserve eigenvalues / quality of classification algorithms. However, this is understandable given the extensive depth of this topic.

### Questions
Does the theorems developed in Section 4 imply a direct bound on the quality of applying the algorithm in Section 5 to node classification?

### Summary
The authors propose a theory on signal sampling from graphons and provide a poincare type inequality for graphon signals. In particular, they show that unique sampling sets on a convergent graph sequence converge to unique sampling sets on the corresponding graphon. They propose a graphon signal sampling algorithm and empirically test its performance.

### Strengths
Originality and Novelty: The approach that the authors propose is, to the best of my knowledge, original and novel.
Significance: Nowadays it is certainly an interesting and important topics to study graphons, graph signal processing, and related tasks in ML. The machinery proposed in this paper, such as the graphon Laplacian and the graphon fourier transform, are themselves interesting constructs that could find wider adoption potentially. 
Quality: The technical claims are, to the best of my knowledge, sound and reasonable, although I did not check any proofs in the appendix in detail. The convergence results on uniqueness sets are sufficiently deep for publication at a venue like ICLR. 
Clarity: The article is written moderately clearly, but is presented in a very dense manner.

### Weaknesses
The main weakness is in the presentation and exposition:

The paper is presented in a very dense way,  My main suggestion to the authors is to provide more motivation and background for the readers. For example, a general ML audience might not have a very good idea of what a poincare inequality is. Setting the motivation and background up more allows for a broader audience and a more enjoyable read.

### Questions
- One canonical way to motivate graphons is via the Aldous-Hoover theorem, which motivates a latent variable perspective on graphons if one sees the nodes as exchangeable. I think the paper by Aldous (1981) and Hoover (1979) are classical references that should be cited/acknowledged in studies discussing graphons. 

- One potential limitation of the graphon sampling approach is that many real life graphs are sparse, but graphons can only be reasonably motivated by dense graphs. Obviously, this is not a short coming of this research (since it is an open problem), but I think it would be reasonable for the authors to mention this explicitly in their paper to provide a comprehensive/balanced perspective.
