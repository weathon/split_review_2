## Abstract
Weather forecasting and time series prediction can be modeled as autoregressive prediction tasks and optimized through a pretraining-finetuning paradigm. We discovered that simply incorporating an element-wise logarithmic operation following the standard square error loss, which we term MLSE, noticeably enhances long-term forecast performance in the fine-tuning phase. Remarkably, MLSE acts as a plug-and-play, zero-cost enhancement for autoregressive tasks. In this paper, we conduct a series of comprehensive experiments that support the effectiveness of MLSE. Furthermore, we present a phenomenological theory to dive into the feasibility and limitations of MLSE, by modeling the rate of error accumulation. Our findings propose a promising direction for understanding long-term prediction based on finite history.

### Summary
This paper considers a particular approach for auto-regressive time series forecasting specifically, in which a model is pre-trained with next-step prediction and then fine-tuned for multiple auto-regressive prediction steps (for which predictions and errors are propagated).  

The authors propose to use a mean log squared error (MLSE) loss for fine-tuning, rather than the basic mean squared error (MSE) loss - that is for updating the model further based on the error for more than just the next time step prediction (which is still in this setting less than the target horizon for which the models are evaluated).

The authors show with experiments on weather forecasting datasets and a couple non-weather time series datasets, for multiple different target horizons and base models, that using this MLSE loss consistently (for the majority of cases) offers some improvement (reduction in test error) compared to MSE fine-tuning.

They provide some analysis and justification for using this loss base on a concept of error amplification relating different-order errors (i.e., errors after multiple auto-regressive steps), and further discuss limitations.

### Strengths
-The experiments involved multiple datasets and horizons, and showed consistent improvement using MSLE vs MSE, which is interesting

-The problem and setting were well-motivated

-The proposed method is very practical, in that it requires only a very simple modification to the existing common loss function and approach used (i.e., simply taking the log of the squared errors)

### Weaknesses
 - The novelty seems somewhat limited.  The only new thing introduced is adding a "log" transform in the fine tuning loss function - everything else is prior work. Mean squared log error is not a new metric or loss, and has been used for both training and evaluating forecast models before.  One could argue the connection to error accumulation in this particular setting (and the application particularly to fine-tuning) is the novel part, but this the justification for this does not seem so clear, aside from experiment results.


- The paper is not very clear or detailed.  E.g., the actually loss functions used in each training phase are not well defined, there are many details left out, such as how hyper parameters are selected and models tuned.  There are many incomplete sentences.  The details in the explanations / formulation are lacking and not clear.  E.g., many detail are left out in section 4 making it hard to follow.  It's not clearly explained how the error metrics are computed in the reported results - for example, for table 2, an a particular range like 096 - is this computed averaged across predictions for all time steps 1 to 96, or just the last time step?


- The justification for adding the log transform in the loss seems lacking and not so clear and not really tied to the motivating points.  
  - I.e., it's posed that existing approaches (using MSE loss between Nth order n-step prediction and ground truth) for fine-tuning suffer from error accumulation, but it's not clear how the proposed approach addresses this, especially since they end up using the same base error in the loss in the end. They instead state the goal of including more order error terms (i.e., at each time step as opposed to just the last), claiming without any substantiation that this can improve performance - but essentially state it's more efficient to use their approach to approximate this.  Meanwhile, prior work has used errors for each prediction step as well (as this is the typical approach for RNNs or CNNs) - which should already be doing what they are aiming to do (albeit arguably less efficiently) - and this is not compared to in the experiments.  
  - In the analyses, the authors claim the Nth order error can be seen as the 1st order error plus some error accumulation term, then state that its most efficient to reduce / optimize for this Nth order error by optimizing for the 1st order error plus the "error amplifier" term (and subsequently drop the 1st order error part as well) - presumably as a way to bring in the other error terms - but the equating analysis is a bit of a stretch and requires multiple assumptions.  Additionally, they also state that the 1st order error is already accounted for by the pre-training step, so fine-tuning can focus on the error amplifier, which is then roughly approximated by the mean log squared nth order error (bringing the loss back to the original objective anyway, just with a log term).  This seems like an unjustified assumption, since fine-tuning a neural net can cause the original concept learned to be forgotten, but I would suspect that since the nth order error depends on the 1st order error anyway, it would likely avoid the first order error getting worse, but it's not justified in this way here.  


- Experimental procedure and results seems a bit lacking.
  - As mentioned, specifics around hyper parameters and how they are selected are missing.
  - For experiment results, it's hard to tell if the difference shown is significant, because the differences generally seem very small, no error bars are reported, and apparently a single sample is used to get the test error scores.  Along with not knowing how methods are tuned, it's hard to say if the improvements shown aren't from over-fitting to the particular test sample.  In general it's hard not to be skeptical of the results in light of the lack of details, given the very minor change applied.  
  - It would also be better to see the mean and variance of the results over multiple test sets (test windows) and model training runs - e.g., with time series cross-validation (sliding window evaluation)
   - It seems like the e2e approaches are not applied as e2e - so it is not really a fair comparison - as it's stated they are applied auto-regressively after the initial output window, which defeats the purpose.
  - Another thing that casts some doubts on the correctness of results, is that the forecasts for the 0-96 output horizon for which the e2e models are specifically trained does worse than the auto-regressive approach fine-tuning those same models for additional future horizons, according to the results (Table 2).  This doesn't seem to make much sense - since the fine-tuning is causing the models to focus on future errors which the models are not even evaluated on, and this would typically only match the targeted models performance or possibly make it worse.  Yet somehow in these results it always improves it.  However, this would trivially make sense, if the metric being evaluated in this case is the prediction only on the last timestep in that window (i.e., at time step 96) as the fine-tuning would cause the model to focus more on predicting that time step in particular more accurately (at the expense of other time steps like 95, 94, etc.) - so these results are not really showing anything when it comes to comparing to E2E.  Since for the E2E case we also care about predicting accurately all the time steps before the last one being predicted in that prediction window - and these models were not given the opportunity to be trained focusing on one particular time step - so it's also not a fair comparison.

### Summary
This paper focuses on the autoregressive prediction task. The key contribution is the proposed elementwise logarithmic operation following the standard square error loss, i.e., Mean Logarithm Square Error (MLSE), for improved forecasting performance. Generally extensive experiments are performed to support this claim.

### Strengths
1.	The proposed elementwise logarithmic operation following the standard square error loss, i.e., Mean Logarithm Square Error (MLSE), for improved long-term forecasting performance. Some theoretical analysis is provided. 
2.	Generally extensive empirical studies.

### Weaknesses
1.	Although this paper proposes a simple and effective trick for autoregressive prediction, its significance is not enough for a ICLR publication. 
2.	Experiments: In this paper the weather forecasting task is considered as a typical autoregressive prediction task. In fact, in weather forecasting we are interested in large n. For example, in the hourly forecasting, if we are interested in the weather forecast in the next 3 days, then we have n=72. From Table 1, when n increases, the performance advantage of the propose trick seems decrease for T+3. Thus, it would be very interesting to explore the comparison for some large values of n.

### Summary
Authors introduce a new loss that is able to mitigate error-propagation in autoregressive systems which is an especially relevant problem for the time-series and spatio-temporal forecasting literatures. Their proposal is to use the logarithm of the Mean Squared Error (MSE) instead of the MSE alone which seems to help in time-series forecasting for some architectures and is competitive for spatio-temporal modeling (e.g. weather forecasting in this case). Moreover, the authors present a theoretical justification for their approach, which is based off the "error amplifier" that they try to minimize and using the theoretical justification, they arrive at different losses, of which, they chose the logarithm one for its superior empirical results.

### Strengths
- Authors present a plug-and-play method that requires a small change in the training loss, which makes its adoption as well as iterating over and comparing against much easier
- Extensive and rigourous experiments were done, both for weather forecasting which is a multi-dimensional problem and plain time-series forecasting. MLSE shows strong performance for some time-series architectures while it's competitive for weather forecasting.
- A theoretical justification for the MLSE is provided.
- MLSE is "ablated" against other variants from the theory section.

### Weaknesses
 - Paper is poorly written and would benefit from a much needed overhaul:
  - \citep{} should be used instead of \citet{} whenever parenthetical citations are needed.
  - When referenceing figures, it's better to say "Figure 4" instead of "Figure4" or "Fig.4" which makes it more readable (same goes for tabkes as well).
  - In page 7, $\alpha^20$ should be replaced by $\alpha^{20}$.
  - Overall style could be improved.
- Although a theoretical justification is presented in section 4, some assumptions are made without justification:
   - While the orthogonality conjecture is true in high dimensions for random uniform vectors (https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/3059747/probability-of-two-random-points-being-orthogonal-in-higher-dimensional-unit-sph), it would be at least worth it to provide a justification for it in the appendix. Specifically, the assumption that the error vectors are uniformly distributed on a high-dimensional sphere needs to be explicitly stated and justified. It's not clear if the error distributions from the neural network would satisfy this assumption. The high dimensionality alone is not sufficient.
   - In equation 2, I don't understand how: $\frac{||\epsilon^N_{t+N} - \epsilon^I_{t+N}||}{||\epsilon^{N-1}_{t+N-1}||} \approx \frac{||\epsilon^N_{t+N}|| - ||\epsilon^I_{t+N}||}{||\epsilon^{N-1}_{t+N-1}||}$. No justification is provided for why the approximation holds. This seems to be very important for the theoretical derivations and conclusions made after. The approximation implies that the angle between the error vectors is close to zero or that one error vector is significantly larger than the other, but this is not explained or proven. This approximation needs a more in-depth analysis of the error vector properties. Moreover, the approximation is used to derive the final loss function, so any error in the approximation will propagate to the loss function.
- LMSE is the same as LMAE (up to a constant), so it would be fairer to include training under MAE loss as well.

### Questions
- Inconsistent error definition between section 2 and section 4 which can be confusing.
- For how many orders does the Dalpha strategy optimize for ? Does it pick one order ?
- How is MASE an improved alternative over Dalpha? They seem two different things altogether. Dalpha optimizes the relative errors while MASE optimizes each error separately
- I don't understand how the conclusion towards using the logarithm is made, in the paper it's just mentioned that "it should be", but that's not sufficient.

### Summary
Time series prediction can be modeled as an autoregressive task and optimized through a pretraining-finetuning strategy. This paper proposes MLSE, an element-wise logarithmic operation following the standard square error loss, which enhances long-term forecast performance in the fine-tuning phase. MLSE acts as a plug-and-play enhancement for any autoregressive task.

### Strengths
1. The authors propose a simple yet effective method to enhance performance in long-term time series forecasting.
2. The proposed method performs well across a variety of datasets, forecasting models, and forecasting time steps.
3. The authors offer theoretical support for their proposed method.

### Weaknesses
1. Given that this paper focuses on the study of loss functions for time series forecasting, there should be comparisons with more time series loss functions. For example, see [1]. Specifically, the paper lacks comparisons with loss functions tailored for time series, such as those that incorporate temporal dependencies or are robust to outliers, which are common in time series data. A more comprehensive evaluation should include metrics beyond RMSE, such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), or metrics that assess forecast accuracy at different horizons.
2. The quality of writing needs significant improvement. The paper contains numerous typos, grammatical mistakes, and incorrect LaTeX function usages. The equations, in particular, are difficult to follow. For instance, the notation is not consistently defined, and the mathematical derivations lack clarity. The explanation of the core mathematical concepts is not intuitive, making it hard to grasp the essence of the proposed method. Refer to the questions below.
3. To have a deeper understanding of the proposed loss function, it would be beneficial to include traditional, straightforward models into the experiments, such as autoregression (AR), ARIMA, or DeepAR [2]. The absence of these baseline models makes it difficult to assess the true contribution of the proposed method. It is unclear whether the performance gains are due to the proposed loss function or simply due to the use of more complex models.

### Questions
1. On page 4, what do T850 and Z500 represent?
2. What is the difference between the experiments done in Sections 3.1 and 3.2? Why have the authors chosen different forecasting models for each section?
3. There should be more explanation about the penultimate equation on page 6, which is about the propagation matrix M.
