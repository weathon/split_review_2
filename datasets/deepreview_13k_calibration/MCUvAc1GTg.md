## Abstract
Network alignment is the task of establishing one-to-one correspondences between the nodes of different graphs and finds a plethora of applications in high-impact domains. However, this task is known to be NP-hard in its general form, and existing algorithms do not scale up as the size of the graphs increases. To tackle both challenges we propose a novel generalized graph autoencoder architecture, designed to extract powerful and robust node embeddings, that are tailored to the alignment task. We prove that the generated embeddings are associated with the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the graphs and can achieve more accurate alignment compared to classical spectral methods. Our proposed framework also leverages transfer learning and data augmentation to achieve efficient network alignment at a very large scale without retraining. Extensive experiments on both network and sub-network alignment with real-world graphs provide corroborating evidence supporting the effectiveness and scalability of the proposed approach.

### Summary
Network alignment is the task of establishing one-to-one correspondences between the nodes of different graphs. In this work, the authors propose a graph autoencoder architecture designed to extract node embeddings that are tailored to the alignment task. They prove that the generated embeddings are associated with the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the graphs and can achieve more accurate alignment compared to classical spectral methods.

### Strengths
1. The paper is easy to follow, and the claims made by the authors are very clear.
2. Theorem 3.2 effectively supports their proposed approach, comparing the performance of a GNN to that of the spectral approach.

### Weaknesses
1. There is little explanation on their actual model, i.e., Figure 1 and 2. The authors should give the full information of their approach in the main paper, not in the appendix (maybe E.4).
2. In Table 3, the performance improvement over WAlign or FINAL seems negligible. Since the “perturbed” datasets are created synthetically by the authors, there should be more realistic benchmarks that can exhibit the superiority of the approach.
3. Although the authors include 8 graph datasets in the experiments, there is only one setting of experiments; they used specific 4 datasets in the training, and evaluated on all the datasets. Why do the authors pick this setting? Can they perform experiments with more diversity?
4. (Related to Weakness 2) In Section 5.2.2, the authors create the datasets using the same perturbation approach used for their proposed method. The performance improvement is not surprising because of that reason. It might be better to find a real perturbation scenario and see if their proposed way of perturbation can deal with realistic problems.
5. There are too much white space and redundant writing in the paper. For example, Remark 4.1 is unnecessary since the authors repeatedly say about that throughout the paper. Equations (8), (9) and (10) can be also presented more concisely. The authors can bring more important information into the paper if they use the space more efficiently.

### Questions
1. The authors claim that “The implications of this framework are of paramount importance since they enable node embedding and graph matching for large-scale graphs, where training is computationally prohibitive.” How does Equation (9) lead to scalability?

### Summary
In the submitted manuscript, the authors propose a graph autoencoder model (T-GAE) to perform the task of network alignment. They prove that alignment results obtained from their T-GAE are at least as accurate as traditional alignment methods based on the elementwise absolute value of adjacency matrix eigenvectors. They furthermore propose to augment the training dataset by perturbing and permuting training graphs to yield a GAE, which is more robust to noise and potentially more transferable between datasets. In a range of experiments they find their T-GAE model to outperform several baseline models on the task of network alignment.

### Strengths
- The ideas are clearly presented and it is very easy to follow your writing. 
- The complexity analysis in Section 4.4 and the Limitations paragraph in Section 5.3 are nice additions. 
- The approach you propose is well-motivated (so well in fact that I am surprised that it has not been published already).

### Weaknesses
 - While the general ideas are clearly presented I would have liked to see more technical detail in several places. Generally, your presentation of the concepts sometimes was a little superficial (for example would it be nice if you extended Section 4 to also describe your proposed model in greater detail).
- Several of the statements made in your paper are either too general to be true (see Question 1).
- The experimental evaluation could likely be further improved (see Question 3).

- Several of the statements made in your paper are either too general to be true (see Question 1).
- The experimental evaluation could likely be further improved (see Question 3).

- It seems to me that several of the claims you make in the paper are stated too generally to be true and cannot be substantiated by evidence, e.g., "enable a generalized framework that can be applied to out-of-distribution graphs that have not been observed during training" (there is no guarantee that you can perform well on out-of-distribution graphs, in fact we already observe strong performance drops at 5% perturbation rates; this should be clarified) and "the learned mapping can be applied to larger, big-data graphs with high accuracy and efficiency", as well as "to tackle network alignment at a very large scale" (the largest network you consider has 18 thousand nodes and 81 thousand edges, in the context of the ogb benchmarks [1] for example it is difficult to call your considered data sets "very large" or even "big-data"). I therefore want to ask you to please weaken these statements to be more realistic or to provide further evidence to substantiate these claims in the generality in which they are stated.

- In Section 4.3 in your data augmentation method you propose to permute the node labels of the perturbed graphs. GNNs should either be permutation equivariant or invariant to node permutation, in either case the permutation of node labels in your perturbed graphs should be inconsequential. Could you therefore please motivate the node permutation in your data augmentation method?

- Your experimental evaluation could be further improved.

- Using a standard graph autoencoder and graph variational autoencoder as a baseline seems intuitive to me and would provide a nice ablation study to give insight on which parts of your architecture are major contributors to your observed performance increases.

- While you state DeepWalk to be one of your baseline models, it is absent in Table 3 and only used for subgraph matching in Figure 3. Could you please explain why you choose not to use it for graph matching?

- While this is certainly not a requirement, it might be worthwhile to include more advanced unsupervised embedding methods such as LINE [2] in your baselines to strengthen the evidence in favour of your model.

- The larger datasets you transfer to are known to be structurally similar to the smaller datasets you trained on, e.g., they are also homophilic. It might be more meaningful to consider to what degree your pre-trained models transfer to datasets with drastically different characteristica, such as for example heterophilic datasets. Or whether your method is still viable at even larger scale than 18 thousand nodes.

- Minor comments:

- The font in Figure 1 is too small to be comfortably read on a print-out.

- It is unclear to me what you mean by a GNNs output being unique. It would be good if you could clarify your use of the word unique in the paper. GNNs can produce equal representations of different graphs (see for example [3]) and consequently, one could reasonably claim GNN embeddings to not be unique in the sense that GNN embeddings do not uniquely identify graphs they correspond to.

- There is minor errors in the bold font setting in Tables 3 and 4, e.g., "90.0\pm0.4" in row 1 column 3 of Table 3 and "90.1\pm0.4" in row 1 column 3 Table 4.

- I could not see where you describe or reference the GNN_c, which seems to be one of the backbones of your T-GAE. Could you please add further detail on this model or point me to the part of your paper where this is described?

### Summary
This paper proposes a network alignment technique using GNN, which is called T-GAE. Compared with other network alignment approaches, T-GAE is capable of transferring to other unseen graphs, and as such, the alignment can also be performed without retraining. Specifically, T-GAE devises a GNN encoder to match nodes from different graphs. Through permutation and perturbation, different versions of graphs are generated to be augmented datasets. These datasets enable T-GAE to have generalization and be extended to other graphs. The transferability helps T-GAE perform network alignment on other graphs without retraining.

### Strengths
+ The generated embeddings are theoretically more capable compared with spectral methods. The theorem provides a lower bound that supports T-GAE to have high performance in network alignment.
+ According to the experiments, T-GAE performs well in transferability, which avoids plenty of retraining. Moreover, T-GAE can be extended to graphs with larger sizes, which is much more scalable compared with existing methods.
+ T-GAE is robust with regard to the permutation noise.

### Weaknesses
- There are many typos, e.g., Figure 1’s caption: traing -> training; Figure 5: Spectrul -> Spectral; Theorem 3.2: a solutions -> solutions. What does 1 mean in the 5th line in Appendix H.1?
- ⋆ and * are too similar in Theorem and it is hard to distinguish them. I suggest the authors could substitute them with some other symbols.
- Theorem 3.2 looks sound, but not all the adjacencies have non-repeated eigenvalues, so the lower bound is not always satisfied. This is a significant limitation as the theorem's applicability is contingent on a property not universally held by adjacency matrices, potentially undermining the theoretical justification for the method in certain cases.
- Some other concerns can be referred to in the `Questions’ section.

### Questions
- How is S generated from a family of graphs? In the experiments, does S mean the adjacency matrices and their permuted-perturbed versions? How can this family of graphs be extended to other untrained graphs? I understand that the permutation and perturbation can augment the datasets but they still cannot cover the distribution of the unseen datasets.
- Are the 10 randomly perturbed samples the same in training and test on Celegans, Arena, Douban, and Cora networks?
- Does perturbation widely exist in real-world datasets?
- I notice that the perturbation is also reported in FINAL, and they even test the 20% perturbation noise while 5% is reported for T-GAE. However, the performance of FINAL is very stable but is quite bad in Table 3. Please explain the reason.
- Why are the results of graphwave not reported on DBLP and Coauthor CS?
- What is the future work for T-GAE?

### Summary
The paper proposed T-GAE, a generalized graph autoencoder architecture which produces node embedding tailored to perform graph alignment which is equivalent to QAP. The authors drew the connection between GNNs and Spectral methods in graph matching. T-GAE uses transfer learning to perform network alignment on large graphs. Through extensive experimentation, the authors demonstrated the effectiveness of T-GAE compared to other baselines.

### Strengths
1. The authors established a connection between GNNs and spectral methods, and proved that there always exists a GNN that can perform at least as well as the spectral approach. The authors provided comprehensive proofs for these theorems.

2. The authors proposed a self-supervised framework, that can also scale for large graphs by leveraging transfer learning

3. T-GAE empirically outperformed the baselines on graph matching and subgraph matching tasks, especially at higher perturbation levels.

### Weaknesses
1. The authors did not compare their model with recent state-of-the-art models like S-GWL[1], Cone-Align[2] which could have been good baselines to compare against.
2. The runtimes are not provided for Graph matching datasets. Fig. 5 in appendix has runtime comparison only for Subgraph matching tasks.
3. The authors mentioned that T-GAE takes more time to train on larger networks compared to WAlign but did not provide specific training times for GNN-based methods, which would offer a better context for this statement. Furthermore, the runtime comparison in Figure 5 only shows the time to generate embeddings, not the total training time.
4. It appears in section 5.3, Fig. 3 should be referenced but instead Fig. 5 is referenced
5. README.txt in the repository mentions that the submission is for Neurips 2023.
6. The accuracy scores of the degree-perturbation model are less than the uniform-probability perturbation model at higher perturbation levels, but the reasons for this are not clearly explained or analyzed. It is unclear why a degree-based perturbation would lead to a more significant performance drop compared to a random perturbation, and this requires further investigation.

### Questions
1. Why did you not compare with state-of-the-art recent approaches like S-GWL[1] and Cone-Align[2]?
2. What are the runtimes for Graph matching tasks? Runtime comparison is provided only for Subgraph matching tasks. Also, what are the training times for GNN-based methods?
3. Why are the accuracy scores of the degree-perturbation model less than the uniform-probability perturbation model, at higher perturbation level?
