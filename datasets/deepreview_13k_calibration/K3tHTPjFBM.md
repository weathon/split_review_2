## Abstract
Understanding and leveraging the 3D structures of proteins is central to various tasks in biology and drug discovery. While deep learning has been applied successfully for modeling protein structures, current methods usually employ distinct models for different tasks. Such a single-task strategy is not only resource-consuming when the number of tasks increases but also incapable of combining multi-source datasets for larger-scale model training, given that protein datasets are usually of small size for most structural tasks. In this paper, we propose to adopt one single model to address multiple tasks jointly, upon the input of 3D protein structures. In particular, we first construct a standard multi-task benchmark called PROMPT, consisting of 6 representative tasks integrated from 4 public datasets. The resulting benchmark contains partially labeled data for training and fully-labeled data for validation/testing. Then, we develop a novel graph neural network for multi-task learning, dubbed Heterogeneous Multichannel Equivariant Network (HeMeNet), which is equivariant to 3D rotations/translations/reflections of proteins and able to capture various relationships between different atoms owing to the heterogeneous multichannel graph construction of proteins. Besides, HeMeNet is able to achieve task-specific learning via the task-aware readout mechanism. Extensive evaluations verify the effectiveness of multi-task learning on our benchmark, and our model generally surpasses state-of-the-art models. Our study is expected to open up a new venue for structure-based protein learning.

### Summary
This paper presents a multitask learning framework for protein property prediction. Specifically, a dataset is constructed consisting 6 tasks from 4 sources and an equivariant Transformer is proposed to extract task-specific embeddings in a multitask setting. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed strategy.

### Strengths
+ The formulation is clearly motivated and could benefit a wide range of biochemistry problems
+ The idea is easy to understand and the paper is well written
+ Protein representations seems to benefit from the proposed multitask learning paradigm

### Weaknesses
 - The current presentation of the datasets and their construction appears to be straightforward. It is essential for the readers to understand the nature and significance of the studied properties: EC, MF, BP, and CC. It would be helpful if the authors could elucidate whether these properties are mere one-hot encodings of certain database indices or if they carry deeper biological or computational significance. Specifically, the paper lacks a discussion on the granularity of these labels; for instance, are EC numbers treated as a flat classification problem, or is the hierarchical structure of the EC classification considered? Similarly, for MF, BP, and CC, are GO terms used directly, or are they simplified, and how does this impact the learning task?
- It would be constructive if the authors provide insight into how these properties (EC, MF, BP, CC) interact or interplay with each other. Explaining this can give a clearer understanding of how collectively these properties can enhance protein representation learning. The paper mentions multi-task learning but does not elaborate on whether the tasks are complementary or if there are potential conflicts between them. A more detailed analysis of the relationships between these tasks, perhaps using correlation analysis or other methods, would strengthen the justification for the multi-task approach.
- The claim that the Transformer is E(3)-equivariant is not evident from the text. A detailed proof or a more comprehensive explanation of this feature is required. The paper needs to clarify which parts of the model are equivariant and which are invariant. Specifically, it is unclear how the geometric relation extractor and message scaler maintain equivariance, and whether the task-aware readout also preserves this property. A rigorous mathematical justification or a clear architectural explanation is needed.
- It would be beneficial for the readers to understand the motivation and design principles behind the geometric relation extractor and message scaler. Providing the rationale can establish the unique contribution of this work and its difference from existing architectures. The paper should explain why these specific designs were chosen over other possible methods for message passing and feature scaling. For example, what are the limitations of existing message-passing schemes that the proposed approach aims to address? What are the benefits of the dynamic scaling approach compared to static scaling?
- The experimental results seem to be marginal on some tasks. The multitask baselines employed all rely on sum pooling for aggregating task-specific embeddings. A stronger baseline or justification for the chosen approach would give more credibility to the reported results. The paper should also consider more sophisticated multi-task learning baselines, such as those that use attention mechanisms or task-specific layers, to provide a more robust comparison. Additionally, the paper should provide a more detailed analysis of the performance on individual tasks, including error analysis and a discussion of the limitations of the proposed method.

### Questions
Apart from points in the "weakness" part, the authors may need to provide a table summarizing the dataset with more statistics, e.g., the ratio of missing targets. Also, there are some missing details in the model architecture, e.g., $\phi_m, \phi_x, \epsilon$.

### Summary
The paper introduces a benchmark dataset for atom-level multi-task learning in the context of proteins. Accompanying this, the authors present a heterogeneous equivariant graph neural network designed to support multi-task learning. The newly introduced dataset, named Protein Multiple Task (PROMPT), comprises 31,887 samples and encompasses six distinct tasks, spanning ligand binding affinity predictions, protein-protein interactions, enzyme commission number predictions, as well as molecular function, biological process, and cellular component properties.

The proposed neural network, referred to as the Heterogeneous Multichannel Equivariant Network (HeMeNet), is adept at learning through heterogeneous message passing across various edge types while maintaining invariance to E3 transformations. HeMeNet incorporates an attention-based task-aware readout mechanism, enabling simultaneous learning of different tasks. The architecture is optimized through the summation of losses from the multiple tasks it addresses.

### Strengths
1. The benchmark dataset can be convenient and practical for studying protein properties.

2. The experiment results of HeMeNet are strong, as presented in Table1.

3. The paper is easy to follow.

### Weaknesses
1. The proposed benchmark, in my evaluation, does not exhibit novelty in terms of introducing new protein structures or bringing forth innovative tasks for protein learning. PROMPT primarily amalgamates existing protein datasets and employs a matching pipeline to transfer labels between enzyme commission and properties of gene products.

2. The proposed network, HeMeNet, lacks novelty. The concept of heterogeneous message passing, as presented, is simply realized by incorporating additional edge representations into the messages. This core idea appears to be adapted from the existing dyMEAN approach.

3. The computation of the training loss as the simple summation of all sub-losses for multi-task learning is overly simplistic.

### Questions
1. I would like to propose an experiment to investigate the internal transfer of information within the tasks. For instance, in your experiments involving ligand binding affinity (LBA) and protein-protein interactions (PPI) predictions, you set the weight of PPI to zero during training, effectively isolating the loss of LBA. I suggest conducting an experiment where the predictions of PPI are optimized on the test and validation data, even with a zero weight during training. This would allow us to explore the extent to which information from one task can be transferred and benefit the prediction of another task during testing and validation.

### Summary
This paper aims to conduct multi-task learning of protein 3D structures. To do that, the authors build a benchmark named PROMPT integrating the structures and labels from 4 public datasets. The PROMPT dataset contains 3 different types of inputs, including single-chain proteins, protein-protein, and ligand-protein complexes. On top of that, the authors propose a Heterogeneous Multichannel Equivariant Network (HeMeNet) as the base neural architecture of multi-task learning. A task-aware readout mechanism is designed to associate the output head of each task with a learnable task prompt. Extensive experiments compared to a few baselines on the single-task setting and multi-task setting confirm the superiority of HeMeNet.

### Strengths
- The authors contribute a new multi-task benchmark by integrating 4 public datasets. Protein data samples are properly processed to obtain fully multi-task labels. 
- They propose an Equivariant GNN with structural protein inputs and different readouts for several tasks. Self-attention and learnable task vectors are employed in task-aware readouts. 
- Empirical performance on fully labeled test sets demonstrates significantly better performance of the proposal than other baselines.
- The paper is well-written and easy to follow. The experiments are clear.

### Weaknesses
 - The motivation of this paper can be further enhanced. That is, protein representation learning has been greatly enhanced by a pre-trained mechanism in a self-supervised way. It is not convincing to me why multi-task is still of high research interest. I would like to see more explanation to motivate this paper. Further, some empirical evidence would also be helpful.
- There are previous studies demonstrating similar performance gains for proteins from multi-task sequence models, such as [1][2][3]. I acknowledge that it is non-trivial to extend the success in using sequential information to structural information and build structural benchmarks. Yet the novelty and contribution of building such a benchmark alone, when the proposed HeMeNet is not adequately novel, is not as expected to be published in the main conference of ICLR. 
- The HeMeNet network is similar to existing GNN-based protein structure models, like dyMEAN. Also, for task-aware readouts, there are a few recent works inspired by prompt learning and prefix tuning such as [4].
- The experiments do not cover comparisons with prompting LLMs and multi-task protein sequence models. Thus it is not clear how much gain is achieved.

### Summary
This work proposes a multi-task learning framework for structure-based protein function prediction. At the first place, authors contribute a multi-task benchmark dataset PROMPT that incorporates protein-ligand affinity prediction, protein-protein affinity prediction and protein function prediction. For addressing the multi-task learning under such a set, authors employ a multi-relational equivariant encoder for extracting protein representations and use task-specific heads for prediction. Based the experimental results, the proposed architecture outperforms previous architectures (like GVP and GearNet) on single-task learning, and some benefits are observed on ligand-protein and protein-protein affinity prediction by applying multi-task learning.

### Strengths
+ The proposed benchmark dataset is carefully curated to avoid potential data leakage (e.g. proteins similar to test cases are observed during training), and the additional efforts are paid to annotate unlabeled data using UniProt knowledge.
+ It is an interesting research topic to study the influence of function prediction on affinity prediction and vice versa.

### Weaknesses
 - The comparison experiments do not sufficiently illustrate the effect of each single task on each other task, and thus less insights can be obtained from the current draft.
- Some important baseline models are omitted in performance comparison.
- The proposed protein encoder lacks some novelty, which looks like a simple combination of GearNet and dyMEAN layers. 

Detailed in the Question section.

### Questions
In general, I am convinced by the benchmark construction process and regard it as a decent contribution in this field. However, in terms of experimental comparison and multi-task learning, I have concerns as below:

1. In current multi-task learning experiments, we can observe obvious performance decay on function prediction tasks after coupling with affinity prediction, which is counter-intuitive. There should be some deep analysis on this phenomenon.

2. Although performance gains are observed on affinity prediction after coupling with function prediction tasks, it is still not clear which specific task (EC, MF, BP or CC) leads to such increase. Authors are suggested to supplement more fine-grained task-coupling results, i.e., LBA&PPI + EC, LBA&PPI + MF, LBA&PPI + BP and LBA&PPI + CC. These results can help us better identify good task combinations. 

3. There are some state-of-the-art protein encoders ignored for performance comparison, like CDConv [a] and Full-atom GearNet [b].

4. A more thorough discussion on the technique contributions against GearNet and dyMEAN is suggested.
