## Abstract
Excellent tail performance is crucial for modern machine learning tasks,
such as algorithmic fairness, class imbalance, and risk-sensitive decision making,
as it ensures the effective handling of challenging samples within a dataset.
Tail performance is also a vital determinant of success for personalized recommender systems to reduce the risk of losing users with low satisfaction.
This study introduces a \emph{``safe''} collaborative filtering method that prioritizes recommendation quality for less-satisfied users rather than focusing on the average performance.
Our approach minimizes the conditional value at risk (CVaR), which represents the average risk over the tails of users' loss.
To overcome computational challenges for web-scale recommender systems,
we develop a robust yet practical algorithm that extends the most scalable method, implicit alternating least squares (\ials).
Empirical evaluation on real-world datasets demonstrates the excellent tail performance of our approach while maintaining competitive computational efficiency.

### Summary
The paper proposes SAFER2 for excellent tail performance. \
The paper modified CVaR and devises CVaR-MF and SAFER2.

### Strengths
1. Well-written and organized.
2. Solid derivation and equations.

### Weaknesses
[Major cencerns]
1. Motivation
- As far as I understand, the main motivation of this paper is tail performance. (in Abstract)
- However, I found that the main contribution of this paper focuses on parallel computation and Scalability. (in the manuscript.)
- What if we just put some high weight on the tail users? or What if we just compute gradient only with bottom-$α$% losses?

2. Experiment
- The main experimental result focuses on that SAFER2 shows comparable results when $\alpha=1$ and superior results when $\alpha=0.3$.
- When $\alpha=1$, there are many recent methods outperforming Multi-VAE. e.g., LightGCN, SGCL. and in my opinion, the pair-wise and list-wise loss functions outperform the point-wise loss.
- When $\alpha=0.3$, there are many recent methods enhancing the performance of tail users.
- Did you train two SAFER2 models with $\alpha=1$ and $\alpha=0.3$? If so, that is somewhat unfair for the baselines (e.g., VAE-CF).

### Summary
Authors propose a method for recommender systems via Matrix Factorization, that is having a special type of loss-function that is connected to conditional value at risk (CVaR in Finance). 
However, CVaR is "hard" for optimization, author re-use Rockafellar and Uryasev (2000) reformulation of CVAR to block multi-convex  loss function, over which CVaR-MF optimzation can be done. Still this formulation is not scalable, since max(0,x) part prevents separability for items. Author propose to use Molifier kernels to get strict convexity. 
Finally, they wrap the steps in Smoothing Approach For Efficient Risk-averse Recommender (SAFER2).

### Strengths
Going beyond standard ERM objectives, nice mathematical re-formulation of tail risk CVaR and combining it with Matrix Factorization for Recommender Systems.

### Weaknesses
No clear weakness, except more baselines from Robust Recommender Systems field.

### Questions
Can you make comparison to the existing model:
e.g. Wen, Hongyi, et al. "Distributionally-robust Recommendations for Improving Worst-case User Experience." Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2022. 2022.

In your paper, major contributions are done by forcing re-formulation of CVaR to be scalable. Can you elaborate, what is the problem of controlling the "tail-risk" with distribution-wise losses like divergences (KL), or Wasserstein metrics?

### Summary
The authors target tail performance in recommendation systems- a crucial but often overlooked scenario in the recommendation domain. They propose a collaborative filtering-based training approach for minimizing the conditional value at risk (CVaR), which represents the average risk for tail users. This is in contrast to conventional ERM-based methods, which focus on the overall average performance. The authors first show that a reformulation of the ERM objective using matrix factorization includes a non-smooth and non-linear term, which hampers the objective’s separability, making it difficult to parallelize and scale the approach. The authors circumvent this issue by applying convolution-type smoothing in the objective. They then use convolution-type smoothed quantile estimation in their proposed method, “Smoothing Approach for Efficient Risk-averse Recommender (SAFER2). They evaluate their model in the semi-worst case and average-case scenarios and find that, in general, their approach improves tail performance while maintaining average case performance.

### Strengths
1. The authors propose a novel and efficient approach for making CVaR minimization tractable, allowing them to target tail performance in their training objective.
2. Their approach improves tail performance without significantly impacting average performance.
3. Rigorous mathematical proofs are provided for justifying each step of their algorithm.
4. The authors compare the performance of their model with several baselines and state of the art methods.
5. The experiments also demonstrate that the proposed method is robust and computationally efficient.

### Weaknesses
Some concepts may need to be explained in more detail in the main paper (e.g.- the reformulation of the CVaR minimization objective, smoothing techniques for quantile regression, NR algorithm etc.)

### Questions
No particular questions.
