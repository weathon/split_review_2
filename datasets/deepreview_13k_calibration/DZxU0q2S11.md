## Abstract
The geometrical perspective of deep ReLU networks is important to understand the learning behavior and generalization capability of the neural networks. As such, here we investigate the relationship between the geometric and topological attributes of datasets and ReLU network architectures. Specifically, we first establish the data geometry-dependent bounds of the ReLU network widths and unveil a profound connection between these bounds and the underlying data manifold. Then, we show that topological characteristics are not the sole factor in fully determining network architecture. Rather, by combining the constraints on the hole shapes of the data manifold, the network architecture can be characterized by the Betti numbers of the data manifold. We further provide theoretical and empirical evidences that gradient descent converges to the proposed network configurations.

### Summary
The authors study the ability of neural networks to approximate the indicator
function for $\epsilon$-blowups of convex polytopes (or more generally, the
blowup of a difference of unions of convex polytopes) as a function of the width
and depth of the neural network, versus the complexity of the polytope. The
authors present a general result that says (for example) that a two-layer
network with a number of neurons in the hidden layer growing with the number of
hyperplanes that define the convex polytope $\mathcal{X}$ is sufficient to
represent exactly the indicator function for $\mathcal{X}$ (with a corresponding
lower bound). Further results are given that quantify the width in terms of
Betti numbers or $k$-facets when $\mathcal{X}$ is a simplical complex, as well
as providing a local (initialization-dependent) theory for obtaining such
networks via global minimization of an empirical risk over the data
distribution. Low-dimensional experimental results are presented that verify
that gradient descent finds networks matching the architectural parameters
asserted as sufficient by the theory for two toy data distributions.

### Strengths
- The mathematical writing in the paper is clear and precise. The authors define
  relevant concepts, precisely state hypotheses, include relevant ancillary
  results in appendices with appropriate references, and present a rather robust
  characterization of the problem (in terms of sufficient architectures for
  representing indicators for convex polytopes (with holes), and results that
  specify the widths in terms of complexity parameters of these polytopes).

- The experimental results consider toy (low-dimensional) cases, but present a
  compelling verification of the conclusions of the authors' theoretical
  results.

### Weaknesses
 - The metrics in the paper used to quantify geometric structure in the input
  data (which the theoretical results reflect in terms of the rates for the
  network widths to achieve the feasible architecture property) seem that they
  may be hard to compute in moderate dimensions (presumably, one needs to fit a
  simplical complex to data, and calculate Betti numbers from it). This means it
  may be hard to verify the theory in cases beyond the low-dimensional examples
  highlighted in experiments. I hope the authors will correct me if I am
  mistaken here, and clarify this in the revision.

- The non-technical writing in the paper (in contrast to the mathematical
  writing, highlighted above) suffers from a lack of precision in many areas. I
  would recommend rewriting the abstract to be more in line with the tone of the
  rest of the paper, tuning the first sentence of the introduction (I do not
  think this claim is universally accepted -- arguably, the ability to
  (efficiently) learn these networks is of far greater importance for
  understanding the successes of deep learning), and generally proofreading for
  typos.

- There are two relevant references that I think should be discussed in this
  context -- both are relevant to guarantees for *learning deep networks* when
  the data distribution has nontrivial geometric structure, going beyond the
  present theory on initialization-dependent or pure-representation-capacity
  results. The first is [1], which proves classification guarantees for random
  three-layer neural networks with rates that depend on the geometric structure
  of the input (measured through the Gaussian width). I think it could inform
  the presentation in the present submission to contrast with this work, as the
  way this work proves its results is by studying the way the random
  initialization induces a hyperplane arrangement conducive to separation
  (perhaps similar to the authors' analysis, for representation capacity).
  The second is [2-3], which studies sufficient settings of width and depth to
  classify pairs of one-dimensional curves (in terms of geometric properties of
  the data) with a deep ReLU network trained with gradient descent. This work
  uses very different tools from the present submission, but its motivation is
  relevant, and contrasting with this work may allow the authors to highlight
  salient advantages of their tools/framework.

### Questions
- Can the authors clarify the reason for the focus on representing indicators
  for the relevant polytopes $\mathcal{X}$ (in the kind of $L^\infty$ sense
  mandated by Definition 3.1), and the limitations of this framework for general
  problems of interest? It seems to me that it might be too "hard" of a problem
  to characterize sufficient architectural configurations to fit data
  distributions if one's end goal is a machine learning task such as
  classification (for example, generally, one could classify $\mathcal{X}$
  without exactly representing $\mathbb{1}(\mathcal{X})$). It also seems to me
  that representing $\mathbb{1}(\mathcal{X})$ may not be sufficient to solve
  general nonparametric regression tasks, i.e. to enjoy universal approximation
  of various nonparametric classes defined on $\mathcal{X}$ (please correct me
  if I am mistaken). A significant amount of work has been done in the latter
  setting, specifically on manifolds, which does not seem to have been
  discussed (e.g., [4] and many works by the same authors).

- In Section 3.1, it is not exactly explicitly defined what an "architecture" is
  (relevant to understanding $\mathcal{A}$ in Definition 3.1), but it seems from
  context that it is a fixed choice of inter-layer maps and in particular of
  hidden layer dimensions. A limitation of this definition (c.f. footnote 1)
  seems to be that in general, universal approximation of various nonparmetric
  classes can only be enjoyed with neural networks when the hidden layer
  dimension is allowed to grow -- in other words, the "architecture" involves
  only (in a sense) the computational graph of the neural network, rather than
  particulars (such as input and output dimensions) about the maps corresponding
  to "edges" in the graph. Could the authors clarify this difference, and why
  they have opted to define an "architecture" in this way?

### Summary
The paper suggests feasible shallow ReLU-induced neural network architectures that approximate indicator functions on a space having a polytope basis cover. It proposes lower and upper bounds to network widths in the process, based on Betti numbers in case the underlying space has prism-shaped convex holes. The proposed networks can also be realized based on gradient descent, by minimizing some of the commonly used loss functions.

### Strengths
The organization and writing are of sound quality. The theoretical framework is technically solid and the results clearly address the problem being dealt with. The supporting experiments provide empirical evidence for the findings.

### Weaknesses
 There remain a few typographical/grammatical errors in the manuscript.

 There is a significant gap between the theoretical results and their applicability to real-world datasets. It is often difficult for real data sets to satisfy Assumption 4.2 since the polytopes separating the clusters may not be convex. The paper does not adequately address how the proposed convergence guarantees [Theorem 4.3] can be modified or extended when dealing with non-convex cluster boundaries. Furthermore, the increase in the number of classes, and hence potentially overlapping polytopes, is not sufficiently addressed in terms of its impact on the complexity of the network construction [Page 21].

 The optimality of $3$-layer ReLU networks for approximating indicators is clear from Proposition C.1 and C.2. However, the paper does not provide sufficient justification for the extension of these results to high-dimensional compactly supported functions ($f: R^d \to R^l$), $l>1$, particularly in terms of smoothness. While the authors mention universal approximation (UA) bounds for Lipschitz maps using ReLU feed-forward networks, they do not provide concrete bounds on the network width or depth required to achieve a desired level of approximation for such functions. This is a crucial omission, as the practical utility of the theoretical results hinges on the ability to translate them into concrete network architectures with quantifiable performance guarantees.

 Finally, the paper lacks a thorough discussion on the practical challenges of applying the proposed architectures to real datasets. The authors do not comment on how well the prescriptions regarding architectures hold up against simpler real datasets. As a practitioner, it is often frustrating to witness theoretical suggestions underperforming significantly. For example, to my knowledge, there exists no consistent method of estimating Betti numbers corresponding to even simpler real data distributions, if they at all have punctured supports.

### Questions
1. It is often difficult for real data sets to satisfy Assumption 4.2 since the polytopes separating the clusters may not be convex. Are there any definitive modifications to the proposed convergence guarantees [Theorem 4.3] that the authors can suggest? How does the increase in the number of classes, and hence perhaps overlapping polytopes add to the complexity of the construction [Page 21]?

2. The optimality of $3$-layer ReLU networks for approximating indicators is clear from Proposition C.1 and C.2. Is it true for high-dimensional compactly supported functions ($f: R^d \to R^l$), $l>1$ in general, perhaps of some regularity in terms of smoothness? This seems crucial as there are numerous UA bounds for Lipschitz maps using ReLU feed-forward networks. 

3. Can the authors comment on how well the prescriptions regarding architectures hold up against simpler real datasets? As a practitioner, it is often frustrating to witness theoretical suggestions underperforming significantly. For example, to my knowledge, there exists no consistent method of estimating Betti numbers corresponding to even simpler real data distributions, if they at all have punctured supports.

### Summary
The work explores relationship between the width and, in some cases, the depth, of simple fully-connected neural networks with ReLU activations, and the polytope geometry of data distribution support, in the context of classifiers. Authors describe four constructions of  two to four layers neural networks, approximating indicator functions on convex polytopes, difference of unions of polytopes, simplicial complexes, and convex polytopes with prism-shaped polytopes removed.   Some lower bounds on the width of neural networks approximating such indicator functions  are also stated.  Finally, the work verifies that the constructed networks for convex polytopes can be reached via gradient descent optimization if it is initialized from certain regions of weight space.

### Strengths
1) The article describes a  construction of  two layers neural networks, approximating indicator functions on convex polytopes. The article further uses it for three constructions of three to four layers neural networks, approximating indicator functions on difference of unions of polytopes, simplicial complexes, and convex polytopes with prism-shaped polytopes removed. 

2) While the polytope geometry was explored in many works in the context of ReLU fully connected neural networks, the work is based on the seemingly novel idea, see Figure 5,  that  a simple two layers ReLU network can have a constant output on a convex polytope, contrary to the more standard approach with constant output on cubical sets.

2) For three out of four constructions the work states lower bounds on width of neural networks that can approximate the indicator functions. 

3) The work verifies that the constructed networks for convex polytopes can be reached via gradient descent optimization if it is initialized from certain regions of weight space.

### Weaknesses
Principal weaknesses of the work are:

1) Lack of applications to practical real-world datasets. It is not clear how to count the numbers of polytopes, or j-dim facets in simplicial complex, necessary to approximate a given real-world dataset, so the practical application  of the results is somewhat unclear.

2) Presentation of the paper suffers from several drawbacks. The paper contributions are theoretical, but the presented in the article proofs are too sketchy. The article is intended for a wider iclr community, but because it is too sketchy in the main part, a smooth reading  even for experts is questionable, cf below.

3) Another drawback of the presentation, in the case of the lower bounds: the principal lower bound argument involves the "bent hyperplane argument"  used in several previous works. However the paper does not explain clearly what was done in this context in the previous works compared with what constitutes the paper's novelty when establishing the lower bounds.

4) The numerous allusions to topological aspects are heavily overstated. The only place, where some topological notion appears, namely Betti numbers,  is in the fourth construction (Theorem 3.7) involving the polytopes with  prism-shaped polytopes removed. However in this context the (d-i)-th Betti number is simply the number of the removed prism-shaped convex polytopes with maximum i unbounded axes, so the Betti numbers can be replaced by such simple counters in the Theorem 3.7.  

5) Related work section does not mention vast literature on geometry and topology applications in analysis of data representations, eg  Kim K et al. "Pllay: Efficient topological layer based on persistent landscapes." Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems 33 (2020), Barannikov, S et al. "Manifold Topology Divergence: a Framework for Comparing Data Manifolds." Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems 34 (2021), Barannikov, S et al. "Representation Topology Divergence: A Method for Comparing Neural Network Representations." ICML (2022).

6) The verification of possibility to reach the constructed networks via gradient descent optimization is somewhat limited as it is only applicable to some initializations satisfying some additional conditions and not to others.


Below are some specific remarks:
- page 1: The figure appearing on the article first page usually serves to highlight the principal contribution of the paper, does the standard Figure 1 with very well-known XOR dataset really serve such purpose? 

- page 2: "considering the given dataset as  a topological space" -> considering the support of the data distribution as a topological space? 

- page 2: "We answer this question by constructing a collection of convex polytopes..." - where is it described in the paper how to construct such collection? 

- page 2: "forms m-simplicial complex..., we establish  a novel topology-dependent bound" - the bound established in Theorem 3.6 concerning simplicial complexes is in terms of numbers of j-dimensional facets, which are not "topology-dependent" quantities. 

- page 4:  "from the volume identity of the polytope"- what is it? a reference is necessary here. 

- page 5: in Theorem 3.6 "d_1 is bounded by" refers to the presented construction of the network, or to any 2 layer network which is feasible on X, it is not clear

- page 6: "the first result on the width of neural networks in terms of topological data structure"- the result in Theorem 3.6 is in terms of numbers of j-dimensional facets, which is not "in terms of topological data structure"

- page 7: "This implies that the architecture outlined in Theorem 3.7 is dictated by the filtration parameter"- The topological space considered in Theorem 3.7 is a convex polytope with disjoint prism-shaped convex polytopes removed, it is not the Cech complex with respect to some parameter epsilon, so there is no architecture in Theorem 3.7 related to the filtration parameter. 
- page 8: "which completely classifying the given dataset " - perhaps, which classifies with zero error the given dataset ?

### Questions
Please address the limitations related with the feasibility of approximating  real-world datasets with the difference of polytopes or the simplicial complex constructions, how to construct and count such polytopes or the numbers of j-dimensional facets for all j.

### Summary
Building on the observation that ReLU networks have piecewise linear/polytope decision boundaries, this paper theoretically analyzes ReLU networks for data which is a (convex) polytope or may be approximated by unions or differences of polytope. Using novel terminology, bounds on the width of ReLU networks for such polytope data are given. It is claimed these bounds are the first such bounds in terms of topological data structure. Numerical experiments are given which are claimed to verify the theory.

### Strengths
Analyzing learning in terms of data geometry/topology is an interesting problem. The authors make a serious effort, and I appreciate their enthusiasm.

### Weaknesses
The relationship of novel terminologies used in this paper to other ideas learning theory is unclear. For instance what is the relationship between the margin of a "feasible architecture" on a manifold and the generalization error of that architecture on that manifold?

I noted Proposition C.1 where the author claims that "feasible architecture" is a sufficient condition for universal approximation. I didn't find the proof convincing. You assume the existence of function $f_\delta$ which fits the indicator of $\mathcal{X}$. Then a neural network is defined to be equal to this $f_\delta$. How do you know there is such a neural network? Universal approximation would guarantee that, but that's what you're trying to prove.

The novel term "feasible architecture" is doing a lot of work in this theory. It seems to hide the question of how well an architecture actually fits a dataset. It is clear that ReLU networks can fit polytopes exactly, but it is not clear how well they can fit arbitrary manifolds.

Likewise for "polytope-basis cover". What guarantees are there for finding a tight covers for a given manifold?

Missing some discussion of prior related work on relating topological characteristics to generalization theory, e.g. [0]

Practical applicability of results is unclear. How do you actually find a polytope-basis cover?

Many strong claims are made in this paper, and after reading the paper it's not altogether clear to me they are substantiated.

Proposition 3.5 seems trivial. A very wiggly (but non-intersecting) decision boundary is homeomorphic to a linear decision boundary. The former cannot be solved by a linear classifier, but the later can be.


### Questions
Is topological space really the right level of generality for this paper? Why not just consider manifolds? The former is substantially more general, and it appears you only consider subsets of $\mathbb{R}^n$.

Can you analytically compute any explicit non-trivial examples of "feasible architecture" and "polytope-basis cover"?

Why should we believe polytope-basis covers are good approximations of manifolds? Can you prove it? Can you actually find them in practice for realistic data?

Can you clarify the relationship of your novel terms to other terms in learning theory?

Can you provide references for your proof techniques?
