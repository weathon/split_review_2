## Abstract
Traditional Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) tend to use 3$\times$3 small kernels, but can only capture neighboring spatial information in one block. 
Inspired by the success of Vision Transformers (ViTs) in capturing long-range visual dependencies, recent CNNs have reached a consensus on utilizing large kernel convolutions (e.g., 31$\times$31 and, astonishingly, 51$\times$51 kernels). 
Nevertheless, these approaches necessitate adopting specialized techniques such as re-parameterization or sparsity, which require extra post-processing. And too large kernels are unfriendly to hardware. 
This paper introduces a Simple Convolutional Neural Network (SCNN) that employs a sequence of stacked 3$\times$3 convolutions but surpasses state-of-the-art CNNs utilizing larger kernels. Notably, we propose simple yet highly effective designs that enable 3$\times$3 convolutions to progressively capture visual cues of various sizes, thereby overcoming the limitations of smaller kernels. 
First, we build a thin and deep model, which encourages more convolutions to capture more spatial information under the same computing complexity instead of opting for a heavier, shallower architecture. Furthermore, we introduce an innovative block comprising two 3$\times$3 depthwise convolutions to enlarge the receptive field. Finally, we replace the input of the popular Sigmoid Linear Unit (SiLU) activation function with global average pooled features to capture all spatial information. 
Our SCNN performs superior to state-of-the-art CNNs and ViTs across various tasks, including ImageNet-1K image classification, COCO instance segmentation, and ADE20K semantic segmentation. 
Remarkably, SCNN outperforms the small version of Swin Transformer, a well-known ViTs, while requiring only 50\% computation, which further proves that large kernel convolution is not the only choice for high-performance CNNs.

### Summary
This paper proposes Simple Convolution Neural Networks (SCNN) for a bunch of fundamental vision tasks (classification, detection segmentation). It conducts extensive comparison to existing improvements over CNN such as ConvNeXt, RepLKNet, and ViTs. Results shows that it could achieve superb results comparing to those SOTA CNNs and ViTs.

### Strengths
The presentation is clear and the idea is fairly simple.

### Weaknesses
In Figure 2, putting aside SILU and GSILU, the architecture of SCNN looks very similar to mobilenet and its variants; Could the authors provide results comparison to MobileNet with the same layers, depth and width, but without SILU and GSILU blocks? I am curious whether the improvement is coming from SILU or GSILU.

It claims GSILU leads to rich spatial information, could you provide a receptive field size analysis/illustration when comparing network with or without SILU and GSILU?

### Summary
In the provided submission, the authors present a Simple Convolutional Neural Network (SCNN) that using only 3x3 depthwise convolutions, outperforms CNNs that employ larger kernels. A notable enhancement is the incorporation of global average pooled features into the Sigmoid Linear Unit (SiLU) activation function, the paper named it GSiLU, which enables these small kernels to capture comprehensive spatial information.

### Strengths
1) The paper effectively challenges the notion that larger kernels are the way for CNN advancements.
2) The presented model is more lightweight than its counterparts, achieving comparable performance with the same FLOPs.
2) The authors have conducted a robust suite of experiments to validate their model.

### Weaknesses
1) The paper could benefit from a more polished and professional tone in its presentation and writing style.
2) Some of the claims or hypotheses put forth lack empirical validation through experiments, which could strengthen the paper's assertions.
3) While it's understandable given potential computational constraints, the model was not trained on ImageNet 21K, a limitation that might affect generalization claims.
4) The paper doesn't explore the performance of larger-sized versions of their model. Although this might be due to resource limitations, such exploration could provide additional insights into the model's scalability and robustness.
5) Regarding Table 5's ablation analysis on the SCNN block, it is unclear why the number of parameters and FLOPs remain constant when PreConv and MidConv are removed. Could the authors clarify if there were any mechanisms employed to maintain these metrics, and if so, elaborate on the methodology used?
6) The paper describes the use of both Layer Normalization (LN) and Batch Normalization (BN) within the architecture, with LN explicitly employed as the initial normalization layer. Could the authors explain the reason behind this specific arrangement? Furthermore, it would be beneficial if the authors could provide an ablation study examining the impact of the positioning of these normalization layers within the network.
7) The paper describes the use of both SiLU and GSiLU activation functions within the architecture, with the use of SiLU as the first activation layer. Could the authors provide insight into the reason underpinning this specific sequence?
8) The claim that GSiLU enhances the performance of small 3x3 kernels by capturing global spatial information warrants empirical validation. Could the authors clarify if GSiLU doesn't have similar benefits to larger kernel sizes?
9) The functionality of GSiLU, which zeros out channels with sufficiently negative averages, prompts a request for statistical analysis. Could the authors provide data on the proportion of channels that are effectively zeroed by the GSiLU activation in practice?
10) As part of a review process, I believe it is expected to validate the findings through an independent examination of the code and model (Hence, my low confidence score.). To maintain the integrity of my review, I request access to the relevant code and model. This will enable me to verify the results personally.

### Summary
This paper proposes a Simple Convolutional Neural Network (SCNN) that uses only 3x3 convolutions but outperforms models with larger kernels. The main ideas are: (1) Thin and deep architecture with more 3x3 layers to capture spatial information under compute constraints. (2) Stacking two 3x3 depthwise convolutions to enlarge receptive field. (3) Using global average pooling in activation (GSiLU) to capture global information. The model is evaluated on ImageNet classification, COCO detection/segmentation, and ADE20K segmentation, achieving improved results.

### Strengths
The paper comprehensively validates the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed SCNN architecture. It outperforms models with larger kernels like ConvNeXt and SLaK on ImageNet classification by up to 0.7% top-1 accuracy with less FLOPs (Table 2). For dense prediction tasks, SCNN as a backbone for Mask R-CNN improves COCO object detection AP by 0.9% over Swin Transformer while requiring lower computation (Table 3). Similarly, SCNN exceeds Swin Transformer by 2.6% mIoU on ADE20K semantic segmentation with comparable FLOPs (Table 4). Detailed ablation studies demonstrate the impact of key components like the thin and deep architecture, double 3x3 convolutions, and global context modeling with GSiLU.

### Weaknesses
•	The paper lacks some analysis on how the proposed architecture captures spatial context and increases receptive field size. The introduction describes this as a key motivation, but there is little discussion in the experiments. Some visualization or measurements of the receptive field size could provide more insight.
•	The paper does not discuss in detail some other related work on improving convolutional backbones, such as [1,2]. Comparing and contrasting with these methods could highlight the novelty of SCNN's approach.

•	Beyond incremental improvements on established benchmarks, in-depth insights or observations about the properties of the SCNN architecture could increase the depth of the contribution.

### Questions
For global context modeling, how does GSiLU compare to other approaches like SENet? I think the global context modeling in SCNN is not very different from widely used techniques like SE modules（Channel Attention for Convolution）. The paper could benefit from more comparison and discussion about the relative merits of GSiLU.

Some other concerns are in Weaknesses.
