## Abstract
Current vision-language generative models rely on expansive corpora of \textit{paired} image-text data to attain optimal performance and generalization capabilities. However, automatically collecting such data (e.g. via large-scale web scraping) leads to low quality and poor image-text correlation, while human annotation is more accurate but requires significant manual effort and expense. 
We introduce \textbf{\name} (\textbf{I}n\textbf{T}egrating \textbf{I}mage \textbf{T}ext): an innovative training paradigm grounded in the concept of cycle consistency which allows vision-language training on \textit{unpaired} image and text data. \name~is comprised of a joint image-text encoder with disjoint image and text decoders that enable bidirectional image-to-text and text-to-image generation in a single framework. During training, \name~leverages a small set of paired image-text data to ensure its output matches the input reasonably well in both directions. 
Simultaneously, the model is also trained on much larger datasets containing only images or texts. This is achieved by enforcing cycle consistency between the original unpaired samples and the cycle-generated counterparts. For instance, it generates a caption for a given input image and then uses the caption to create an output image, and enforces similarity between the input and output images.
Our experiments show that \name~with unpaired datasets exhibits similar scaling behavior as using high-quality paired data. We demonstrate image generation and captioning performance on par with state-of-the-art text-to-image and image-to-text models with orders of magnitude fewer (only 3M) paired image-text data.

### Summary
This paper proposes to learn from unpaired data for T2I I2T generation by exploiting a cycle consistency constraint. A joint text-image architecture is presented as the unify model for this learning. Then, pseudo examples are generated and cycle consistency is optimized as two sub-steps in one training iteration. The learned model produces good generation quality with limited paired data, such as 4M vs. 398M.

### Strengths
1. The semi-supervised learning process for generative models has not been well studied before.
2. This paper provides a plausible way of learning from unpaired data with optimized computation cost.
3. Ablation studies are well presented and support the claim of adopting unpaired data.

### Weaknesses
1. This paper claims that the paired data gap is almost closed in Figure 4 (from 398M to 4M). However, there is still a significant gap in FID and CIDEr according to Figure 1 compared with other methods e.g. CM3Leon, Muse, GIT. Is there any other reason besides different numbers of parameters? Or maybe Shutterstock data is so similar that scaling data does not make a difference, but on more diverse datasets the Figure 4 claim will not hold?
2. How does ITIT generalize to new/different domains without paired data in that domain (assuming unpaired domain specific text and image available)? One example readers might be interested in could be medical imaging where paired data is much more difficult to obtain.
3. Unclear compatibility with other types of generative models such as diffusion/flow/consistency models as the I2T stage. How much does the ITIT framework depends on the unified architecture? Does ITIT work with any kind of T2I I2T model?
4. ITIT essentially denoises training data by learning a better alignment as shown in Figure 6. Does it worth to study other methods that also cleans the data, e.g. simply CLIP filtering with high confidence as pseudo labels, i.e. semi-supervised discriminative learning? This might keep the “blue” information in Figure 6 as well?
5. Runtime due to the pseudo pair generation stage. The appendix mentioned that the ITIT requires 2x training time compared with T2I and I2T non-cycle training, but how is it the case considering the 24 steps of decoding happening? How much of the time was spent on the online pseudo pair generation stage? Does it require careful batching or implementation for good TPU utilization?
6. Although scaling data is left to future work, the value of this paper depends a lot on the promise of further scaling unpaired image and text data beyond the combination of all current paired datasets. Are we still able to collect 10x high quality images/texts but not paired? Do we still need more data in this domain? Unfortunately this has not been shown to a good extent.

### Summary
This paper suggests novel  ITIT(InTegrating Image Text) method which enables leveraging massive unpaired images or texts. It suggests a concept of cycle consistency by using image-to-text (I2T) generation model and text-to-image (T2I) generation model in a single framework. As a result, the authors verify that ITIT with unpaired data shows comparable performance with paired data and, it achieves state-of-the-art performance with much fewer paired image-text data.

### Strengths
1. The motivation (usage of unpaired image and text) is clear and solid.
2. The method (ITIT) is a simple but strong:
     - It introduces the concept of consistency, effectively bridging image-to-text generation models (like BLIP) with text-to-image generation models (like Maze).1
     - The two-step phase in T2I2T / I2T2I facilitates efficient pre-training.
3. The experimental result is strong. To the best of my knowledge, this might be the first paper where a method pre-trained on unpaired image-text data demonstrates comparative performance with those pre-trained on paired image-text datasets.
4. The paper is well-written and figure and tables are well-organized.

### Weaknesses
1. In Table 2, the gap between full cycle and half cycle of ITIT training seems very marginal, which raises doubts about the effectiveness of proposed consistency concept. Namely, it seems that the pseudo-targets (ITIT-half cycle) would be sufficient to leverage unpaired image and texts. In this case, I believe that generating pseudo-targets would be more powerful:  1) it is computationally efficient and 2) it could easily integrate with the recent pre-trained models such as BLIP v2, stable-diffusion, and so on. (since the generation process of pseudo-targets are model-agnostic)


2. Given that ITIT employs synthetically generated captions or images during the training process, there is a reasonable expectation that numerous failure cases may occur. This concern is particularly pronounced with datasets like CC3M, which are known to consist of noisy image-text pairs, potentially leading to a higher frequency of failures. It would be grateful if authors could share the fair cases.

### Questions
1. Could you provide a comparison of the computational overhead involved in ITIT when implemented in full cycle, half cycle, and no-cycle
2. Are the models involved in this study trained entirely from scratch, or do they utilize weights from pre-existing pre-trained models?
3. Is it possible to extend the method for using diffusion based model for the T2I?
4. Given the concerns mentioned in the weakness section about ITIT's susceptibility to failure cases in the early pre-training phase, I wonder:  What are the results when trained with a two-stage approach  (first pre-trained with paired dataset and then use unpaired dataset / paired-unpaired dataset)?

### Summary
The ITIT model introduces a new training paradigm in vision-language generative models, focusing on cycle consistency to facilitate training on unpaired image and text data. Unlike conventional models reliant on vast, paired image-text datasets, ITIT optimizes performance using a limited set of paired data, supplementing it with larger unpaired datasets, and ensures output accuracy through bidirectional image-to-text and text-to-image generation. Experimental results show that ITIT, even with significantly fewer paired datasets, delivers performance comparable to state-of-the-art models in image generation and captioning.

### Strengths
This paper proposes a view of training of image-to-text and text-to-image models using unpaired image and text data. The overall design is based on an existing reasonable idea of "cycle consistency".

The paper evaluates the proposed ITIT framework and the image-text cycle consistency method and demonstrates that it can enhance model performance in image generation and captioning.

The proposed method is claimed to be scalable to get higher performance improvement.

The paper writing is clear and easy to follow.

### Weaknesses
Innovation. It seems all innovation comes down to how to reduce memory consumption. Others such as network structures and designs already exist. Specifically, regarding the method of reducing memory consumption, the core idea is that the author found that generating training data from 0 to 1 has too high a memory cost, so they first go from 0 to 1 (without calculating the gradient), then manually return to 0.9, and redo 0.9 to 1. From this point of view, the contribution is somewhat engineering-oriented. 

Other issues. There are a few other issues: 
1. The author only mentions a reduction in memory usage, but the time consumption should be quite large, which is a disadvantage. Any justification for this?
2. The I2T2I method seems a bit unreasonable because the latter half of T2I can already generate many kinds of images, so why must reconstructing the image necessarily be correct? 
3. For visual-language cycle consistency, there are two papers already: 'Equivariant Similarity for Vision-Language Foundation Models' (ICCV 2023), and 'CyCLIP: Cyclic Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining' (NeurIPS 2022). In this submission, there is an image-text encoder, for which it’s very straightforward to use the above two methods as a baseline (in the cycle consistency of embedding). So the reviewer is quite curious about how the cycle of embedding compares to the cycle of generating data.

### Summary
The study introduces a groundbreaking training paradigm called ITIT, designed for vision-language generative models. ITIT capitalizes on cycle consistency to train on unpaired image and text datasets, thereby minimizing reliance on costly and extensive paired datasets. The architecture features a single encoder for both image and text data, along with distinct decoders for each. A minimal amount of paired data is employed for baseline training, while the bulk of the training leverages unpaired data, regulated by cycle consistency to maintain output fidelity. Experimental evaluations reveal that ITIT achieves performance levels similar to existing leading models but with a significantly reduced need for paired data. Furthermore, the study confirms the model's ability to effectively scale with unpaired data. ITIT paves the way for more efficient and economical training of vision-language models.

### Strengths
1. The introduction of cycle consistency in vision-language generative models is innovative and addresses a significant gap in the literature. This is particularly relevant for scenarios where paired data is scarce or expensive to obtain.

2. ITIT scales well with unpaired data, achieving performance levels similar to non-cycle baselines but with much lower paired data requirements. In addition, the paper provides a thorough evaluation of the proposed ITIT framework, demonstrating its efficacy in both image-to-text and text-to-image generation tasks with comprehensive experiments.

3. The cycle consistency training improves image-text alignment for both image-to-text and text-to-image generation, while the method without the cycle consistency loss fail on the generation consistency to some extent.

### Weaknesses
1. While the paper mentions techniques to reduce computational overhead by one-step back-propagation in the I2T2I cycle, it does not provide quantitative metrics to evaluate the efficiency of these techniques. For the pre-trained data used in the experiments, ITIT still uses 4M paired data and 398M unpaired data to compete with the method that uses 398M paired data. In that case, the overall computational overhead is larger than the traditional paired data training. Can you provide some analysis in comparing the training efficiency between the paired data training and the ITIT.

2. The pseudo-synthesized data pairs could be noisy at the beginning of the training since the generator is not trained yet, I am wondering whether the pseudo-data pairs generated at the beginning will play negatively on the performance.

### Questions
1. Question for the gradient estimation of the cycle training: Referring to the figure 3, T2I is performed twice with a stop gradient operation in the middle for the T2I2T, why not directly perform the T2I once. Similar questions for the  twice I2T in the process of I2T2I.

2. Why ViT is chosen as the joint image-text encoder, instead of using some multimodal architectures. How does ViT extract the text feature?
