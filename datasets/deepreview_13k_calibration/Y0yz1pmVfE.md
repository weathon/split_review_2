## Abstract
Ad hoc teamwork (AHT) is a cutting-edge problem in the multi-agent systems community, in which our task is to control an agent (`learner’) which is required to cooperate with new teammates without prior coordination. Prior works formulated AHT as a stochastic Bayesian game (SBG), standing by the view of non-cooperative game theory. Follow-up work extended SBG to open team settings and proposed an empirical implementation framework based on GNNs called Graph-based Policy Learning (GPL) to tackle variant team sizes. Although the performance of GPL is convincing, its global Q-value representation is difficult to interpret and, therefore, impedes the potential application to real-world problems. In this work, we introduce a game model called coalitional affinity game (CAG) in cooperative game theory and establish a novel theoretical model named open stochastic Bayesian CAG to describe the process of AHT with open team settings. Based on the theoretical model, we derive the new solution concept that guides the representation of the global Q-value with theoretical guarantees for this setting. We further design a practical algorithm which can easily implement the theoretical results. In experiments, we demonstrate the performance improvement the proposed algorithm over GPL and verify the effectiveness and reasonableness of our theoretical model. The demo of the experiments is available at https://sites.google.com/view/cagpl.

### Summary
This work investigates the ad hoc teamwork (AHT) problem. The work introduces coalitional affinity game (CAG) and its Bayesian variant to characterize the AHT problem with open teams. The work further designs the solution concept and an algorithm to tackle the problem. The work mainly compares its performance with graph-based policy learning (GPL). The work even provides an external link to show some gifs about their experimental results.

### Strengths
1. This work combines open SBG and CAG to propose open-SB-CA-G. This combination seems natural. The work demonstrates that open CAG is well compatible with CAG.
2. The work subsequently formulate the problem of finding the optimal stationary policy into reinforcement learning. This cast is very natural and it obtains a variant of the Bellman optimality equation.
3. The work provides some lemmas and a significant amount of experimental results.

### Weaknesses
Considering that the idea of combining open SBG and CAG is quite natural, and so does the RL formulation, the contribution of the work will concentrate on its practical performance. The amount of testing environments seems a bit lacking, and the difference of the outperformance seems marginal.

### Summary
The paper investigates learning techniques for **open** ad-hoc teamwork, which is a setting in which an uncontrollably heterogeneous set of agents are put in the same environment, and we want to train a single agent (called learner) to operate in the environment in order to maximize his reward while potentially collaborating with other agents. The other agents are assumed to be of a fixed type (sampled from a distribution), corresponding to a specific policy that is adopted in the environment.
The main challenges that are faced are that the agents cannot leverage any form of pre-coordination and agents have to adapt in real time to a varying number of teammates in the environment.

The paper builds incrementally on a previous approach known as GPL. The GPL technique is a value-based reinforcement learning technique that uses a complex architecture to estimate:
* types of the agents
* joint-action Q-value (decomposed as sum of single action Q-values and pairwise actions Q-values) given types and state
* behavioral model, i.e. the probability of other agents taking specific actions given types and state
Those components are trained together in a RL fashion, by letting the learner pick actions according to a Q-function over its actions, derived from the joint Q-value and the behavioral model.

The contribution of the paper is a different approach to the decomposition of Q-values based on coalitional affinity games. In particular, the paper:
* models the interactions between the agent as a star-shaped pattern around the learner, with symmetric values
* theoretically justifies the optimization of the agent's reward done by GPL as it corresponds to the strict core of the affinity game centered around the learner
* derives a Bellman optimality equation from the star structure
* uses a GPL-like architecture to estimate Q-values of the learner, with the difference that the joint Q-function does not consider pairwise contributions between agents different from the learners

### Strengths
The strenghts of the paper can be summarized as follows:
* introduction of a modelling framework that interprets open ad-hoc teamwork as a coalitional affinity game
* slightly better empirical results in terms of value, more stable in terms of stability

### Weaknesses
 **Severe** lack of clarity throughout the paper:
* when introducing an affinity graph, the values from the singleton coalition are not ported to the new representation, and then they are used when discussing individual rationality.
* in many instances of the paper, assumptions are introduced without justification and they are not properly highlighted (just a "There exitst..."). As an example the existance of an affinity graph is not guaranteed in general as far as I know.
* Many different probability distributions are introduced ($P_E$, $P_O$, $\mathcal T$ ,,,) in Section 3.1, making really obscure the dependencies across variables, Figure 5 from the appendix and a clearer text  may help.
* lack of an example to clarify the settings and its peculiarities.
* the term "Preference Q-Value" is unneeded, as it is just a Q value over the action space of the agent
* the text between Theorem 2 and Propositoin 2 is unreadable and I could not understand it even reading it multiple times. Please rephrase it and provide proper space for the mathematical equations used.
* the GPL framework is never defined, and it could really help to highlight the contributions of the paper.

The usefulness of the theoretical contributions is debatable. In particular, the whole coalitional affinity games(CAG) framework seems like a very elaborate way of justifying the star-shaped Q-value computation novelty introduced, However, such a conclusion derives rather directly from the star-shaped interaction graph between agents, that is assumed.
*   up to theorem 2, the theoretical contributions are just saying that we need to optimize the learner's utility, which coincides with the social welfare thanks to the assumption of a star-shaped graph. Given the context at hand, this result is banal and the introduction of CAG actually makes the formalism uselessly complex

The final architecture developed for the CAG-GPL is not described in detail, nor properly compared with GPL. A picture is needed, as in GPL paper.

Empirical results are difficult to interpret.
* in Figure 1 it seems that CAG-GPL has really similar performance to GPL
* Figure 3 is unreadable: the legend's colors do not match with the plot, and in the Q-value plot there is written "learner" even on the rows not related to the learner

### Questions
* Is my interpretation of the architectural differences between GPL and CAG-GPL in the last point of the summary correct? Ie, this paper "uses a GPL-like architecture to estimate Q-values of the learner, with the difference that the joint Q-function does not consider pairwise contributions between agents different from the learners", so only Q_ij, Q_i and Q_j but not Q_jj'

* I could not highlight an important gap between CAG-GPL and GPL apart from training stability. Is there anything I missed in my weakness summary?

* similarly, what is the biggest novelty from a modelling perspective introduced by the CAGs? If possible, can you compare it in terms of differences with GPL?

### Summary
The paper studies the problem of ad-hoc teamwork from a novel, cooperative game-theory perspective. Specifically, the paper considers conditions on the optimization of the single learner (in ad-hoc teamwork, a single learner is trained to collaborate with different teammates which she has never met before) so that the grand coalition, i.e., the coalition in which all teammates collaborate for the common goal, is stable and preferred by all agents. Importantly, this allows for an approach with variable number of teammates in every round that is not addressed by previous methods. The paper further uses a, possibly time-varying, star graph to model the interactions of the players with the learner in the centre and the non-interacting teammates in the leaves.

The main contribution of the paper is that it proves that the solution concept describing the stability of ad hoc teams, roughly the core of the cooperative game described above, is reached when the agents maximize the social welfare, i.e., the sum of agents’ preference Q-values as the global Q-value. Based on this, the paper extends the Graph-based Policy Learning (GPL) algorithm to the coalition-affinity GPL (CA-GPL). CA-GPL is then experimentally evaluated in the Level-Based Foraging (LBF) and Wolfpack environments. The experiments suggest consistent improvements over GPL and also dilligently highlight the importance of each assumption used in the theoretical results. For instance, variations of the main model that relax sufficient (not necessary) conditions show similar performance to the optimal model sheding light into possibilities for further research.

### Strengths
- The paper is well placed in the relevant literature of ad-hoc teamwork. It considers a SoTA algorithm, identifies well-justified shortcomings, e.g., lack of theoretical foundation/suboptimal results in variable environments, and tries to propose solutions to these.
- The paper is using novel techniques, specifically elements from cooperative game-theory, to provide a theoretical background for a simple algorithm that provides improvements on the above problems. 
- The environments used in the experiments and the experimental evaluation are comprehensive, include sensitivity (ablation) studies of all assumptions required for the theoretical results and are very well presented. The paper also provides a link to a website that includes demos of the experiments which provides further insight. I am not sure, though, if links are desirable or if these demos need to be provided in the supplementary material to make the paper self-contained.
- Limitations, proofs and simulation details for reproducibility are thoroughly documented.

### Weaknesses
 - The major weakness of the paper is, in my subjective opinion, the overly complicated presentation in some critical places which does not allow the reader to appreciate the theoretical contributions of the paper and to verify their correctness. This affects both the theory and the experiments and I elaborate on this below in the experiments.

In general, I think that the paper achieves a solid contribution in the literature and has a clear potential, but given my concerns about proper understanding, I think that it requires a thorough revision prior to being ready for publication.

- Can you please elaborate on what do types represent since all teammates always want to collaborate? This is not explained in the text.
- Can you please highlight the main theorem that addresses the motivating question at the bottom of page and top of page 2? I admit that I got lost in some parts of the theoretical presentation. 
- An algorithm environment for CA-GPL would have aided the reader to appeciate the novelties over GPL.
- If I am not mistaken, the notation seems too complicated and redundant. For instance, if I understand correctly, it holds that v_j(C) = w_ji  = R_j and later on R_j = \alpha_j + (other terms). Similarly for the social welfare that is defined as sum (of sums) of such terms. Thus, I had difficulty to follow the proofs. Is my concern valid?
- More examples for complicated notation: 
    - what is $|-i|$? Is it the cardinality of the set of all agents other than $i$? If yes, then first, this is never explained, and second why not simply write $N_t-1$?
    - what is $b_j$ in the bottom of page 2? Is this used later on?
    - what is $a_{t,j}$ below equation (1)? Should this be $a_{t,-i}$?
    - social welfare is used in Theorem 1, but it has not been defined before.
- It seems to me that the definition of the joint policy $\pi_{t,-i} :\mathcal{S}\times \Theta_N \to \Delta(\mathcal{A}_N)$ allows for _correlated_ policies. However, this contradicts the assumption that permeats the text, that teammates don't interact at all with each other. Is this concern valid?
- Theorem 1 is hard to parse for me. If the grand coalition is strict core stable (with respect to what valuations?), then what does it mean to show that it is strict core stable? Apologies if my confusion is not justified.
- Regarding the experiments: In Table 1, we see that the stability metric worsens for CA-GPL in both scenarios as training progresses (especially for the 4 teammates). Why is this? Also, in the figures, we see that the curves keep increasing (they have not converged). Is this a valid concern? And would it make sense to provide larger frames?

There are many typos or difficult to understand sentences. I name a few below:
- page 2: "we translate the achievement .... decision making". incomprehensible
- p2: the stability, of ad hoc teams (misplaced comma)
- p2: LBF -> please name it properly the first time that this is used.
- p3: "if a coalition structure ... weakly blocking coalition". incomprehensible
- p3: "There exist an affinity graph" -> exists
- p3: continually (you may want to check if continuously is better here)
- p5: we aims at -> aim
- p8: "the relationship among ad hoc teammates is weak to" -> shouldn't it be the opposite here, i.e., strong relationship?
- p9: "theoretical model Our theoretical model" -> typo?
- p16: "...results in that prices ..." (in Theorem 1) -> incomprehensible.
- there are more, please check.

### Summary
The authors propose a framework for multi-agent ad-hoc teamwork based around cooperative game theory. They define solution concepts and algorithms based on this concept, and run extensive experiments to compare their method to previous methods.

### Strengths
I like the idea of using cooperative game theory to analyze ad-hoc cooperation. The ideas in the paper seem, to the best of my understanding, novel. The experimental results also seem fairly strong, but my ability to understand their significance is limited (see next section).

### Weaknesses
I am not too familiar with cooperative game theory, and I found the technical exposition rather hard to follow, and things took a long time for me to parse---perhaps because, while reading, I didn't have a mental model for where things were going/what to expect. I think the exposition would be greatly strengthed by the addition of a running example that the authors could use to demonstrate the various claims and definitions that they make, and by formalizing various definitions mathematically. An incomplete list of specific clarity concerns is listed in the "Questions" section.

I gave up on attempting to parse the rest of the technical part of the paper as I have already spent considerable time and am still confused about several things that are quite fundamental (again, see "Questions" below for some of these). I think there could be an interesting contribution here, but the quality of writing needs to be improved before publication.

From what I can tell, the experimental results seem strong, but my ability to understand the significance of the results is essentially limited to seeing that CA-GPL's line is higher than GPL's.


Nitpicks/minor errors (not affecting score):
* I think $\mathcal A_{\mathcal N}$ and $\Theta_{\mathcal N}$ should have an $\exists$ quantifier in their definitions, not a $\forall$---otherwise, they're both empty sets, since there is not a joint action that is simultaneously in $\mathcal A_{\mathcal N_t}$ for all ${\mathcal N_t}$.
* In the formulation in Sec 2.2, it is unclear how the team $\mathcal N_t$ evolves with time. It seems to me that this is formalized in the next subsection, but if so there should be a forward pointer.

### Questions
1. In Theorem 1 it should be made clear exactly what "maximizing the social welfare under the grand coalition" means. I am interpreting it as finding a *joint* policy, that is, a map $\pi : \mathcal S \times \mathbb P(\mathcal N) \ni (s_t, \mathcal N_t) \mapsto a_t \in \mathcal A_{\mathcal N_t}$ that, for every pair $(s_t, \mathcal N_t)$, selects $a_t$ to maximize the local social welfare $\sum_{i \in \mathcal N_t} R_i(s_t, a_t)$. Is that correct? In any case this should be formally stated.
2. It seems like the paper is adopting a single-agent perspective, where there is a single learner $i \in \mathcal N$ and all other agents' policies are held fixed (is this correct?). But then how can we optimize social welfare, required by Theorem 1, if we only control the single learner $i$? In particular, what if the other agents are acting in such a way that learner $i$ alone cannot achieve social welfare optimality?
1. At the beginning of Sec 3.3, I don't understand the point of defining $\mathcal{CS}_t$ only to later set $\mathcal{CS}_t := \mathcal N_t$. Does this have a purpose? It seems cleaner to just not define the extra symbol.
1. In section "Representation of Preference Q-Values", there is a clause beginning "which is presumed ... goal". What does "which" refer to here? Is this an assumption required by Theorem 2? If so it should be formalized mathematically.
1. What's the purpose of the types? They don't seem to be doing anything, except perhaps affecting transitions---but my interpretation of Theorem 1 implies that we only need to perform local optimizations at each state anyway. Perhaps it would be cleaner---and just as interesting---to write the paper without types?
