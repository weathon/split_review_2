## Abstract
Training agents to behave as desired in complex 3D environments from high-dimensional sensory information is challenging. Imitation learning from diverse human behavior provides a scalable approach for training an agent with a sensible behavioral prior, but such an agent may not perform the specific behaviors of interest when deployed. To address this issue, we draw an analogy between the undesirable behaviors of imitation learning agents and the unhelpful responses of unaligned large language models (LLMs). We then investigate how the procedure for aligning LLMs can be applied to aligning agents in a 3D environment from pixels. For our analysis, we utilize an academically illustrative part of a modern console game in which the human behavior distribution is multi-modal, but we want our agent to imitate a single mode of this behavior. We demonstrate that we can align our agent to consistently perform the desired mode, while providing insights and advice for successfully applying this approach to training agents.

### Summary
Similar to recent work in finetuning LLMs to align them with human preferences, the authors propose a process for aligning game agents that have been initially pretrained on a diverse, multimodal dataset via imitation learning. The paper studies the specific setting of taking an agent pretrained on diverse human behaviors in a 3D game (Bleeding Edge), and finetuning the agent policy to focus on only navigating to a chosen one of the three possible locations. The overall process consists of initial pretraining on a diverse dataset of human behaviors, next finetuning on a smaller set of curated, high quality demonstrations for a particular behavior, then finally finetuning the policy with a learned preference-based reward model.

### Strengths
- The overall motivation of studying how well imitation-learning + RL with preference-based reward models applies aligning generally capable game agents is interesting and meaningful. 
- The additional experiments showing the efficacy of combining online learning with the learned reward model and additional finetuning on the top 20% of offline trajectories (as ranked by the same reward model) is interesting and a meaningful contribution, as most prior works only focus on either the offline or online settings individually rather than combining them.  
- The experiments and discussion are thorough and detailed – in particular, it’s helpful to note why the policy finetuned for the right jumppad was less effective, despite the symmetry of the map, and to clearly show the gap in performance when building a reward model off of the pretrained policy encoder rather than using a random one.

### Weaknesses
 - The paper shows that the same overall process for finetuning LLMs can also be applied to agents within this game. However, the overall method has limited novelty – as noted in the related works section, the general process of bootstrapping RL with imitation learning and further finetuning agent behaviors with reward models learned from human preferences have both been studied in prior work training RL agents outside of LLMs. 
- The authors note that unlike prior work, their goal is to train "a generally capable base agent that can be aligned by game designers or end-users to perform different tasks or behave with different styles". This is a meaningful contribution even if the overall process itself is not novel, however, I believe that the current set of behaviors studied in this work (navigating to 3 different locations) is too limited. The paper would be greatly strengthened if the sets of behaviors or tasks demonstrated by the base and fine-tuned agents were more complex. While I understand the merit of first studying the approach in a simpler setting to disentangle what the agent is learning at each stage, the paper would be more complete with additional experiments showing the methodology also works on learning more complex behaviors, as this is the underlying motivation of the work. 
- Rather than just having the bar plots in the first two stages and then reward curves for the final stage, the paper presentation would be strengthened with an overarching connecting figure showing a heat-map of how the agent behaviours across the map evolve at each stage (first showing diverse locations visited, then focusing on the jumppads evenly, then focusing on just the left/right one).

### Questions
While the more poor performance from the agent finetuning to the right jumppad is likely due to the lack of data and diversity as noted by the authors, this is also exactly the problem that RL should be able to address. Have the authors tried more sophisticated RL algorithms for encouraging diverse exploration (adding in an entropy bonus, injecting randomness, more complex intrinsic rewards on top of the human preferences)?

### Summary
Paper investigates the LLM-alike pretraining - instruction fine-tuning - RLHF scheme in game AI domains. Specifically, it focuses on a game called Bleeding Edge, and for each stage, the resulting agent is mainly evaluated on a target task where the goal is to reach left/middle/right jumping pad. The results show that 1) after instruction fine-tuning, the overall performance on the target task can be improved; 2) RLHF can help align the instruction-tuned model to a certain aspect (ex. left jumping pad) of the task but the aligned model can be hard to be re-aligned to some other aspects, echoing the importance of maintaining diversity during the alignment stage.

### Strengths
+The topic studied here is important. Albeit the success of the training-tuning-alignment scheme of large language models, its effectiveness in other domains has not been fully verified. This paper has made a valuable contribution to exploring this idea of agent learning in game AI and the results do show some promises. I believe it could drive the interest of audiences from both LLM and game AI communities (and possibly more).

+Although the task considered in this paper can be relatively simple (left/middle/right jumping pad), it is indeed investigated thoroughly, and yield some interesting (but not surprising) results, including the struggle on re-alignment.

### Weaknesses
Overall, I think the idea that this manuscript tries to put up with is clear and neat, but it can be a bit premature in terms of the width and depth of the investigation. Some substantial augmentation on the experiment part should be done before it can be accepted by a major conference. Here are some suggestions:

-Width: the authors have claimed they "investigate how the procedure for aligning LLMs can be applied to aligning agents from pixels in a complex 3D environment". Although I do agree that the environment can be visually perplexed, the task, however, might not be challenging enough. Is the goal hard to be recognized/identified due to the complextity of the 3D environment? Are there many distractions or interferences? Is the goal semantically rich therefore understanding it could become a challenge? Does the human preference over such goal go beyond simple multi-choice selection? Unfortunately, I find many of these aspects of interest when exploring pretraining - instruction-tuning - RLHF in game AI unchecked in this paper. Point is, this scheme has been verified in the language domain teaming with many of these aforementioned challenges and it actually work pretty well. Therefore, investigating this on a different domain (game AI), but without on par challenges, could be less illuminating to the community.

-Depth: although the paper offers rich variants of reward models in the RLHF experiments section, some aspects can still be missing. To name a few: the scale of the model(both the base model and the reward model), error range, etc. These will help with a better understanding on applying RLHF in a new domain.

### Summary
This paper proposes to apply the methodologies for alignment problem in large language models to game agents in a console game. The authors test the method in a console game (called Bleeding Edge) to align the behaviour of an agent follow human behaviour in a specific game mechanics to spawn off from one of the three starting points. The methodologies follows the InstructGPT procedures of 1. unsupervised pre-training the agent 2. Fine-tuning with demonstrated data 3. Using a reward function and align the deployed model for certain behaviour.

### Strengths
The paper is written nicely and easy to follow. The proposed game is interesting and different from the rest of the community.

### Weaknesses
No human behaviour data is going to be released. The game environment is not going to be released. This makes the reproducibility of the results impossible.

Limited details are provided of the environment, such as the internal mechanism of the game, how it simulates the physics. These critical details are essential given the game is not widely known in the research community.

The task is not particularly challenging and focus on a niche mechanics in the game. The task is only focusing on a small part of the full game, with a maximum rollout episode of 100 timesteps (equivalent of 10 seconds of game play). The task is comparably simpler than a lot of the locomotive control problems in the simulated experiments, with only 16-dim action space.

No benchmark is established for the task. Please compare the result with some basic model-free or model-based RL agents. Even classical control algorithms should be able to provide decent benchmarks.

Significant amount of work is needed for the paper to make the cut for the quality of ICLR.

### Summary
This paper investigates how to align large-scale imitation learning agents with supervised finetuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning from preferences. Specifically, this paper utilizes imitation learning for pretraining, supervised learning for finetuning, and REINFORCE for learning from preferences. Initial empirical findings show the effectiveness of the procedure of LLM for aligning agents in a complex 3D environment.

### Strengths
- A descent paper, easy to follow.
- Interesting idea to explore LLM technique for RL agent.

### Weaknesses
 - Although the idea is interesting, the technique is too incremental, integrating IL for pretraining, IL for SFT, and REINFORCE for alignment.
- With the incremental technique, I would like to see more sufficient and interesting empirical findings. However, this paper does not contain the discussion including but not limited to:
1. Scaling Law. Whether model size scales, data scales, then the performance improves still holds for this setting?
2. In-context Learning. Whether preferences with some demonstrations in the model context can be captured?
3. Longer model context. Currently, the context length is 32 timesteps. Compared to typical LLMs with at least 2k steps, isn’t it too small to memorize useful information in the context?
4. During alignment, try PPO algorithm, which is verified as effective by many papers. Furthermore, why this paper utilizes an **undiscounted** version of REINFORCE? How about direct policy optimization (DPO) that utilizes supervised learning style alignment? As this paper only finetunes the last layer, how about full-parameter finetuning? How about LoRA?
5. Comparison and discussion of offline-to-online reinforcement learning.
6. Generalization. How about more environments or multi-task setting?

### Questions
Why is the imitation learning in the first stage claimed as "unsupervised pretraining" in Figure 1?
