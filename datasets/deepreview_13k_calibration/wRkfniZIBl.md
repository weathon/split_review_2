# Splicing Up Your Predictions with RNA Contrastive Learning

- Decision: Reject
- Avg Score: 4.33
- Scores: 3, 5, 5

## Abstract
In the face of rapidly accumulating genomic data, our understanding of the RNA regulatory code remains incomplete. 
Recent self-supervised methods in other domains have demonstrated the ability to learn rules underlying the data-generating process such as sentence structure in language.
Inspired by this, we extend contrastive learning techniques to genomic data by utilizing functional similarities between sequences generated through alternative splicing and gene duplication. 
Our novel dataset and contrastive objective enable the learning of generalized RNA isoform representations. 
We validate their utility on downstream tasks such as RNA half-life and mean ribosome load prediction. 
Our pre-training strategy yields competitive results using linear probing on both tasks, along with up to a two-fold increase in Pearson correlation in low-data conditions. 
Importantly, our exploration of the learned latent space reveals that our contrastive objective yields semantically meaningful representations, underscoring its potential as a valuable initialization technique for RNA property prediction.

### Rating Number

### Confidence
4: You are confident in your assessment, but not absolutely certain. It is unlikely, but not impossible, that you did not understand some parts of the submission or that you are unfamiliar with some pieces of related work.

### Summary
The paper proposes IsoCLR to learn RNA representations by contrastive learning. Splicing as the augmentation is identified as the key for the success.

### Strengths
- The paper is easy to follow.
- The method is simple, yet effective in the studied tasks.

### Weaknesses
 - The work has limited novelty and contributions. It simply applies the contrastive objective to the RNA sequence learning, with the major contribution as identifying an effective augmentation method.
- The work narrows down to learn representations of RNA sequences that mainly can be used for property prediction, making the work less interest and has less impact.
- For example, RNA-FM (which was compared to isoCLR in experiments) demonstrate its effectiveness in structural-related prediction (secondary structure predictions, RNA contact predictions, 3D distances, etc.), which is a more crucial aspect in the related field. The current submission is mostly focused on relatively easier tasks, which is not sufficient to verify the effectiveness of learned representations.

### Summary
This paper introduces a contrastive learning-based method for an RNA pre-trained model. It proposes to utilize functional similarities between sequences generated through alternative splicing and gene duplication as positive samples for contrastive learning and train models on it. It performs linear probing on 3 datasets to show that the proposed method performs well against baselines.

### Strengths
- The idea of utilizing functional similarities between sequences generated through alternative splicing and gene duplication as positive samples for contrastive learning is sound.
- The paper is well written and easy to follow.

### Weaknesses
 - The empirical analysis is not convincing.
    - The number of datasets is limited. Only three datasets are used, among which the performance on Gene ontology is only partially reported in the Appendix.
    - What's the point of learning good RNA representations if all your downstream tasks can be solved with standard fine-tuning? In NLP, better sentence embedding can directly be used to amplify retrieval-based QA systems or retrieval-based text generation. But in your application, I do not see the better embeddings helping your downstream applications.
    - If I understand correctly, the proposed method works comparably with `Saluki` in full fine-tuning while performing worse in linear probing than it. It also has more parameters than it. What is the benefit of your model over `Saluki`?
    - How do you use the pre-trained DNA models to solve the RNA prediction tasks? Do you replace all the `U` with `T` and feed them to the DNA pre-trained models? If this is the case, the comparison between the contrastive training target and MLM/NTP is unfair since the models are trained on different corpus.
    - If I understand correctly, the proposed model and `Saluki` utilize more information than the sequence itself. If this is true, then the comparison with the baselines is unfair.
    - Why do you present the results on linear probing with models like RNA-FM, NT, and DNA-BERT2 while skipping them in the model fine-tuning? If they can generate embeddings for linear probing on the datasets, you should be able to fine-tune them on the tasks, too. The models, except for NT-2.5b, are not too large to be fine-tuned on consumer GPUs.

### Summary
This paper proposes a contrastive learning approach to learn RNA representations that can be employed in downstream tasks. Based on functional similarity between a) alternatively spliced RNA and b) homologous gene, the authors build positive sample pairs through these two similarities. A contrastive training objective adapted from SimCLR is then used to train an RNA encoder, along with projection modules. Experiments are conducted on 3 downstream tasks: 1) RNA half-life and 2) Mean ribosomal load and Gene ontology prediction by training a layer on top of frozen representation. The authors showed that their approach outperform other pretrained represrentations in these tasks and is especially effective in the low data regime.

### Strengths
+Strong empirical performance of approach versus baselines
+The paper is easy to read and follow
+Potential application of approache in biomedicine

### Weaknesses
The key novelty of the paper seems to hinge on using functional similarity between a) alternatively spliced RNA and b) homologous genes to create positive sample pairs for contrastive learning. There is little innovation in the machine learning aspect (i.e. novel algorithm or significant change from SimCLR), which might make this more suitable for a biomedicine-focused audience rather than the general machine learning community.

### Questions
What is the key difference between this approach and existing contrastive objective such as SimCLR apart from exploiting the functional similarity between a) alternatively spliced RNA and b) homologous genes?

==Post-Rebuttal==
I appreciate the authors' response and decided to keep my score.
