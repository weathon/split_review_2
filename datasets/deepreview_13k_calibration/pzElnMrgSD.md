## Abstract
Video editing and generation methods often rely on pre-trained image-based diffusion models. During the diffusion process, however, the reliance on rudimentary noise sampling techniques that do not preserve correlations present in subsequent frames of a video is detrimental to the quality of the results. This either produces high-frequency flickering, or texture-sticking artifacts that are not amenable to post-processing. With this in mind, we propose a novel method for preserving temporal correlations in a sequence of noise samples. This approach is materialized by a novel noise representation, dubbed $\int$-noise (integral noise), that reinterprets individual noise samples as a continuously integrated noise field: pixel values do not represent discrete values, but are rather the integral of an underlying infinite-resolution noise over the pixel area. Additionally, we propose a carefully tailored transport method that uses $\int$-noise to accurately advect noise samples over a sequence of frames, maximizing the correlation between different frames while also preserving the noise properties. Our results demonstrate that the proposed $\int$-noise can be used for a variety of tasks, such as video restoration, surrogate rendering, and conditional video generation.

### Summary
This paper introduces the novel problem of Gaussian noise warping. Therein, the authors raised the interesting question of "how to properly warp the Gaussian noise such that the warped noise map still has the Gaussian distribution preserved?". To this end, the authors discussed why applying conventional warping operation on the noise map is not suitable, and they proposed a mathematically grounded solution to the problem with their ∫-noise formulation. The authors motivated the practical value of this problem with the applications of lifting image diffusion models to perform temporally consistent video editing. Experiment results with different video editing tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

### Strengths
The research question “how to properly warp a Gaussian noise map” introduced by this paper is interesting scientifically.

The problem is well motivated with clear explanations on why the problem is not trivial, i.e. why the conventional warping operations are not suitable. The proposed solution is technically sound and well-grounded mathematically.

The practical aspects of the problem are also well-motivated, with interesting video editing applications.

### Weaknesses
The major weakness from the practical point of view is the implicit assumption that temporally correlated noise maps can induce temporally consistent video editing results, which is often not true. This limitation, however, has been acknowledged and explained by the authors in the paper.

While the method demonstrates a mathematically sound approach to warping Gaussian noise, the practical impact is limited by the reliance on accurate optical flow. Errors in optical flow estimation will inevitably lead to artifacts, such as temporal misalignment, which could significantly degrade the quality of the edited video. The paper acknowledges this, but a more thorough analysis of the sensitivity to flow errors is needed. The experiments, while showing promising results, do not fully explore the limitations imposed by the accuracy of the underlying flow fields. For example, the super-resolution and JPEG restoration tasks use degraded video for flow estimation, which may not be representative of more complex real-world scenarios with significant occlusions or large motions.

Furthermore, the paper does not sufficiently explore alternative methods for generating temporally correlated noise maps, such as DDIM inversion. While the authors mention this technique, they do not provide a detailed comparison or visual results. This omission leaves open the question of whether the proposed ∫-noise formulation offers a significant advantage over simpler, deterministic methods for generating correlated noise, especially when considering the computational overhead of the proposed approach.

### Questions
Other than the comments above, there are a couple of questions I’m curious about:
+ I’m wondering how sensitive the method is with respect to the underlying estimated flow map? In other words, how do the errors in the estimated optical flows affect the results?
+ One principled way to obtain a sequence of correlated noise maps is to perform inverse DDIM on the reference video frames (assuming such video is available, which is true in most of the use cases demonstrated in this paper). The authors did mention that technique in the paper, but did not elaborate further and did not show visual results or comparison. I’m wondering how will the noise maps obtained that way compare to the ones obtained from the ∫-noise in terms of the final video quality?

### Summary
This work attempts to mitigate the lack of temporal correlation seen in diffusion based video generation models. The proposed method attempts to generate new noise samples that preserve the correlations induced by motion vectors. To this end, first, this work reinterprets individual noise samples used in diffusion models as a continuously integrated noise field called integral noise. With the help of the derived noise transport equation, a transport algorithm is developed to generate noise with temporal correlation between samples while preserving the desired properties of noise samples. Results are demonstrated to indicate the potential of the proposed method for tasks such as video restoration and editing, surrogate rendering, and conditional video generation.

### Strengths
1. The problem tackled in this work has significant practical impact.
2. The paper is written very well.
3. Motivation is clear, ideas are well formulated with theory, and the results are impressive.

### Weaknesses
1. The proposed method is computationally inefficient as compared to prior arts. Quantitative comparisons on this aspect would have been more helpful for future research works.

2. Figure 5 illustration is hard to follow, it’s not clear how to judge the performance based on the images shown. It’s mentioned that, the Random Noise creates incoherent details while Fixed Noise suffers from sticking artefacts. Our R -noise moves the fluid in a smoother way. However, I find this explanation hard to map to the results shown. Maybe the authors can highlight based on the image contents the reasons for each of these conclusions.

### Summary
This paper proposes a method for warping Gaussian noise while preserving its Gaussian properties. 
To achieve the goal, the authors consider a mathematical model of the Brownian sheet (i.e. the distributional derivative of the two-dimensional Brownian motion) and develop a noise transport equation for that model. 
In applications, the following approximation is applied. First, the input noise map is conditionally up-scaled so that it remains Gaussian. Second, the up-scaled map is warped according to the equation derived for the Brownian sheet. 
Finally, the warped noise is down-scaled to the original size.
 
The method is tested on a number of vision problems. According to the provided evaluations, typically it produces better temporal coherence than the baseline methods.

### Strengths
From my point of view, this paper tackles a pretty important problem for the community, since the application of image translation models to videos is a popular direction which still suffers from flickering and other artifacts. It seems to me that the Brownian sheet model and conditional Gaussian upscaling both are a very good fit for that problem as they take into account the intrinsically hierarchical nature of image resolution. The video results in the supplementary demonstrate that the amount of flickering and, vice versa, texture sticking in videos is reduced.

### Weaknesses
1. From the theoretical point of view, the presented approach relies on the warping field being a diffeomorphism, while in practice to the best of my knowledge optical flows estimated with off-the-shelf methods are rarely invertible mappings. This is a significant limitation because non-invertible mappings can lead to areas where the noise is either over-sampled or under-sampled, potentially causing artifacts. The method does not explicitly address how these cases are handled, particularly in regions with disocclusions or significant motion. 
1. As the authors themselves admit (Appendix E.3), "the impact of the noise scheme is negatively correlated with the amount of constraints given to the model", and, in particular, the method has a limited impact on latent diffusion models. However, it is obviously still useful for cascaded models. This is concerning because the most powerful generative models are often latent diffusion models, and a method with limited impact on these models has a narrower scope of application. 
1. As mentioned in the paper (Sec. 6) the method is computationally less efficient than other techniques. This is a practical concern, as increased computational cost can limit the applicability of the method, especially for high-resolution videos or real-time applications. It would be valuable to provide a quantitative comparison of the computational cost against other noise handling methods. 
1. According to Tab. 1, while the proposed method typically increases temporal coherence, at the same time it worsens frame-wise image plausibility metrics such as LPIPS or FID. This trade-off between temporal coherence and image quality is a significant issue, as it suggests that the method may be sacrificing the visual fidelity of individual frames to achieve better temporal stability. The LPIPS and FID metrics are well-established measures of perceptual quality and a decrease in these metrics is a notable drawback. 
1. None of the video samples in the supplementary except for fluid dynamics provides the results of noise handling with the method proposed by Control-A-Video model. Please note that this model more close to the presented method in spirit since it also takes input video into account while PYoCo does not. The lack of a comprehensive comparison against Control-A-Video limits the assessment of the method's performance relative to a more comparable baseline.

### Questions
1. As indicated in Tab. 1, bilinear interpolation often results in quite decent quality (excl. Video SR task). Haven't the authors considered a small modification of bilinear interpolation which is able to preserve the variance of pixels, namely, replacing the commonly used weighting coefficients with their square roots? Probably, this simple modification can even further improve its performance. Also note that Eq. 5 is also essentially "Gaussian averaging" of subpixels, i.e. averaging using variance-preserving weighting coefficients of $1/\sqrt{k}$ instead of $1/k$.
1. As mentioned above, the presented method is less computationally efficient than the baselines. It would be nice to provide a quantitative evaluation of that (in)efficiency.
1. From the manuscript, it is a bit unclear how the 9 triangulation points are warped in Fig. 1a. How exactly is the estimated optical flow $\mathcal{T}^{-1}$ which typically has the same resolution as the image itself, applied to non-integer pixel coordinates? In other words, how is the operation $\textrm{WARP}_{\infty}$ from Algorithm 2 implemented?
1. I suggest adding an explicit proof of why $\textbf{Z}$ is a Gaussian vector (Appendix B.2). Probably, the shortest proof is the one considering the linear combinations $\kappa^T \textbf{Z}$ for all possible $\kappa$, which are obviously Gaussian random variables.
1. I recommend adding more comments on how Eq. 24 for the continuous case turned into Eq. 5 for the discrete case. Why is it valid to still rely on the first-order approximation?

### Summary
This paper studied the influence of initialized noise when adopting diffusion based image model to video model.

A new initialization method called integral noise is propose, which is composed of a conditional upsampling, rasterization, and aggregation stage. It can maximizing the correlation between the warped and the original sample and maintain the independence of pixels in each sample.

### Strengths
The method is well illustrated in Figure 2 and is easy to understand.
A deep and comprehensive theoretical analysis is provided in the method and supplementary material.
The method is evaluated on several tasks, including rerendering (SDEdit), pose-to-person, and video restoration.
Good video illustration in supplementary material.

### Weaknesses
I guess most experiments in this paper are conducted in zero-shot way which applies the image processing model and method to video processing problems. Looking forward to seeing whether this helps when training a video model, like the PYoCo model
Considering video restoration (**Zeroscope Text-to-Video**) and pose-to-human (dreampose) already have good performance, I wonder the gap between image model+ integrate noise and these video models.
As stated in Appendix E, integrat noise does not work well in latent diffusion model. I wonder if this is applicable to other pixel-level diffusion models like the open-sourced deepfloyd from stabilityAI, whose capacity is comparable or better than stable diffusion.

### Questions
I am happy to see the comparison with the video processing model and the integration with DeepFloyd
