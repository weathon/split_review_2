## Abstract
Generative flow networks (GFlowNets) are sequential sampling models trained to match a given distribution. GFlowNets have been successfully applied to various structured object generation tasks, sampling a diverse set of high-reward objects quickly. We propose expected flow networks (EFlowNets), which extend GFlowNets to stochastic environments. We show that EFlowNets outperform other GFlowNet formulations in stochastic tasks such as protein design. We then extend the concept of EFlowNets to adversarial environments, proposing adversarial flow networks (AFlowNets) for two-player zero-sum games. We show that AFlowNets learn to find above 80\% of optimal moves in Connect-4 via self-play and outperform AlphaZero in tournaments.

### Summary
The paper proposes Expected Flow Networks (EFlowNets) extending GFlowNets to stochastic environments. Stepping forward, Adversarial Flow Networks (AFlowNets) is introduced for adversarial environments like two-player zero-sum games. The authors show that EFlowNets outperform other GFlowNet formulations in tasks such as protein design and AFlowNets outperform AlphaZero in Connect-4.

### Strengths
1. The paper introduces EFlowNets and AFlowNets as extensions of GFlowNets, which provide solutions for generative modeling in stochastic and adversarial environments respectively. 
2. The paper provides theoretical analysis and derives training objectives for EFlowNets and AFlowNets. The experiments conducted demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods. The demo is also interesting.

### Weaknesses
1. The differences between stochastic environments and common environments for GFlowNet may not be stated clearly.
2. The line of extension is similar to that in reinforcement learning. However, not enough comparisions to RL algorithms are provided in the experiments in both environments.

### Questions
1. Can you provide more clear description of the differences between stochastic environments and common environments?
2. What is the motivation of extending GFlowNet to stochastic environments and adversarial environments? And what is the general advantage of GFlowNet-based methods compared to RL methods in both environments?
3. How do you think about the potential of AFlowNet compared to RL methods considering the limitation in the proposed algorithms currently?

3: You are fairly confident in your assessment. It is possible that you did not understand some parts of the submission or that you are unfamiliar with some pieces of related work. Math/other details were not carefully checked.

### Summary
This paper proposes expected flow networks, which extend generative flow networks to stochastic environments. They also extend their formulation to adversarial environments for two-player zero-sum games. Experiments show that the proposed methods achieve promising empirical performance.

### Strengths
This paper proposes a new formulation for learning in stochastic environments, which ensures that a set of desiderata can always be satisfied. The propose modification is intuitive and elegant. It can also be generalized to zero-sum game in a straightforward way, making it a widely applicable formulations. The writing is mostly clear and it gives a good introduction.

### Weaknesses
The paper still requires solid background knowledge on generative flow networks and it is not very friendly to non-expert.

### Questions
1. From Figure 3, it seems that the proposed method is much more computation heavy, can you show the computation time requires for each step of each method? Also how does the computation time scale with the size of the problem for each method?

### Summary
This paper argues that it can address limitations of previous attempts for extending GFlowNets to stochastic transition dynamics by expected flow networks, which leads to meaningless solution. This paper also studies adversarial flow networks, to tackle the tree-structured MDP.

### Strengths
This paper studies an interesting setting about GFlowNets in tasks with stochastic transition dynamics.

### Weaknesses
 - It is mentioned that "We propose expected flow networks, ... generalizing GFlowNets on tree-structured state spaces." In the simpler case of trees instead of non-tree DAGs, why don't you just apply maximum entropy reinforcement learning (MaxEnt RL) approaches? It has been extensively demonstrated in previous GFlowNets papers that when the DAG degenerates to a tree, it is indeed equivalent to MaxEnt RL approaches (e.g., Soft Q-learning), which can natually handle stochastic worlds. Therefore, it makes little sense for only EFlowNets to be only evaluated in tree-structured state spaces.

- The performance and explanation of EFlowNets does not make sense. As described in the paper, this paper aims to extend (Pan et al., 2023; Bengio et al., 2023) to handle more general cases considering stochasticity in the transition dynamics, i.e., extend GFlowNets -- which aims to sample proportionally to a reward function $R(x)$, i.e., $\pi(x) \propto R(x)$, to the settings with stochastic transition dynamics.
However, the solution learned by EFlowNets is incorrect as demonstrated in Figure 1(a). Although it is able to solve $p$ (with a solution of around $0.66$) in this case while $p$ cannot find satisfiable solutions in Stoch-GFlowNets, it leads to sampling $x1$ with probability $p(x_1) \approx 0.33 \neq 2/10$, $p(x_2) \approx 0.33 \neq 3/10$, $p(x_3) \approx 0.306 \neq 1/10$, and $p(x_2) \approx 0.034 \neq 4/10$. Although $p$ is solvable in EFlowNets, the learned sampling policy fails to realize the goal of GFlowNets (sampling proportionally from the reward function), and learns a meaningless sampling policy. Consequently, EFlowNets do not address the limitations of Stoch-GFlowNets in some cases where satisfiable solutions are unavailable. However, this claim is made throughout the paper, which is an overstatement in this context.

- The statement seems incorrect -- "Stochastic GFlowNets directly apply the training algorithms applicable to deterministic GFlowNets (e.g., DB) to the augmented DAG $G$, with the only modification being that the forward policy $P_F$ is free to be learned only on agent edges, while on environment edges it is fixed to the transition function." In stochastic environments, the transitions dynamic is unknown, and after I checked the Stochastic GFlowNets paper, I found that it indeed learns the forward policy and the underlying transition dynamics (which is not fixed, unknown and is learned by experiences).

- In the "Violated desiderata in stochastic GFlowNets" section, a very important property is missed (which is satisfied by Stochastic GFlowNets with solvable cases but EFlowNets unfortunately violated) -- the correct sampling behavior, which means that GFlowNets function well in stochastic environments which sample proportionally to the reward function. Failures to satisfy this basic and fundamental requirement will lead to meaningless solutions. 

- EFlowNets bear great similarity to (Yang et al., 2023), however, the latter aims to extend Decision Transformer to stochastic environments in the realm of RL. Taking the expectation is correct in RL, since the objective of RL is to maximized the expected discounted future rewards. In addition, EFlowNets also bear similarity to Section 3.3.2 about stochastic rewards in (Bengio et al., 2023), which is mentioned about stochasticity in the rewars (not the transition dynamics), which is a case studied in (Zhang et al., 2023). Therefore, it does not make sense to apply the methodology in about learning an expectation as in RL (Yang et al., 2023) to GFlowNets with the hope to tackle stochasticity in transition dynamics as discussed in (Bengio et al., 2023).

- It is mentioned that trajectory balance is used for branch-adjusted AFlowNets. However, most practical games in multi-agent systems are actually partially observable (e.g., StartCraft II), which renders stochasticity in the transition dynamics. TB leads to large variance as mentioned in the text and in experiments in (Madan et al., 2023). Therefore, it seems to be more appropriate to apply this with DB or SubTB (since one of the claims for SubTB is to improve credit assignment). 

- It is mentioned that "This data defines a fully observed sequential game", which can limit its practical applicability in a wider range of applications with partial observation. 

- A very relevant paper extending GFlowNets to the multi-agent setting  (Li et al., 2023) is not cited and discussed. Since both paper study a very similar setting, it is worth comparing the approach with FCN and CFN in (Li et al., 2023), or at least discussed thoroughly. "Generative Multi-Flow Networks: Centralized, Independent and Conservation. Yinchuan Li, Haozhi Wang, Shuang Luo, Yunfeng Shao, Jianye Hao. 2023."

- It is unclear why experiments in Section 4.1 employ very large $\beta=10, 30$ which is different from (Jain et al., 2022), which leads to the case of a tree with very peaky rewards. In addition, it is worth investigating how the approach behave under the traditional $L_1$ error metric, which measures how well EFlowNets learn compared with other approaches.

- Why the two-play games correspond to a tree instead of a graph? There can be many parent states for a state actually.

### Summary
The paper proposes two extensions of generative flow networks (GFlowNets): expected flow networks (EFlowNets), designed to operate in stochastic environments, and adversarial flow networks (AFlowNets) for (two-player) zero-sum games. They experimentally demonstrate that EFlowNets outperform earlier approaches for protein design, and AFlowNets outperform AlphaZero in simple zero-sum games.

### Strengths
GFlowNets have shown promise in developing robust agents in challenging Markov decision processes. The paper provides a novel and natural formulation of GFlowNets to stochastic and adversarial environments. Unlike an earlier attempt by Pan et al., the new formulation satisfies a number of desirable theoretical properties, which is also reflected in the experimental results. For the adversarial setting I am not aware of any prior comparable formulations. Moreover, the experimental results also seem overall promising.

### Weaknesses
First, in terms of the experiments, the current results do not go far enough at least in the zero-sum setting. In particular, the games tested (tic-tac-toe and connect-4) are not large enough in order to make solid conclusions regarding the scalability of the method. While tic-tac-toe serves as a simple illustrative example, it is a game that can be trivially solved with a min-max search algorithm, and thus does not present a significant learning challenge for modern reinforcement learning techniques. Connect-4, while more complex, has also been solved using methods like alpha-beta search with handcrafted heuristics, which makes it unclear if the presented method is truly pushing the boundaries of what is achievable. It would be much more convincing if the authors used this new formulation to make progress on benchmarks that are otherwise elusive using prior techniques. Overall, I believe that the paper would significantly benefit from having more experiments and on larger benchmarks. It would also expect the adversarial formulation to capture partially observable settings (such as Poker); I do not see any significant obstacles in extending the methodology to partially observable settings. Such extensions would significantly strengthen the contributions of the paper. Besides those issues with the experiments, the other concern is that the new formulations are relatively straightforward, and there is not much conceptual or algorithmic novelty in deriving them based on earlier approaches. Overall, although the results are promising, they seem to be in a rather preliminary stage.

### Questions
What was the previous state of the art method for the protein design task considered in Section 4.1? Is it included in the current comparisons?
