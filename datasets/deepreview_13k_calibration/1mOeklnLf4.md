## Abstract
Self-supervised learning (SSL) is an increasingly popular paradigm for representation learning. Recent methods can be classified as sample-contrastive, dimension-contrastive, or asymmetric network-based, with each family having its own approach to avoiding informational collapse. While dimension-contrastive methods converge to similar solutions as sample-contrastive methods, it can be empirically shown that some methods require more epochs of training to converge. Motivated by closing this divide, we present the objective function FroSSL which is both sample- and dimension-contrastive up to embedding normalization. FroSSL works by minimizing covariance Frobenius norms for avoiding collapse and minimizing mean-squared error for augmentation invariance. We show that FroSSL converges more quickly than a variety of other SSL methods and provide theoretical and empirical support that this faster convergence is due to how FroSSL affects the eigenvalues of the embedding covariance matrices. We also show that FroSSL learns competitive representations on linear probe evaluation when used to train a ResNet18 on the CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, STL-10, and ImageNet datasets.

### Confidence
4: You are confident in your assessment, but not absolutely certain. It is unlikely, but not impossible, that you did not understand some parts of the submission or that you are unfamiliar with some pieces of related work.

### Summary
This paper propose a new self-supervised learning algorithm. The authors give some simple analyses to show the property of this algorithm. Some experiments are conducted.

However, I think the experiments are insufficient and the motivation of their method is not convicing.

### Strengths
This paper propose a new self-supervised learning algorithm. The authors give some simple analyses to show the property of this algorithm. Some experiments are conducted.

### Weaknesses
 I don't understand why the objective of Barlow Twins does not push representations to be rotationally invariant, since it pushes the cross-correlation to identity.

 I think the intuition of using logarithm should be discussed further. I don't understand why it's necessary.

 Since this paper's main contribution is a new algorithm, I think its experiments are very insufficient. I highly recommend the authors to add more experiments to show the performance of their method. Besides, I think they can conduct some experiments to show the necessary of logarithm in their loss function.

### Confidence
3: You are fairly confident in your assessment. It is possible that you did not understand some parts of the submission or that you are unfamiliar with some pieces of related work. Math/other details were not carefully checked.

### Summary
The authors put forward a new regularizer that is supposed to help SSL
techniques, combining both sample- and dimension-contrastive methods.

### Strengths
The combination follows the exposition of Garrido et al. (2023) and is
simple to understand.  The manuscript motivates the regularizer well
and has a good structure.

The faster convergence seems convincing and the explanation via
dimensional collapse is sensible.

### Weaknesses
The quantitative results are a bit lacking.  While the results are
always in the top 3, they never manage to beat any of the already
established methods (Table 2).

There is a mean +- std missing, aggregated over multiple runs.  I
consider this to be important because the reported accuracy numbers
are so close together in Table 2.

### Questions
Why do you think the FroSSL is eventually bested by other contrastive
methods over the course of training?  Is there any intuitive
explanation for it?

### Summary
The paper presents FroSSL, a novel SSL loss that is based on minimizing covariance Frobenius norms. The suggested loss is both sample- and dimension-contrastive (up to embedding normalization). Evaluated over standard datasets it is empirically shown that FroSSL experiences faster convergence and attains competitive performance using a linear probe.

### Strengths
[-] originality: the paper addresses an aspect which is less explored discussing SSL frameworks, the speed of convergence, which implies on the amounts of compute required for solving a given task. 

[-] quality: the paper is well written, providing the reader with a clear view of diverse SSL aspects required to follow. In addition, it is evident that much work has been put into mathematical analysis as well as running experiments and benchmarks. 

[-] clarity: the main ideas conveyed in this paper are clearly constructed and explained. The authors provide the necessary background, define notations and terminology, which are required to follow and understand the presented framework.

[-] significance: the paper's significance is in putting the emphasis on the convergence time of SSL objectives and suggesting an alternative that allows for faster convergence.

### Weaknesses
[-] contribution: the major contribution of FroSSL is presented to be its fast convergence. However, while fast convergence is a desired feature it is mostly beneficial in the case where convergence is to a competitive value or if at early epochs there is a substantial gap in performance. Judging by the provided experiments this is not the case as elaborated in the next point.

[-] overstated performance: the performance of the method is overstated judging by the provided experimental results. First, the main results (Table 2) are provided for “full” training length (1000/500 epochs), that is without utilizing the fast convergence property (and still does not outperform competing methods). Next, looking into the short training analysis over STL-10 (Table 3) already at 30 epochs SwAV is reaching nearly identical performance as FroSSL and from 50 epochs FroSSL’s performance is not in the top-3. Similarly (Sec. 6.2 and Figure 4) for ImageNet compared to Barlow Twins (BT), as highlighted by the authors, at 30 epochs the methods are already reaching similar performance, while at 100 epochs FroSSL seems to have a slight advantage over BT, it is important to note that BT is not SOTA.  The advantage of FroSSL in terms of convergence speed is not clearly demonstrated, and the final performance is not convincingly superior to existing methods, especially considering the computational cost of training for a large number of epochs.

[-] related work: two kernel-based methods which are very closely related to FroSSL are presented in the section for related work sec. 4.3 (“Entropy in SSL”). It will be beneficial to include these in the benchmark analysis to showcase the advantages of FroSSL in comparison to similar methods.

[-] minor: links to figures and tables are referencing respective sections. When relating to SimMER a citation is missing.

### Questions
[-] FroSSL’s contribution: it will be beneficial to present additional experiments where the fast convergence property stands out as significant. Alternatively, providing other properties that make FroSSL (as a dimension-contrastive and sample-contrastive method) stand out.

[-] additional baselines: as mentioned above, it will be beneficial to compare the performance of FroSSL to the presented similar methods.

### Summary
This paper presents FroSSL, a joint-embedding SSL method motivated by dimension-contrastive and sample-contrastive approaches. In particular, FroSSL places its central emphasis on the reduction of covariance Frobenius norms to prevent collapse and the minimization of mean-squared error to enhance augmentation invariance.
The results of this study demonstrate that FroSSL exhibits a faster convergence and learns competitive representations when compared to other SSL methods.

### Strengths
This paper tackles an important research problem in SSL (faster convergence).

### Weaknesses
Despite the mentioned strengths, the experiments and analyses presented in this paper cannot address the issue of fast convergence. Detailed weaknesses are as follows.

- The authors claim that one of FroSSL's main contributions is fast convergence. However, FroSSL is derived from rotational invariance, rather than being directly derived from fast convergence. Explanations are needed regarding the relationship between rotational invariance and fast convergence. Specifically, the paper needs to clarify how enforcing the eigenvalues of the representation space to become equal through Frobenius norm minimization directly translates to faster convergence in the context of self-supervised learning.
- The experimental results appear to lack significance. For instance, as shown in the ImageNet results of Table 4, it's evident that FroSSL converges faster than Barlow Twins only when the performance is 50% or lower. However, there are doubts about the significance of this result because it's unlikely that one would use a model with performance below 50%. The paper needs to demonstrate the practical relevance of this faster convergence in a more meaningful performance range.
- The explanations for the figures and tables in the paper are insufficient. For example, it is unclear what the paper means by "variants" in Figure 2, and the dataset used for Figure 3 is not specified. This lack of clarity hinders the understanding of the reader. The paper should explicitly define the loss variants and provide the dataset details directly in the figure captions or surrounding text.
- In Table 2, FroSSL exhibits suboptimal performance when compared with other methods. The paper should discuss the limitations of FroSSL in achieving state-of-the-art performance and provide insights into why it underperforms in certain scenarios.
- There seems to be a lack of experiments. (e.g., experiments on larger models where fast convergence is critical, analysis on the role of log, …)

### Questions
- Based on the paper, the dimension-contrastive method is characterized by its absence of negative samples, whereas the sample-contrastive method explicitly employs negative samples. Therefore, it might be inferred that dimension-contrastive and sample-contrastive approaches are inherently distinct and cannot coexist within the same framework.
However, the first contribution of this study, as corroborated by Proposition 3.3, asserts that FroSSL is simultaneously dimension-contrastive and sample-contrastive.
This apparent contradiction raises a compelling question: How can FroSSL reconcile these seemingly opposing attributes within its framework?
- What are the Figure 5.1, Figure 5.2, and Table 5.2 referring to?
- This study does not offer experimental results for the speed of convergence concerning CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets.
- The issue of implementation effectiveness concerning the minimization of the Frobenius norm loss has been previously addressed in [1]. What sets FroSSL apart from I-VNE+ in [1], highlighting its superiority?
