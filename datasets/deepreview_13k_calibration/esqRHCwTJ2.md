## Abstract
When machine learning (ML) models need to be frequently retrained, it is often too expensive to obtain *human-annotated* samples, so recent ML models have started to label samples by themselves. This paper studies a setting where an ML model is retrained (with *human* and *model-annotated* samples) over time to make decisions about a sequence of *strategic* human agents who can adapt their behaviors in response to the most recent ML model. We aim to investigate what happens when *model-annotated* data are generated under the agents' strategic feedback and how the models retrained with such data can be affected. Specifically, we first formalize the interactions between agents and the ML system and then analyze how the agents and ML models evolve under such dynamic interactions. We find that as the model gets retrained, agents are increasingly likely to receive positive decisions, whereas the proportion of agents with positive labels may decrease over time. We thus propose an approach to stabilize the dynamics and show how this method can further be leveraged to enhance algorithmic fairness when agents come from multiple social groups. Experiments on synthetic/semi-synthetic and real data validate the theoretical findings.

### Summary
The paper models and analyzes the dynamics of model retraining under strategic feedback. Specifically, how label prevalence and predicted prevalence change over time when agents' can adapt their features based on the previous time-step's model.

### Strengths
- The topic is interesting and warrants further studies.
- The paper is well written.
- The authors consider not only acceptance and qualification rates, but also how
fairness w.r.t. sensitive attributes evolves over time under this strategic
setting.

### Weaknesses
 - Section on fairness is somewhat underwhelming and under-explored.
  - Assuming groups have equal base rates is entirely unrealistic.
  - If the purpose is to study "long-term impacts of model retraining", the proposed solution for fairness can't be "stop retraining the model".
  - Plus, assuming the decision-maker has some acceptance bias, and then relying on the same decision-maker to self-identify it and correct it, is not ideal.
  - It would be extremely interesting to have explored how strategic feedback (either individually or in the form of collective action) could've helped with improving fairness (and ideally using different base rates as a source of unfairness, which is still simplistic but already a great deal more realistic than a bias in acceptance rates alone).
  - The reason why early stopping can improve DP is because the retraining process (without "refinement") simply monotonically increases acceptance rate, which just showcases the modelling flaws.

- It's unclear to which degree the conclusions hold on any real-world scenario.
  - Of the two non-synthetic datasets ("German" and "credit approval"): (1) the
  experiments for "German" seem to have been ran on a synthetic version of the
  dataset as a result of fitting a KDE on the original data, and (2) the
  experiments on "credit approval" use only a small subset of features (two
  continuous features).
  - As there are a series of simplifying assumptions that are unlikely to hold
  in real-world settings, it seems important to verify to which degree violating
  these assumptions changes the conclusions.

- Shouldn't qualification rate for human-annotated samples also change as a
results of the same strategic behavior? How would an agent know whether it was
assigned to a model or human annotator?

### Questions
- Why does the qualification rate only change for the model-annotated samples
under strategic feedback, and not for human-annotated samples?
  - It's assumed that the "algorithm bias" is negligible; so whichever strategic
  feedback moves agents' features $X$ towards a more positive prediction by the
  classifier $f_{t-1}$ will also increase their qualification and acceptance
  rates for human annotators.
  - In other words, as the marginal feature distribution $P_X$ changes under
  strategic feedback, it would be expected that the qualification rate $Q(\mathcal{S}_{o,t-1})$
  would also change in response, no? Or are the human-annotated samples at each
  time step not drawn from the same distribution? And, if so, why not, and how
  could the decision-maker distinguish in practice whether to use a model or a
  human annotator?
  - I see that it's assumed that human annotated samples are drawn from the
  prior-best-response distribution, but how would (1.) the decision-maker
  distinguish these distributions, and (2.) the agents' know whether they were
  assigned to a model-annotator in order to know whether to employ strategic
  behavior.

### Summary
The paper studies the dynamics between retrained machine learning models and strategic human agents who adapt their behavior over time. It finds that retraining makes models more likely to give positive decisions, but may reduce the proportion of agents with positive labels. To stabilize this, the paper proposes a method to improve algorithmic fairness. Experimental data and some theorems supports these findings.

### Strengths
The overall setting is interesting.

Theorem 3.3, 3.5, 3.6 seem correct and interesting. I spent about 1 hour per theorem. It's possible that mistakes exist but results seem plausible at a glance.

I think most of the value is in the theoretical results. The simulations are interesting, but are mostly window dressing for the mathematical formulation and ensuing theorems. I think it majority of the value in this paper is intellectual. With that being said, I am actually very fond of the formulation and I feel that the analysis of the emergent dynamics is extremely interesting.

### Weaknesses
My main issue is with Section 4. 

The primary result of section 4, Theorem 4.1, seems like the authors are grasping at straws in order to have a Fairness section, rather than actually finding the most interesting emergent results in their model. 

While social aspects of computing and ML are extremely timely and important issues, I fail to see the value of 4.1, given that the proposed "early stopping" is not particularly well-connected to a tangible use-case or real-world setting. The mathematical depth of 4.1 seems lackluster compared to Section 3. The connection between the proposed early stopping and a practical fairness intervention is not clearly established. It's unclear how this specific stopping rule would translate to a real-world scenario where fairness is a concern. The theorem seems to only show that under certain conditions, the retraining process will eventually converge to a fair classifier, which is not particularly novel or insightful. The result lacks a clear motivation and practical significance. 

The authors should consider removing Section 4. Instead, they could focus on removing convexity constraints in Thm 3.5. Convexity seems like a strong assumption -- it would be good to weaken it or further describe results in more general settings. I think that would strengthen this work more than a bolted-on fairness theorem. As can be seen in the supplement, there is seemingly little substance to theorem 4.1.

### Questions
Why is 4.1 interesting? Am I missing a practical application of this work? Or perhaps I am missing something interesting about the 4.1 from a theoretical perspective in terms of the depth of the result?

In rebuttal, I am looking for strong response. I think this paper could be as high as a 7 depending on the author response.

In fact, by simply REMOVING section 4, this paper is probably a 6. By replacing 4.1 with a substantive result, I think this could even be a 7.

I realize this is a bit of a reviewer bias in terms of fixating on one problematic theorem or claim in an otherwise sound paper, but in this case, an entire section of the paper is dedicated to what is essentially a meaningless result. I hope the authors can either explain what I am missing about section 4 or offer a replacement theorem in rebuttal.

### Summary
This paper studies strategic classification in a sequential framework where an ML model is periodically re-trained by a decision maker with both human and model-annotated samples. The paper analyzes how marginal quantities, such as the proportion of positively-labeled agents and the probability of positive classification change over time.

### Strengths
1. I commend the authors for finding and defining an interesting and novel problem! Not much work has focused on the interaction between strategic behavior and different model re-training strategies. The problem formulation is promising and well-written, though I do have some questions / issues with some of the details.

2. This work studies the interaction between a machine learning model and strategic human agents in a dynamic setting. Most previous works in strategic classification focus on a one-time deployment. Dynamic settings are of interest because realistically the human population evolves and the model is repeatedly updated.

3. Although the authors focus on a much more complicated setting, the question of what happens when agents are strategic and the model is updated using model-annotated samples (where the covariate distribution of the samples comes from the strategic agents’ covariates) is of independent interest. There has been some work related to this idea in the literature on repeated risk minimization in the performative prediction / strategic classification literature already, but to the best of my understanding, this particular question is still not completely understood. The framework that the authors propose can be used to make progress on this related problem.

### Weaknesses
1. The main weakness of the theoretical results in this work is that the authors focus on changes in ``marginal” quantities, such as the acceptance rate $E_{S_{t}}[A(f_{t}, P^{t})]$ instead of changes in conditional quantities, such as the acceptance rate conditional on a particular choice of covariates $x$, which is given by $E_{S^{t}}[f_{t}(X) \mid X=x].$ As a result, it is difficult to understand to what extent their results derive from the data provided from the strategic agents (covariate shift), the systemic bias in the human-annotated samples (one form of conditional shift), or the fact that the conditional distribution of the classifier $f_{t}(X) \mid X=x$ does not (second form of conditional shift). To what extent do the results derive from changes in the covariate distribution and changes in the classifier? In the absence of systemic bias, Theorem 3.3 seems to derive from the fact that after agents’ respond strategically to the model, they are more qualified to get a positive label (agents sampled from $P_{X}^{t}$ are more likely–based on P_{Y|X}-- to get a positive label than agents sampled from $P_{X}$). Thus the acceptance rate of agents would increase over time, simply because there are now more qualified agents. It would be helpful if the authors could clarify their presentation and discuss how much these different forces yield changes in the distribution of $f_{t}(X) \mid X=x$ the conditional distribution of the classifier.

2. This paper focuses on (1) human agents are reacting strategically to an ML model (2) retraining with human-annotated samples (3) the model is being updated with model-annotated samples. Studying these simultaneously, without discussion of what happens in the system when only one or two of these occur, makes it difficult to understand how different components of the system drive the main results. It might improve clarity for the authors to consider one of these at a time and describe what we expect to happen– for example, what would happen when human agents react strategically to a model over time? What would happen when human agents are strategic and the model is updated with model-annotated samples? This way the authors can build up to the entire complex system.


3. The assumption that agents’ covariate modification translates to genuine changes in the label is a somewhat strong assumption. This means that the classic “gaming” type behavior (where agents may manipulate their covariates while their labels remain fixed) is not permitted. This assumption greatly reduces the complexity of the problem because when “gaming” is not permitted, the strategic behavior problem becomes equivalent to covariate shift (no gaming essentially implies that $P_{Y|X}$ is fixed over time). Since this assumption is a departure from previous works in strategic classification, where previous works permit an agent to “game” and take meaningful actions that change their label [Kleinberg and Raghavan, 2020], the authors should flag it and make the contrast more clear in their paper. I noticed that the authors have a related work section in their appendix, but I would urge them to include some of these references in the main text of the paper.

4. It’s somewhat confusing that the covariate distributions of the model-annotated samples and the human-annotated samples are different. What’s the motivation for permitting the covariates of human-annotated samples to be sampled from the prior-best-response distribution? Given the dynamic nature of the setup, It seems more natural for both sets of samples to have the same covariate distribution (the post-best-respose covariate distribution).

Writing:
1. The paper could improve in notational clarity with regard to which quantities are finite/empirical and population level. For example the authors could name and express the distributions over the human-annotated samples, the model-annotated samples, and the previous training samples respectively. Then, the authors can define that the distribution over samples in the retraining dataset is a mixture distribution of the three components, where the weight on each component may differ depending on the proportion of each data type. 

2. It might be helpful to use terms from the distribution shift literature to describe how different parts of the system affect the data distribution at time $t$. For example, in this work, the strategic behavior of the agents only results in covariate shift of the data distribution. The human-annotated samples represent a conditional shift of the original data distribution $P$. Meanwhile, the model-annotated samples represent a joint shift of the original data distribution, where the covariate shift can be attributed to the strategic behavior and the conditional shift arises from the distribution of $Y|X$ of the classifier being different from the $P$.

### Questions
1. It is not clear from the introduction how we should think about human-annotated samples. It would be helpful if the authors could clarify early on whether we view human-annotated samples to be reliable (the conditional distribution of the human-annotated samples is the same as $P_{Y|X}$ from the true distribution) or we believe the human-annotated samples to be inaccurate (the conditional distribution of the human-annotated samples does not have the same $P_{Y|X}$ as the true distribution). Later in the paper, it becomes clear that it is the latter. Furthermore, should we think of the human-annotated samples as being strategically supplied? Later in the paper, it seems like the human-annotated samples are not strategically supplied, because the covariates are drawn from the prior-best-response distribution and the labels are given by a systematically biased (but not necessarily strategic) decision maker. The confusion arises because the authors write that one of their motivating questions is – “how is the agent population reshaped over time when the model is retrained with strategic feedback?” 

2. I'm especially interested in the setting where agents are strategic and the model is updated with only model-annotated samples? Will a fixed point arise [Frankel et al, 2022]? To what extent is this setting related to the repeated risk minimization in performative prediction [Brown et al, 2022, Perdomo et al, 2020]? 

3. It would be helpful to see a discussion of the different retraining strategies, e.g. (1) using the strategic agents’ post-best-response covariate distribution labeled with model to retrain, (2) using the strategic agents’ post-best-response covariate distribution with ground-truth (accurate) labels to retrain, (3) using the prior-best-response covariate distribution (4) using i.i.d. data with ground-truth (accurate) labels to retrain.

### Summary
This paper investigates acceptance rate, qualification rate, and classifier bias and unfairness when strategic agents interact with a machine learning system that retrains itself over time with both human-annotated and model-annotated samples. Due to the strategic interactions, it shows that the acceptance rate increases over time and gives conditions under which it can asymptotically reach 1. As expected, the qualification rate decreases over time. The disparity between these two metrics represents the classifier bias. The evolution of classifier bias is examined under different settings involving or not involving systematic bias. The results show that unless systematic bias is negative, classifier bias monotonically increases. To stabilize the dynamics of the variables above, the paper tweaks the generation of model-annotated samples by using a probabilistic sampler. It also proposes an early stopping mechanism to promote fairness when there exist two demographic groups with different sensitive attributes: one having a positive systematic bias and another having a negative systematic bias.

### Strengths
This paper studies an important problem faced in real-world ML deployments where agents who interact with the system are strategic and where both human and model-annotated samples are utilized. It provides an in-depth analysis of the acceptance rate, qualification rate, and classifier bias in such systems. The conclusions are intuitive but not surprising. The paper also touches upon the issue of fairness in the presence of disadvantaged groups and proposes a simple mechanism to balance it. 

Experimental evaluation is extensive. Theoretical insights under simplified assumptions continue to hold under realistic settings in which some of the assumptions are violated.

### Weaknesses
To the best of my knowledge, it is the first time that strategic agents, repeated retraining, and a combination of human-annotated samples and model-annotated samples are investigated together in a study on the long-term impacts of model retraining. Most of the paper is concerned with building a theory that explains how biases grow over time and how unfairness can manifest itself. However, the most important question is how to prevent these biases and unfairness. The paper partly answers these questions by proposing a refined training process and an early stopping mechanism. They seem to be a small step towards the solution of the problem. Overall, this paper has a comprehensive formulation of the problem but an incremental solution.  

While the paper investigates long-term interactions, it makes the simplifying assumption that the joint distribution $P_{XY}$ is fixed over time. This is clearly not the case, especially when who stays in the system or who comes into the system is determined by the previous interaction of the ML system with different demographic groups. User retention and the effect of retraining on the representation disparity seem to be neglected in the current work.

- How Assumption 3.1 is justified? How does having a fixed hypothesis class allow us to ignore algorithmic bias? It clearly varies with $D^t$. Is it assumed that it does not vary much with $D^t$? Or is it assumed that the algorithmic bias is very small compared to other biases for all possible $D^t$ values? If so, can you justify this, perhaps by going over an example scenario and by providing experimental evidence? 

- Theorem 3.5 does not shed light on the lower limit of the qualification rate. Can it get worse than the qualification rate under $P_{XY}$?

- If the decision-maker knows that there are long-term impacts, then why should it use a one-shot trained classifier like logistic regression? Isn’t it better to incorporate the knowledge of the long-term impacts of strategic agents and classifier-annotated samples within the loss function to be optimized? 

- About implementation of the early stopping mechanism. Does the decision maker know that it has systematic bias? How does it know the identities of the advantaged and disadvantaged groups? If these are not known, then how can this early stopping mechanism be implemented?

- The appendix includes results where all examples are human-annotated. Investigating the figure there, can’t we conclude that it is better to forget about model-annotated samples and train only with human-annotated samples (although they are much fewer in number)?
