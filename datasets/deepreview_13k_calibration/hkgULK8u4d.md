## Abstract
Transformer-based models have emerged as popular choices for the multivariate long-term time-series forecasting problem due to their ability to capture long-term dependencies. However, current transformer-based models either overlook crucial mutual dependencies among channels or fail to capture various temporal patterns across different scales. To fill the gap, we propose a novel model called MGTST (Multi-scale and cross-channel Gated Time-Series Transformer). In this model, we introduce three innovative designs, including Parallel Multi-Scale Architecture (PMSA), Temporal Embedding with Representation Tokens (TERT), and Cross-Channel Attention and Gated Mechanism (CCAGM). In addition, we introduce Channel Grouping (CG) to mitigate channel interaction redundancy for datasets with a large number of channels. The experimental results demonstrate that our model outperforms both channel-dependent (CD) and channel-independent (CI) baseline models on seven widely used benchmark datasets, with performance improvement ranging from 1.5 percent to 41.9 percent compared to the state-of-the-art in terms of forecasting accuracy.

### Summary
**Summary:**

This paper introduces the MGTST (Multi-scale and cross-channel Gated Time-Series Transformer) model, aiming to address the limitations of current transformer-based models in multivariate long-term time-series forecasting. The authors propose several novel components, including Parallel Multi-Scale Architecture (PMSA), Temporal Embedding with Representation Tokens (TERT), Cross-Channel Attention and Gated Mechanism (CCAGM), and Channel Grouping (CG). The paper claims that MGTST outperforms existing models on several benchmark datasets.

**Strengths:**

A new MGTST model is proposed, which consists  PMSA, TERT, CCAGM, and CG modules.

**Weaknesses:**

*Insufficient Justification for Module Design:* The paper describes the procedures of the proposed modules but lacks a clear explanation of the underlying inductive biases and the rationale behind choosing these specific designs. For instance, the advantage of using gated attention over standard attention in time-series forecasting is not adequately discussed.

By the way, from my perspective, the parallel multi-scale structure and the CLS token seem not new in forecasting literature. For example, the multi-scale structure design in Crossformer starts from Unet. Unet contains the skip connection between the encoder and decoder at the same resolution which can be viewed as a parallel multi-scale design. Thus the Crossformer is not a simple sequential design as shown in Figure 3 but also contains a parallel design. The CARD (Xue et al., 2023) also considered the CLS token (e.g., Figure 1 in Xue et al., 2023). I have to admit that the exact design of the parallel multi-scale structure and CLS token are not the same as the counterparts in Crossformer and CARD but based on the current presentation I don't think they are significantly different.



*Numerical Comparison:* While the paper claims superior performance over baseline models, the results of PatchTST can be better according to the original paper. In PatchTST paper, results with two different input lengths, PatchTST/64 (512 input length) and PatchTST/42 (336 input length) are reported. In complexity settings (e.g., Electricity, Traffic, and Weather), PatchTST/64 with 512 input length has better performance than those with 336 input length. In particular, in the Traffic setting, PatchTST/64 obtains 0.360/0.379/0.392/0.432 MSE scores for 96/192/336/720 forecasting lengths, which are better than both MGTST-336 and MGTST-512. As authors consider two different input lengths, it would be better to also include experiments PatchTST/64.

*Dataloader Issue:* The sample codes seem to have the same issue in the test dataloader part as the original PatchTST paper, in which the last several test samples would be ignored. A similar observation has also been reported in TIDE paper. It would be better to fix the dataloader issues and update the crossposting results. 



**Questions:**

1. Can authors elaborate more on why the gated mechanism is useful in the forecasting tasks?
2. Will the performance of the channel grouping module depend on the order of channels? After a random permutation on the order of channels, it seems that different groups will be obtained. Moreover, when setting group number 1, the settings of 5 datasets out of 7, how would channel grouping work, and how does it differ from standard attention?

**Minor Issues:**

1. In the paragraph before section 3.1 and section 3.2, $\frac{L\_{input} - L\_{patch}}{S_{stride}}$ -->  $\lfloor\frac{L\_{input} - L\_{patch}}{S_{stride}}\rfloor$ 

2. Discussion for Crossformer in Section A.1.3. The Crossformer and PatchTST are concurrent work. The statement that "*...adds a cross-attention layer on the top of PatchTST*" seems improper from my perspective. 


At this stage, the paper's contributions do not appear substantial enough for acceptance at a top-tier machine learning conference like ICLR. The novelty and effectiveness of the proposed components need to be more convincingly demonstrated. However, I am open to reconsidering my decision if the authors can address these concerns in their rebuttal.

*Insufficient Justification for Module Design:* The paper describes the procedures of the proposed modules but lacks a clear explanation of the underlying inductive biases and the rationale behind choosing these specific designs. For instance, the advantage of using gated attention over standard attention in time-series forecasting is not adequately discussed. The paper does not provide sufficient justification for why the specific gating mechanism is superior to other attention variants, especially given the computational overhead it might introduce. A more detailed analysis of the gating mechanism's impact on different time-series characteristics is needed.

### Summary
This paper introduces an interesting approach for long-term time series forecasting, harnessing the power of cross-channel attention and a multi-scale learning mechanism simultaneously. We enhance performance while reducing complexity by incorporating innovative temporal embedding mechanisms and a refined channel grouping strategy.

### Strengths
The paper is well-structured, offering a detailed description of each component's contribution.

The combined utilization of cross-channel attention and a multi-scale learning mechanism represents a fruitful approach in the provided scenarios. 

Comprehensive comparison and ablation studies are provided, contrasting the proposed method with several existing approaches for long-term time series forecasting.

Overall, the motivation is clear.

### Weaknesses
The paper would benefit from providing more comprehensive details regarding the architecture and model settings of the transformer-based model. Specifically, the dimensions of the embedding layers, the number of attention heads, and the specific activation functions used within the transformer blocks should be explicitly stated. Furthermore, the method of positional encoding and its impact on the model's ability to capture temporal dependencies should be elaborated upon. Without these details, it is difficult to assess the reproducibility and generalizability of the proposed approach.

To enhance the clarity of the figures, particularly Figures 2 and 3, consider adding explicit annotations and ensuring that the notations in the text align precisely with the corresponding elements in the figures. For instance, in Figure 2, the flow of data through the different components should be clearly indicated with arrows, and the specific operations performed at each stage should be labeled. In Figure 3, the different scales should be clearly distinguished, and the interaction between the scales should be visually represented. The current figures lack sufficient detail to fully understand the proposed method.

Some areas that need attention include addressing missing notations (e.g., defining the meanings of "D"). The paper also lacks a clear explanation of how the channel grouping strategy is determined. The method for selecting the number of groups, the size of each group, and the criteria used to group channels are not discussed. This lack of detail makes it difficult to understand the impact of the channel grouping strategy on the overall performance of the model. In the case of Figure 2, it is crucial to clearly indicate which components represent the Temporal Embedding with Representation Tokens and which depict the Cross-Channel Attention and Gated Mechanism. The current figure is ambiguous and does not clearly distinguish between these two key components.

Further discussions on channel group sizes, scale numbers, and stride lengths would add depth and clarity to the paper. The paper should include a sensitivity analysis of these hyperparameters, demonstrating how different choices affect the model's performance. Missing experiments on complex, multivariate, multimodal datasets, e.g., the air quality [1], interstate traffic [2]

### Questions
The use of a parallel architecture introduces substantial overhead when compared to the sequential approach. This overhead is expected to have a significant impact on prediction performance, particularly in the context of large-scale multimodal datasets. It's worth noting that the experimental section currently lacks the inclusion of these large-scale multimodal datasets for evaluation.

Considering the substantial computational overhead, the observed prediction improvement, such as the 1.5% reduction in Mean Squared Error (MSE), appears relatively minor.

The paper's evaluation is limited to simple time-series datasets, and it lacks assessment on more complex, multi-variate, and multi-modal datasets, e.g., the air quality [1], interstate traffic [2] (mentioned above in Weakness).

How does this approach compare with copula-based transformers [3] in the context of both long-term and short-term time-series prediction?

### Summary
Based on the observation that existing transformer-based methods have issues, either overlooking the crucial interdependencies between channels or failing to capture various temporal patterns at different scales, this paper introduces a new method, MGTST (Multi-scale and cross-channel Gated Time-Series Transformer), which addresses these issues through the design of three modules:  Parallel Multi-Scale Architecture (PMSA), Temporal Embedding with Representation Tokens (TERT), and Cross-Channel Attention and Gated Mechanism (CCAGM). Additionally, the authors introduce the channel grouping strategy to alleviate channel interaction redundancy. Experiments are conducted on seven commonly used datasets to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed MGTST.

### Strengths
(1) The proposed method tackles issues of inadequate modeling of cross-channel dependencies and multi-scale temporal patterns in multivariate long-term time-series forecasting, which is technically sound.

(2) The authors conducted comparisons with several state-of-the-art baselines and ablation studies on different datasets to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

(3) The paper has a clear structure and is generally easy to follow.

### Weaknesses
 (1) The motivation of this paper is too general and lacks specific depth. The issues of mutual dependencies among channels and various temporal patterns have been long-standing. The authors fail to provide a deeper analysis and lack a detailed exposition of the specific problems the paper aims to address, and the reasons or new insights behind them. 

 (2) The claim that "One prominent limitation pertains to the inadequate modeling of cross-channel dependencies" is not fully convincing. The cross-dimension dependencies have been explored in (Zhang & Yan, 2022; Nie et al., 2022; Wu et al., 2022). It is not clear why or in which aspects the cross-dimension or cross-channel modeling of these methods is insufficient. The advantages of the proposed cross-dimension modeling module in this paper over these modeling methods are not clear. Similarly, for modeling multi-scale temporal patterns, the advantages of the corresponding module proposed in this paper over existing methods are also not clear.

 (3) The method proposed in the paper seems like a simple stacking of modules. The authors could delve deeper into analyzing the relationship and interplay between the three proposed modules: PMSA, TERT, and CCAGM.

### Questions
(1) The motivation and some claims are not convincing enough. The advantages and relations among the proposed modules are not clear. Please see weaknesses for details.

(2) Hyperparameter settings. The paper conducted a hyperparameter analysis in the ablation study and provided additional hyperparameter configurations in the appendix. How do the authors determine the hyperparameters? For instance, the group size varies significantly across different datasets. Was it selected using a validation set?

(3) The main conceptual diagram in the article is too hastily drawn and occupies too much space.
