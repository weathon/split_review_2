## Abstract
Federated Domain Adaptation (FDA) describes the federated learning (FL) setting where source clients and a server work collaboratively to improve the performance of a target client where limited data is available. The domain shift between the source and target domains, coupled with limited data of the target client, makes FDA a challenging problem, e.g., common techniques such as federated averaging and fine-tuning fail due to domain shift and data scarcity. 
To theoretically understand the problem, we introduce new metrics that characterize the FDA setting and a theoretical framework with novel theorems for analyzing the performance of server aggregation rules. Further, we propose a novel lightweight aggregation rule, Federated Gradient Projection (\texttt{FedGP}), which significantly improves the target performance with domain shift and data scarcity. Moreover, our theory suggests an \textit{auto-weighting scheme} that finds the optimal combinations of the source and target gradients. This scheme improves both \texttt{FedGP} and a simpler heuristic aggregation rule. Extensive experiments verify the theoretical insights and illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods in practice.

5: You are absolutely certain about your assessment. You are very familiar with the related work and checked the math/other details carefully.

### Summary
This paper considers two important issues in federated learning: small data at client sites and domain shift across clients. Simple, intuitive strategies such as gradient projection and auto-weighting for mitigating these issues are proposed. Several interesting theorems are proved regarding federated aggregation, gradient projectin. Results on three datasets are provided.

### Strengths
Nice treatment of federated learning in the presence of domain shift and small data. A good mixture of theoretical and experimental work.

### Weaknesses
I loved the paper till I came to the experiments section. In this day and age, should we still be doing experiments with ColoredMNIST, VLCS, CIFAR-10 and TerraIncognita? ColoredMNIST, VLCS and TerraIngocnita are from 2019, 2013 and 2018 respectively! This raises the questions whether the proposed solutions will scale to larger and difficult datasets.

### Questions
Try on DomainNet, Office Home and PACS datasets. Although these datasets are from 2019 and 2017, atleast they are more challenging datasets.

### Summary
This paper studies the optimal design of an aggregator in federated domain generalization (generalizing to a target client/domain in cross-silo). The FedDA method works by aggregating interpolations (i.e. weighted averages) of the target domain gradient and the source domain gradients. The FedGP method further projects the source gradient onto the "positive direction" of the domain gradient before interpolation (i.e. zeroing out conflicting directions). The interpolation factor for each domain is chosen such that the $L^\pi$ distance between the source and target gradients is minimized w.r.t. some prior $\pi$ on the parameters. The authors show that this error can be decomposed as a noise term of the target domain and a distance term between the source and the target domains. The optimal interpolation factor would then balance the source and target gradients based on those terms, which can be estimated during training in a scheme called auto_weight. Extensive experiments show the benefits of this approach.

### Strengths
- The paper's analysis and experiments are well-detailed.
- The analysis is interesting and covers many aspects of the design of an optimal aggregator in the federated domain generalization setting.
- The method is intuitive and is easy to implement (save for the auto-weighting scheme).
- The improvement seems to be significant in terms of generalizing to the target domain with respect to personalized federated learning algorithms.

### Weaknesses
 - It seems like it would be better to compare the algorithms presented in this paper to domain generalization algorithms, such as the ones shown in DomainBed's GitHub repo.
- The methods presented make sense mostly in the cross-silo setting, as mentioned in the paper, which limits its applicability to general federated learning problems with a relatively larger number of clients that can benefit a lot from methods for generalizing to new clients.
- It is mentioned multiple times that data scarcity is the setting of interest, in which FedDA and FedGP are supposed to perform more favorably. However, we do not see experiments showing the effect of data scarcity on the robustness of the performance of FedGP vs. FedAvg, for example.
- Personalized federated learning algorithms are relevant for comparison, but I think that direct comparison of such algorithms with FedGP might put them at a disadvantage since they are not specifically designed for domain generalization. ColoredMNIST, VLCS, and TerraIncognita datasets are more concerned with shifts in p(x) or p(x|y), whereas personalized FL is more concerned with shifts in p(y) and p(y|x), i.e. personalizing the prediction rather than adapting to spurious correlations or invariant attributes. You should either choose federated datasets for comparison, or you should compare your algorithm to domain generalization algorithms, e.g. IRM and others. Or why not use a hospital dataset that fits the setting you described in the paper? For example, you can consider FLamby [2].
- One work [1] from federated continual learning might be of interest (which even shares the same name FedGP). It is motivated from a similar intuition, which is to remove from the gradient its projection onto the negative direction of the reference gradient.
- In algorithm 1, the auto_weight scheme requires intermediate gradients for each domain, which might require a lot of memory.

### Questions
Can you train your algorithms and compare them on federated datasets that follows the setting of interest in the paper (cross-silo with data scarcity)?

### Summary
This paper proposes two algorithms to solve federated domain adaptation, a case in which there exists a distributional/domain shift between clients in federated learning. The authors tackle the problems of domain shift and data scarcity in their work. To solve these problems, they propose to design algorithms concerning the __server aggregation rule__, i.e., how the server merges the different gradients of the same model coming from the clients. The two proposed methods are called __FedDA__ which does a convex combination of clients' gradients (including the target), and __FedGP__, which extracts information from source clients' gradients based on the target client gradients.

### Strengths
__Originality.__ The authors provide a novel theoretical framework for the analysis of Federated Learning under heterogeneity.

__Quality.__ The paper is globally well-written and clear. Parts of the experimental section could be improved

__Clarity.__ The novel theoretical framework is easy to follow. Assumptions, notation and definitions are clearly stated and the proposed algorithms are intuitive.

__Significance.__ This paper tackles an extremly important problem in federated learning, i.e., how to deal with __client heterogeneity__. In this sense, besides being important for the niche of federated DA, it can also impact federated learning in general.

### Weaknesses
 __Major__

__W1.__ The description of the real-world experiments in the main paper is not sufficient. While the authors do provide enough information in the appendix, the main paper does not fully describes the methodology the authors employed in consolidating the results of Table 1. For instance, how are the labeled data points chosen for the experiments? How does the performance change w.r.t. to the choice of data points (i.e. standard deviation of the accuracy on target domain)? Specifically, the paper lacks detail on the sampling strategy for the labeled target data used in the experiments. It is unclear if the labeled data points are selected randomly, or if there is a specific selection process. Furthermore, the paper does not discuss the potential impact of different random seeds on the performance of the proposed methods, specifically concerning the variance of the accuracy on the target domain. This lack of information makes it difficult to assess the robustness of the proposed methods.

__Minor.__ (note, this point __did not__ impacted negatively in my review).

__W2.__ I would like to raise that, while this is a Federated DA paper, the authors assume access to a (small) set of labeled data in the target domain. This somewhat breaks the rules of _Unsupervised_ DA, and may bias performance towards methods that use target labeled data when comparing with UDA algorithms such as KD3A. This remains somewhat true even when supposing a small amount of labeled target data, depending on the degree of distributional shift. Nonetheless, __I do think the authors use labeled data in a clearly motivated and justified way__.

### Questions
__Q1.__ Concerning __FedDA__ and __FedGP__ aggregation schemes, in order to have a convex combination, shouldn't $\sum_{i=1}^{n}\beta_{i}=1$? Is this constraint enforced? For instance, in Figure 9 (appendix), the sum of betas exceeds 1.

### Summary
The submission studied domain adaptation under the federated setting. Two methods (FedDA (1) and FedGP(2)) to aggregate gradients were proposed based on the analysis of the delta error of an aggregation rule (Theorem 3.6). An auto-weighting rule (3) was proposed (FedDA_Auto and FedGP_Auto), too. Experiments showing the robustness (Figure 2) and target accuracies (Table 1) justified the proposed methods.

### Strengths
The submission identifies the factors that affect the performance of an aggregation rule and then proposes solutions based on the findings.
The target domain enjoys the robustness and performance increases brought by the solutions.

### Weaknesses
Despite a comfortable reading experience and leading performance results, I would like to raise a concern about the problem formulation.

(a) From the federated learning perspective, the server and the clients are learning together to achieve a better performance measured by the sum of ALL clients. Therefore, federatively speaking, paying the whole attention to ONE target client might not align with the original intention of studying federated learning.

### Questions
(b) Given the federated learning nature, multiple target clients seem more practical. How would the proposed method scale with the number of target clients?

(c) The current source clients are given and assumed to be well-trained. What are the potential and challenges to extending the proposed method to a scenario where every client learns and transfers simultaneously?

(d) What if one negates the direction of the projections of negative source gradients (e.g., the projections of g_s3 and g_s4 in Figure 1)?

(e) The behaviors of FedDA in Figure 2(a) and Figure 2(c) seem contracdict to each other. Is it trivial? Or may I have a clarification?
