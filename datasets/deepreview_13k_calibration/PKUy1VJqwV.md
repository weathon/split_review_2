## Abstract
Self-supervised learning (SSL) has garnered increasing attention in the graph learning community, owing to its capability of enabling powerful models pre-trained on large unlabeled graphs for general purposes, facilitating quick adaptation to specific domains. Though promising, existing graph SSL frameworks often struggle to capture both high-level abstract features and fine-grained features simultaneously, leading to sub-optimal generalization abilities across different downstream tasks. To bridge this gap, we present Multi-granularity Graph Semantic Ensemble via Knowledge Distillation, namely MGSE, a plug-and-play graph knowledge distillation framework that can be applied to any existing graph SSL framework to enhance its performance by incorporating the concept of multi-granularity. Specifically, MGSE captures multi-granular knowledge by employing multiple student models to learn from a single teacher model, conditioned by probability distributions with different granularities. We apply it to six state-of-the-art graph SSL frameworks and evaluate their performances over multiple graph datasets across different domains, the experimental results show that MGSE can consistently boost the performance of these existing graph SSL frameworks with up to 9.2\% improvement.

### Summary
This work studies a problem overlooked by existing graph self-supervised models, i.e., how to simultaneously capture coarse-grained and fine-grained information for outstanding performance in various downstream tasks. To this end, the authors propose a plug-and-play graph knowledge distillation framework (MGSE), which can integrate with existing graph self-supervised learning models and enhance model performance by incorporating multi-granularity concepts. Specifically, under the condition of probability distributions at different granularities, MGSE captures multi-granularity knowledge by making multiple student models learn from a single teacher model. Extensive results on several benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed MGSE improves the performance of existing graph self-supervised learning models. The ablation experiments also demonstrated the effectiveness of the techniques employed in MGSE.

In summary, this work makes the following contributions: Firstly, it proposes a plug-and-play knowledge distillation framework to enhance the generalization of any graph-based self-supervised learning model. Based on empirical experimental results, the framework demonstrates promising performance, and the authors provide theoretical guarantees for the performance of MGSE.

### Strengths
1. The considered problem is important, and the proposed method is technically sound.
2. Experiments conducted show that the proposed method achieves good empirical performance.
3. The paper is well-written and easy to follow.

### Weaknesses
While overall this work does not have major flaws, I still have some concerns as follows and I hope the authors to address them as much as possible.
1. Although the authors have designed different student models based on the analysis to capture knowledge at different granularities for solving various downstream tasks, it is important to visually demonstrate the distinct granularities of knowledge captured by each student model, rather than solely asserting that “different prototype sets capture different semantic granularities because we assign different numbers of prototypes to each prototype set in descending order”. The authors should consider adding a case study to provide a better explanation, like the mentioned example in the introduction about which knowledge in amino acids is coarse-grained and which knowledge is fine-grained.

2. In this paper, the framework captures multi-granular knowledge and performs an averaging operation on the outputs of different student models. However, since different datasets may lean towards different granularities of knowledge, it is worth considering whether the introduction of fine-grained knowledge in datasets where coarse-grained knowledge dominates could potentially be not only irrelevant to the target task but also introduce noise. Taking document classification as an example, capturing high-level textual features may be sufficient, and the fine-grained semantic features may not provide substantial assistance in determining the category of the document.

3. If I haven't missed any important details, as far as I know, the model ensemble can also lead to performance improvement. Therefore, it is crucial to determine whether the performance improvement comes from capturing knowledge at different granularities or is simply a result of the model ensemble strategy.

4. From the results, it can be observed that the designed framework brings some improvement, but this improvement comes at the cost of ensemble of multiple models. Additionally, although the authors have indicated that the proposed framework's computational complexity is proportional to the existing graph self-supervised models, considering the significant computational complexity of the original graph-based self-supervised models, it is uncertain whether this trade-off is worthwhile.

### Summary
The paper introduces a novel method, MGSE, which aims to enhance the capabilities of self-supervised learning (SSL) in the graph learning domain. The authors address the challenge of existing graph SSL frameworks in capturing both high-level abstract features and fine-grained features simultaneously. By employing knowledge distillation, MGSE captures multi-granular knowledge using multiple student models learning from a single teacher model. Experimental results indicate that MGSE consistently improves the performance of several existing graph SSL frameworks.

### Strengths
The paper addresses a relevant challenge in the graph SSL domain.
Experimental results indicate the potential of MGSE to improve various existing graph SSL frameworks.
The authors provide a comprehensive discussion and analysis of their experimental results, showcasing a deep understanding and thorough examination of the outcomes.

### Weaknesses
The primary methodology of the paper appears to draw significant inspiration from the ProtoNCE loss, originally from the visual domain, as candidly acknowledged by the authors in “our optimization objective can be an analogy to the ProtoNCE loss to maximize the mutual information at cluster-level”. This brings forth concerns regarding the novelty and distinctiveness of the paper's central contribution. While adapting this approach to the context of GNNs is commendable, it seems that the crux of the innovation might be largely credited to the ProtoNCE loss itself.

The structure of the paper, particularly in Section 4, lacks comprehensive detail. With only two pages dedicated to the methodology, certain aspects remain unclear. For instance, the authors mention the construction of "K sets of corresponding trainable prototypes" but do not elucidate how these prototypes are updated. This omission leaves room for ambiguity and confusion.

The experimental results, while positive, do not offer a comprehensive comparison with other fine-tuning methods, which would have provided a clearer picture of MGSE's relative advantages.

The paper argues that multiple student models exhibit diverse levels of granularity. So why not choose the best model for the downstream task but use an ensemble? It is essential to consider the possibility that combining models with varying levels of granularity might introduce conflicting or inconsistent information, leading to a negative impact on the overall performance of the downstream task. A thorough analysis and experimentation on the ensemble's potential drawbacks and benefits are warranted to address this concern.

### Questions
Could the authors clarify the update mechanism for the "K sets of corresponding trainable prototypes"?

How does the proposed MGSE method compare with other fine-tuning techniques when applied to one base model?

Given the analogy to the ProtoNCE loss, what are the unique challenges and considerations when applying this loss to the GNN domain?

### Summary
This paper proposes a teacher-multi-student knowledge distillation framework to enhance the effectiveness of existing graph SSL methods. Specifically, authors deem an existing SSL pre-trained graph encoder as teacher, and employ multiple students to acquire discriminative representations on different granularities guided by the teacher. On downstream tasks, the students are separately fine-tuned and their predictions are linearly combined as the final output. The proposed framework is shown to be able to improve six existing graph SSL algorithms on molecular graph and PPI graph modeling.

### Strengths
+ The proposed method is technically sound to extract discriminative representations in different semantic spaces, which shows some novelty and practical value.
+ The proposed framework is guaranteed with decent theoretical results.
+ The empirical results are sufficient to demonstrate the general effectiveness of the proposed framework.

### Weaknesses
- The effectiveness of the proposed framework is largely depended by the selection of prototype numbers, which determines the semantic levels learned by student models. However, the selection procedure of this set of hyperparameters is not clearly justified in the current draft.

### Questions
Generally, I am convinced by the proposed techniques, while I have some concerns on the selection of prototype structures:
1. **Selection of prototype number**: It seems that authors use some heuristic methods to determine the prototype numbers for multi-student distillation. Such heuristic method can hardly capture the intrinsic semantic structures underlying the pre-training dataset. By comparison, the prototype number determination scheme explored in [a] can better discover such structure in a learnable way. Can authors justify their prototype number selection scheme against such method with some theoretical or empirical results?
2. **Visualization of learned prototypes**: Authors are suggested to show the semantic prototypes learned for both molecular graphs and PPI graphs. Such visualization can help to understand the learning mechanism of the proposed method.
