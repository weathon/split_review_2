## Abstract
Epileptic seizure is an abnormal brain activity that affects millions of people worldwide. Effectively detecting seizures from electroencephalography (EEG) signals with automated algorithms is essential for seizure diagnosis and treatment. Although much research has been proposed to learn EEG representations, most of them neglect the detection latency when it comes to real-world clinical scenarios where the inputs are streaming. Moreover, they fail to either capture the underlying dynamics of brain activities or localize seizure regions. To this end, we propose an improved seizure detection task named onset detection, which identifies both the presence and the specific timestamps of seizure events, and two new metrics to quantify the timeliness of detection methods. We further introduce the Dynamic Seizure Network, a framework for EEG representation learning, which models the evolutionary brain states and dynamic brain connectivity efficiently. Theoretical analysis and experimental results on three real-world seizure datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms baselines with low time and space complexity.  Our method can also provide visualizations to assist clinicians in localizing abnormal brain activities for further diagnosis.

### Confidence
4: You are confident in your assessment, but not absolutely certain. It is unlikely, but not impossible, that you did not understand some parts of the submission or that you are unfamiliar with some pieces of related work.

### Summary
This paper presents a method, namely the onset detection, for seizure detection using EEG, and two metrics to quantify the timeliness of detection. The proposed method is based on a framework for EEG representation learning, which models the evolutionary brain states and dynamic brain connectivity efficiently. The experimental results conducted on two EEG databases have shown the effectiveness of the proposed method.

The paper is clear and well presented. The idea of the proposed contribution seems interesting.

### Strengths
- A method, called seizure onset detection task, for improving seizure detection task using EEG. The proposed method allows identifying the presence of seizures also the specific timestamps when seizures start.
- Two metrics were proposed (i.e., diagnosis rate and wrong rate) to quantify the timeliness of seizure detection under streaming context.
- A framework, called Dynamic Seizure Network (DSN), for efficient seizure detection from EEG signals that integrates the attention mechanism and the recurrent mechanism within a unified evolutionary state modeling module to localize brain abnormalities and model dynamic evolutionary patterns.

### Weaknesses
 - Related work is not well described.
- The proposed method should be summarized as an algorithm allowing the readers to reproduce the proposed method.

### Questions
- It is suggested to discuss more the related work by considering some recent and relevant similar studies. 
- It is also suggested to introduce an algorithm summarizing the proposed method.

### Summary
This paper proposes a new task called seizure onset detection that aims to identify the presence and timing of seizures from EEG signals. Existing seizure detection models is limited in real-world clinical use due to high latency and resource requirements, according to the authors. The paper also introduces two new metrics to quantify the detection latency.
The authors also propose a mode consisting of spectral embedding, evolutionary brain state modeling, and brain correlation learning.
Experiments are performed on three EEG datasets.

### Strengths
- Introduces a potentially useful seizure onset detection task and latency metrics.
- Achieves good results on the datasets and tasks, according to the paper's presentation.

### Weaknesses
My questions regarding the paper is primarily due to the experimental setup. We keep the basic settings of all baselines and our method to be identical (e.g. learning rate as 0.001, model dimension as 64) and use grid search to find the optimal model-specific hyper-parameters to get more reliable results, e.g. model layers and dropout rate. This is critical and does not posit a fair comparison. Other models were not designed for this architectural configuration or experimental setup. Its not clear what is model dimension. How were model parameters chosen for benchmarks? Was a grid-search performed for all of them and for both tasks (streaming and static) independently?

### Questions
Would like clarifications regarding weaknesses. Particularly the experimental setup of the evaluation

### Confidence
4: You are confident in your assessment, but not absolutely certain. It is unlikely, but not impossible, that you did not understand some parts of the submission or that you are unfamiliar with some pieces of related work.

### Summary
This paper proposes 1) a seizure onset detection task, 2) two metrics to quantify the timeliness of the detection methods, and 3) a Dynamic Seizure Network (DSN) to model the evolutionary brain states and dynamic brain connectivity from EEGs. Experimental results suggest that the proposed network outperforms baselines, and results in low time and space complexity. The authors further provide visualizations to display abnormal brain locations.

### Strengths
1. Technically sound paper.
2. Extensive experiments were performed and results were strong.

### Weaknesses
1. The proposed seizure onset detection task is not new. Here are a few examples of machine learning studies for seizure onset detection:

Naumann (Eds.), Proceedings of the Conference on Health, Inference, and Learning (Vol. 174, pp. 311–337). PMLR.

2. Seizure involves long-range temporal dependency (e.g., 30 second). The proposed onset detection task uses very short window length (e.g., 1s) as inputs, which could be a limitation and prevent the model from learning long-range temporal dependency in EEGs.
3. The proposed metrics (diagnosis rate and wrong rate) only measure the correctness of predicting the start of the seizure, but do not measure the correctness of the predicted duration of the seizure.
4. Baseline selection seems a bit arbitrary. The models mentioned in Appendix Section A3 are seizure detection models and are highly related to this paper, but not all of them are chosen as baselines. e.g., BrainNet (Chen2022) and GraphS4mer (Tang2023) are not included as baselines. In particular, GraphS4mer also captures dynamic brain connectivity, so it would be good to compare DSN to it.
5. No details about hyperparameter selection is provided.

### Questions
1. As mentioned above, seizure onset detection is not a new task. Please conduct a thorough literature review and cite prior works.
2. What’s B in equation 3? How was B selected?
3. Please include a more comprehensive list of baselines, such as BrainNet and GraphS4mer. If a baseline cannot be included due to availability of open sourced code, please specify in the paper.
4. Please provide details about hyperparameter selection.
5. Were the examples in Figure 6 and Appendix Figure 9 reviewed by clinical experts? If not, please acknowledge it as a limitation.
6. As mentioned above, the seizure onset task does not capture long-range dependency in EEG during model training. Please acknowledge this limitation. A more optimal setup may be to train the models using longer window lengths, but predict seizure/non-seizure label within a short window (e.g., 1s) at inference time.
7. Please acknowledge the limitation that the proposed metrics do not take into account the predicted seizure duration.
