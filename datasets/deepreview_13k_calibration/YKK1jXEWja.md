## Abstract
Large language models (LLMs) have shown the ability to solve complex decision-making tasks beyond the natural language processing tasks. Current LLM agents such as ReAct can solve interactive decision-making tasks by imitating the few-shot demonstrations given in the prompt. The LLM agents based on few-shot in-context learning (ICL) achieve surprisingly high performance without training. Despite the simplicity and generalizability, the ICL-based approaches lack optimizing trajectories based on the reward from an environment. In this paper, we introduce Prospector, a reflective LLM agent that features Self-Asking and Trajectory Ranking. To elicit the LLM agent to generate more proper actions that contribute to following a given instruction, we introduce additional Self-Asking steps in the few-shot demonstrations. Furthermore, to take advantages of the stochastic generation of LLMs, we provide Trajectory Ranking in which the LLM agent generates diverse (creative) trajectories and the most rewarding trajectory is selected by using the reward prediction models. On the representative decision-making benchmark environments such as ALFWorld and WebShop, we empirically demonstrate that Prospector can considerably increase the success rate of given tasks, while outperforming recent advancements such as ReAct and Reflexion.

### Summary
The authors propose Prospector, which extends in-context learning (ICL) for LLMs to be able to optimize trajectories based on reward from environment using self-asking and ranking in decision making tasks. On two decision-making benchmark environments such as ALFWorld and WebShop, they empirically demonstrate that Prospector can considerably increase the success rate of given tasks, while outperforming recent advancements such as ReAct and Reflexion.

### Strengths
1. The paper is well-written and easy to follow
2. Extensive ablations and analysis presented is nicely done -- it shows how the two components of the prospector framework work and improve the performance of the baseline react models.

### Weaknesses
1. Limited novelty: While it is good to see how two simple ideas when put together in the prospector framework can lead to good task performance in interactive decision making scenarios, the two ideas themselves are very close to existing work. Consequently, the novelty seems a bit limited, IMO.
2. Broader baselines: I liked the authors ablations and comparison with React and its variants given the closeness of the approach (prospector) to react.  These were helpful in understanding how prospector's individual components improve performance. However, it would have been also useful to see how prospector's performance compares to other llm planning approaches e.g., the ones that combine llms + tree search/classical planning approaches such as https://arxiv.org/pdf/2307.08962.pdf to see how far does prospector push the performance. Lastly, given that prospector does some training for critics using example trajectories, I am wondering how the performance of prospector would compare to finetuned LLM planner/policy e.g., with LIMA (https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.11206) which can be used to finetune LLM with limited data. Without these, right now, it is unclear whether prospector should be the goto planning approach for interactive decision making problems or is it really just a better version of react?
3. It seems that Prospector would be slower than React or reflexion because of additional reasoning that it does using more LLM calls. For real world interactive decision making tasks, it might be useful for the authors to also report compute time needed to decide the next action during the task execution. To that end, it would be great to also add a limitation section.
4. What is the advantage of the LLM critic over a “learnt” critic which can take a policy rollout and provide a corresponding reward? Given that prospector is evaluated only in sim environment, why not use sim to learn such a critic?
5. The authors dont seem to cite or mention self-refine: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.17651.pdf but that seemed very similar to self-asking in prospector too IMO.

### Questions
- Unclear why the authors do not show prospector with askact + trajectory ranking results on Alfworld (Table 2,4). I’d encourage  the authors to do this for the sake of completeness. Likewise, it would be good to see prospector with react + trajectory ranking on webshop (table 7).
- Table 5,8: Why is few-shot reward prediction accuracy of LLM critic lower with more shots (3-shot vs. 2-shot)?
- It seems that Prospector would be slower than React or reflexion because of additional reasoning that it does using more LLM calls. For real world interactive decision making tasks, it might be useful for the authors to also report compute time needed to decide the next action during the task execution. To that end, it would be great to also add a limitation section.

- Opensourcing plans? Despite the simplicity of the approach, I encourage the authors to opensource their code for reproducibility.

### Summary
In this paper, the authors present Prospector, an algorithm for improving LLM agents operating on language tasks. The authors introduce the concepts of Self-Asking, involving asking the model to ponder the task and options at hand, and trajectory ranking, which considers multiple rollouts from the language models and compares them using a "critic", which is a different LLM call, to find the best possible response.

The paper is organized as following: first, the interactive decision making tasks is introduced on which the rest of the paper is based on. Then, the authors introduce the two new components in this paper, namely self-asking, where the agent asks and answers a question about the task at hand, and trajectory ranking, where multiple natural language interactions are rolled out, and then the best trajectory is picked out by an LLM critic. The authors present a variety of experiments based on these premises, such as how different language models perform as the action model, and how well different critics (fine tuned vs. few shot prompted) perform against each other. The authors show that while it may not be very important to fine tune the actor, fine tuning the critic leads to clear improvements. The necessary ablations (such as: how well does each of these components perform by themselves?) are not marked separately, but included in the primary reported results tables.

### Strengths
The paper has a few strong points, such as:
1. A comprehensive evaluation across different language models used as critics. 
2. On different parameters of the experiments, a proper experimentation schedule was used, such as few-shot reward prediction accuracy.
3. The success rate on the evaluated benchmarks show marked improvement over previous work, however, I am not familiar with the benchmarks in the field enough to know if this is sufficient.

### Weaknesses
The positive impact of the paper is beset by several downsides. Here are these in the order of importance:
1. I am not certain about the magnitude of the impact of the method introduced in this paper. The method of self-asking itself does not seem significant enough in and of itself without the trajectory ranking, and is quite similar to many different previous methods such as thinking step by step. Trajectory ranking is definitely the more interesting of the two components, but I am not sure it is a novel and significant enough contribution to merit a place in this venue.
2. Following up on this, the work is beset by the fact that the new methods are only evaluated in two benchmarks only. While they perform well on the benchmarks, the question of how easy they will be to scale to a variety of other tasks remain unanswered from the paper itself.
3. While there is a comprehensive study run on LLM critic and which language model is best for that task, it does not extend to the LLM actor itself. Rather, only two models of incredibly large sizes are used, which keeps the evaluation quite one-sided.

### Questions
1. How well does the open source smaller models perform on the tasks presented in the paper?
2. Could you please expand the previous work section to properly differentiate yourself from them and clarify what contributions of yours in this paper are novel vs. same as what is done before?
3, What would be the primary challenges of scaling this method to new benchmarks?

### Summary
The paper introduces Prospector, an innovative LLM agent designed for decision-making tasks. Unlike previous methods such as ReAct and Reflexion, which rely on few-shot in-context learning or use feedback from the environment, Prospector integrates two novel components: Self-Asking and Trajectory Ranking. Self-Asking allows the LLM to pose and answer its own questions during few-shot demonstrations, aiming to collect more pertinent information for decision-making. Trajectory Ranking, on the other hand, involves generating multiple action trajectories and selecting the most rewarding one using reward prediction models. The authors show that Prospector significantly outperforms existing methods on benchmark tasks like ALFWorld and WebShop.

### Strengths
1. The paper addresses a gap in current LLM-based decision-making methods by integrating feedback from the environment and incorporating stochasticity in trajectory generation.
2. The proposed method shows empirical success, outperforming existing state-of-the-art methods on standard benchmarks.
3. Prospector offers an approach that avoids costly fine-tuning, making it more generalizable and efficient.

### Weaknesses
1. Both the critic and the generator are LLMs. This could amplify any existing issues inherent to LLMs.
2. Limited discussion on the limitations of the reward prediction models used for Trajectory Ranking.
3. The paper could benefit from a more comprehensive analysis comparing the computational overhead introduced by the Self-Asking and Trajectory Ranking components.

### Questions
1. How does the computational complexity of Prospector compare to that of existing methods like ReAct and Reflexion?
2. Could you elaborate on the reward prediction models used in Trajectory Ranking? What are the limitations of the reward prediction models you used, and how do they impact the overall performance of Prospector?
3. Are there specific types of questions or domains where the Self-Asking mechanism is more or less effective?

4: You are confident in your assessment, but not absolutely certain. It is unlikely, but not impossible, that you did not understand some parts of the submission or that you are unfamiliar with some pieces of related work.

### Summary
This paper proposes Prospector, a large language model-based agent that aims to solve multi-step decision making tasks. Prospector comprises two parts: Self-Asking, which enables the LLM agent to generate questions and answer them itself, leading to improved intermediate steps in the decision making process, and Trajectory Ranking, where an LLM critic is used to predict the rewards of different trajectories. Compared to prior LLM agents for the ALFWorld and Webshop tasks that only use ICL methods, Prospector is able to achieve higher success rates.

### Strengths
- The proposed method is both simple and intuitive, using LLMs for both planning and critiquing of possible trajectories. The paper is well-written and clear.
- The experiments seem thorough, with comparisons against state-of-the-art methods in the same task domains, and ablations of each component of the proposed Prospector method (removing the trajectory ranking, evaluating the accuracy of the different LLM critics, comparing few-shot and finetuned LLM critics). In particular, studying the choice of either a fine-tuned or ICL-based critic is interesting and seems novel.

### Weaknesses
While the method is straightforward and intuitive with impressive experimental results, my main concern is that the two main components of the methods seem to lack novelty in themselves. This can maybe be clarified with further experimentation: 

-  It’s not clear how much of the overall performance improvement is just due to giving the LLM multiple attempts at a single question with the trajectory ranking process. Further experiments disentangling this would be helpful: for example, if we used the same LLM critics and trajectory ranking process with the ReAct prompt, would it perform on par with Prospector (these experiments seem to be present for ALFWorld but not WebShop)? Would majority voting at every step, which also allows multiple trajectory attempts but without an explicit LLM critic, be less useful than using the LLM-based critic as in Prospector? 

- The AskAct process is does not seem like a novel contribution in and of itself, as it was proposed in Measuring and Narrowing the Compositionality Gap in Language Models (Press et al., 2022). While the authors note that that Self-Ask work was developed for QA tasks specifically, applying the same general technique of prompting the LLM to ask itself a limited set of questions to reason is a limited contribution. In particular, it seems like AskAct was not applied to the ALFWorld benchmark for the Prospector agent, and only tested in WebShop as a single fixed question that asks "which observed object is most proper to select" (shown in Figure 2 and Table 13 and 16). Further experiments eliciting different types of self-asked questions across all the tasks would strengthen this contribution.

### Questions
- It would be helpful to have an ablation with the trajectory ranking only, and no intermediate self-asking step for WebShop, as is shown in ALFWorld. Is most of the juice coming the critic-based trajectory ranking?
- It would also be interesting to see if the few-shot critic performance improves with intermediate chain-of-thought reasoning steps in the critic prompt, rather than just having the critic immediately output a response as success/failure. 
- It would help to add a clarifying caption to Figure 2. It’s not immediately clear why the AskAct reasoning is correct (the second highlighted think[] sentence on the right seems to just reiterate the query, similar to the first highlighted think[] sentence on the left). The item observations from the search don’t seem to indicate which option matches the query (they both are <40 dollars and have mn4 as an option).
