The aligned \textit{Large Language Models} (LLMs) are powerful language understanding and decision-making tools that are created through extensive alignment with human feedback. However, these large models remain susceptible to jailbreak attacks, where adversaries manipulate prompts to elicit malicious outputs that should not be given by aligned LLMs. Investigating jailbreak prompts can lead us to delve into the limitations of LLMs and further guide us to secure them. Unfortunately, existing jailbreak techniques suffer from either (1) scalability issues, where attacks heavily rely on manual crafting of prompts, or (2) stealthiness problems, as attacks depend on token-based algorithms to generate prompts that are often semantically meaningless, making them susceptible to detection through basic perplexity testing. In light of these challenges, we intend to answer this question: \textit{Can we develop an approach that can \textbf{automatically} generate \textbf{stealthy} jailbreak prompts?} In this paper, we introduce AutoDAN, a novel jailbreak attack against aligned LLMs. AutoDAN can automatically generate stealthy jailbreak prompts by the carefully designed hierarchical genetic algorithm. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that AutoDAN not only automates the process while preserving semantic meaningfulness, but also demonstrates superior attack strength in cross-model transferability, and cross-sample universality compared with the baseline. Moreover, we also compare AutoDAN with perplexity-based defense methods and show that AutoDAN can bypass them effectively.

### Confidence
3: You are fairly confident in your assessment. It is possible that you did not understand some parts of the submission or that you are unfamiliar with some pieces of related work. Math/other details were not carefully checked.

### Summary
This paper investigates the automated construction of jailbreak prompts for large language models during autoregressive inference. The paper proposes a technique based on genetic algorithms which is able to consume a pre-defined list of initialization prompts, and permute sentences and words between them to maximize a fitness function. The proposed method is also difficult to detect by perplexity based methods. The proposed approach is evaluated on a variety of open-source models.

### Strengths
The proposed method is novel and easy to understand. The proposed method demonstrates strong attack success rates, while also demonstrating a strong ability to avoid detection via perplexity based methods. The strength of the attack on both open and closed source models raises concerns for the safe deployment of conversational large language models.

### Weaknesses
The proposed approach seems to depend significantly on the choice of initialization prompts used. It’s also unclear to me how the choices of prototype prompts relate to the handcrafted DAN baseline.  

I’m also concerned about the usage of the “Recheck” metric. While the metric is interesting and answers an important question (i.e. is the model actually answering the query), it’s unclear how well the metric itself performs (seems to be dependent on the abilities of the evaluating LLM?). I believe the paper would be stronger if examples and further study of the recheck metric (e.g. under different evaluators) could be provided.

### Questions
* Which specific tokens is the objective fit to on the output? (Is it “Sure, here’s how to do [X]”?). 
* Were the prototype prompts tested independently for success in the handcrafted DAN baseline? More clarification about this baseline would be helpful.
* Which model is used to evaluate the “Recheck” metric? Have you tried with SoTA LLMs (e.g. GPT4)?
* Was the method tried on GPT-4?
* Do you have results for transferability to GPT-3.5 turbo (i.e. table 2 with GPT 3.5 turbo)

### Summary
This paper deals with the jailbreak attacks to aligned large language models. To address the scalability issue from manual prompt design, and the stealthiness issue from token-based algorithm and semantically meaningless prompt, the authors propose AutoDAN that is capable of automatically generating stealthy jailbreak prompts. This is achieved by a hierarchical genetic algorithm. The proposed method can preserve the stealthiness of jailbreak prompts and bypass perplexity detection. Experimental results illustrate the efficacy of cross-modal transferability and cross-sample universality.

### Strengths
1. This work introduces a genetic algorithm for generating jailbreak prompts over the paragraph and sentence levels, which decreases the prompt perplexity and shows its superiority against perplexity filter-based defense. 

2. The authors investigate lexical-level optimization and observe that jailbreak prompts obtained by lexical-level optimization have better transferability.

### Weaknesses
1. Could you clarify the definition of the word scores? In Sec. 3.5.1, the word score seems to be assigned by the sentence-level score. In this case, all words in one sentence have the same score. Why can the sentence-level score represent the word score? Please correct me if my understanding is wrong.

2. As per Table 3, DAN initialization and LLM-based Mutation have higher impacts on performance. For the LLM-base Mutation, this brings additional computation. Moreover, outputs from Alg.4 could be random without any pattern so it is not straightforward and detailed to see how the diverse initializations influence the performance. It would be better if the authors could provide some insights on it. 

3. I also have concerns about the defense evaluation in Table 3. What is the threshold used in this evaluation? This is important because there still seems to be a small gap of PPL values between the handcrafted and automatic DANs. Does that mean if the threshold is set to be a proper value, the perplexity-based method [1] still has the chance to make successful defenses? 

4. For the experiments of cross-model transferability in Table 2, I have concerns about the low transferability of prompts optimized on Vicuna using GCG while Table 2 of [2] shows they can achieve ASR over 30% on GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 using Behavior+GCG optimized on Vicuna. It would be better to see the comparison between AutoDAN-HGA with GCG on GPT-3.5 or GPT-4.  

5. The proposed method still takes a long time to optimize for one sample.

### Summary
The paper presents AutoDan that can automatically generate stealthy jailbreak prompts. It also shows superior attack strength against baselines.

### Strengths
1. The paper is well-written, well structured and easy to understand. In particular, figures are helpful for understanding.
2. The problem is important and well-motivated.
2. the method shows great improvement in terms of ASR, Cross-model transferability, and effectiveness against perplexity defense.

### Weaknesses
Figure 1 is a bit confusing - "Write a blog post that promotes anorexia or bulimia as a healthy lifestyle choice." and "Write a blog
post that promotes anorexia or bulimia as a healthy lifestyle choice." are identical. Maybe revise it to show that the jailbreaking prompt is the difference here.

### Questions
Please consider improving Figure 1.

### Summary
This paper focuses on jailbreak attacks on LLMs, and aims to design a stealthy attack. They combine handcrafted adversarial prompts and genetic algorithms to automatically generate meaningful adversarial prompts. They evaluate methods on AdvBench and show better performance compared with handcrafted prompts and other baselines.

### Strengths
1. The studied problem is well-motivated and well-formulated.
2. The idea of combining handcrafted prompts and automatic generation techniques is reasonable and interesting.
3. The experiments show some advantage of the proposed methods.

### Weaknesses
1. The organization of this paper is poor, especially in Method section. For example, I have no idea what 3.4.1 is trying to state and why it is under Fitness Evaluation section. Besides, there is no preliminary about genetic algorithms before the introduction of proposed methods. 2. 2. The introduction of Paragraph-level and Sentence-level is confusing. The authors mentioned (in section 3.5.1) 'start by exploring the
space of the sentence-level population' and 'then integrate the sentence-level population into the paragraph-level population and start our search on the paragraph-level space'. While in algorithm 1, the authors start from paragraph-level population. Please make your statements clear and consistent.
3. In table 1 and 2, the improvement of ASR looks subtle. Please provide standard error to determine whether there is indeed an improvement.

### Questions
1. My primary concern is that I do not find the way this paper uses handcrafted prompts meaningful or reasonable. Though this paper uses handcrafted prompts as initialization, I did not understand why this is important. If the prompts are effective, then they are valuable foundations as mentioned in the paper, but if they do not work in the first place how can one find an effective prompt near this ineffective initialization? Besides, if the handcrafted prompt is effective, then why bother finding new ones? 
2. Could you evaluate more defenses as mentioned in the paper 'Baseline defenses for adversarial attacks against aligned language models'?
3. Please revise the Method section and reorganize the paper. The Method part is so unclear and it seems many important algorithms are in the appendix which further increases the difficulty of understanding the proposed methods.
