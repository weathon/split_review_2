## Abstract
Multi-agent path finding (MAPF) is the combinatorial problem of planning optimal collision-avoiding paths for multiple agents, with application to robotics, logistics, and transportation. Though many recent learning-based works have focused on large-scale combinatorial problems by guiding their decomposition into sequences of smaller subproblems, the combined spatiotemporal and time-restricted nature of MAPF poses a particular challenge for learning-based guidance of iterative approaches like large neighborhood search (LNS), which is already a state-of-the-art approach for MAPF even without learning. We address this challenge of neural-guided LNS for MAPF by designing an architecture which interleaves convolution and attention to efficiently represent MAPF subproblems, enabling practical guidance of LNS in benchmark settings. We demonstrate the speedup of our method over existing state-of-the-art LNS-based methods for MAPF as well as the robustness of our method to unseen settings. Our proposed method expands the horizon of effective deep learning-guided LNS methods into multi-path planning problems, and our proposed representation may be more broadly applicable for representing path-wise interactions.

### Summary
1The paper proposes to use a deep learning-based framework to select agent subsets to destroy in LNS for the problem of multi-agent path finding (MAPF). Two architectures are proposed: per-subset and multi-subset methods. In experiment, two architectures are tested on five maps of different sizes. In particular, multi-subset performs a lot better than the other approaches.

### Strengths
1. The deep neural network architecture that incorporates spatiotemporal information seems to be a good contribution to the MAPF community. 

2. Empirical results demonstrate the usefulness of the multi-subset architecture.

### Weaknesses
1. The description of the runtime overhead is a bit unclear. I just want to confirm since this is important: when you run your method for 60 seconds, this includes the machine learning inference overhead, right? Though, from the plot it is clear your approach is still the best when the overhead is included.

2. Have you tried generalizing your model to other agent sizes on the same map as training (similar to what Huang et al show in their paper)?

3. It seems unfair to restrict the unguided approach to use only one destroy heuristic, this restriction is made mainly for the benefit of the ML-guided approaches. In the MAPF-LNS paper, it has been shown that the adaptive destroy heuristic is much better for the unguided approach.

### Questions
You mentioned two challenges in the intro with the second one being the overhead of machine learning inference time. Can you elaborate more on how you address this issue with your model?
There is a short paragraph in section 5 that describes some of the engineering details. Do you use other techniques behind the scenes?


You use c_min to compute the gap, which is the solution found by the baseline within 10 minutes. Could this lead to a negative gap when your method finds better solutions within just 1 minute? (though it is unlikely to happen)

### Summary
This paper is a study that utilizes a neural network structure based on 3D convolution to perform multi-agent path finding from a spatial-temporal perspective. Unlike previous research that used linear feature-based machine learning structures, this paper eliminates the feature dependency through 3D convolution-based architecture.

By selecting a subset of k diverse combinations of agents from the entire agent set and comparing the changes in cost, it distinguishes between the multi-subset approach, which aims to find the optimal subset structure, and the per-subset approach, which uses only a single subset. Through testing, it confirms that the multi-subset approach performs better. Furthermore, it also demonstrates performance improvements when comparing with the Unguided method, which extracts subsets using predefined rules, and the traditional Linear method.

### Strengths
By utilizing 3D convolution to consider spatial and temporal information simultaneously, the authors have proposed a method for enabling appropriate path finding for multi-agents without collision in situations involving a large number of agents at higher speed. Furthermore, through the Multi-subset structure, they solve multiple subproblems in a "batch" format, which has the advantage of quickly verifying better paths using this batch structure.

### Weaknesses
The key point of this paper is the rapid resolution of Guiding LNS using 3D convolution without the need for separate feature design in the network structure. However, the author has only applied 3D convolution without providing further theoretical proof or proposing new methods. Therefore, while it is acknowledged that there is an improvement in performance through the application of deep learning structures, the paper has limitations in terms of its overall value.

Additionally, the MAPF the author aimed to address only holds significance when applied to real robots. However, the author tested the proposed method in a simplified simulation environment for performance verification. This aspect restricts the paper's value to the theoretical domain. To give this research more meaning, it would have been beneficial to include tests involving the use of robots in real-world environments, such as logistics robots.

### Questions
Overall, the representation through diagrams is lacking. First, this paper places significant importance on the Time dimension. However, it merely mentions the T dimension without providing any illustrative examples of path changes in this time domain direction, which made it challenging to comprehend. It would have been easier to understand if a few examples of images with different appearances in the T dimension were shown.

Additionally, it would have been helpful for understanding if the paper had diagrammatically represented the network in Figures 2 and 3. The section regarding the network is written with text such as "3D CNN" and "2D CNN," making it difficult to intuitively grasp. Visualizing the network, as done in other papers that use convolution layers, would have aided in conveying the content.

Furthermore, in Section 4.3, two types of transformers are utilized: Light-weight and Heavy-weight. It would be beneficial if the differences between these two structures were more explicitly mentioned.

### Summary
The paper addresses Large Neighborhood Search (LNS) for Multi-Agent Pathfinding (MAPF) using deep learning. Starting with a feasible (but suboptimal) solution, LNS can solve MAPF in an anytime manner by iteratively destroying and repairing parts, i.e., the neighborhood, of the incumbent solution to improve the solution quality over time. The neighborhoods are determined by using some heuristics from the literature. Given a set of neighborhood candidates, the paper proposes to use deep learning to select a suitable neighborhood via score prediction. The deep learning approach exploits the spatio-temporal structure of the MAPF problem by encoding the paths and obstacles in separate tensors, which are processed by a series of 3D and 2D convolutional layers as well as an attention mechanism. The approach performs well compared to state-of-the-art approaches in selected problems and displays some generalization capabilities for maps of the same size.

### Strengths
The paper addresses an interesting application area that is well-known in the AI community.

The paper is well-written and easy to understand.

### Weaknesses
Novelty

The main contribution of the paper is the application of standard deep learning techniques to 2D grid world MAPF. Since tensor encoding of grid worlds is common practice [1,2,3], I do not consider the approach as particularly novel. The architecture is common practice as well (standard convolutional layers and attention), where the application to a new domain seems to be the main contribution to me.

Soundness

As noted in the paper, MAPF-LNS relies on fast operations (like prioritized planning/PP for repairing and linear models for neighborhood scoring) to ensure its success as an anytime algorithm. However, the paper proposes several modifications to the standard/default setting of the MAPF-LNS or MAPF-ML-LNS paper, which actually increase runtime:
- A relatively large model for score prediction compared to simple linear models
- Generation of several neighborhoods at each iteration (which requires the invocation of the destroy heuristics several times)
- Priority-based planning (PBS) for repairing, which is slower than the default PP due to backtracking in the tree search

MAPF-LNS and MAPF-ML-LNS rely on a large number of iterations to achieve a good solution quality. Therefore, I am not sure if the addition of several more expensive operations actually pays off since it should significantly limit the number of possible iterations.

The generalization depends on the map size. A model trained on $32 \times 32$ maps cannot be straightforwardly used on, e.g., $24 \times 64$ maps and is therefore limited.

Significance

The paper evaluates with different hyperparameters than suggested in the original literature [4,5]. Thus, I am
1. uncertain about the fairness of the evaluation and
2. skeptical about the effectiveness, since some changes increase runtime that would limit the number of iterations for sufficient search (see above).

I am also not sure if the modifications used in the deep learning variant are also applied to the linear version. If so, the comparison might be unfair since MAPF-ML-LNS uses some mechanisms, e.g., random neighborhood sizes, that are seemingly important for its success. 

The experiments only report relative numbers, which makes it difficult to relate to the performance reported in prior work, e.g., do the baselines still perform similarly? In that case, fairness could be confirmed, at least.

The evaluation only considers maps with a fixed number of agents; therefore, I have no intuition on how the average/final gap would scale, e.g., with an increasing number of agents.

Evaluation

To decide whether I raise my score or not, I first need to check the following:
- Since MAPF algorithms are generally very implementation-dependent (as stated in the appendix), I need to confirm the validity of the proposed mechanisms by viewing and running the code myself (with a provided trained model).
- I need to see plots or tables with the absolute performance, i.e., the sum of delays, for different numbers of agents per map. The evaluation can be easily done by running the experiments with the neural LNS on the exact same setting as [5] and comparing it with the performance of MAPF-LNS and MAPF-ML-LNS reported in that paper.
- I need to see plots or tables with the number of iterations and success rate per iteration for different time budgets. If the approach was valid, we should see a lower iteration count than the state-of-the-art but a higher success rate.

### Questions
- *“we perform parameter sweeps detailed in Appendix A.2 to first identify the strongest possible configuration for the Unguided baseline”* - The original MAPF-LNS paper already reported extensive hyperparameter experiments to determine good hyperparameters. Why was it necessary to tune them again?
- I wonder why deep learning was only used for neighborhood selection via scoring, while the neighborhood generation is still based on the handcrafted destroy heuristics. Wouldn't it make sense to address the generation via deep learning as well to make the approach more end-to-end [6]?

### Summary
This paper presents a novel approach for leveraging machine learning in multi-agent path planning (MAPF) based on large neighbor search (LNS). Given an initial solution for a MAPF problem instance, LNS selects a subset of agents and optimizes their solution paths, treating the paths of other agents as spatiotemporal obstacles. 

Traditionally, subset selection has relied on heuristic rules or linear models with hand-crafted features. However, the method proposed here integrates a deep neural network into the agent subset selection process. This network predicts the performance gain achievable by selecting a particular subset, using a tensor that encapsulates the agents' current paths, potential shortest paths, and the layout of other obstacles. To manage the computational expense of applying this procedure to various subsets, the proposed method initially extracts features from all agents' paths and predicts the final gain from the feature map slices corresponding to the subset, facilitated by the deep network.

The method's effectiveness has been validated on MAPF problems involving hundreds of agents.

### Strengths
**Clarity**: The paper is very well-written overall, and it accurately positions the proposed method against various related studies.

**Novelty**: The structure of the network used to estimate performance gain for agent subset selection and the method of constructing input tensors are new and intriguing.

**Quality**: Overall, the work is of high quality. The proposed method appears solid and technically sound. The authors have implemented numerous techniques to reduce computational costs, a critical factor in MAPF where execution time is crucial.

**Significance**: The method's significance has been evaluated across multiple MAPF problems, and it has been tested on scenarios involving hundreds of agents. It is commendable that the proposed method can handle hundreds of agents, though I still have some concerns about experimental results, as shown below.

### Weaknesses
Despite the paper's strengths, it could benefit from a more persuasive quantitative evaluation, which would likely enhance its impact.

In Table 1, the difference between the Linear baseline and the proposed method appears relatively marginal. While the proposed method outperforms the Linear baseline in terms of average gap and final gap scores, the Linear baseline requires less runtime overhead. Given this trade-off between computation time and solution quality, how can the benefits of the proposed method be demonstrated?

Additionally, it is unclear what computational resources the proposed method and baseline methods require. The paper suggests that both the proposed method and Linear baseline were tested on a GPU, but it doesn't specify the details of GPU specs required. In practical scenarios, not all environments have access to high-end GPUs, and being able to execute path planning on affordable entry-level GPUs or standard CPUs could be a significant advantage.

### Questions
While the paper is well-written and the proposed method is clearly explained, there are some uncertainties regarding the evaluation experiments.

Specifically, how can we demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method over the Linear baseline? While the solution quality obtained by the proposed method is better, the Linear baseline can run faster instead. Moreover, I wonder if the proposed method may require much more GPU resources than other methods and could be much slower when performed on CPUs.

For example, is it possible to reduce the model capacity for the proposed method so that it can run as approximately fast as the Linear baseline, and compare the solution quality under such conditions?
