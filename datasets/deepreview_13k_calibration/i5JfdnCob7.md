## Abstract
Score-based methods have demonstrated their effectiveness in discovering causal relationships by scoring different causal structures based on their goodness of fit to the data. 
Recently, \citet{huang2018generalized} proposed a generalized score function that can handle general data distributions and causal relationships by modeling the relations in reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS). 
The selection of an appropriate kernel within this score function is crucial for accurately characterizing causal relationships and ensuring precise causal discovery. 
However, the current method involves manual heuristic selection of kernel parameters, making the process tedious and less likely to ensure optimality.
In this paper, we propose a kernel selection method within the generalized score function that automatically selects the optimal kernel that best fits the data. Specifically, we model the generative process of the variables involved in each step of the causal graph search procedure as a mixture of independent noise variables. Based on this model, we derive an automatic kernel selection method by maximizing the marginal likelihood of the variables involved in each search step.
We conduct experiments on both synthetic data and real-world benchmarks, and the results demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms heuristic kernel selection methods.

### Summary
The paper proposes a kernel-based method for causal discovery. The criterion for the dependency estimation is derived through mutual information between noise term and independent variables. The main claim is that kernel hyper-parameters can be optimized by the proposed criterion, which can be seen as the marginal likelihood of the joint distribution. The performance is verified through synthetic and benchmark function.

### Strengths
The hyper-parameter selection for the kernel-based causal discovery is obviously important, and the marginal likelihood based approach provides a reasonable criterion.

### Weaknesses
Differences from Huang et al. (2018) are somewhat weak. Some contents are similar. The specific differences in the model and score function compared to Huang et al. (2018) are not clearly articulated, making it difficult to assess the novelty of the approach. The claim that the proposed method optimizes kernel parameters is not sufficiently emphasized or demonstrated in the experimental results. The practical impact of optimizing these parameters, especially in comparison to using fixed parameters, is unclear. The evaluation lacks a thorough comparison against other kernel-based causal discovery methods, making it difficult to gauge the relative performance of the proposed approach.

### Questions
Although the definition of S is different, Section 4 is quite similar to Huang et al. (2018). Is there any significant technical difference compared with Huang et al. (2018) in this part?

### Summary
This paper emphasizes the importance of selecting proper kernel parameters when training a score-based causal inference model on a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS). The paper illustrates two counter-examples where the existing method may fail and proposes a marginal likelihood maximization principle to maximize the log-likelihood of the joint distribution of all variables. It later empirically shows its superiority on synthetic and real datasets.

### Strengths
This paper highlights the fundamental problem of kernel choices in the field of kernel regression as a part of score-based causal inference.

### Weaknesses
1. This paper is highly related to Huang et al. 2018, while the comparison is not sufficient, which dilutes the marginal contribution of this paper. Some of the comparisons are even misleading to some extent. See the Question part.

2. This paper states the criticality of choosing the right kernel. However, it keeps the original kernel choice as Huang et al. 2018 ("More specifically, we utilize the widely-used Gaussian kernel throughout the paper" on page 5). The lack of in-depth discussions on different choices of kernels severely undermines the completeness of the discussion. The paper should explore the impact of various kernel choices, such as polynomial or Laplacian kernels, and provide a rationale for why the Gaussian kernel was ultimately selected, especially given the claim about the importance of kernel selection. The absence of such an analysis makes the contribution appear limited.

3. This paper seems to have reproduced Huang et al. 2018 incorrectly. The variance parameter of Marginal Likelihood of Huang et al. 2018 is actually trainable ("where the hyperparameter \hat{\sigma}^2_i, as the noise variance, is learned by maximizing the marginal likelihood with gradient methods", page 1555 of https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3219819.3220104), while the authors of this paper state that the width is chosen in a manual and pre-defined way in Huang et al. 2018 and reproduce it as fixed. This misrepresentation of the baseline method casts doubt on the validity of the empirical comparisons and conclusions drawn from them.

### Questions
1. I don't quite follow the first example given in the Motivation section by the authors to attack the weakness of Huang et al. 2018. The authors give an example to show the dependency between the error and the regressor under the RBF kernel, boiling it down to the inadequate model capability to capture the causal relationship. As I understand it, the linear function class on the RKHS induced by RBF kernel is capable to be consistent with any underlying model. For example, Theorem 8 of "On Consistency and Robustness Properties of Support Vector Machines for Heavy-Tailed Distributions" ensures the consistency once the RKHS is dense in the L$_1$ space, while Theorem 4.63 of "Support Vector Machines", https://pzs.dstu.dp.ua/DataMining/svm/bibl/Support_Vector.pdf proves that the RKHS of the RBF kernel is dense in L$_p$ for $p \geq 1$. Instead, an alternative explanation may be the finiteness of samples in practice. Another problem is that the term "correlated" is not equivalent to "dependent"; the error seems to be linearly uncorrelated with the regressor. 

2. I also have some questions on the second example given in the Motivation section. I think if one is going to test the (conditional) independence of X_1 and X_3 given X_2, they should regress X_1 on X_2 and X_3 on X_2 and compute the correlation between the errors according to Huang et al. 2018. I wonder about the explanations of regressing X_2 on X_1 instead and the reason why it leads to a spurious edge between X_1 and X_3.

3. The algorithm proposed by the authors is to maximize the marginal log-likelihood \log p(X = x, PA = pa | f, \sigma_x), while the corresponding term in Huang et al. 2018 is \log p(X = x | PA, f, \sigma_x). What is the difference in their dynamics that leads to potential performance differences needs more discussion？

### Summary
The authors propose a score-based method for causal structure learning. The method is based on a previously introduced method by Huang et al. (2018) which exploits regression in RKHS to capture statistical dependencies between variables and extends it via introducing trainable kernel hyperparameters. In an experimental validation, the authors demonstrate that their approach outperforms the method of Huang and the common PC algorithm.

### Strengths
- The proposed method is convincingly motivated from an information-theoretic point of view where the goal is to minimize the mutual information (MI) between parents of a variable and a noise term.
- The proposed method outperforms other score-based causal discovery methods on synthetic and two real-world data sets.
- The paper is easy to follow.

### Weaknesses
 - The main contribution of the paper seems to be the introduction of a trainable kernel hyper-parameter (instead of previous work that estimates it heuristically from data) and an extended objective that minimizes the MI between parents of a node and noise variables. This seems too incremental as a conference contribution and in my (the reviewer's) opinion is of insufficient originality.
- The paper is extremely close to Huang et al. (2018) [1], both in writing and content as well as methodologically. 
- The experimental section is very thin. Since the method by Huang et al. (2018) has been published, a multitude of other score-based methods have been introduced, against which the author's method should be compared. To name a few:
[2-4] (and references therein) all of which have been evaluated on the Sachs data.
- The paper misses several key references in the field, e.g., [2-4], but several others as well, e.g., [5-7].

### Questions
- In think the paper would benefit from an extended experimental section, e.g., by validating against the methods described above.
- What is the additional computational cost of the method, when a possibly non-convex objective has to be optimized instead of the simpler objective by Huang?

### Summary
This paper presents an extension to score-based causal discovery with RKHS regression. The authors propose utilizing the marginal likelihood in the RKHS of dependent and independent variables as a local score function. Additionally, they suggest optimizing kernel hyperparameters by maximizing the marginal likelihood, aiming to eliminate the necessity of manual parameter selection.
The authors provide proof for the local consistency of the proposed scores, although I am a bit uncertain whether it is limited to Gaussian noise and a Gaussian kernel. In terms of empirical evaluation, the paper offers a comparison between the proposed method and baselines using manually selected kernels and conditional likelihood score functions. This comparison is conducted on both synthetic and real datasets, with the results indicating that the proposed method shows consistent improvements over the baselines.

### Strengths
The strength of this paper lies in its introduction of a methodology for optimizing kernel parameters, which effectively sidesteps the necessity of manual selection. The intuition of this approach is presented in an accessible manner. While the motivation behind the proposed score function could benefit from further elucidation, it is, nonetheless, founded on principled considerations.
The author fortifies the theoretical foundation of the paper with a proof of local consistency for the proposed score. Complementing the theoretical contributions, the paper includes initial empirical experiments that lend support to the claims made, although these might benefit from further expansion and depth.

### Weaknesses
The primary concerns of this approach pertain to the method's comparative effectiveness and certain areas requiring additional clarification.

Initially, the author posits the use of joint marginal likelihood as a score function, highlighting its ability to mitigate overfitting issues commonly associated with conditional likelihood. While this is a crucial point, it could be significantly strengthened by including experimental comparisons with a baseline where kernel hyperparameters are optimized using conditional likelihood. Additionally, a more in-depth exploration of why joint marginal likelihood successfully avoids overfitting—potentially due to the marginalization of 
$f$ would contribute to a clearer understanding of the method’s advantages. A term-by-term comparison between the equations of these two score functions could provide valuable insights into the sources of their respective strengths and weaknesses.
The use of Gaussian process for $f$ is noted as advantageous for preventing overfitting and negating the need for explicit training of f. However, this brings with it a computational complexity of $O(n^3)$?

In terms of empirical validation, the paper focuses on demonstrating the learning of simple bandwidths. To underscore the method’s versatility and general applicability, consideration of more complex kernels, such as deep kernels, would be beneficial.

On the matter of clarity, questions arise regarding the method’s performance under non-Gaussian noise conditions and whether Equation 13 can be derived in such scenarios. Furthermore, for Lemma 1, it would benefit from a clarification on whether a Gaussian kernel is assumed and how the condition in Equation 15 is utilized.

### Questions
Apart from the weakness, I have the following questions:

1. Is Equation 11 the same as the conditional likelihood?

2. You mentioned "maximizing the likelihood function itself may potentially lead to overfitting in structure learning", what do you mean by this? Could you elaborate about it?

3. What do you mean by "mixture of independent noise variables"?

4. Why joint distribution likelihood enforces constraints on the additional parameters? Since this is the key contributions, the author should consider explaining it more clearly.

### Summary
Authors propose a Gaussian-process-based method for Bayesian network structure learning. They develop a score criterion based on marginal likelihood to optimize the kernel hyper parameter. However, the significance of this score criterion is unclear because the proposed idea is similar to that of UAI2000 paper [1], which employs Gaussian processes for structure learning and introduces several score criteria for optimizing the kernel hyper parameter. Since the authors do not even cite this paper, the novelty and the significance are unclear to me.

### Strengths
- The proposed score criterion is founded on the recent idea of generalized score criterion [Huang+; KDD2018].

### Weaknesses
 (A) The difference from the existing Gaussian-process-based framework is unclear.

- As described above, the idea of optimizing kernel hyper parameters in the context of Bayesian network structure learning has already been developed more than 20 years ago.
- What are the key differences from UAI2000 paper [1]? 
- I am not sure, but isn’t the proposed score function in Eq. (13) very similar to that of [1]?

(B) Notations are unclear and seem inconsistent, which makes the paper hard to follow.

- In particular, the notations around Eq. (1) are unclear. Noise $\varepsilon$ is introduced without definition. Is it a function in RKHS, i.e., $\varepsilon \in \mathcal{H}_X$? If so, state it clearly. Definition of $k_x$ is unclear: $x$ is a realization of random variable $X$? What is the relationship with kernel feature mapping $\phi_X$? $\phi_X(x) = k_x$? Is it defined in the same way as Section 3.1?

- (In causal inference, usually, the parent set of random variable is denoted by e.g., $PA_X$, not $PA$, to clearly state the child variable.)

- The connection between Eqs. (3) and (4) is unclear. I believe that authors express $\phi_i(x)$ as the i-th element of (possibly) infinite-dimensional feature vector $\phi_X(x)$, where $\phi_X \in \mathcal{H}_X$. However, they say that $g(x) = \phi_i(x)$ also belongs to the same RKHS $\mathcal{H}_X$. What does this mean? Please clearly define what indices $i$ and $j$ mean.

- In Eq. (6), there is no definition or description about parameter $\theta$. What kind of parameters do the authors consider?


Typo: See the beginning of Section 2 carefully.
