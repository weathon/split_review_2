## Abstract
In this paper, we study how the granularity of pretraining labels affects the generalization of deep neural networks in image classification tasks. 
We focus on the ``fine-to-coarse'' transfer learning setting, where the pretraining label space is more fine-grained than that of the target problem. 
Empirically, we show that pretraining on the \textit{leaf} labels of ImageNet21k produces better transfer results on ImageNet1k than pretraining on other coarser granularity levels, \textit{which supports the common practice used in the community}.
Theoretically, we explain the benefit of fine-grained pretraining by proving that, for a data distribution satisfying certain hierarchy conditions, 1) coarse-grained pretraining \textit{only} allows a neural network to learn the ``common'' or ``easy-to-learn'' features well, while 2) fine-grained pretraining helps the network learn the ``rarer'' or ``fine-grained'' features in addition to the common ones, thus improving its accuracy on \textit{hard} downstream test samples in which common features are missing or weak in strength.
Furthermore, we perform comprehensive experiments using the label hierarchies of iNaturalist 2021 and observe that the following conditions, in addition to proper choice of label granularity, enable the transfer to work well \textit{in practice}: 1) the pretraining dataset needs to have a \textit{meaningful label hierarchy}, and 2) the pretraining and target label functions need to \textit{align} well.

### Summary
The paper considers the setup when models are first pretrained on fine-grained classes and then finetuned (transferred) to a dataset with more coarse-grained labels. They provide both theoretical and experimental contributions.

Theoretically, they prove that 1) coarse-grained pretraining only allows a neural network to learn the “common” or “easy-to-learn” features well, and 2) fine-grained pretraining helps the network learn the “rarer” or “fine-grained” features, thus improving its accuracy on hard downstream test samples.

Empirically, they show that pre-training on ImageNet-21k leaves (and then transferring to ImageNet-1k) is more beneficial than pretraining on other coarser granularity levels. They also experiment with iNaturalist, noting the importance of meaningful label hierarchies and good source-target label alignment.

### Strengths
* I believe the paper makes valid theoretical contributions which are partially supported experimentally.
* The paper is easy to read and follow and the main takeaway messages easy to understand.

### Weaknesses
I am not totally sure that the idealized setup considered here makes much sense in practice. For example, Jain et al. (2023) claim that fine-grained labels are often hard and expensive to obtain and going in the coarse --> fine-grained direction is equally valuable. Moreover, when pretraining on large-scale datasets, (e.g., Mahajan et al. 2018), I believe it is often not clear what the label hierarchy is (or if it even exists).

The other concern that I have is related to the transition from theoretical contributions to empirical experiments. I am not sure if the experiments on ImageNet and iNaturalist are sufficient to support the presented theory (could you please elaborate a bit on that if that is the case). One suggestion (that should be doable and easy to implement) would be to generate synthetic data and confirm that Theorems 4.1 and 4.2 hold on it, exploring and explaining the impact of the different parameters needed by your theory.

### Questions
Q1: Just to confirm: When fine-tuning, you do fine-tune the whole network, i.e., you do not keep the feature extractor fixed. It is a bit surprising to me that regardless of the pretraining granularity (e.g. on Fig. 1 and Table 1), the fine-tuned model does not catch up with the baseline training, assuming that sufficient time for finetuning is given.

Q2: Is the granularity solely determined by the number of classes or number of classes AND class level in hierarchy? Do we assume that all classes in a given (pre)training dataset are at the same hierarchy level? What if we mix classes from different levels in the class hierarchy during the pretraining?

Q3: Could you please provide some intuition why you need the different patches and how do they relate to real-world image inputs? If I understand correctly, it is the same intuition as in Fig. 2 and the different patches represent different parts of the image (which may contain different common/rare features).

Q4: If I understand correctly, the theorems require that the neural networks are trained only on "easy" samples. Why is that the case? If it is indeed needed, how can you distinguish between easy and hard samples during training?

Q5: In the paper you perform experiments with ViT and ResNets. Based on your theory, in what way is the model important and what is its impact on the training? I.e., what properties are desirable for it?

Q6: On iNaturalist (Fig. 4) why do you only report validation errors but omit the final accuracies? Are the accuracies consistent with the shown figure?

Minor: In your examples (Sec 4) you consider mainly binary task (i.e., 2 coarse level classes). Can the theory and the theorems be extended to the multi-class setup?

### Summary
This paper delves into the impact of pre-training label granularity on the generalization capabilities of deep neural networks (DNNs) in image classification tasks. It explores the 'fine-to-coarse' transfer learning scenario, where pre-training labels are more detailed than those of the target task. The study finds that pre-training with the most detailed labels from ImageNet21k leads to improved transfer performance on ImageNet1k, a practice commonly adopted within the community. The paper offers a theoretical perspective, suggesting that fine-grained pre-training enables DNNs to learn not just common features but also those that are rare or specific, thereby enhancing accuracy on more challenging test samples that lack strong common features. Extensive experiments with iNaturalist 2021's label hierarchies indicate that effective transfer requires a meaningful label hierarchy and alignment between pre-training and target label functions.

# Post-rebuttal
Based on the current limited empirical evidence and all I suggested experiments are promised to be done in the future work, I'd like to lower my score. 

However, I'd like to emphasize to AC, my evaluation is based on the empirical evidence only.

### Strengths
I believe the studied direction is important to understand the transferability of learning representation which corresponding to the goal of ICLR. The methodology employed in the study is theoretically driven, and it indicates a rigorous mathematical approach to understanding the effect of label granularity on DNNs.

The experimental setup is well-detailed, using widely recognized datasets such as ImageNet and iNaturalist. The results section seems to provide theoretical backing with definitions and theorems regarding SGD behavior.

### Weaknesses
 ***Clarification***: my assessment are mainly focused on the empirical evidence not the theoretical conclusion.

The empirical experimental results are not surprised to me, as much more fine-grained labels help to gain stronger transferable performance. I believe there are two points could be improved:

- Testing on more datasets. The current results are verified on a single cross-dataset pair which not hold for other dataset pairs. There are some datasets are studied in low-shot learning could be used in this sceneries.

- Studying how to obtain the hierarchy/fine-grained labels for unlabeled datasets. It's hard, costly, and usually "impossible" to obtain the used hierarchy for large-scale dataset; therefore, it's important to have discussion and analysis here. The paper currently provided a simple study on Section 5.2. However, I expect more analysis such as how should we decide class-level for unlabeled dataset. A probably related paper here is Large-Scale Few-Shot Learning: Knowledge Transfer With Class Hierarchy.

### Questions
You should use \citep not \cite in most place of citations.

Please address all the mentioned points above. 

As I review this paper mainly based on the empirical evidence, I am good to elevate the rating if the concerns around empirical evidence are eased.

### Summary
This paper studies the influence of pre-training label granularity on the transfer learning performance on the image classification task. The authors prove that pretraining on leaf/fine-grained labels achieves better transfer results than pre-training on root/coarse labels. The authors provide both theoretical and experimental proof.

### Strengths
1. The authors have provided both theoretical and experimental proofs, reinforcing the credibility of their arguments.
2. The drawn conclusion offers guidance for transfer learning, making the paper an engaging read.

### Weaknesses
1. Does the scale of the dataset influence the final performance? As the number of classes increases, the dataset scale typically expands. The authors may consider maintaining a consistent dataset scale—for instance, by having diverse classes with few samples each or limited classes with ample samples—to further substantiate their claims.
2. In Definition 4.2 regarding 'hard samples', this paper characterizes them based on the introduction of random noise. However, merely adding random noise doesn't necessarily make a sample challenging to classify. Learning with noise is different from learning with hard samples. Prior research typically defines hard samples as those with significant classification loss, e.g., boot-strapping or hard negative mining.

### Questions
1. About Figure 4: why does the validation error increase for CLIP clustering when the number of classes increases?
2. It is suggested to use \citep rather than \cite in the latex
