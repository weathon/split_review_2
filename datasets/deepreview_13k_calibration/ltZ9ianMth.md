## Abstract
Time series forecasting is an important and forefront task in many real-world applications.
 However, most of time series forecasting techniques assume that the training data is clean without anomalies. This assumption is unrealistic since the collected time series data can be contaminated in practice. The forecasting model will be inferior if it is directly trained by time series with anomalies. Thus it is essential to develop methods to automatically learn a robust forecasting model from the contaminated data. In this paper, we first statistically define three types of anomalies, then theoretically and experimentally analyze the \emph{loss robustness} and \emph{sample robustness} when these anomalies exist. Based on our analyses, we propose a simple and efficient algorithm to learn a robust forecasting model. Extensive experiments show that our method is highly robust and outperforms all existing approaches.

### Summary
This paper presents an algorithm for time series forecasting in the presence of anomalies, together with some theory and experimental results.

### Strengths
1. The paper explores a bit of variability in various hyper parameters and dataset normalization---more than the typical submission. Although, as I point out in weaknesses, some more information is needed.
2. The proofs are clearer than the typical ML paper.

### Weaknesses
1. The ranges of hyper parameters, noise scales, and stds, and other variables related to normalizing the data and running the algorithms need to be clearly identified. Specifically, the paper needs to specify the exact ranges explored for parameters like the noise scale (epsilon) for different anomaly types (constant, missing, Gaussian), and how these relate to the standard deviation of the data. Furthermore, for the algorithm itself, the ranges for parameters such as lambda and tau need to be explicitly stated, along with a justification for the chosen ranges.
2. In table 7, and some others where noise rates are varied, show that the lowest noise rate is 0.1. That is a rather high rate. The noise rate needs to be decreased to at least 0.01 and maybe lower depending on the dataset. It is important to test the algorithm's performance under more realistic noise conditions, where anomalies are less frequent. The current minimum noise rate might mask potential weaknesses of the proposed method when dealing with subtle anomalies.
3. The characteristics of the chosen datasets need to be described. Hopefully they cover a large range of variability, relationships between input variables, fraction of dataset that have anomalies, etc. The description should include details about the statistical properties of the datasets, such as stationarity, seasonality, and the presence of trends, as these can significantly influence the performance of time series forecasting algorithms. The fraction of anomalies in the real world datasets also needs to be specified.

Minor weakness:
1. "Proposation" -> "Proposition."

### Questions
1. In section 3, the fourth line, I suspect that $T-\alpha$ should be $T/\alpha$. Is that correct?
2. [Yoon 2022a] and [Yoon 2022b] are the same citation.
3. In appendix B, the lines after the first one seem to have been cut off and are hidden behind figure 2.
4. For table 12, what computer system was used for training?

### Summary
This article presents a model for forecasting time series containing anomalies. The article begins by specifying the three main types of anomalies of interest and then introduces the theorems that will be used for the proposed algorithm. These theorems are primarily proofs of the robustness of Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) in the presence of anomalies. The proposed algorithm mainly involves filtering to detect potential anomalies and penalizing the cost for windows containing these anomalies in order to not consider them. Experiments are finally conducted to demonstrate the method's efficiency in various settings

### Strengths
* The state of the art is well presented, the work presented is well contextualized, and the theoretical aspects are well introduced and explained
* The experiments are numerous, they are entirely reproducible, and the appendices contain very useful information.
* The issue of anomalies is well introduced, formally presented correctly, and intriguingly

### Weaknesses
 * The first weakness of the article is the presentation of the main algorithm's idea. Its explanation is spread across several pages, and one has to wait until the 6th page to get an idea of how the algorithm will work, even though the idea itself is rather simple: identifying anomalies in the signal and applying very weak penalties to the cost in the corresponding region. It would be much easier to read the article if even a brief description were introduced very early on to understand the relevance of the different theorems formulated.

* Regarding novelty, the main theorems seem to be adapted quite directly from other works, so there isn't much novelty there. Furthermore, the idea of filtering and training on robust windows is not very new either, and the filtering method is also pre-existing. Apart from adapting the framework for anomalies to time series, there isn't a significant novelty.

* Regarding Section 5, which analyzes the effect of the position of anomalies on forecasting, it seems quite normal that anomalies near the end of the signal disrupt the prediction more than anomalies at the beginning. The system's state is disrupted, making forecasting more challenging. In contrast, if the anomalies are at the beginning, the model has time to stabilize on the 'correct' values.

* However, the biggest weakness of the article lies in the experiments, which do not include any modern time series forecasting baselines (such as PatchTST, DLinear, Autoformer, ...). From a few quick experiments I conducted using the authors' code, DLinear seems to easily outperform the proposed model on the noisy data. This raises the question of the method's relevance if state-of-the-art models do not struggle with the anomalies considered by the authors. Of course, I may be mistaken, but in any case, it would be helpful to have the performance of state-of-the-art algorithms on this kind of problem to understand the challenges posed by the envisaged anomalies.

### Questions
Can you provide experiments with the usual baseline of the state of the art ? (PatchTST, Dlinear, Autoformer, Pyformer, ...)

### Summary
The paper introduces a method that combines the learning with noisy labels (LNL) technique and time series forecasting with anomalies (TSFA). The key distinction is that LNL deals with label noise in the target variable Y, while TSFA handles noise in both the input variable X and the target variable Y, making TSFA more complex than LNL. The authors categorize anomalies into three types: constant, missing, and Gaussian type anomalies. They analyze the loss robustness when anomalies affect Y and the sample robustness when anomalies affect X.
The authors propose a method called RobustTSF that integrates LNL and TSFA. Specifically, they provide a method for selecting time series with minimal anomalies. The process involves computing the trend of a given time series, denoted as S, and constructing a triplet D = (X, S, Y). An anomaly score A is defined as the difference between X and S, with an associated weight w. After calculating the anomaly scores for all samples, the authors design the final loss function for RobustTSF, employing the mean absolute error (MAE) as a more robust loss function. They utilize the anomaly score to measure the degree of anomalies in the time series data and perform appropriate filtering.
Importantly, this method does not rely on any specific deep learning model and can be compatible with any DNN model for time series forecasting.

### Strengths
1.Originality: This article presents a novel method that integrates LNL and TSFA, representing the first application of LNL to the domain of time series prediction. This pioneering approach demonstrates significant originality and provides valuable guidance for future research directions.
2.Quality: This article exhibits high quality as it presents a well-supported argument, effectively connecting LNL and TSFA from a new perspective, allowing readers to comprehend the rationale behind the author's design choices. Furthermore, the author validates the effectiveness of this approach through various experiments, enhancing the overall quality of the work.
3.Clarity: The author demonstrates exceptional clarity through a meticulously organization, guiding readers step by step in understanding the algorithm. Moreover, the author employs precise terminology, minimizing ambiguity and ensuring a clear and unambiguous understanding of the concepts presented.
4.Significance: The author's work holds great significance as they propose a novel framework for addressing anomalies in time series data, applicable to any forecasting model. This contribution provides a fresh direction for researchers in the field of time series prediction, offering an alternative approach to further enhance prediction accuracy. The implications of this work are of paramount importance to the community, as it opens up new avenues for exploration and advancement in the field.

### Weaknesses
1. I noticed that in your experimental section, you used a large input length to predict a relatively small output length. For example, in section 7.2, you used an input length of 96 to predict an output data of length [4, 8]. However, for time series forecasting tasks, the typical setting is an input length of 12 and an output length of 12. Therefore, I am unsure if your model is applicable to this setting. I recommend conducting an additional set of experiments where the input series has a length of 12 and the output series has a length of 12, in order to assess the performance of your model in this specific scenario.
2. In Section 6.2, I propose that additional elucidation should be provided: Why does the substitution of squared terms with absolute values in Equation (4) lead to an improvement in robustness? The current explanation lacks sufficient detail on the mathematical properties that cause this change to improve robustness, particularly in the context of anomaly detection and time series forecasting.
3. Please note the spelling error: "k-the" below Equation (5) should be corrected to "k-th."

### Questions
1.In Theorem 1, why is it necessary for the anomaly rate to be less than 0.5?
2.In your method, you mentioned three types of anomalies, and your analysis of loss robustness indicates that MAE is robust to all three types of anomalies, while MSE is only robust to one of them. Can we understand from this that MAE is more suitable as a loss function than MSE in all situations? Are there any criteria to evaluate the robustness of other loss functions?

### Summary
The paper studies time series forecasting problem in the presence of anomalies, a setting where the difficulty comes from the fact that anomalies produce noise in the labels and in the input data at the same time. To deal with anomalies in the labels, authors propose to use Learn with Noisy Labels (LNL) framework and present analysis of LNL in the regression setting. They also introduce a heuristic approach to deal with anomalies in the input data by discarding samples where anomalies appear towards the end of an input sample. They combine both techniques in RobustTSF algorithm and compare it on two datasets with existing state-of-the-art approaches.

### Strengths
## Originality 
* The analysis of mean absolute and mean square errors in LNL regression setting for 3 presented types of anomalies is novel
* The sample selection technique to avoid samples with late anomalies is novel
## Quality 
* Authors compare their method to diverse set of baselines
* Empirical evaluation shows the advantage of presented techniques
## Clarity 
Presentation is clear and main ideas are explained well
## Significance
I assess the paper to be of limited significance: while the presented method uses novel ideas in the context of time series forecasting with anomalies, evaluation is limited to two datasets with very similar properties and the limitations of the presented approach are not discussed.

### Weaknesses
 * Hyper parameter tuning of RobustTSF is missing: it’s never discussed how \tau of 0.3 was chosen and Figure 5 suggests that choice of \tau would affect the comparison to the baselines. 
* Overall limitations of the approach are not discussed. When does it break? What implicit assumptions are made? What time series aspect one would need to consider to choose this approach over another in practice?
* No confidence bounds in the experimental results makes it hard to judge the significance of the evaluation results
* Only two datasets of very similar properties are used for evaluation, which again limits the assessment of method applicability

Overall, my main concern is with the evaluation - choice of hyperparameters for the method and the lack of confidence bounds.

### Questions
* Proposition 2: the statement is not clear: does it hold under the conditions of Theorem 1? If yes, then the statement is obsolete, if not, then where does C_x comes from?  
* Section 6.2: why notations change from z to x? It’s not clear what x is and how they are different from z
* End of page 6: while RobustTSD does not need a pre-trained DNN, it relies on limited trend estimation precedure in eq. (4) that implicitly assumes the smooth behavior of the time series. I’d see this as a disadvantage that one will have to adapt eq. (4) in unclear way to different datasets, while DNN would adopt automatically via pre-training. 
* It’s great that authors look at scenario where the test set contains anomalies as well as this is the most realistic case. However, this sections misses a comparison of RobustTSF to other approaches on the test set with anomalies. It would be very relevant for practical applications if this evaluation is expanded.
* Ablation study section: what is presented is not an ablation study, but rather a hyperparameter tuning on the test dataset. An ablation study would, for example, consider the effect of LNL and sample selection separately, i.e. what happens when one applies only LNL or only sample selection. 
* Parameter \tau seems to be scale dependent and while appendix mentions that the time series are normalized, the main text omits this detail.
