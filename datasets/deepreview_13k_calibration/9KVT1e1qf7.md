## Abstract
Large Language Models (LLMs), such as LLaMA and T5, have shown exceptional performance across various tasks through fine-tuning. Although low-rank adaption (LoRA) has emerged to cheaply fine-tune these LLMs on downstream tasks, their deployment is still hindered by the vast model scale and computational costs. 
Post-training model pruning offers a way to compress LLMs. However, the current pruning methods designed for LLMs are not compatible with LoRA. This is due to their utilization of unstructured pruning on LLMs, impeding the merging of LoRA weights, or their dependence on the gradients of pre-trained weights to guide pruning, which can impose significant memory overhead.
To this end, we propose LoRAPrune, a new framework that delivers an accurate structured pruned model in a highly memory-efficient manner. Specifically, we first design a LoRA-guided pruning criterion, which uses the weights and gradients of LoRA, rather than the gradients of pre-trained weights for importance estimation. We subsequently integrate this criterion into an iterative pruning process, effectively removing redundant channels and heads. 
Extensive experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of our LoRAPrune over existing approaches on the LLaMA series models.
At a 50\% compression rate, LoRAPrune demonstrates superior performance over LLM-Pruner, achieving a reduction in perplexity by 4.81 on WikiText2 and 3.46 on PTB, while also decreasing memory usage by 52.6\%.
Besides, LoRAPrune also matches semi-structural pruning across multiple LLMs, proving its wide applicability.

### Summary
This paper proposes a new pruning technique, called LoRAPrune, to perform structural pruning on the target LLM and its LoRA adapters at the same time. Specifically, this paper first proposes a LoRA-guided criterion to indicate the weight importance of LLMs, which works better with LoRA. The proposed LoRAPrune pruning technique is built based on this criterion, which unifies PEFT with pruning. Experiment results show that the proposed method achieves better accuracy compared with existing pruning techniques on LLMs.

### Strengths
- The target domain of improving the efficiency of LLMs during inference, especially their compatibility with the SOTA tuning methods (e.g., LoRA adapter).
- The proposed method has the potential to alleviate the memory overhead during pruning, which can potentially enable the proposed pruning technique on a wider range of devices and applications. 
- The achieved performance improvement over the baseline methods is promising.

### Weaknesses
After reading the paper, I have the following concerns and would like to hear from the authors on their justification. I would like to consider revising my rating based on the authors' feedback. 
- To the best of my understanding, the novelty of this paper is limited. Specifically, there are some existing explorations on identifying the dependency during structural pruning to maximally preserve the performance after pruning, such as LLM-Pruner. In this paper, the key difference is that the authors propose to shift the computation of dependency from backbone weight in LLMs to LoRA adapters in LLMs. The author may want to further address the novelty here. 
- In Table 1, the authors claim that LLM-Pruner does not support tuning. However, as LLM-Pruner also uses a structural pruning technique, it is also compatible with LoRA adapters, which is indicated in the abstract and experiment sections in LLM-Pruner. The authors may want to further justify their claim. 
- In Figure 3, the author missed an important baseline, LLM-Pruner. It would help the authors to better understand the performance of the proposed LoRAPruner by adding the LLM-Pruner baseline in the figure.

### Summary
Large pre-trained models (LPMs) like LLaMA and GLM excel in diverse tasks when fine-tuned. While low-rank adaption (LoRA) can cost-effectively fine-tune LPMs, the vast model scale and computational demands remain challenges. Current pruning techniques for LPMs aren't compatible with LoRA due to issues like their use of unstructured pruning and reliance on the gradients of pre-trained weights. Addressing this, the paper introduces "LoRAPrune," a framework that prunes efficiently using a LoRA-guided criterion and an iterative procedure. This approach avoids computing gradients of the pre-trained weights, ensuring more memory-efficient and accurate models. Tests reveal that LoRAPrune outperforms other methods, reducing memory usage and improving performance.

### Strengths
- The authors study the compelling research area of integrating LoRA with pruning methods, meticulously examining the challenges inherent in this combination.

- The proposed framework allows for the concurrent application of structured pruning and LoRA.

- The pruning criteria can be guided by LoRA principles which are novel and useful.

- Comprehensive experimental outcomes using LLaMA models are presented.

### Weaknesses
 - Upon examining Table 2, several concerns arise regarding the experimental results. Notably, when juxtaposed with the PPL of LLaMA-7B, there's a marked degradation in PPL. Even at a relatively modest 20% pruning rate, the PPL increase is evident. One has to question if there are scenarios where such a pronounced PPL drop would be deemed acceptable.

- Furthermore, the results from WANDA also indicate a significant PPL degradation, which seems to contradict the assertions made in the WANDA paper.

- The 50% pruning rate appears to present substantial challenges. What is the overarching conclusion here? Is the implication that a 50% pruning rate might be overly ambitious? Alternatively, do the authors consider the observed performance drop at this rate to be inconsequential?

- For a more comprehensive understanding, it would be beneficial to have the PPL and other metrics as reported by contemporaneous studies.

### Summary
The paper introduces a new framework called LoRAPrune, which aims to efficiently compress LLMs. Existing pruning methods designed for LPMs are not compatible with low-rank adaptation (LoRA), which aims to reduce computational costs. LoRAPrune addresses this by using a LoRA-guided pruning criterion that relies on LoRA weights and gradients rather than the gradients of pre-trained weights, reducing memory overhead. It also introduces a structured iterative pruning procedure to remove redundant channels and heads. Experimental results demonstrate that LoRAPrune outperforms existing approaches, achieving a 50% compression rate while reducing perplexity on datasets like WikiText2 and PTB and significantly reducing memory usage.

### Strengths
- The presentation is commendably clear, and all the figures in the paper are of high quality.

- The derivations presented in Section 3.2 are particularly intriguing. The authors employ a LoRA-guided criterion to effectively circumvent the need to store the entire $\frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial\mathbf{W}}$, resulting in significant memory cost savings compared to existing pruning methods, such as LLM-Pruner.

- The evaluation conducted in this paper is impressively thorough.

### Weaknesses
My primary concern regarding the paper pertains to the results presented in Table 2, which clearly indicate a significant degradation in Perplexity (PPL). Such a pronounced reduction in PPL threatens the practical utility of the model. When evaluated with a context window of 2048, a PPL degradation of just 1 already surpasses the performance differential between LLaMA-13B and LLaMA-30B. A mere PPL degradation of approximately 0.2 can account for the disparities between LLaMA and Llama-2. Although the PPL values in the paper might not align with the precise window size I used, but a PPL degradation of 4 unquestionably renders the resulting model inconsequential.

Moreover, I find that the overall methodology is very similar to LLM-Pruner. The only distinction lies in the methodology for computing importance metrics. However, I have reservations about the pivotal significance of the 'starting point' for fine-tuning. Concurrent research, such as Wanda and Sheared-Llama, has demonstrated that fine-tuning a pruned model on a relatively extensive corpus (e.g., RedPajama) diminishes the disparities between LLM-Pruner and more sophisticated, optimization-based pruning criteria (refer to the Sheared-Llama's appendix for more insights). Hence, I am skeptical about the true value of the proposed method, especially when the pruned model is meticulously fine-tuned. Notably, the memory constraints of LLM-Pruner can be effectively mitigated through off-loading, such as utilizing CPU memory to store certain gradients.

Disclaimer: I am not requesting the authors to directly compare their work with Wanda and Sheared-Llama, as these papers have been simultaneously submitted to the same venue. Nonetheless, the insights and findings presented in these two papers may offer valuable context for my assessment of this paper.

### Questions
Kindly address my comments under the 'Weaknesses' section. My primary concern regarding this paper is the usability of the resulting models. The PPL degradation from pruning 25% weights is even larger than the performance difference between 13B and 30B models in my opinion. In this context, all speedup and memory-saving metrics appear to lack significance.

### Summary
The paper introduces LoRAPrune, a novel framework designed to efficiently compress large pre-trained models (LPMs) for cost-effective inference. LoRAPrune achieves this by introducing a LoRA-guided pruning criterion that utilizes weights and gradients from LoRA, avoiding the memory overhead associated with gradients from pre-trained weights, and a structured iterative pruning procedure.

### Strengths
+ The proposed LoRAPrune can achieve practical speedup by introducing the structured sparsity onto the pre-trained large model and the LoRA update.
+ The proposed approach can efficiently guide the pruning process using the LoRA-guided gradient.
+ This paper unifies the parameter-efficient fine-tuning and structured pruning, efficiently saving memory usage.
+ Experiments show that this method works well in practice, and the figures are easy to understand.

### Weaknesses
 - This paper lacks the motivation why the LoRA can considered as the guidance. Instead, the authors just directly show it can estimate the importance of each parameter. It is encouraged to illustrate why this criterion is created. More explanations and analysis are needed.
- The equations in this paper are unclear and not easy to understand, as there are a lot of abnormal superscripts and subscripts.

### Questions
What is the reason why the LoRA-guided creation is better than other pruning criteria? What is the motivation?

### Summary
This paper presents a LoRA-guided structured pruning method for large-scale pre-trained language models. Unlike the previous method that requires gradients w.r.t the entire model parameters, the proposed LoRA-guided criterion only needs to compute the gradients w.r.t up and down low-rank matrices, which can be very lightweight. Based on the method, the authors propose LoRAPrune, which progressively prunes unimportant weights. The experimental results demonstrate that it outperforms the previous LLM-pruning algorithms, given the similar compression rate, while also reducing memory usage.

### Strengths
1. LoRA-guided weight importance criterion seems original and interesting
2. Experimental results look very promising, especially when combined with fine-tuning
3. Reduced the resource requirement to do pruning and fine-tuning would constitute a good practical contribution

### Weaknesses
1. This paper can benefit from better writing and presentation. A few examples are the following.
1-a.  More details might have been helpful. e.g., what does numbers in Figure 2 mean?
1-b. Abuse of notation, In eq. (6), I_ij, ‘ij’ subscript indicates the index of the matrix I, but in eq 11, I_g, here ‘g’ means the index of the group.
1-c. top-s% has not been formally defined. is it a set?
1-d. In eq 11, I_g \in top-s% -> this notation seems mathematically wrong. I_g probably denotes the importance score.
1-e. In algorithm 1, you calculated I |_t, but it was never used. I think you missed ‘|_t’ in 13th line (inside the double for loop)
1-f. In eq 4, superscripts were used to represent Query, Key, and Value weights. However in algorithm 1, the superscript was used to denote the layer.

2. The authors claim that the proposed method approximates the importance of the weights. Could you present any supporting experimental results on how accurate LoRA-guided importance approximations are? And, following up on this, does better approximation yield better performance eventually?

3. It seems ‘\hat{I}’ has the same dimension as the model weights W? Then, in terms of memory usage (at least if we strictly follow the algorithm 1), is the same as computing the gradients w.r.t. W?

4. It would be helpful for authors to provide ‘theoretical FLOPs’ compared to dL/dW-based importance criterion.
