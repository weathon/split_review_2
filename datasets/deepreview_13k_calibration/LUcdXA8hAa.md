## Abstract
Unbiased Learning to Rank (ULTR) aims to train unbiased ranking models from biased click logs, by explicitly modeling a generation process for user behavior and fitting click data based on examination hypothesis. Previous research found empirically that the true latent relevance is mostly recoverable through click fitting. However, we demonstrate that this is not always achievable, resulting in a significant reduction in ranking performance. This research investigates the conditions under which relevance can be recovered from click data in the first principle. We initially characterize a ranking model as \textit{identifiable} if it can recover the true relevance up to a scaling transformation, a criterion sufficient for the pairwise ranking objective. Subsequently, we investigate an equivalent condition for identifiability, articulated as a graph connectivity test problem: the recovery of relevance is feasible if and only if the \textit{identifiability graph} (IG), derived from the underlying structure of the dataset, is connected. The presence of a disconnected IG may lead to degenerate cases and suboptimal ranking performance. To tackle this challenge, we introduce two methods, namely \textit{node intervention} and \textit{node merging}, designed to modify the dataset and restore the connectivity of the IG. Empirical results derived from a simulated dataset and two real-world LTR benchmark datasets not only validate our proposed theory but also demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods in alleviating data bias when the relevance model is unidentifiable.

### Rating Number
5

### Confidence
4: You are confident in your assessment, but not absolutely certain. It is unlikely, but not impossible, that you did not understand some parts of the submission or that you are unfamiliar with some pieces of related work.

### Summary
In this paper, the authors explore if or when the true relevance can be recovered from click data. Overall, it is a solid paper. My concern lies in whether and how can this approach apply to the existing unbiased learning-to-rank framework that developed from the examination hypothesis. Or, how the proposed framework incorporates current ranking models. Also, it would be better to compare this work against more recently proposed existing unbiased learning-to-rank algorithms. Overall, I give a weak rejection. If the authors would clarify the above concerns, I will be happy to raise my score.

### Strengths
1. It is an interesting and important topic to investigate when the true relevance can be recovered from click data.
2. I like the theoretical analysis in this paper (i.e., Sections 3 and 4).
3. They have conducted experiments on Yahoo! and Istella-S datasets, verifying the performance of the proposed model.

### Weaknesses
1. It lacks recently proposed methods as the baselines.
2. It would be interesting to discuss the difference between the proposed method and the existing approaches based on the examination hypothesis.
3. For an unbiased learning-to-rank algorithm, there is always a ranking algorithm base. It is not clear how the proposed model incorporates the existing ranking models.

### Questions
It is essential to evaluate if or when the true relevance can be recovered from click data. I like this idea very much. However, in the context of unbiased learning-to-rank, there should be a ranking function (often referred to as biased), and then the core goal of unbiased learning-to-rank is to build a debiasing method that can be incorporated into the biased ranking models. After reading this paper multiple times, I consider that it is not clear how this approach can be applied to existing ranking models. Also, in the experiment part, the authors only compare no debias and a simple examine hypothesis method. I highly recommend the authors compare and discuss the connections to existing unbiased learning-to-rank algorithms such as “Unbiased Learning to Rank with Unbiased Propensity Estimation” and “An Unbiased Pairwise Learning-to-Rank Algorithm”. Therefore, I would like to give a weak rejection.  If the authors would clarify the above concerns, I will be happy to raise my score.

### Summary
The paper investigates the problem of position bias in the task of Unbiased Learning to Rank. It first introduces the widespread concern of biased user logs and the consequent appriximation error in most of the commonly used ranking models. With a clear problem setup and definition of identifiability, the author states the conditions under which the true relevances can be extracted from click data. Particularly, the paper converts the identifiability problem into a graph connectivity problem. Based on the connectivity problem,  the authors further come up two new approaches to deal with “unidentifiable” datasets and optimize the ranking models using structures of the graph. Experiments are conducted to prove the validity of the graph conversion, the performance of new approaches, and the application to the real-world datasets.

### Strengths
S1: As one of its major contributions, this paper tansfers the identifiability of a ULTR task to the connectivity of a graph constructed based on the dataset. This equivalence is useful in that tasks related to a graph usually have more efficient computations, nicer properties, and more intuition-based understandings. The work also allows for more explainability in the field of ULTR and thus simplifies difficult questions.

S2: This paper proposes two novel methods, node intervention and node merging, to bridge the “unidentifiability gap” by utilizing the graph properties. These two methods are theoretically supported and empirically verified.

### Weaknesses
W1: Since the theory of this paper relies heavily on the examination hypothesis, the graph-equivalence idea is not generalizeable to other general hypotheses on the dataset.

W2: Since the methods are still propensity-based, there are a plethora of such ranking models. It would be fair game if the paper uses such methods as baselines to strengthen the validity of the proposed methods.

W3: When choosing the bias factors, we can choose either fewer factors, which makes the graph more likely to be connected, or more factors, which accounts for more bias but poses a more disconnected graph. It would be great if there is any discussion on the tradeoff and the corresponding performance of the two proposed methods. In addition, assume that each feature x and bias factor t are independently and uniformly chosen to construct the dataset D is nearly impossible in practice.

### Questions
Q1: In the real world, the dataset is mostly sparse and thus there might be a large number of connected components in IG. How much does the performance of the two methods deteriote with the increasing sparsity? Is there a systematic way to deal with that issue?

Q2: In the node merging method, the costs between nodes are computed based on the their deterministic features X_t. However, how is it guaranteed that the features reflect their true similarity? For example, we may use document rank as a bias factor when only considering the position bias. But it turns out that the user may notice the documents in the order of: the first several documents (since they’re most noticeable), the last several documents on this page (since users may scroll down), and then documents in the middle. In the more complex settings of several factors, it’s even less obvious which nodes are similar to each other. Is it possible to make the features not deterministic but rather learned throughout multi-task learning?

Q3: In the application of the method, the dataset is mostly online and continuously taking in new data points. How does the proposed method handle the updates efficiently? For example, if two nodes (bias factors) with similar features are already merged but the new datapoints from the user creates an edge between them, is there a way to efficiently deal with this?

### Summary
This paper delves into the identifiability issue of the ranking model within the context of unbiased learning to rank (ULTR). Previous studies have established the model's unbiasedness, assuming perfect fits for both clicks and the observation model, inadvertently overlooking the identifiability challenge at its core. Motivated by this, the article investigates the conditions necessary to recover identifiability, primarily in the context of scale transformation. The authors formalize the identifiability challenge as a graph connectivity test problem. Based on it, they further propose two methods, namely node intervention and node merging, to tackle this problem for empirical applications.

### Strengths
1. The topic is interesting and important both theoretically and empirically;
2. The methods of graph connectivity are novel to me;
3. This paper is well-written.

### Weaknesses
1. Experiments are weak and not very convincing, since it has very little baseline (see Q1 below for more details);

2. Theorem 3 is straightforward and does not seem useful; the conditions required by Theorems 2 and 4 are stringent (see Q2 below for more details).

### Questions
I have two main concerns: 

**Q1.** In the experiment, there are only two weak baselines. In addition, there are lack of details about the two baselines. However, this article mentions a lot of related works but does not include them as part of the baselines for comparison empirically. This is inconsistent with the requirements in this area of ULTR. Could you add some cutting-edge ULTR methods as baselines? 

**Q2.** In terms of the theoretical results. 

>(1)	Theorem 2 is a very simple case (… $x$ and $t$ are selected independently and uniformly …). Thus, it is not sufficient to write it as a Theorem; it might be more appropriate to write it as a Proposition.

> (2)	Theorem 3 is simple and straightforward (just by the central limit theorem) and does not seem useful. Could you clarify the purpose and use of Theorem 3? Also, it is not sufficient to write it as a Theorem; it might be more appropriate to write it as a Lemma.

> (3)	The condition required in Theorem 4, "A disconnected IG consists of two connected components G1 and G2" is strong and difficult to fulfill in practice. 

**In fact, the soundness of Theorems 3 and 4 is very critical to this paper.** Here are the two main reasons: (a) The graph is always disconnected in practice, and will suffer from identifiability problems; (b) To recover the identifiability, we always need node intervention and node merging to recover the connected graph for empirical applications. Thus, the rationality of these two proposed algorithms (node intervention and node merging) becomes critical. Regrettably, Theorems 3 and 4 are slightly weak, which seriously undermines the contribution of this paper.

### Summary
The submission studies the identifiability problem of unbiased learning to rank (ULTR) - given a dataset of implicit feedback, whether the true relevance can be identified or not. By treating each bias configuration as a node, and the shared input feature vector for the edges, the relevance model is identifiable if and only if the graph is connected. Then two methods are proposed to try to address the issues (making the graph connected). Experiments are conducted on two synthetic datasets and an offline dataset, where it shows that using the two methods to change data can improve the performance of a naive baseline.

### Strengths
It is interesting to study the identifiability problem of unbiased learning to rank from the graph connectivity perspective, though the reviewer is not convinced that this is "the first work" to study the identifiability issue given existing work on coupling / confounding, etc. The major novelty seems to be the graph view.

The proposed two methods are easy to understand. The authors do acknowledge the caveats of the proposed methods (one being not very practical and one may propagate errors).

The paper is overall clearly written.

### Weaknesses
Overall the paper is not satisfactory in term of theories or experiments.

Though the theorems look interesting at first glance, the reviewer feels they are generally not very solid or practical after a closer look at them. A major issue is the reviewer feels the submission has self-contradictions in several places. 

So there are two scenarios in practice: 1) there are a lot of data, and the bias factor space is small. This is the a common case in practice and people are just fine without worrying about identifiability. The analysis and methods in this paper mostly do not apply since the graph is small and likely connected. 2) There are a lot of bias factors and the graph is more likely to be not connected. The paper mainly argues about this scenario. So far so good and it is ok to focus on 2).

However, by closing look at each theorem, all of them are questionable and some look contradictory to the focus/motivation:

Theorem1: while the trend of using more bias factors is the trend is debatable (especially given existing work showing the coupling / confounding effect), the trend to enrich x is clear. Many real-world applications have personalized feature vectors - then the graph is not likely to be connected even with a small number of bias factors. The paper does not concern this perspective, also, people are fine working with ULTR with such datasets. This questions the value of the proposed framework - one should also note that the condition is only a sufficient condition. 

Theorem 2: The assumptions are too strong to make meaningful value from this theorem. The reviewer understands this is to show a simplified “estimate”, but still the value is quite limited for this highly practical field.

Theorem 3: There’s self-contradiction with the motivation of the paper. As discussed, the paper mainly concerns large bias factor space. However, this theorem assumes that each (input feature , bias factor) pair need to sample N observations from a Bernoulli distribution, and the theorem is based on “N is sufficiently large”. How can this be meaningful under the scenario the paper is concerned with?

Theorem 4: The error bound is only shown to merge two subgraphs. Again, the paper is concerned with large bias factor space and the number of subgraphs could be be high - what is the error bound for the entire merge process? Will the errors propagate to meaningless values? Showing error bound only for merging two subgraphs looks quite limited.

There are also several places in the paper that also look contradictory, e.g. when it argues about the benefit of node intervention, “It should be noted that K is typically smaller the the number of positions (assuming that positions are the sole bias factor)” - the reviewer is confused about such claims. If the paper is concerned with such scenario, then there’s probably no need to worry about the identifiability issue.

On the experiments part, the evaluation is weak. The major issue is, the proposed methods are only shown to improve the very basic baseline. The authors argue that the methods are agnostic to the actual algorithm and “aptly represents the current research” - the reviewer strongly disagrees - to show the proposed method is really meaningful,  it needs to show that they can help more sensible baselines. For example, will they help state-of-the-art ULTR methods? If not, why would people care? This is important since the proposed two methods have clear caveats (the node intervention method is not very practical, the node merging method is likely to introduce errors).
