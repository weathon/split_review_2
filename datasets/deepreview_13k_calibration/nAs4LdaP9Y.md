## Abstract
Federated Learning (FL) has gained significant attraction due to its ability to enable privacy-preserving training over decentralized data. Current literature in FL mostly focuses on single-task learning. However, over time, new tasks may appear in the clients and the global model should learn these tasks without forgetting previous tasks. This real-world scenario is known as Continual Federated Learning (CFL). The main challenge of CFL is \textit{Global Catastrophic Forgetting}, which corresponds to the fact that when the global model is trained on new tasks, its performance on old tasks decreases. There have been a few recent works on CFL to propose methods that aim to address the global catastrophic forgetting problem. However, these works either have unrealistic assumptions on the availability of past data samples or violate the privacy principles of FL. We propose a novel method, Federated Orthogonal Training (FOT), to overcome these drawbacks and address the global catastrophic forgetting in CFL. Our algorithm extracts the global input subspace of each layer for old tasks and modifies the aggregated updates of new tasks such that they are orthogonal to the global principal subspace of old tasks for each layer. This decreases the interference between tasks, which is the main cause for forgetting. 
  We empirically show that FOT outperforms state-of-the-art continual learning methods in the CFL setting, achieving an average accuracy gain of up to 15\% with 27\% lower forgetting while only incurring a minimal computation and communication cost.

### Summary
To address the catastrophic forgetting problem in the context of federated continual learning, the paper introduces a novel method that leverages orthogonalization of tasks to mitigate global forgetting in the course of continuous learning. This approach effectively reduces interference between distinct tasks, as demonstrated empirically. FOT exhibits superior performance compared to existing methods, manifesting improvements in accuracy and reduction in forgetting rates, all while incurring minimal additional computational and communication costs.

### Strengths
The study presents a CFL framework, Federated Orthogonal Training (FOT), which addresses Global Catastrophic Forgetting by modifying global updates for new tasks to reduce interference with previous tasks. FOT also ensures client privacy, eliminates the need for client-side storage, and outperforms other methods in cross-device settings, even though they have additional computation and storage requirements.

### Weaknesses
Communication overhead represents a significant weakness in the methodology presented in the paper. However, the paper's analysis is somewhat superficial, lacking a comparison with baseline experiments. The argument regarding the minimized communication overhead is not sufficiently elaborated upon.

Similarly, Remark 1 highlights that the convergence analysis in the paper is relatively straightforward and lacks comprehensive theoretical underpinnings.

### Questions
I have a question of how to understand the correctness of the orthogonal process in this paper (intuitively)?

### Summary
This Paper works on the continual federated learning problem. The author proposed a framework named Federated Orthogonal Training (FOT) to address the Global Catastrophic Forgetting problem.

### Strengths
1. This paper clearly describes the problem setting and states their target -- solving the catastrophic forgetting problem. The authors used illustrations, formulas, and well-written paragraphs to explain the FOT framework step by step clearly.
2. When estimating the global principal, clients need to upload locally extracted principal subspace information to the server. The authors used knowledge from randomized SVD to realize this in a privacy-preserving way.
3. In the paper, the authors discussed several important aspects, especially the privacy, of the algorithm that people worried about. 
4. Empirical results showed that the FOT provided significant improvement in average forgetting compared with extensive baselines in various benchmarks

### Weaknesses
1. There are still some baselines that are not compared in the paper, for example, the methods in paper [1],[2],[3].

2. In FOT, the global update was generated by projecting the aggregated updates onto the orthogonal subspace for each layer in the model. Intuitively, this will make the converge slower, which is directly related to potential extra communication costs. The authors did not provide a discussion about this.

### Questions
1. On page 6, Theorem 1, the author mentioned that "for sufficiently large n, the principal column space of Y recovers the low-rank column space of A up to rank k with a negligible error.". In my understanding, n corresponds to the number of data in every client. Then what is the number of data in your experiments? For the 100 clients' experiments, is there enough data? If not, how do you explain the effectiveness of the FOT?
2. Authors said that they used the same round number for different methods. How did you decide the round number? Did other methods converge earlier than the round number?
3. According to the description of the FOT, to me, it seems like that FOT would also work well if we only apply this to several layers in the model. Have the authors tried this?

### Summary
This paper discusses the concept of Continual Federated Learning (CFL), a real-world scenario where new tasks emerge over time in a decentralized data setting. In CFL, the main challenge is Global Catastrophic Forgetting, where the performance of the global model on old tasks deteriorates as it is trained on new tasks. While previous works have attempted to address this problem, they often rely on unrealistic assumptions about past data availability or violate privacy principles. To overcome these limitations, the authors propose a novel method called Federated Orthogonal Training (FOT). FOT works by extracting the global input subspace of each layer for old tasks and modifying the aggregated updates of new tasks in a way that ensures they are orthogonal to the global principal subspace of old tasks for each layer. This reduces interference between tasks, which is the main cause of forgetting. Empirical evidence shows that FOT outperforms existing continual learning methods in the CFL setting, achieving better average accuracy and lower forgetting while incurring minimal computation and communication costs.

### Strengths
1. The paper is well-written.
2. The authors propose a CFL framework named Federated Orthogonal Training (FOT) to address the Global Catastrophic Forgetting problem. 
3. Within FOT, they introduce a novel aggregation method, named FedProject, which guarantees the orthogonality in a global manner without privacy leakage and more communication.

### Weaknesses
My primary point of concern revolves around the differentiation in technical innovation when compared to related works. More precisely, the paper that introduced the GPM (s Gradient Projection Memory) method for centralized continual learning seems to employ a similar approach to address the issue of forgetting. This similarity is evident in the equations provided – Eq 8 and 9 in the GPM paper and Eq 12 in the current paper.

I acknowledge that this paper introduces an additional layer of aggregation, which generates $A^l$ through secure aggregation in the context of federated learning. However, it's worth noting that secure aggregation inherently lends itself to operations such as summation or averaging. Consequently, I am inclined to question the extent of the technical contribution and novelty offered by this paper. Specifically, the core idea of projecting gradients onto a subspace orthogonal to previous task gradients is not novel. The secure aggregation aspect, while practically relevant, seems to be a straightforward application of existing techniques rather than a significant theoretical advancement. The paper needs to more clearly articulate the novelty beyond the application of secure aggregation to an existing continual learning concept.

### Questions
The author could have a clear statement about the technical novelty and contribution of this paper compared to previous contralized continual learning.
