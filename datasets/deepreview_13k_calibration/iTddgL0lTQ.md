- Decision: Reject
- Avg Score: 3.75

## Abstract
Large language models (LLMs) have displayed massive improvements in reasoning and decision-making skills and can hold natural conversations with users.
   Many recent works seek to augment LLM-based assistants with external tools
   so they can access private or up-to-date information and carry out actions on behalf of users.
   To better measure the performance of these assistants, this paper introduces \benchmark{}, a benchmark consisting of complex user intents requiring multi-step tool usage specified through dialogue.
   \benchmark{} contains 28 tools grouped into 7 plugins, and includes a complete simulated implementation of each tool, allowing for fully automated evaluation of assistants that rely on execution feedback.
   \benchmark{} also emphasizes tools that externally affect the world rather than only tools for referencing or searching information.
   We evaluate GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 on \benchmark{} resulting in success rates of 26\% and 50\% respectively.
   Our analysis of the errors reveals three major categories and suggests some future directions for improvement.

### Summary
The paper presents a dataset that can evaluate tool calling in the context of a conversation. The dataset contains 28 tools from 7 categories. The approach to create conversations includes using GPT-4 with a set of tools (5) to accomplish a task. After a filtering process of these scenarios, 50 conversations are created manually with 28 more that are easy that includes one tool each.  The evaluation strategy includes fuzzy mechanisms to measure string based argument values, difference between actions and no-action tool calls etc. Their results and analyses shows that the success rates for the hard questions giving a good goal for the research community. The paper is written and presented well. 

I have the following concerns with the overall work: (a) Dataset Size and Details: The dataset size seems very small 50 for hard and 28 for easy. Given that there are so much analyses done in the paper, it is concerning on it use as a good test set for conversational setting. Furthermore, it would be great to provide more details of the dataset after the filtering. How many turns in the conversations? How many average number of tools used and evaluated? etc. (b) GPT 3.5 and GPT 4: The only two models used for this work. It is important to know how other models such as Llama or Llama chat or Code Llama perform on this task. I do get the fact that GPT 4 would be the best in the performance but a comprehensive overview is important. (c) Evaluation metrics: Conversational systems are generally evaluated turn-wise with variations of rouge given the input from the APIs. But the overall results here just focus on the success rate and the toolcalls which raises the question on how useful the text and conversations are.

### Strengths
1. The work addresses an important topic in the context of conversational AI and Tools/APIs infusion in such a setting. 
2. Datasets are few specifically those focused on sequences of tools or API calls in conversations.

### Weaknesses
 - There is some lack of clarity about the creation of the ground-truth dialogs. It seems that it was written by humans, but how? Was there any validation of the data? Are the GPT4-generated scenarios biased in any particular way?

- It's not clear whether the user is always requesting that specific tools are invoked (e.g., "search my email", "check the weather") or whether there are situations wherein the assistant is expected to infer tool usage from a passive statement (e.g., "I forgot who emailed me about X" --> search_email(X), or "John asked me to do X by tomorrow" --> add_reminder(X, tomorrow)). Additional examples would help

- Will the proposed methodology generalize to a tool such a search engine or general-purpose retrieval? I imagine the tool correctness metric would need to change.

- The evaluation of GPT4/GPT3.5 does not provide much value, except to show that the benchmark is challenging and that tool documentation is important. To improve this, you could consider evaluating with alternate prompts (e.g., ones that induce better/worse tool usage) in order to demonstrate that the proposed benchmark can effective discern between tool-usage capabilities.

### Questions
1. Is section 3.2 at the right place in evaluation methodology?
    2. Can you please specify the exact difference between easy and hard? Is it only one tool vs multiple tools?
    3. Can you please provide more statistics of the whole dataset after filtering? 50 conversations, how many turns, average number of tool calls?
    4. Did you manually evaluate the conversations for success rates? Is it possible that there were multiple plans for the same goal?
    5. Size of the dataset is a major concern for making any conclusions. Given that there are so much analyses already done on this dataset, how would you think it will help for evaluating as a test set — more seems like a development set.
    6. Clarify the exact differences between ToolLLM, ToolAlpaca, and APIBank. How does just the dialog setting enable research to develop new features?

### Summary
This paper introduces ToolTalk, an evaluation benchmark for tool-usage in multi-turn dialogs. 

There are 28 tools considered (belonging to 7 plugins such as Calendar/Email/Weather/etc), and each has (i) a high-level description, (ii) documentation about parameters, (iii) description of return value, (iv) simulated implementation in python, (v) equality metric to ascertain whether two invocations of a tool are equal. After the tools/plugins have been defined, (i) GPT4 is used to create complex scenarios requiring tool usage, (ii) humans (authors?) create tool-using conversations from these scenarios. Each turn in a multi-turn dialog consists of (i) user utterance, (ii) tool calls made by assistant, (iii) expected return values for tools, (iv) ground-truth assistant response. There are 50 conversations created with GPT4 scenarios (3 tool calls each), and 28 created by humans (one tool call).

The evaluation on ToolTalk is done in two phases: (1) Given a dialog ending in a user utterance, with all prior tool calls/responses, the model either (i) generates a response, or (ii) generates tool calls, which are executed until the model generates a response. (2) The predicted tool calls for a given context are compared against ground-truth tool calls. To measure the correctness of a tool call, either the arguments are compared for equality with the ground-truth (for action tools) or the results of the execution (e.g., search) are compared for equality (for non-action tools). This enables (1) precision of tool calls, (2) recall of tool calls and (3) success rate of tool calls (all tool calls correct, and no incorrect actions) and (4) incorrect action rate (wrong action tool is successfully called). 

GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 are evaluated on ToolTalk, both with and without tool documentation. Three major reasons that models fail are: (i) premature tool calls, (ii) faulty reasoning and (iii) incorrect invocation of correct tool. For both with and without documentation, the rate of each error type is presented. The models without documentation perform worse.

### Strengths
The ToolTalk benchmark (data, metrics) can be a valuable resource to the research community. There are some important aspects that are carefully considered in the design of the data and the evaluation metrics, for example: (1) having a variety of realistic tools (action/non-action, different plugins, arguments), (2) having metrics for tool correctness and incorrect action rate.

### Weaknesses
1. The number of involved tools is small, which may lead to biased evaluation for the LLMs measurement.
2. There is a lack of experiments on open-sourced LLMs, and how to enhance the ability of LLMs on their proposed benchmark is missing.

### Summary
This paper introduces a new benchmark, ToolTalk, to measure the performance of LLM-based assistants. It consists of complex user intents that require multi-step tool usage specified through dialogue. They evaluate GPT series models on ToolTalk and provide some insights for future research.

### Strengths
1. This paper proposes a new benchmark to evaluate the performance of LLM-based assistants. It includes a complete simulated implementation of each tool and emphasizes tools that externally affect the world. Their benchmark will contribute to the NLP community.

### Weaknesses
1. The scope covered by the proposed benchmark is too narrow, compared to recent work on benchmarking the tool-using ability. Although I understand the authors may want to have a focus contribution to this specialized direction (a.k.a, conversation), the difference with other work is not that clear. For example, a lot of work recently tried to evaluate the tool-using ability to solve real-world tasks. See [1] for an example. In this case, real-world tasks can always happen during the conversation. The benchmark's focus on conversational tool use, while potentially valuable, does not sufficiently distinguish itself from existing benchmarks that also incorporate elements of multi-turn interaction and real-world task completion. The specific novelty of the conversational aspect needs to be more clearly articulated, especially given that many existing benchmarks already include multi-step tasks that could be framed within a conversational context.

2. The evaluation is too limited. This is a fundamental drawback for this kind of benchmark paper. Basically, only two models, namely GPT-3.5-turbo and GPT-4, are considered in the experiments.  It would be more interesting to see the results of some open-sourced models, like Vicuna, and Alpaca. The lack of diversity in the models evaluated significantly limits the generalizability of the findings. The benchmark's utility is diminished if it only demonstrates performance on a small set of proprietary models, and it is essential to include open-source models to make the benchmark more accessible and useful for the wider research community.

3. The overall presentation needs to be improved. For example, the two algorithm blocks in Page-5 do not provide too much useful information. The algorithm blocks, as presented, lack sufficient detail and clarity to be truly informative. They do not provide a clear understanding of the underlying processes or the specific steps involved in the tool interaction and evaluation. The pseudo-code should be more detailed, specifying the data structures, control flow, and error handling mechanisms to be truly useful for the reader.
