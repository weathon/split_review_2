## Abstract
While recent advancements in speech language models have achieved significant progress, they face remarkable challenges in modeling the long acoustic sequences of neural audio codecs. In this paper, we introduce \textbf{G}enerative \textbf{P}re-trained \textbf{S}peech \textbf{T}ransformer (GPST), a hierarchical transformer designed for efficient speech language modeling. GPST quantizes audio waveforms into two distinct types of discrete speech representations and integrates them within a hierarchical transformer architecture, allowing for a unified one-stage generation process and enhancing Hi-Res audio generation capabilities. By training on large corpora of speeches in an end-to-end unsupervised manner, GPST can generate syntactically consistent speech with diverse speaker identities. Given a brief 3-second prompt, GPST can produce natural and coherent personalized speech, demonstrating in-context learning abilities. Moreover, our approach can be easily extended to spoken cross-lingual speech generation by incorporating multi-lingual semantic tokens and universal acoustic tokens. Experimental results indicate that GPST significantly outperforms the existing speech language models in terms of word error rate, speech quality, and speaker similarity.

### Summary
This paper studies the task of speech-language modeling. The authors proposed a hierarchical transformer approach to train a speech-based language model, denoted as Generative Pre-Trained Speech Language Model (GPST). GPST has both global and local transformers. The global transformer operates on "coarse" units while the local transformer operates over the "fine" units.

The authors compare the proposed method to several baseline methods considering content preservation (WER), speaker similarity (SPK), and overall quality (DNSMOS). The authors additionally present their method is capable of performing under the multi-lingual setup, and a small ablation study.

### Strengths
1. The authors study the task of speech-language modeling using a joint training of global and local models. 
2. The local and global models mitigate the issue of long sequence generation which is a critical issue in speech LMs.
3. The authors empirically show the proposed method is superior to the evaluated baselines.

### Weaknesses
1. The global and local transformers were introduced before in the NLP community. 
2. There are various unsupported claims in the paper. 
3. Overall this paper seems incremental considering the other modeling approaches such as AudioGen, VALL-E, and AudioLM. It is not clear whether this is enough to pass the bar for ICLR publication.

   The global and local transformers were introduced before in the NLP community. This makes the novelty of the proposed approach rather limited as it seems like a different application of the same modeling approach. 

   There are various unsupported claims in the paper. For instance:  “...which limits the performance of fine acoustic token generation..“ why this is true? did the authors study that? can the authors provide experiments/refs to support that? Or: "These multi-stage generative models induce significant error propagation issues, which can negatively impact the overall performance.“ do the authors have experiments/refs to support that? Or: "Additionally, obstructing the information flow among hierarchical quantizers would degrade the model’s performance, especially in Hi-Res speech generation that requires more residual quantizers."

   Regarding the efficiency analysis, I’m not sure I agree with the author's analysis. The size of $D$ is usually 4/8/12 not more than that, $m_l$ is probably much bigger. So in case the authors decide to ignore $m_l$ in their analysis, they should also ignore $D$. Overall, I agree with the authors that the proposed method is likely to be more efficient, I just do not agree with their specific analysis.

   Regarding the results, can the authors provide more details on how they compute the WER using the GSLM method? GSLM [1] is a decoder-only method that operates on units obtained from HuBERT. There is no conditioning on text. So it is not clear to me how the authors compute WER when the model performs continuation / unconditional generation. Can the authors provide more details here?

   Did the authors try to explore / compare their method to a simple delay pattern as introduce by [2, 3]? It will greatly simplify the modeling approach and remove the need to the local transformer. 

   If I'm not mistaken, the paper's length should be 9 pages, with an unlimited number of pages for refs. and supplemental material. Hence, I believe the "REPRODUCIBILITY AND ETHICS STATEMENT" statements provided by the authors on the 10th page break the submission guidelines.

### Summary
* This paper studies the problem of speech language modeling. In particular, following the setup of SPEAR-TTS and AudioLM, speech is represented hierarchically as semantic tokens (clustered HuBERT/wav2vec2/w2v-BERT features) and acoustic tokens (SoundStream/Encodec tokens). A model first predicts semantic tokens and conditions on it to predict acoustic tokens.
* As acoustic tokens are derived from residual vector quantizers, each time step is represented as a stack of tokens and hence speech is typically encoded at a rate of 600Hz to 1200Hz. Modeling such long sequences can be challenging for vanilla language models. Prior work considers multi-stage models that model semantic tokens, acoustic tokens sequentially with separate models, which the authors argue would result in error propagation.
* The authors present a transformer to jointly model semantic tokens and audio tokens. In particular, MegaByte-style hierarchical Transformer is adopted for acoustic token modeling, where a global transformer processes sequence at 75Hz (taking the summed embedding over the stack of codes for a single time step) and the local transformer predicts the stack of codes within each time step auto-regressively.
* The proposed model evaluated quantitatively on semantic token-to-audio generation, voice conversion, and acoustic continuation tasks. Qualitative results on unconditional speech generation are presented in the appendix.

### Strengths
1. The authors presented a single model trained to optimize the joint probability of semantic tokens and acoustic tokens. In particular, the hierarchical Transformer facilitates efficient modeling of long sequences.
2. Empirical results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, outperforming AudioLM which is the most relevant work.

### Weaknesses
1. I don’t think it is fair to compare GPST/AudioLM with YourTTS/SPEAR-TTS/VALL-E on speaker identity transfer. The latter three are zero-shot text-to-speech synthesis models which take text and speaker prompt as input. In contrast, GPST and AudioLM take semantic tokens inferred from speech, which can have speaker information leaked from speech. If the authors follow the VALL-E setup for speaker identity transfer, then the semantic tokens are inferred from utterances from the same speaker as the audio prompt. For a more fair comparison, I would like to see the GPST-TTS setup for speaker identity transfer where semantic tokens are also inferred from text, in order to compare fairly with the zero-shot TTS models.
2. There is no direct comparison between hierarchical and non-hierarchical (i.e., flatten the audio tokens and use vanilla LM) models that are trained with the same objective. The comparison with AudioLM is not sufficient as there are other confounding factors.
3. Why are DNSMOS not presented in Semantic to Acoustic and Acoustic Continuation tasks?
4. GPST-Hi-Res lags behind GPST in most of the metrics. It is unclear why intelligibility (WER) and speaker similarity (SIM) degrades when having better audio quality

### Questions
1. What is the vocab size for E_a? Is it 1024 or 8192 (1024*8). Namely, does each residual codebook have its own embedding?
2. Is E_a shared between local and global transformers?
3. Unclear what local drops means. Each one predicts D codes for a time step and the batch size is b x T2. Is some (h_t, a_t^1, …, a_t^D) dropped to reduce batch size? Does it improve performance or just save memory?
4. How many layers for Ng, Nl? I did not find it in the paper or appendix

### Summary
The paper presents a new approach to speech language modeling for producing both semantic and acoustic continuations of text/audio prompts, with the ability to retain speaker-specific voice characteristics. Previous approaches (AudioLM, VALLE) have relied on multi-stage chaining of Transformer models to model semantic vs. fine-grained acoustic characteristics of the generated continuations. This paper proposed a single-stage hierarchical Transformer architecture to accomplish both in a single pass.  The approach is evaluated on Librispeech clean test set and Aishell-2 (Chinese) with respect to word error rate and speaker similarity.

### Strengths
The paper advances current research on generative speech LMs in that it proposes a one-stage architecture to achieve both semantic continuity and fine-grained acoustic generation quality, where the cascading of representation generation at different levels of granularity is absorbed into the Transformer architecture itself. This is novel and will be of interest to audiences interested in audio generation/multimodality. From a theoretical perspective the proposed architectures delivers efficiency improvements.

### Weaknesses
1. The evaluations conducted raise several questions. Some of these may be due to a lack of clarity in the presentation and are listed below under Questions.
2. In addition to the theoretical efficiency analysis, it would be good to see actual measures of speed or latency in Table 3. The real-time efficiency depends on the number of layers among other factors, so it would be good to see this as part of the ablation study.

### Questions
For the semantic-to-acoustic condition in Table 1, why use WER as the evaluation criterion rather than human evaluation of acoustic generation quality? Does this box refer to the unconditional generation? If so, why not compare WER against the human-labeled ground truth, why were Hubert-Large/XLSR-53 used as 'Ground Truth'? The evaluation methodology/terminology is a bit confusing here.

### Summary
The paper introduces a model called Generative Pre-Trained Speech Language Model (GPST) that addresses the challenges of modeling long acoustic sequences in neural audio codecs. Existing speech language models struggle to accurately represent acoustic tokens and often suffer from error propagation and information loss. GPST overcomes these limitations by employing a hierarchical transformer architecture and quantizing audio waveforms into two discrete speech representations. This allows for a unified one-stage generation process and improves the generation of high-resolution audio.

### Strengths
The main contribution of the paper is the proposal of a unified stage for speech generative models, which contrasts with prior works that typically adopt two or even three stages. One of the main challenges of one-stage modeling is the increased GPU memory and time cost associated with the unified structure. Compared to two-stage models, the prior unified AR approach can result in a significant increase, up to 8 or even 16 times, in cost. To address this problem, the authors employ a relatively small Transformer model, where the top layers are not as large as the bottom layers. Then the memory and time cost are significantly reduced. 

The authors employed a few of objective metrics to show the effectiveness of the proposed method.

### Weaknesses
1. The primary limitation of the paper is the insufficient evaluation. Due to the absence of a perfect evaluation metric for speech generation tasks, it is necessary to conduct a subjective evaluation in the experiments. Additionally, it would be advantageous to provide a demo page for the reviewers to experience the quality of the pre-trained model firsthand. Even if the authors try their best to do objective evaluations, subjective evaluation is still required. DNSMOS is not enough to measure the speech quality.

2. The primary focus of the paper is on efficiency; however, no specific metric is provided to evaluate its efficiency. I am curious about the potential inference time savings that can be achieved with the HIERARCHICALTRANSFORMER architecture.

3. Given the existence of previous full NAR approaches like SoundStorm, the contribution of the paper seems relatively limited. The efficiency issue has already been largely addressed by these full NAR approaches. Consequently, I have doubts about whether the proposed HIERARCHICALTRANSFORMER structure will inspire further advancements in speech pre-trained models.

4.The storytelling in the paper could be further enhanced. The primary contribution of the paper is the introduction of a unified stage speech pre-trained model, rather than the efficiency of the hierarchical transformer structure. The title and writing of the paper may be slightly misleading for readers.

### Questions
1. I am curious about the training and inference time of the structure. 

2. Since the model directly predicts all encodec tokens, is there any memory issue in long sequence prediction?
