## Abstract
Although neural networks have demonstrated significant success in various reinforcement-learning tasks, even the highest-performing deep models often fail to generalize. As an alternative, object-oriented approaches offer a promising path towards better efficiency and generalization; however, they typically address narrow problem classes and require extensive domain knowledge. To overcome these limitations, we introduce *QORA*, an algorithm that constructs models expressive enough to solve a variety of domains, including those with stochastic transition functions, directly from a domain-agnostic object-based state representation. We also provide a novel benchmark suite to evaluate learners' generalization capabilities. In our test domains, QORA achieves 100% predictive accuracy using almost four orders of magnitude fewer observations than a neural-network baseline, demonstrates zero-shot transfer to modified environments, and adapts rapidly when applied to tasks involving previously unseen object interactions. Finally, we give examples of QORA's learned rules, showing them to be easily interpretable.

### Summary
This paper introduces QORA, a new algorithm for learning interpretable object-relational models that can efficiently solve reinforcement learning tasks with zero-shot generalization. QORA represents states as sets of objects and attributes. It constructs transition rules for each object type by iteratively generating relational predicate hypotheses and combining them using first-order logic with quantification. In experiments on three environments, QORA achieves zero error with orders of magnitude fewer observations than neural networks. It demonstrates strong generalization via zero-shot transfer and rapid adaptation to new object types and interactions. The learned conditional probability rules are compact and interpretable. Overall, QORA advances object-oriented RL by increasing applicability to complex stochastic environments while retaining interpretability.

### Strengths
- This paper presents a novel object-oriented RL algorithm with strong empirical results on efficiency, generalization, and interpretability. Compared to DOORMAX, QORA is able to solve more complex environments (e.g., doors) and perform zero-shot transfer to modified environments. Moreover, the rules QORA deduced are also interpretable.
-  The source code of both QORA’s reference implementation and the benchmark suite will be public, which is beneficial to the community.

### Weaknesses
 - While QORA tacles more challenging environments than prior works (e.g., DOORMAX_D in Marom and Rosman, 2018), the evaluations are still on small-scale games, which limits its wide applicability.
- There are no theoretical guarantees provided for convergence or sample complexity.

This paper is not at all in my area. I am not familiar with OO-MDPs and the follow up works. I think the results presented in this paper is promising compared to existing works but not sure whether it makes adequte contribution in this field.

### Summary
This paper proposes a new object-oriented transition model, Quantified Object Relation Aggregator (QORA). Different from the previous work, DOORMAX, it can learn the general class of transition rules, which are interpretable and cover stochastic transitions. Additionally, they also proposed a new benchmark to evaluate the object-oriented transition models. In this environment, there are several object classes which attributes and transition rules are different, and one of the class has a stochasticity in its movement. In this paper, the authors evaluated their proposed model, QORA outperformed the baselines including several Neural Network models, and it showed a good generalization performance for diverse size of rooms, and can be trained for the stochastic transitions also.

### Strengths
- This paper proposes a new object-oriented transition model which can cover general rules of stochastic transitions.
- To evaluate the object-oriented transition model, a new benchmark is proposed, and it is reasonably designed to evaluate the object-oriented models.
- The evaluation is done step-by-step, which can make the reader understand the strengths of their model easily.
- Unseen size of environments, and object attributes are evaluated for showing the generalization performance of their model.

### Weaknesses
 - Their presentation looks not ready to be published yet in many aspects.
    - Ambiguous expression or not introduced terms.
        - In the introduction, the terms "generalization" (the model's ability to make effective decisions when exposed to novel inputs), "interpretability" (how easily its learned parameters can be inspected and understood by a human), and "robustness" (the predictability of its behavior on arbitrary inputs) need clarification. Explain the distinction between "novel" inputs (previously unseen) and "arbitrary" inputs (inputs that may not follow a specific pattern or structure) to avoid confusion.
        - On page 4, when discussing the player's ability to swap its color with the "new change-color action," it's important to introduce the "new change-color action" before using it in the sentence. Provide a brief explanation or definition of this action to ensure readers understand its context and purpose. Specifically, it should be clarified that this action is introduced for the purpose of interacting with doors, and it is not a standard action.
        - On page 5, when referring to the "best" candidate, explicitly define what "best" means within the context of the paper. Clarify whether "best" refers to candidates that are most relevant for prediction, those with the highest confidence scores, or some other criteria.
        - Regarding the explanation of boosting and the working set in the sentence on page 5, consider whether this explanation is necessary. If it adds value to the reader's understanding of how the working set is updated, provide a concise summary of how boosting is related to the working set, ensuring that it enhances clarity.
        - In section 3.2, provide a clear definition or explanation of the "learnable module" within the context of Quantified Function Learning. Specify its purpose and functionality to ensure the reader understands its role in the paper. Specifically, it is not clear what is learned in this module, which parameters are updated, and how the function is represented.
        - Equation 2 needs clarification regarding the conditions for movement to the right and the meaning of first and second coordinates. It is not clearly stated that the first coordinate represents the x-axis and the second the y-axis, and this should be explicitly mentioned for clarity.
        - The explanation of the relation group is insufficient, and details about its design or training architecture are lacking.
        - The meaning of "c" is not provided in Section 3.3.
        - In Section 4, different notations for different meanings should be used to avoid reader confusion.
        - The abbreviation "EMD" is used before it is introduced.
    - The analysis of experimental results needs improvement
        - The use of $m=1$ for Neural Networks and larger $m$ for DOORMAX and QORA should be justified more, as it may raise fairness concerns.
        - More analysis is needed to explain the errors that occur when $m=1000" for QORA, beyond the fact that a single layout is used.
        - The explanation for DOORMAX's inability to resolve the effect of the change-color action is insufficient.
    - There are several literatures studied the object-centric or object-oriented representation for the Reinforcement Learning tasks, but they are missed. For example, in [1], the unsupervised object-centric representation for model-free reinforcement learning agent is investigated, and in [2], the world model learning of given object attributes is studied. These should be discussed as related work, even if they are not directly comparable as baselines.
    - The evaluation is limited to a synthetic environment, and the paper should discuss the potential for extending the model to more realistic environments and the expected limitations in such cases.
    - The choice of baselines lacks diversity, and the paper could benefit from considering relevant studies in the object-centric representation field [3,4,5].

### Summary
In their submission, the authors present QORA, a novel algorithm that seeks to address the persistent challenge of generalization in reinforcement learning. QORA distinguishes itself by utilizing an object-oriented framework capable of forming models from a domain-agnostic, object-based state representation. This approach allows it to effectively handle environments with stochastic transitions.

Key contributions of the paper include:

1. Algorithmic Development: The introduction of QORA, which can efficiently construct expressive models that are demonstrated to solve a diverse array of domains.
2. Generalization Capability: QORA's design enables it to achieve perfect predictive accuracy in the authors' test domains, far surpassing the baseline neural network model in terms of the number of observations needed by nearly four orders of magnitude.
3. Zero-Shot Transfer: The algorithm's capacity for zero-shot transfer is particularly noteworthy, as it can adapt to environments that have been modified without the necessity for retraining.
4. Adaptability: The adaptability of QORA is further evidenced by its rapid learning curve when faced with tasks that include interactions with new objects not present in the training set.
5. Interpretability of Results: QORA's ability to generate easily interpretable rules is a significant step towards bridging the gap between performance and understandability in machine learning models.
6. Benchmark Suite: The authors also contribute a novel benchmark suite tailored to assess the generalization capabilities of learning algorithms, which is a valuable asset for future research in the field.

Overall, QORA represents an advancement in the pursuit of generalizable reinforcement learning algorithms, with a clear emphasis on efficiency, transferability, and interpretability.

### Strengths
Originality:

- QORA's approach to utilizing object-oriented representations for state transitions in RL is a refreshing direction that diverges from standard neural network methodologies. It contributes to the field by removing the limitations seen in prior model-based RL methods.
- The paper's novelty is also evident in the creative combination of interpretability and generalization, which are often challenging to achieve simultaneously in RL.

Quality:
- The authors make a good effort to provide benchmarks that can directly evaluate the particular angles they investigate. 

Clarity:

- The interpretability of QORA's learned rules is a testament to the clarity of the approach, which is commendably communicated through examples in the paper.

Significance:

- The significant reduction in sample complexity and successful zero-shot transfer capability indicate that QORA could have a substantial impact on the efficiency of RL models.

### Weaknesses
1. Overall, the writing is overly complex, detracting from the key methods involved.
2. The proposed model is difficult to conceptualize, especially without a supporting figure.
3. The proposed benchmarks, while suitable as toy tests, do not extend to nuanced representation learning and remain within grid worlds, where performance does not always translate to more realistic settings. The environments lack the complexity to truly evaluate the generalization capabilities of the proposed method in more challenging scenarios.
4. There are technical imprecisions; contrary to the authors' claims, CNNs can support variable length inputs, and architectures using 3x3 convolutions can model longer-term dependencies through mechanisms like average pooling, self-attention, max pooling, and CNN cascades. The claim that CNNs are inherently unsuitable for object-based representations is not adequately justified.
5. The neural network details used for comparison are not provided, which is a critical omission for reproducibility and transparency. The lack of specific architectural and training details makes it impossible to assess the validity of the comparison.
6. Figures intended for side-by-side comparison have differing scales, which could mislead the interpretation of the results. The inconsistent scaling makes it difficult to accurately compare the performance of QORA against the baselines.
7. The evaluation is not sufficiently robust and lacks the depth needed to substantiate the claims made. The experiments do not sufficiently explore the limitations of the proposed method, and the claims of generalization are not fully supported by the current evaluation.

### Questions
- **Writing Clarity:**  
The manuscript could benefit from a more streamlined exposition. Is a revision feasible to improve clarity and conciseness, particularly in the methodological description of QORA?

- **Model Visualization:**  
Including a figure to visualize QORA's architecture may aid in understanding. Could such a figure be provided?

- **Benchmark Scope:**  
The benchmarks focus on grid-world environments. Can you extend these to more complex settings to better illustrate QORA's generalization?

- **Technical Precision:**  
Clarification is needed on the statements about CNNs' capabilities. Can you reconcile these with the known utility of CNNs in handling variable input lengths and context-length dependencies?

- **Baseline Details:**  
A detailed description of the neural network baselines would be beneficial. Could you provide this additional context?

- **Figure Consistency:**  
The varying scales in comparative figures may lead to misinterpretation. Can you ensure uniform scales across all relevant figures for clarity?


Addressing these points could significantly improve the quality and impact of the work, and would improve substantially any conclusions drawn.

### Summary
The paper proposes a QORA – algorithm that constructs versatile models from domain-agnostic object-based state representations, addressing the generalization challenges faced by current approaches. On a proposed benchmark to depict the generalization capability, they depict better predictive accuracy with significantly fewer observations compared to their baselines, showcasing zero-shot transfer to altered environments, and quick adaptation capabilities to tasks with previously unseen object interactions.

### Strengths
The presented benchmarking environment in this study is thoughtfully designed, offering a clear understanding of the rationale behind each component, including walls, doors, and the fish system. 
Additionally, Section 3, which delineates the different elements of the proposed approach, provides readers with a comprehensive insight into the methodology's operation.

### Weaknesses
The proposed benchmark exhibits limitations in terms of its representation of real-world complexities. Despite featuring three distinct testing environments, it falls short of capturing the nuanced and open-ended nature of real-world concepts. The grid world benchmark, while valuable for assessing agent generalization capabilities, may be considered relatively straightforward and may not fully address the complexities exhibited by current deep learning systems with intricate behaviors. Moreover, its discrete nature may not adequately mirror the continuous nature of many real-world generalization challenges.
While the paper attempts to evaluate against neural network-based approaches, it predominantly relies on relatively simplistic methods, with the best-performing one being the CNN. I recommend the authors expand the range of neural network baselines for a more comprehensive comparison with the proposed approach. Additionally, extending the evaluations to larger grid sizes would provide valuable insights into how performance scales.

### Questions
The paper could benefit from providing more detailed information on hyperparameters and implementation specifics. Including a section on the potential broader impact of the proposed approach would also enhance the reader's understanding and appreciation of the work.
As mentioned in Weaknesses, I would recommend the authors evaluate against a more exhaustive set of approaches.
