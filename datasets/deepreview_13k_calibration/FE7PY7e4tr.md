## Abstract
A prevalent assumption regarding real-world data is that it lies on or close to a lower-dimensional manifold. When deploying a neural network on data manifolds, the required size of the network heavily depends on the intricacy of the underlying latent manifold. While significant advancements have been made in understanding the geometric attributes of manifolds, it's essential to recognize that topology, too, is a fundamental characteristic of manifolds. In this study, we delve into a challenge where a classifier is trained with data on low-dimensional manifolds. We present an upper bound on the size of ReLU neural networks. This bound integrates the topological facets of manifolds, with empirical evidence confirming the tightness.

### Summary
This paper shows the relationship between the topological complexity of the data manifold and the depth and size required for expressive power of the classification network. This result indicates that the topological complexity perspective of data manifolds may be useful for network construction.

### Strengths
Upper bounds on the depth and size of the ReLu network are theoretically given, taking into account the phase complexity of the data manifold.

### Weaknesses
The settings discussed in this paper seem unrealistic from a realistic machine learning perspective.
-  It is generally recognized that data manifolds are embedded in low-dimensional manifold, but anything below 3 dimensions seems too low-dimensional. In three dimensions or less, the target is likely to be relatively simple and easy to analyze by machine learning. Therefore, even if correctly shown in these settings, many theories do not hold true in higher dimensions. In other words, this result is not recognized as a result that can be passed on a general level. On the other hand, if it does not hold in these settings, it will not hold in general. So I recognize that the discussion in this paper is positioned as a pilot study that suggests that it may be important to consider topological complexity.
- The discussion in this paper uses Betti numbers for data manifolds. However, since the data is typically given as a point cloud, the definition of the Betti number is not unique. This is the same as the discussion of filtration in persistent homology. In other words, it is not appropriate as a theory to evaluate a classification network if the results differ depending on the method used to calculate the Betti number, even for the same data.
- The assumption is that the phase of the data manifold is known, but it seems difficult to know that in advance. Are we not specifically discussing building a network, but merely discussing relationships? In other words, is the goal to suggest the value of considering topology?
- The network discussed in this paper introduces $N_p$ and $N_{\phi}$ first. However, a general classification network does not include $N_p,N_{\phi}$, nor is there a need to introduce it. Also, from the proof, the result of the main theorem seems to be strongly influenced by $N_p,N_{\phi}$. In other words, the authors have failed to show that topology considerations are important for general classification networks, the only thing that can be shown is the obvious fact that networks with the additional topology analysis functionality introduced by the author himself are affected by topology complexity.
- The assumption in this paper seems to be that the classes of classification are disjointed. Is that a realistic setting?
- This discussion seems to be overly argumentative for the purpose of simply binary classification. Perhaps it would be more appropriate to discuss this in a setting such as expressive learning.

### Questions
I would like you to answer the questions I wrote in the weaknesses section above. I would like to hear thoughts on how this fits into the scope of this meeting, especially since the setting is so far from a realistic machine learning setting.

### Summary
This work looks at neural network expressive power in terms of the topological and geometric properties of the underlying data manifolds. The work establishes upper bounds on the size of the network needed to distinguish between data drawn from two manifolds as a function of their geometric and topological properties. To quantify topology, the work uses the sum of the Betti numbers (also known as the *topological complexity*) and to quantify geometry, the work uses the reach of the manifolds. Informally, the latter can be thought of as being related to curvature. The main result of the paper gives an upper bound on network depth and network size (the sum of the hidden dimensions) in terms of these two quantities. The work puts a number of assumptions on the manifolds in question, including having dimension $3$ or less and being able to be embedded in $\mathbb{R}^3$, being compact, and being orientable.

### Strengths
**Quality of mathematics:** While the reviewer did not have time to check all the proofs, the mathematical constructions seemed reasonable. It makes sense to start with topological complexity and reach when looking for statistics that capture topology and geometry respectively. 

**Presentation:** Besides some typos and grammatical mistakes, the work was mostly well-presented. The format used for proceedings papers at machine learning conferences is not especially conducive to deep mathematical works that require some building up towards a proof, but the reviewer felt that this paper did a good job conveying the main ideas in the body even if all the proof work had to go into the Appendix. The reviewer appreciated that all the main ideas and assumptions were both motivated and clearly defined. An informal explanation of the significance of individual results was also useful.

**Experiments:** The experimental section was appreciated, and helped ground some of the results. The relationship between the experiments and the main theorem was obvious and required only minimal explanation.

### Weaknesses
- **Assumptions on manifolds:** The types of manifolds that are considered are relatively limited. Some of the assumptions (such as compactness) are reasonable when thinking about data manifolds. Other assumptions, such as $d$-dimensionality, where $d \leq 3$, seems somewhat limiting. For instance, while this constraint is understandable given the complexity of higher-dimensional manifolds and the reliance on classification theorems, it is worth noting that the intrinsic dimensionality of real-world datasets can be significantly higher. As an example, ImageNet has been shown to have an intrinsic dimension between 26 and 43 [1]. Exploring potential relaxations of this constraint, or at least discussing its implications for the applicability of the results to higher-dimensional data, would be beneficial. That being said, other works in this research area also put constraints on some part of the set-up (or have correspondingly weaker conclusions) so this may be the price of progress.

- **Hints at the proof technique:** For papers such as this where the main contribution is a theorem, it is useful to give a high-level overview of the proof, even if the proof itself is relegated to the Appendix. This was done to some extent in this paper, but some additional details could probably be included for clarity. For instance, the reliance on a classification theorem is mentioned, and this presumably was what determined the choice to constrain to *solid manifolds*. However, it's not explicitly stated which classification theorem is being used. Specifying the classification theorem (e.g., classification of closed 1-manifolds or closed surfaces) would provide crucial context. Further spelling out some of these dependencies might illuminate why various assumptions were made and how they tie into the overall proof strategy. It would also be helpful to elaborate on the specific properties of solid manifolds that make them amenable to this type of analysis.

### Questions
- The reviewer was not previously aware of the term “solid manifold”. Is this an idea developed in this work or elsewhere?
- The work references the use of manifold classification theorems, what manifold classification theorem was actually used?

### Summary
The paper studies expressive power of ReLU networks. The main result makes a connection between topology of a data manifold, as evaluated by Betti numbers, and a size (depth and width) of a ReLU network sufficient for its good approximation. The paper is mostly theoretical. Empirical results demonstrate tightness of the proposed bounds for one setting.

### Strengths
1) Only a few papers studies connection between topological complexity of data manifold and size of deep NN.
New theoretical results establish such a connection.
2) The paper is well written and easy to follow.
3) Experiments with tori in 3D demonstrate the tightness of bounds.

### Weaknesses
1) The paper contains only one experiment on a synthetic dataset, which is a union of solid tori.
A typical paper from ICLR is expected to have a larger experimental section. Why not to try more complex datasets: entangled tori, nested spheres, etc. (see Naitzat, 2020).

2) In Section 3, you write "To explore the influence of manifold topology on network size, our analysis framework primarily
leverages manifold classification theorems". There seems to be an ambiguity of the term "classification". Here, you, probably mention **classification** of manifolds by their structure. While in ML, by classification we mean a separation of two manifolds in the shared ambient space, via a hyperplane of a non-linear separating surface.

3) In experimental section, the testing loss, which is of main interest in ML/AI is not studied.

For now, I think that limited experimental section is the main drawback of this manuscript (I haven't checked math carefully).

### Questions
1) In assumption 1, you state that M can be embedded into R^d, where d ≤ 3 and d ≤ D.
This restriction seems to be very tight, because dimensionalities of manifolds from real datasets are much higher.
Can it be relaxed?

2) Naitzat, et al. 2020 showed that the topological complexity of data manifold (and its representations in NN) decreases with depth, while in your work you find that width is more important (beta^2 vs. log(beta)). Can you explain it?

**Post rebuttal**. Thank you for the response. Only a minor part of issues were resolved. I realize that the manuscript is a theoretical one, but I would like to see more experiments, see weaknesses 1,3. For now, I prefer to remain my score unchanged.

### Summary
The paper presents theory in regards to the expressivity of a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) in classifying between two classes, when each class is drawn from a smooth low-dimensional submanifold of a Euclidean space $\mathbb{R}^D$. In a restricted setting where topological theory is more rich (intrinsic dimension at most 3, compact, orientable, and have boundary), the authors make an explicit construction of a neural network classifier, where the network size is bounded by terms of separated topological and geometric complexity. The authors then finally present experimental results to demonstrate the trend between topological complexity (measured through Betti numbers) and needed network size to sufficiently classify the data.

### Strengths
- Visual aids for mathematical ideas were well designed and placed, helping greatly with readability.
- The theory is very well done and written in a way that highlights the connection between Betti numbers and neural network classification.

### Weaknesses
 - A small handful of relatively minor typos (e.g. "quaratically" under main theorem, Definition 2 $\mathcal{M} \subset \mathbb{R}^D$ instead of $\in \mathbb{R}^D$, "fundamental" quote formatting on page 5). While needed to be fixed, these make 0 impact on my overall review.
- The term "classification" is overloaded in this paper, and the expected ICLR reader would likely be mislead by some of the writing. Namely, there are times when the author is talking about geometric manifold classification problems, where the goal is determining if one (or a set of) manifold(s) is homeomorphic to another. This is fundamentally different from neural networks classifying two classes. Since explicit clarification and distinction is missing, there are a number of misleading parts of the text. For example, the statement "classifying manifolds beyond three dimensions is known to be equivalent to the word problem on groups [...] and is undecidable" would lead the standard reader to think that this paper's restriction to at most 3-dimensional manifolds actually retains generality for neural network classification theory, but indeed this statement is talking about geometric manifold classification, not neural network classification.
- The authors' claim that their "result reveals for the first time how the topology, as a global structural characterization of data manifold, affects the network expressiveness" is misleading; while this analysis related to specifically Betti numbers and neural network expressiveness, this work is not the first to relate "structural characterization of data manifold" to nextwork expressiveness. While their related works section does cover a good breadth of related work in the intersection of topology and deep learning, one work in particular was missed that is quite close in setting and goal to this paper, namely an ICLR 2021 paper titled ["Deep Networks and the Multiple Manifold Problem"](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=O-6Pm_d_Q-). This referenced paper is of course not a strict superset (e.g. "Deep Networks[...]") only focuses on 1-dimensional manifolds), but Buchanan et al. do lay down a lot of fundamental theory on relating different sizes of a network (e.g. width and depth) to the complexity of the data manifolds and the distributions over them that data is drawn from, much of which this paper misses and could benefit from integrating in terms of practicality.
- I am having a harder time seeing how this theory applies to deep learning, outside of the analysis being over MLP's. If the goal is a new method for constructing MLP's from data, the paper's main neural network construction seems to rely on a decomposition of a data manifolds into a union of fundamental manifolds (e.g. ball, torus), which is hardly known or even computable from fixed, finite samples of practical data manifolds, and likewise does not characterize the type of functions typical MLP's fit. If the goal is to highlight the expected relationship between the sum of Betti numbers and needed network size to classify data, then the experiments shown are not nearly thorough enough to demonstrate this, not only due to unrealistic settings (incredibly high sampled data density, low dimensional, etc.), but because the only trend plotted was over a single family of manifolds (g-genus tori), which alongside its Betti numbers sum has many other geometric properties growing that could explain the expressivity trend. It is thus not clear from these demonstrations why it is meaningful to focus on the Betti numbers.

### Questions
- Suppose someone has two classes of rotated-MNIST, the 5's and the 9's (for our rotated-MNIST each image from MNIST is rotated 2*pi radians exclusive at, say, fidelity 10; so a single MNIST training class goes from 6,000 to 60,000 data points). They want to train an MLP-classifier between these two classes. How would they use the theory and results introduced in this paper to inform their initial choice of the width and depth of the MLP they start off with?
- In the study of data manifolds and MLP classifiability, why should the research community focus analysis on Betti numbers for data manifolds instead of other previously studied measures of extrinsic geometry?
