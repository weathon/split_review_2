## Abstract
PROTACs are a promising therapeutic technology that harnesses the cell's built-in degradation processes to degrade specific proteins. Despite their potential, developing new PROTAC molecules is challenging and requires significant expertise, time, and cost. Meanwhile, machine learning has transformed various scientific fields, including drug development. In this work, we present a strategy for curating open-source PROTAC data and propose an open-source toolkit for predicting the degradation effectiveness, i.e., activity, of novel PROTAC molecules. We organized the curated data into 16 different datasets ready to be processed by machine learning models. The datasets incorporate important features such as $pDC_{50}$, $D_{max}$, E3 ligase type, POI amino acid sequence, and experimental cell type. Our toolkit includes a configurable PyTorch dataset class tailored to process PROTAC features, a customizable machine learning model for processing various PROTAC features, and a hyperparameter optimization mechanism powered by Optuna. To evaluate the system, three surrogate models were developed utilizing different PROTAC representations. Using our automatically-curated public datasets, the best models achieved a 71.4% validation accuracy and a 0.73 ROC-AUC validation score. This is not only comparable to state-of-the-art models for protein degradation prediction, but also open-source, easily-reproducible, and less computationally complex than existing approaches.

### Summary
The paper presents a strategy for curating open-source PROTAC data and proposes an open-source toolkit for predicting the degradation effectiveness of novel PROTAC molecules. PROTACs are a novel class of therapeutic agents that can degrade specific proteins by recruiting an E3 ubiquitin ligase and a target protein of interest (POI). The authors collect and standardize data from two existing open-source datasets, PROTAC-DB and PROTAC-Pedia, which contain structural and experimental data of PROTAC complexes. The paper organizes the curated data into 16 datasets incorporating essential features such as pDC50, Dmax, E3 ligase type, POI amino acid sequence, and experimental cell type. This work provides an open-source toolkit that includes a configurable PyTorch dataset class, a customizable machine-learning model, and a hyperparameter optimization mechanism. The toolkit allows users to process various PROTAC features and train different models for protein degradation prediction. Three surrogate models that utilize different PROTAC representations are developed, such as molecular fingerprints, molecular graphs, and SMILES strings. The paper evaluates the models on the public datasets and compares them with existing state-of-the-art models. The paper claims that the proposed models achieve comparable or better performance with less computational complexity and more reproducibility.

### Strengths
The paper presents a strategy for curating open-source PROTAC data and proposes an open-source toolkit for predicting the degradation effectiveness of novel PROTAC molecules. The paper also develops three surrogate models that utilize different PROTAC representations, such as molecular fingerprints, molecular graphs, and SMILES strings. The proposed models achieve comparable or better performance with less computational complexity and more reproducibility compared to existing state-of-the-art models. The paper’s approach combines existing ideas and applications to a new domain.

The authors collect and standardize data from two open-source datasets, PROTAC-DB and PROTAC-Pedia, which contain structural and experimental data of PROTAC complexes. The paper organizes the curated data into 16 different datasets incorporating important features such as pDC50, Dmax, E3 ligase type, POI amino acid sequence, and experimental cell type. The paper provides an open-source toolkit that includes a configurable PyTorch dataset class, a customizable machine-learning model, and a hyperparameter optimization mechanism. The toolkit allows users to process various PROTAC features and train different models for protein degradation prediction.

The paper is well-written and easy to follow. The authors clearly explain the concepts and methods used in the study. The paper includes detailed descriptions of the datasets, models, and experiments conducted. The authors also provide visualizations of the results to aid in understanding.

### Weaknesses
The paper evaluates the proposed models on automatically curated public datasets and compares them with existing state-of-the-art models. However, the curation performed does not account for the dimension of time, which is critical metadata for protac datasets as pDC50 and Dmax can vary substantially based on the timepoint due to variations in parameters such as the kinetics of degradation and protein resynthesis rate, etc. The authors should explicitly account for time in their modeling framework.

In the curve fitting section of the data curation, the authors use a standard four-parameter fit using the Hill Equation, similar to what is commonly used with equilibrium pharmacology. This type of fit does not accurately estimate DC50 or Dmax because of the hook effect. A fit similar to that proposed by Haid et al (https://doi.org/10.3390/pharmaceutics15010195) is preferred.

The paper could benefit from additional experiments that evaluate the models on more diverse and challenging datasets, such as those specific to a congeneric series or those with different E3 ligase types and POI amino acid sequences.

The work focuses on predicting protein degradation efficacy using machine learning models. However, the paper does not address other important aspects of PROTAC engineering, such as pharmacokinetics, toxicity, or other ADMET properties. The paper could benefit from additional experiments that address these aspects and provide a more comprehensive view of PROTAC engineering.

### Questions
Why do the authors remove stereochemistry information in their molecular standardization workflow? In many instances one stereoisomer may be significantly more potent than another, which becomes especially apparent in degrader design. The authors should show how their modeling framework is affected by retaining stereochemical information vs. removing it.

### Summary
This paper introduces a benchmark for assessing PROTAC molecules' degradation efficacy. The authors' key contributions include:

-   The collation and organization of PROTAC data from existing databases into a set of 16 comprehensive datasets featuring parameters such as pDC50, Dmax, E3 ligase type, and POI sequence.
-   The creation of an open-source toolkit using PyTorch designed for PROTAC data analysis, featuring a custom dataset class, various models, and a system for optimizing hyperparameters.
-   The evaluation of several foundational models including MLP, GNN, and BERT to predict PROTAC activity, with the best-performing model achieving a validation accuracy of 71.4%.

### Strengths
**Originality**: The provision of a new open toolkit for PROTAC modeling is noted. However, the utilized model architectures and molecular representations are established techniques in drug discovery. A comparative discussion on how this study's data curation advances beyond existing methodologies such as those in DeepPROTACs would be beneficial.

**Quality**: The dataset curation and model implementation demonstrate rigor, but the evaluation lacks a thorough examination of generalizability to out-of-distribution data. The validation accuracy is on par with certain benchmarks but does not reach the latest advancements in PROTAC prediction.

**Clarity**: The manuscript is articulate in method and result description. Nonetheless, it could benefit from a more detailed discussion on dataset balancing and optimization strategies. The section on limitations requires expansion to provide a deeper insight.

**Significance**: The toolkit has the potential to facilitate open PROTAC research; however, its impact might be limited by the conventional nature of the modeling techniques employed. The real value for the field appears to be in the datasets provided, despite the datasets being variations of the same data compilation.

The paper, as it stands, may not meet the innovation and impact criteria for a premier ML conference. Enhancements in methodology and evaluation could be considered to aim for such venues. Currently, it is more suited to a workshop setting.

### Weaknesses
**Rigor**: The benchmarking methodology should include comparisons with leading-edge models like DeepPROTACs. Clarity on whether these benchmarks are evaluated on identical test splits would be informative.

**Technical Depth**: The choice of 2D molecular representations might be constraining accuracy. The consideration of 3D structural representations may provide accuracy benefits. Additionally, the simplistic approach to embedding combination could overlook essential interaction details. Incorporating explicit modeling of PROTAC-target engagement may be advantageous.

**Organization**: The first four sections display redundancy, with overlap in the introduction, background, and contributions. The scientific context of PROTAC, while informative, could be condensed or moved to an appendix to make room for more technical details of the current contribution.

### Questions
**A/I Balance**: The discrepancy in the active/inactive data proportions across training, validation, and test splits, specifically the ~20%/80% in the test split, raises questions regarding the choice of this distribution. How would the baseline and control (i.e., "dummy") models perform under a balanced test split? A uniform distribution across all splits reflecting the overall dataset composition would likely yield a more fair and robust evaluation framework.

### Summary
In this paper, the author proposed and developed an architecture powered with deep learning to predict protein degradation. The suggested architecture consists of assembling embeddings from various model branches each processing distinct features.

### Strengths
- The steps around data collection and data curation of the PROTAC data were really well defined and explained. 
- Really detailed litterature review by mentioning the various work that were applied on PROTAC data. 
- Validation on different types of data splits.

### Weaknesses
The authors did not clearly mention and explain many experimental details that are important to reproduce the reached results.

### Questions
- At the end of the "Related Work" (section 4) the author mentioned: "Thirdly, the model’s performance is not benchmarked against other SOTA models with high predictive capacity, such as LightGBM or XGBoost" by state of the art here does the authors refer specificly to PROTAC research or for general ML and DL applications? since claiming that LightGBM and XGBoost are the best as predictive models is too generic and is not true with the presence of different advanced neural network architectures like transformers and attention models. 
 
 - In section 5.2, the authors mentioned about the oversampling that they applied on the minoriy class and I quote: "For class balance, oversampling and SMILES randomization were applied to minority class entries in the training datasets." however they did not specify the type of oversampling/data augmentation algorithm or logic that was leveraged for this purpose, was it some random duplication? SMOTE oversampling algorithm? and if any what is the reason behind using that specific oversampling method. 
 
 - At the beginning of section 5.3, the author mentioned the following:" We propose a general model architecture for predicting degradation activity of PROTAC complexes. This architecture involves joining (either summing or concatenating) embeddings from different model branches". So did the authors applied a suming or a concatenation to assemble the different embeddings?
 
 - Still in section 5.3, the authors talked about how they generated the embeddings derived from SMILES, they mentioned the approach with MLP, GNN and BERT, However later on in the experimental comparison they compared those three to XGBoost, so was XGBoost also used to extract representations from SMILES, if so how was it done? If not what is the reason behind comparing it to MLP, GNN and BERT? 
 
 - I do not quite understand the reason behind writing section 7.3, isn't it somehow obvious that a dummy model will have a good accuracy but a bad F1-score since it naively classifies the majority class? 
  
- Concerning section 7.6 about Out-of-Distribution (OOD) generalization, could the authors provide the amount of domain shift happening between the train and test data? This would be helpful to quantitatively grasp the gap between the 2 sets and thus observe how generalizable is the approach towards OOD.
