## Abstract
Estimating mutual information accurately is pivotal across diverse applications, from machine learning to communications and biology, enabling us to gain insights into the inner mechanisms of complex systems. Yet, dealing with high-dimensional data presents a formidable challenge, due to its size and the presence of intricate relationships. Recently proposed neural methods employing variational lower bounds on the mutual information have gained prominence. However, these approaches suffer from either high bias or high variance, as the sample size and the structure of the loss function directly influence the training process.
In this paper, we propose a novel class of discriminative mutual information estimators based on the variational representation of the $f$-divergence. We investigate the impact of the permutation function used to obtain the marginal training samples and present a novel architectural solution based on derangements. The proposed estimator is flexible since it exhibits an excellent bias/variance trade-off.  The comparison with state-of-the-art neural estimators, through extensive experimentation within established reference scenarios, shows that our approach offers higher accuracy and lower complexity.

3: You are fairly confident in your assessment. It is possible that you did not understand some parts of the submission or that you are unfamiliar with some pieces of related work. Math/other details were not carefully checked.

### Summary
This paper suggests using the variational representation of $f$-divergence to estimate mutual information (MI), the general idea is to extract a density ratio directly from the discriminator output, which is slighly from existing neural network-based MI estimators that optimize a variational bound of MI. Theoretically, authors show that the new estimator has smaller variance. Practically, authors evalute the performances of three different f-divergence MI estimators on benchmark synthetic data and sanity self-consistency tests.

### Strengths
1. Using $f$-divergence to estimate MI is new to me.
2. It is good to show that the new estimator has smaller variance.
3. Authors also contribute a new way to sample data from the product of marginal distributions $p(x)p(y)$ by derangement; which theoretically should perform better than random permutation and is always overlooked in previous literature.

### Weaknesses
My main concern comes from the claim that the new estimator has best or excellent bias/variance trade-off, which is not clear to me.
In fact, according to Figs. 1 and 2, the HD-DIME and KL-DIME do not perform that well, which usually suffer from large bias than NJEE and SMILE. Moreover, it seems there is no consistent winner for all f-divergence MI estimators that always performs better than others. 
For example, when the true MI is large, KL−DIME has a low variance but a high bias; whereas GAN-DIME has low bias but high variance.
Hence, it is hard to say which estimator really achieves a good bias-variance tradeoff; given that some other estimators also perform well, e.g., NJEE.

### Questions
1. Are there ways to give more insights on the bias of the new estimator, 
especially demonstrating why it has smaller bias when the true MI value is also small?
2. Please refer to weakness
3. Given the inconsistent performance of different $f$-divergence MI estimator, how can we choose the suitable one in practice?

### weaknesses:
 I would like to express my sincere respect for all the efforts the authors have invested in this paper. Unfortunately, however, I cannot strongly recommend this paper as an ICLR 2024 accepted paper for the following reasons: (1) discrepancies between claims and content, (2) ambiguous presentation in the important theoretical analysis part, and (3) concerns about the validity of the experimental evaluation of the proposed method. The details are provided below. If there are any misunderstandings, I apologize, and I would appreciate it if you could explain them to me.

## Discrepancies between claims and content
- The authors claimed that their derangement training strategy achieves the unbounded MI estimation. However, I couldn't found out the theory and proof to justify this claim unless I'm misreading. I can only see that they only showed that the permutation bound is bounded by $\log N$. I read the experimental part, but could not find anything to support this claim either. At this stage, the contributions mentioned in the introduction do not align with the content, and I am compelled to express concerns regarding the validity of this research paper.
- Is it possible to overcome the $\log N$ upper bound on the mutual information neural estimation through the maximization of the variational lower bound, perhaps by employing a simple technique such as derangements? The recent paper [1] has shown that, not just CPC, **any distribution-free high-confidence lower bound on mutual information estimated from $N$ samples cannot be larger than $\mathcal{O}(\log N)$**. When I first read the preface of this paper and found the claim that unbounded estimation had been achieved despite such serious statistical limitations, I was both surprised and hopeful. However, I am disappointed to discover that there is no theoretical basis or related discussion to support this assertion.

## Ambiguous presentation in the important theoretical analysis part
- The theoretical analysis in Sections 4 and 5 is the most crucial part of this paper as it provides strong support for the favorable properties of the method proposed in this paper. Nevertheless, the presentation in these sections introduces assumptions, notations, and proof sketches abruptly before delving into the discussion of the results obtained. This made it quite challenging to grasp the intent and content when I first read it. I believe that it would be challenging for readers to comprehend the content on first encounter if the section's opening does not provide an outline of what is to be demonstrated and the results obtained before sharing the proof's details.
- Given that the primary purpose here is to present theoretical results, it would be advisable to organize them as theorems or proposition and provide formal proofs in the main text or in an appendix for clarity and thoroughness (Just to reiterate, I would like to declare that I understand that the proofs for Lemma 1, 2, and other such elements used in the explanatory proofs of each section are provided in the appendices.).
- I believe that readability is a crucial element in effectively presenting the main theoretical claims. Currently, it is necessary to read the content multiple times to understand it to some extent, which can lead to the final intended message becoming unclear. Additionally, I'm concerned about important theoretical aspects being placed in the appendix. For instance, isn't Lemma 3 an important property of the proposed estimator?

## Concerns about the validity of the experimental evaluation of the proposed method
- I also have concerns regarding the validity of interpreting the experimental results.The authors claim that from the experimental results presented in Figure 1, their proposed f-DIME estimator achieves lower variance compared to conventional methods (MINE, NWJ, SMILE). However, at least to me, it doesn't seem like there is a significant difference. I've also examined the experimental results in Fig. 2-5 and the Appendix, but it appears that there are no results provided to substantiate this claim. Even when reviewing Table 1, which provides quantitative evaluations, it is clear that C PC consistently achieves good performance in terms of variance, which contradicts this claim entirely. I hope it's my misinterpretation, but it's quite challenging to accept this claim as valid.
- The precision of the f-DIME estimator doesn't seem to be consistently good overall. However, there's no mention of this, and in fact, it's claimed to be robust to changes in data size and dimension. To me, it appears that NJEE and SMILES are rather stable. For instance, in Fig. 2, the accuracy of HD-DIME w./ separable in the cubic case seems to deteriorate compared to Fig. 1. It's challenging to confirm the proposed method's exceptional robustness based on these experimental results.
- Is it correct to say that the estimator in the "deranged" setting (the green line) is the most crucial among the f-DIME estimators, such as GAN-DIME? It appears that its accuracy is inferior to other methods in many experiments. However, there is no discussion addressing this, which leaves questions about the claim in the introduction that the proposed approach is state-of-the-art.

## MISC
- I recommend adhering to the ICLR format. The authors seem to have mistakenly used a different font style from the original ICLR template. This is evident, for instance, in the title where the font appears distinct. Furthermore, there also seems to be a slightly wider character spacing throughout the document. This could be a candidate for a desk reject.

- I would greatly appreciate your response to the concerns outlined in the weakness section, with particular attention to the discrepancies between the claims of contributions and the interpretation of experimental results in contrast to the actual findings, as these are the most crucial issues requiring attention.

### Summary
The paper introduces Discriminative Mutual Information Estimator (f-DIME) as a family of mutual information (MI) estimators based on the relation between the dual representation of f-divergences and the ratio between joint and marginal distributions. A theoretical section first justifies f-DIME by characterizing the variance of the estimators with respect to other popular estimation strategies in the literature, then motivates the use of derangements instead of permutations when training the discriminative ratios. Experimental results confirm that f-DIME results in competitive MI estimation, showcasing the effect of the choice of f-divergence and the use of derangements on simple tasks.

### Strengths
1) The paper addresses a relevant problem in the literature, proposing a well-motivated strategy to mitigate the variance of discriminative MI estimators. 

2) Claims in the paper are backed up by a solid theoretical analysis.

3) Section 6 includes a meaningful analysis of the computation time as a function of the batch size for various critic architectures.

### Weaknesses
1) The experiments included in the main text are quite limited since they consider solely simple unimodal distributions. The reported experimental evidence seems limited to support the claim that f-DIME offers higher accuracy when compared to other estimators in the literature.

2) The paper mentions the similarity between SMILE, GAN-DIME (and JS in [1]), further discussion is required to better underline the differences between the estimators, especially considering that the performance seems hardly distinguishable. 

 3) Although the proposed method is novel in the context of mutual information estimation, the paper builds upon a well-established theory on the estimation of f-divergences. The comparison between the use of permutations and derangements to produce samples from $p({\bf x})p({\bf y})$ is also novel although similar methods have been already used in practice in existing implementations.
   
 4) Many relevant parts of the theory and the experimental results are not included in the main text. I would recommend restructuring the submission by potentially moving detailed descriptions of existing estimators into the appendix.

### Questions
1) The analysis in section 4 focuses on characterizing the variance of the f-DIME estimator (equation 12), but the convergence of the ratio estimator $T({\bf x},{\bf y})$ is determined by the variance of the training objective in equation 10. Does the training variance for the objective in 10 relate to the sub-optimality (bias) of the estimator?

2) What are the main differences between GAN-DIME/JS and KL-DIME/NWJ? I believe that a more direct experimental comparison could provide additional value to the submission.

3) Is there any rationale behind the choice of $f$-divergence to use for f-DIME? What are the main advantages and downsides of each choice, and how do relate to $f$?

### Summary
This paper extended the mutual information neural estimators (MINE) by using f-divergence in the variational form of mutual information. The variance of the proposed estimator is analyzed in Section4. In section 5, the authors proposed a derangement strategy in order to solve the problem caused by the "fixed points" after permutation. The proposed estimators are tested via high-dimensional linear and nonlinear Gaussian synthetic datasets.

### Strengths
This paper extended the MINE using f-divergence. As we know, f-divergence is a wide generalization of many different divergence measures in information theory. So f-MINE can be a very natural but general framework for a family of MINE-like estimators. A more general framework will always be helpful for a deeper understanding of these estimators.

### Weaknesses
I think the relation between f-MINE proposed in this paper and previous estimators is still not explained very clearly. Also, it is good to explore more about the bias, variance and the derangement strategy. Please refer to the specific questions listed below. Thanks.

### Questions
1. Will f-MINE be degenerated to traditional MINE, or other estimators reviewed in Section 2, by choosing different f? If so, then f-MINE is a more general framework. If not, which estimators can be degenerated from f-MINE and which ones can not? It's good to make these clear in order to connect f-MINE with previous works.
2. Is the variance of f-MINE related to the choices of f in theory? If so, how to choose f to minimize the variance. If not in theory, can we observe the same or similar variance for arbitrary choice of f?
3. What about the bias of f-MINE. When the variance is analyzed, the readers are always curious about the bias.
4. It seems that the experiments in Section 6 are all based on derangement strategy proposed in Section 5. In order to prove the usefulness of derangement, it is good to compare the results without derangement.

### Summary
This submission presented a solution to mutual information estimation for high-dimensional data using the variational formulation of f-divergence. The author(s) pointed out that naive permutation-based shuffling upper bounds the MI estimate via log(N), and therefore advocate a novel shuffling scheme called derange. The claims are validated using numerical experiments with simple Gaussian variables.

### Strengths
The author(s) have presented a novel variational mutual information estimator inspired by f-GAN. The proposed estimator employs a two-stage estimation procedure: (1) optimizing the value function with respect to the critic; (2) estimating the mutual information based on the estimated critic. A key claim of the proposed estimator is that it does not involve any partition function estimation, which is a contributor to extra variance. The author(s) further presented rigorous variance analyses and presented a novel shuffling scheme called derangement to overcome the log(N) cap from vanilla permutation.

### Weaknesses
* Inadequate literature coverage and missing baselines. Technically the author(s) are proposing a GAN-like MI estimator, where an f-divergence-based function is optimized to learn the density ratio, then plug in that density ratio estimate into the MI definition to approximate the MI. This is similar in spirit to the DIM work [1], where the JSD objective (also an f-divergence) was used. The authors should clarify how the proposed method differs fundamentally from optimizing the JSD objective in terms of the resultant MI estimator. Also, the idea of dropping the partition function to reduce estimation variance for MI has also been explored in the work of FLO [2], where similar Fenchel duality is applied to cast the log(partition) into a nested optimization problem. A more thorough comparison should be made with FLO, specifically regarding how the proposed two-stage estimation procedure compares to the nested optimization in FLO in terms of variance reduction. Also highly relevant is the work of RenyiCL [3], where skewed Renyi divergence is used as a more generic mutual information measure that enjoys bounded variance for numerical estimation. The authors should discuss how the proposed estimator relates to the Renyi divergence and whether it can be extended to incorporate the skewed version for improved variance properties.

* Weak experiments. The author(s) only compared different estimators on the toy multi-dimensional Gaussian data, which is inadequate by today's standard. The variational MI estimators are extensively used in self-supervised representation learning (e.g., CLIP, SimCLR, etc.), and the current work failed to provide convincing evidence that the proposed estimator can reliably handle high-dimensional complex data in such applications. For instance, the authors could have evaluated their method on benchmark image datasets like CIFAR-10 or ImageNet, where MI estimation is used for representation learning. They should demonstrate the performance of their estimator in such settings and compare it with state-of-the-art methods.

* The statement that "However, Monte Carlo sampling renders MINE a biased estimator. " is inaccurate. The bias comes from Jensen's inequality applied to the non-linear logarithmic function within the expectation, not Monte Carlo sampling itself. Monte Carlo sampling introduces variance but not necessarily bias if done correctly.

* The statement "Although MINE provides a tighter bound $I_{MINE} ≥ I_{NWJ}$, the NWJ estimator is unbiased." is also misleading. Both MINE and NWJ can be tight estimators given a sufficiently expressive critic. The tightness depends on the critic's capacity, not the estimator itself. Note that MINE is an approximation to MI, while NWJ is a formal lower bound, so technically you can not compare the two with an inequality. They are different quantities, and it's more accurate to say that NWJ provides a lower bound, while MINE provides an estimate that can be either an upper or lower bound depending on the critic.

* The notation of permutation function $\sigma(y)$ is not common in the statistical literature and causes confusion. The more standard notation for a permutation function is $\pi$.

### Questions
I have trouble understanding the following statements to fully appreciate the proposed solution and dearrangement

* "The partition function estimation $\mathbb{E}_{p_X^N p_Y^N}[\hat{R}]$ represents the major issue when dealing with variational MI estimators"
* "Viceversa, the derangement of y, denoted as $\sigma(y)$, leads to N new random pairs (xi,yj) such that $i \neq j$,$\forall i$ and $j \in {1,··· ,N}$."
* "Denote with K the number of points $y_k$, with $k \in {1, . . . , N }$, in the same position after the permutation (i.e., the fixed points)."
