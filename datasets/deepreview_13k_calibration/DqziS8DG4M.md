## Abstract
We present Point2SSM, a novel unsupervised learning approach for constructing correspondence-based statistical shape models (SSMs) directly from raw point clouds. SSM is crucial in clinical research, enabling population-level analysis of morphological variation in bones and organs. Traditional methods of SSM construction have limitations, including the requirement of noise-free surface meshes or binary volumes, reliance on assumptions or templates, and prolonged inference times due to simultaneous optimization of the entire cohort. Point2SSM overcomes these barriers by providing a data-driven solution that infers SSMs directly from raw point clouds, reducing inference burdens and increasing applicability as point clouds are more easily acquired. While deep learning on 3D point clouds has seen success in unsupervised representation learning and shape correspondence, its application to anatomical SSM construction is largely unexplored. We conduct a benchmark of state-of-the-art point cloud deep networks on the SSM task, revealing their limited robustness to clinical challenges such as noisy, sparse, or incomplete input and limited training data. Point2SSM addresses these issues through an attention-based module, providing effective correspondence mappings from learned point features. Our results demonstrate that the proposed method significantly outperforms existing networks in terms of accurate surface sampling and correspondence, better capturing population-level statistics.

### Summary
This paper proposes a method, Point2SSM, for the task of correspondence-based statistical shape modeling(SSM), This refers to mapping a shape to a set of $M$ keypoints (correspondence points (CPs) in the paper). The CPs must accuractely summarize a shape and correspond to consistent anatomical features such that they can be used, e.g., with PCA, to compute population level statistics.

Point2SSM maps $N$ input points to $M$ CPs. It consists of a dynamic graph CNN (DGCNN) encoder which outputs a feature vector for each input point. Then, self-feature augment (SFA) attention is applied on the feature vectors. Softmax is then applied to produce an $M x N$ attention matrix that maps the input points to the CPs. Point2SSM is trained in an unsupervised fashion. A Chamfer loss is used to ensure the CPs accurately summarizes the input shape and an adapted pairwise mapping error (ME) is used to ensure the CPs correspond to consistent features. While each components of Point2SSM does not seem novel, their combination is.

The authors compare Point2SSM with several recent and relevant methods on three datasets of spleens, pancreases, and left atriums. They show that Point2SSM summarizes shapes significantly better than the compared methods, while being competitive regarding the consistency of the CPs. They perform additonal experiments showing improved robustsness and include ablation experiments in the supplementary that shows the benefit of each component.

### Strengths
- The paper is well written. It is well motivated and it is clear how the method works and how the experiments are set up.
- The results show clear improvements over the compared approaches.
- The experiments are comprehensive enough to demonstrate the benefits of Point2SSM.
- The use of the attention module provides clear benefits - this is a nice finding.

### Weaknesses
 - The method seems to have significant overlap with the ISR method from Chen et al., 2020. Specifically, it seems to me that replacing PointNet++ with DGCNN + SFA in ISR would almost be the same method. This is not an issue for me, but: if true, I think the inspiration/similarities should be mentioned and Chen et al., 2020 cited in sec. 3.1. If false, I would like the authors to clarify the differences.
- It is stated that enforcing the CPs to be a convex combination of the input points "increases surface sampling accuracy". It is not fully clear to me why this must be true. From the attention maps in App. B, Fig. 7, right, CPs could be placed very inacurately even if they are convex combinations of the attended points. I would like clarification on this point. If it is an empircal observation, I would like it clearly stated (ideally, with an ablation experiment but this is not crucial to me).
- It is not clear to me why Point2SSM has such a benefit when it comes to adding new samples. How would this work? Would one "simply" continue training from previous weights, or does the architecture enable something smarter?
- Minor point: At the end of sec. 2.3, it is stated that: "These methods establish correspondence but are prone to overfitting given a limited training budget and are not robust to noise, missingness, and sparsity in the input point cloud." I find this to be a strong statement. Could it be softened or further justified?

### Questions
- Point2SSM has many more parameters than other models (App. E, Table 6.). Is comparing it with the much smaller models fair? Would "upscaling" the other models narrow the performance gap? I would like the authors to clarify why/why not.
- Top of page 5: please specify what "Euclidean neighbors" mean. As I can tell, it is the K-nearest neighbors - if so I suggest using that. While Lang et al., 2021 also used "Euclidean neighborhood", I think  it would make the text in this paper easier to read with another term.
- The text in the figures is very small. Also, blue text on blue background in Fig. 5 is hard to read. Improving this would make the results much easier to interpret.
- For the robustness experiments, it would be nice to illustrate how the pertubations look like. This can just be in the supplementary.
- For the sparse input experiment, how are the points sampled? Random, farthest point samping or other?
- When illustrating modes of variation, I find it more clear to deform the mean shape instead of showing deformation vectors. However, this is minor for me and the authors may choose to change it or not.
- Section 3.1, first line: second use of "unordered" seems redundant.

### Summary
The author introduces Point2SSM, a novel unsupervised learning approach designed for constructing statistical shape models (SSMs) from point clouds, a method crucial for analyzing morphological variation in anatomy in clinical research. Traditional SSM creation methods have limitations, such as the need for noise-free meshes, reliance on assumptions, and long inference times. Point2SSM addresses these issues by inferring SSMs from raw point clouds, a process that is more efficient and widely applicable due to the ease of acquiring point cloud data. Despite recent advances in deep learning for 3D point clouds, the construction of SSMs for anatomy faces challenges such as noisy or incomplete input and limited training data. Point2SSM overcomes these by using an attention-based module for correspondence mappings, demonstrating superior performance in surface sampling and correspondence, thus enhancing the capture of population-level anatomical statistics.

### Strengths
Point2SSM introduces a novel unsupervised learning framework that directly constructs SSMs from point clouds, a significant advancement over traditional methods. Additionally, this method addresses the limitations of classical SSM generation methods, such as the need for noise-free surface meshes and reliance on predefined templates. By incorporating local information, it utilizes a DGCNN encoder to learn features by incorporating local neighborhood information, capturing global semantic characteristics of anatomical shapes. Moreover, the attention module in Point2SSM predicts correspondence maps in a self-supervised manner, eliminating the need for labeled data. The results show robustness against noisy, partial, and sparse inputs, which is critical for clinical modeling.

### Weaknesses
Single Anatomy Modeling: Point2SSM's current limitation to model only one anatomical structure at a time could be expanded upon. How might the method be adapted to accommodate the study of multiple anatomical structures simultaneously, and could this expansion improve the model's understanding of the interrelationships between various anatomical features?

Pre-alignment Requirement: The necessity for pre-aligned input point clouds could restrict Point2SSM's use in scenarios with non-aligned data sources. What methods could be integrated into Point2SSM to automate the alignment process, or to make the model robust to variations in data orientation due to patient movement or diverse scanning protocols?

Uncertainty Quantification: The lack of uncertainty quantification in the model's outputs is a notable concern for clinical decision-making. Are there potential strategies for integrating uncertainty estimation into Point2SSM to make it more suitable for clinical environments where risk assessment and error margins are vital?

Performance with Sparse Data: While Point2SSM has demonstrated promising results with limited datasets, its performance with sparse data is not fully explored. Investigating this could provide insights into how the model might be optimized to better capture the variability and complexity of anatomical shapes, leading to more accurate and robust SSMs.

Model Expansion for Multiple Anatomies: Enhancing Point2SSM to handle misaligned inputs and model multiple anatomies could greatly increase its clinical relevance. How could the model be developed to not only process various anatomical structures within a single framework but also address the variations and interconnections between them?

### Questions
How could Point2SSM be modified to model multiple anatomical structures concurrently and understand their interrelationships?
What approaches could be integrated into Point2SSM to allow for automated pre-alignment or to make the model resilient to unaligned data from diverse orientations?
Are there methods to incorporate uncertainty quantification into Point2SSM's outputs to aid risk assessment in clinical decision-making?
How could Point2SSM be optimized for improved performance with sparse data, ensuring more accurate and robust statistical shape models?
In what ways could Point2SSM be developed to handle both misaligned data and the modeling of multiple anatomies within a single framework?

### Summary
This paper addresses a clinically relevant problem of statistical shape modeling from point cloud data of different anatomical structures. Specifically, the authors learn to reconstruct the point cloud and learn correspondence in a self-supervised manner. The results show improved SSM on three anatomical structures.

### Strengths
Strength:

+ The paper is well-motivated and has done a thorough literature review.

+ The results improve SSM performance over previous methods.

+ The method shows robustness against noisy, partial, and sparse input.

### Weaknesses
Major comments:
- Although the paper addresses a clinically relevant application, the technical novelty of this paper is limited since it is based on existing architecture and loss without any new insights or analysis. This remains a major weakness and is hard to address during rebuttal.
- Since the corresponding promoting loss acts between the minibatch samples, what is the effect of minibatch size on the model performance?
- Only three anatomical structures have been studied. The inclusion of more anatomical structures is needed to support the generalizability of the method.
- The methods describe the objective as reconstructing a sparse set of point reconstruction but, in practice, uses N=M=1024, which raises concern about the initial objective.

### Summary
The paper proposes a new model for learning statistical shape models (SSM) from unregistered 3D point cloud data for modelling anatomical shapes. The main contributions lie within the newly proposed architecture that enables attention based correspondences and later on more compact models, even from noisy or partial inputs.

### Strengths
The paper addresses an interesting and relevant problem that has not received enough attention in research yet. Shape models are very important for interpretable segmentation outputs.
The motivation and differentiation to related work is clear and the numerical and visual evaluation convincing. The visualisations are well done.
The paper discusses different mapping algorithms in detail and experimentally validates the positive aspects of the proposed global correspondence finding.

### Weaknesses
While the used metrics cover a good range of aspects from (Chamfer) surface distance to compactness and noise robustness, as well as a shape classification task in the supplement, other point distances e.g. density or rasterisation-based could have been explored. Specifically, metrics that capture the uniformity of point distribution, such as the standard deviation of point-to-point distances within a local neighborhood, could reveal if the learned correspondences lead to uneven sampling of the shape surface. Furthermore, while rasterization-based metrics might be sensitive to resolution, they could provide a complementary view by evaluating the overlap between the reconstructed surfaces and the original point clouds, especially in areas with high curvature or thin structures. The (compared) models have very many different aspects making a pin-pointing of the decisive difference harder. E.g. why did the authors not compare always the same geometric convolutional backbone / encoder for both correspondence and auto encoder-based solutions? This would isolate the impact of the correspondence mechanism more clearly. For example, using a consistent DGCNN encoder for both the proposed method and the autoencoder baseline would allow for a more direct comparison of the correspondence learning itself, rather than the combined effect of different encoders and correspondence approaches. The method requires the computation losses of all pair-wise alignments within one mini-batch, which is computationally expensive but also raises the question why the authors did not directly compare to groupwise point registration as another good baseline. This is especially relevant given the computational cost of the pairwise approach; a comparison to a groupwise method would help contextualize the trade-off between computational cost and performance gains.

### Questions
I wonder whether DPC is the optimal choice for a pairwise/groupwise correspondence model, as it does not consider instance optimisation which was shown to improve point registration nor does it create an unbiased mean for the shape model (but simply selects one reference cloud).
