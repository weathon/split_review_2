## Abstract
Monte Carlo (MC) integration has been employed as the standard approximation method for the Sliced Wasserstein (SW) distance, whose analytical expression involves an intractable expectation. However, MC integration is not optimal in terms of absolute approximation error. To provide a better class of empirical SW, we propose quasi-sliced Wasserstein (QSW) approximations that rely on Quasi-Monte Carlo (QMC) methods. For a comprehensive investigation of QMC for SW, we focus on the 3D setting, specifically computing the SW between probability measures in three dimensions. In greater detail, we empirically evaluate various methods to construct QMC point sets on the 3D unit-hypersphere, including the Gaussian-based and equal area mappings, generalized spiral points, and optimizing discrepancy energies. Furthermore, to obtain an unbiased estimator for stochastic optimization, we extend QSW to Randomized Quasi-Sliced Wasserstein (RQSW) by introducing randomness in the discussed point sets. Theoretically, we prove the asymptotic convergence of QSW and the unbiasedness of RQSW.}.

### Summary
Sliced Wasserstein distance is a commonly used measure of distance between probability measures, whose evaluation involves a usually intractable integral term. Standard evaluation of the integral term is based on Monte Carlo integration, which has an estimation error that depends sub-optimally on the number of samples. This paper fills the hole in literature of computing Sliced Wasserstein distance using Quasi-Monte Carlo methods and Randomized Quasi-Monte Carlo methods. Multiple variants are proposed, and some new ideas for randomization over the sphere are discussed. Adequate experimental results are provided to demonstrate the improvement over Monte Carlo methods.

### Strengths
1. The paper is well-written and mostly clear.
2. Adequate background and literature review are provided.
3. The visualizations are very nice.
4. Lots of numerical experiments are conducted and many of them are realistic data examples.

### Weaknesses
1. The paper is mostly a combination of existing methods, which lacks certain novelty. However, this paper is a helpful reference for people that needs to numerically compute Sliced Wasserstein distance, so it seems worth publishing in ICLR or somewhere similar.
2. The randomized QMC method for Sliced Wasserstein distance is motivated by stochastic optimization, but it could also be used to obtain confidence intervals on the estimates. This is probably worth discussing, both in theory and with applications.



### Questions
In the numerical experiments, while the reported statistics in the tables typically demonstrate significant improvements, such improvement is hard to see from the visualized figures. What are some observable differences in the figures between SW and QSW (e.g. CQSW)?

### Summary
The paper proposes novel quasi-Monte Carlo (QMC) method for sliced Wasserstein distance (SW), which utilizes various QMC point sets to approximate the integration over uniform distribution on the unit sphere that arises from SW. Specifically, the paper investigates the construction of point sets that approximate the uniform distribution on unit sphere, aiming to obtain lower absolute error, compared to naive MC estimator of SW. Furthermore the paper provides methods to randomize the constructed point sets to obtain unbiasedness, in addition to consistency. Lastly the paper provides empirical study of the error of the proposed estimator, and applications of QMC SW that suggests better performance.

### Strengths
The paper is overall clear and well presented, and the results are original and novel to the knowledge of the reviewer. The strengths of the paper includes:
1. The absolute error reduction is a novel perspective, as traditional SW estimators only guarantees consistency and unbiasedness, but a bound for the absolute error is usually missing. This paper sheds new light on the faithfulness of SW estimating beyond MC regime.
2. The paper provides a thorough investigation of the construction of equally-spaced points on the unit sphere, which is of wider interest as it is in general an open problem on 2 dimensions and beyond. The proposed methods all seem promising, and their incorporation into machine learning tasks seems interesting.
3. The paper provides extensive experiments, which seem sufficient for justifying the practicality of the proposed estimators.

### Weaknesses
Some weaknesses:
1. The contributions seem limited, as the paper mainly applies existing QMC methods to SW estimation, whereas little was investigated on how QMC and SW interact. Specifically, the paper claims that the Koksma-Hlawka inequality is the main guarantee of lower absolute error. While all listed QMC methods do achieve low discrepancy, on the SW side it does not seem trivial to claim that the SW integrand satisfies the smoothness assumption for the absolute error bound to hold. For instance, for general $\mu,\nu$, the integrand $W_p^p(\theta\mu,\theta\nu)$ only seems to be Lipschitz in $\theta$, which does not imply bounded HK variation in higher dimensions [1]. The BV condition should be verified before claiming the applicability of the inequality. A more thorough investigation is needed to justify the use of Koksma-Hlawka in this context, given that the sliced Wasserstein distance involves a sorting operation, which is non-smooth, and the projection of measures which may not preserve smoothness. The paper needs to address the smoothness of the integrand with respect to the projection direction more directly.
2. Related to the previous item, when applying the Koksma-Hlawka inequality, the discrepancy was empirical CDF error. It is unclear why the paper then switches to spherical cap discrepancy, and how this is connected to the Koksma-Hlawka inequality. The reviewer agrees that this is a better measurement of the uniformity on sphere, but is not sure about how this directly contributes to bounding the absolute error. The paper should clarify the relationship between the empirical CDF error used in the Koksma-Hlawka inequality and the spherical cap discrepancy, and provide a more direct theoretical justification for the use of spherical cap discrepancy in bounding the error of the SW estimation. It is not clear if minimizing spherical cap discrepancy directly leads to a better SW estimate.

### Questions
Please see above (section Weaknesses) for details. Some more questions:
1. The paper used term 'low-discrepancy' twice w.r.t. 2 different discrepancies, and with different benchmark rates $O(L^{-1}\log L ^d)$ and $O(L^{-3/4}\sqrt{\log L})$. How are they related? And which is applicable to obtain the overall error bound for the proposed estimator?
2. Integration over the sphere is a classical numerical analysis problem. Another class of method that seems reasonable is cubature, see [1], with the most notable difference being that the weight is not uniform. Is it possible to use this class of method for estimation of SW? It seems the smoothness requirement for cubature is not any worse than that for QMC in the paper.

### Summary
This work proposes several novel approximations for the calculation of Sliced Wasserstein distance. Prior works relied on Monte Carlo approximation of expectation in calculating SW distance. The authors propose to substitute it with Quasi-MC approximation of expectation which results in lower approximation error. The main idea behind it is to pick a deterministic set of uniformly distributed points (low-discrepancy sequences) instead of sampling them randomly as in standard MC. The authors propose and evaluate four different strategies to obtain these low-discrepancy sequences on the unit hypersphere, all suitable for QMC calculation of SW distance. They prove that QSW converges to SW in the case of infinite integration points.

Additionally, they propose a randomized version of QSW which they prove to be an unbiased estimator of SW, which allows for unbiased estimation of SW gradients, which leads to improved optimization with RQSW objective.

In the experiments, the authors: (1) show the reduction of the SW approximation error by computing all the different distance approximations between point clouds sampled on the surfaces of 3D shapes; (2) perform point cloud interpolation and image style transfer by interpolation using the gradients of different approximations; (3) train an autoencoder for point clouds using QSW and RQSW as training objectives. (1) and (2) show considerable improvements compared to the baseline SW estimation with MC. For (3) there are improvements but the results seem not to be statistically significant.

### Strengths
1. The paper is well-written and is easy to follow.

2. The proposed methods for SW distance approximation seem to consistently outperform the regular MC SW distance approximation.

3. The authors present the approach in a mathematically rigorous manner and prove the main results of the paper.

### Weaknesses
1. The improved SW approximation seems not to translate its benefits in large-scale training experiments. It might be worthwhile to recheck that with more powerful auto-encoder architectures, which can better benefit from the improved distance approximation.

2. Figure 1 is not very informative (might be moved to supplementary?), some figures are too small (fig 1, 2), and point clouds in all the figures are too small.

3. There is the complexity analysis of approximations in the paper, but it still will be nice to see a computation time comparison for all the different approximations.

### Questions
Related to W.3, empirically, how efficient in terms of time are all the presented approximations?

### Summary
In this paper, it is proposed to approximate the Sliced-Wasserstein distance (SW) using Quasi-Monte Carlo methods instead of the usual Monte-Carlo approximation. Authors discuss and compare several methods to generate a point set with low spherical cap discrepancy in order to generate uniform samples on the sphere. Then, they also propose a randomized version which is useful to obtain a better estimate of the gradient. Finally, they show the usefulness of QMC approximation of SW on different tasks such as comparison of point clouds, point-cloud interpolation, image style transfer or deep point-cloud autoencoders.

### Strengths
Finding better estimates of the Sliced-Wasserstein distance is a nice problem which can improve the results in applications using SW. This work discusses and compares many different methods to construct point sets to generate uniform samples on the sphere, which is not something very common to the best of my knowledge. Furthermore, the results of the application demonstrate well the superiority of the differents methods compared to the usual Monte-Carlo estimator of SW.

- Discussion of different construction of point sets with low discrepancy and allowing to generate uniform samples on the sphere
- Application of these different point sets to approximate SW
- A randomized version to improve the estimate of the gradient
- Different applications which show well the benefits of the different point sets to approximate SW

### Weaknesses
 - The figures are generally too small which makes them hard to read properly (especially Figure 1 and 2)
- The experiments are only focused on the case $S^2$, which is already nice, but I believe that some of the methods work for higher dimension and could therefore have been tested.



### Questions
Why is Proposition 1 not valid for the Maximizing distance version?

"Since the QSW distance does not require resampling the set of projecting directions at each evaluation time, it is faster to compute than the SW distance if QMC point sets have been constructed in advance": I guess we could also use the same samples for the evaluation of different SW (even though I agree this is not really in the spirit of the computation of SW).
