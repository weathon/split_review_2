## Abstract
Mesh deformation plays a pivotal role in many 3D vision tasks including dynamic simulations, rendering, and reconstruction. However, defining an efficient discrepancy between predicted and target meshes remains an open problem. A prevalent approach in current deep learning is the set-based approach which measures the discrepancy between two surfaces by comparing two randomly sampled point-clouds from the two meshes with Chamfer pseudo-distance. Nevertheless, the set-based approach still has limitations such as lacking a theoretical guarantee for choosing the number of points in sampled point-clouds, and the pseudo-metricity and the quadratic complexity of the Chamfer divergence. To address these issues, we propose a novel metric for learning mesh deformation. The metric is defined by sliced Wasserstein distance on meshes represented as probability measures that generalize the set-based approach. By leveraging probability measure space, we gain flexibility in encoding meshes using diverse forms of probability measures, such as continuous, empirical, and discrete measures via \textit{varifold} representation. After having encoded probability measures, we can compare meshes by using the sliced Wasserstein distance which is an effective optimal transport distance with linear computational complexity and can provide a fast statistical rate for approximating the surface of meshes. To the end, we employ a neural ordinary differential equation (ODE) to deform the input surface into the target shape by modeling the trajectories of the points on the surface. Our experiments on cortical surface reconstruction demonstrate that our approach surpasses other competing methods in multiple datasets and metrics.

### Summary
This work addresses the challenge of efficiently measuring the discrepancy between predicted and target 3D meshes, a key component in various 3D vision tasks. The paper introduce a novel metric for learning mesh deformation, defined by the sliced Wasserstein distance. This metric operates on meshes represented as probability measures, which generalize the set-based approach. This approach offers computational efficiency, flexibility in encoding mesh representations, and outperforms other methods in cortical surface reconstruction experiments.

### Strengths
This work introduces a novel representation for triangle meshes as probability measures, which generalizes the common set-based approach within a learning-based deformation network. To be precise, the paper outlines three forms of mesh representation as probability measures: continuous, empirical, and discrete measure through the utilization of oriented varifolds. And the authors present a novel learning-based framework DDOT for Diffeomorphic mesh Deformation framework via an efficient Optimal Transport metric, which leverages an efficient Optimal Transport metric. DDOT enables the learning of continuous dynamics to smoothly deform an initial mesh into a complex shape. 

The paper is presented in a clear and structured manner, making it easy for readers to understand the proposed methods and experimental results. The work demonstrats improved performance over existing state-of-the-art methods in experiments on multiple brain datasets, particularly in terms of EMD, SWD, ASSD, CN an SI.

### Weaknesses
The authors depict a mesh as an oriented varifold, a pivotal concept in this paper. However, for enhanced clarity and accessibility, it's better to provide a concise introduction to oriented varifolds, even though the foundational idea is rooted in earlier works. This brief overview will promote a fundamental understanding of oriented varifolds and their importance in our study, improving the paper's readability.

### Questions
1. Is the initial surface in your method the same as the initial surfaces used in competing methods, which are also extracted from the white matter segmentation mask of the brain MRI image?
2. How about the topological information of the initial surface and the ground truth surfaces? Are they all genus-0 surfaces? Does the DDOT framework maintain the topological information during the deformation process?
3. It is better to give a brief introduction of oriented varifold for paper's readability.

### Summary
This work introduces a learning-based diffeomorphic deformation network that employs sliced Wasserstein distance as the objective function to deform an initial mesh to a complicated mesh based on volumetric input. The work proposes to present triangle meshes as probability measures that generalize the common set-based approach in a learning-based deformation network; the work proposes the sliced Wasserstein distance as a metric  for learning mesh deformation, and proved the convergence rate is solely determined by the number of samples, independent of the dimensionality; the work conducts extensive experiments on white matter reconstruction by employing neural ODE, which show the proposed method outperforms the SOTA in terms of geometric accuracy, self-intersection and consistency.

### Strengths
1. This work has solid theoretic foundation, especially the theorem 1 is novel and promising, which shows sliced Wasserstein distance metric   has faster convergence rate than others, and suitable for practical applications.
2. The experimental results are thorough and convincing, the reconstruction mesh quality is good for geometric analysis purposes.
3. The work is well written, the representation is clear, the logic is clean, and the theoretic deduction is explained in details.

### Weaknesses
The proposed method to represent a mesh as a distribution in the position-orientation space, and the optimal transportation map is carried out in this space. It should be explained the cost function, and also this representation depends on the position and the orientation of the mesh, and the Wasserstein distance varies if one mesh is transformed by a rigid motion.

### Questions
1. What is the cost function defined on the position-orientation space? 
2. Does the Wasserstien distance vary when one mesh is transformed under a rigid motion ?
3. Why use the position-orientation space to represent the mesh measure? Why not just use position space?
4. Can we say something about the regularity of the optimal transportation map? Is it diffeomorphic ?

### Summary
This paper presents a learning-based diffeomorphic deformation network that employs sliced Wasserstein distance (SWD) as the objective function to deform an initial mesh to an intricate mesh based on volumetric input. Different from previous approaches that use point-clouds for approximating mesh, it represents a mesh as a probability measure that generalizes the common set-based methods. By lying on probability measure space, it can exploit statistical shape analysis theory to approximate mesh as an oriented varifold. It proves a theorem that shows that leveraging sliced Wasserstein distance to optimize probability measures can have a fast statistical rate for approximating
the surfaces of the meshes. The main application is on brain cortical surface reconstruction. Experiment results demonstrate that the proposed method surpasses existing state-of-the-art competing works in terms of geometric accuracy, self-intersection ratio, and consistency.

### Strengths
The paper proposes a new metric for learning mesh deformation defined by sliced Wasserstein distance on meshes represented as probability measures that generalize the set-based approach. By leveraging probability measure space, it can gain flexibility in encoding meshes using diverse forms of probability measures, such as continuous, empirical, and discrete measures via varifold representation. The new metric seems novel and works well.

### Weaknesses
The paper is very math-heavy and is relatively hard to read for non-experts. The results seem limited to the brain surface. The authors do mention the limitation, which I assume would be a high requirement on the mesh quality. I would like to see more details on that, i.e. how applicable this method is on a common dataset/mesh. The genus zero requirement might be another limitation? can we extend it to shapes of other topology?

### Summary
The paper proposes to learn a diffeomorphic flow using sliced Wasserstein distance (SWD), instead of classical chamfer distance (CD) and earth mover distance (EMD). Such a design choice is not tried before in the context of mesh optimization. The authors shows that SWD leads to better performance, compared to some diffeomorphic flow baselines using other losses.

### Strengths
- The proposed solution is simple: just to replace CD with SWD.
- The authors provide theoretical justification for the benefit of using SWD.
- The authors show better quantitative and qualitative results on mesh optimization to reconstruct the cortical structure, compared to some baselines on the same task.

### Weaknesses
 - The novelty of the idea is limited -- optimizing meshes with CD and/or earth mover distance (EMD) between sampled point clouds is not new (for instance [1]). Replacing EMD with another distributional distance seems more or less some pure trial-and-error endeavor. Indeed, the paper [2] has shown that optimization with SWD on point clouds is beneficial. It is therefore not surprising that SWD can be used for mesh optimization.

 - I feel that the math for the probabilistic interpretation, although probably not explicitly presented in the context of mesh optimization, is unnecessary at least from the practical point of view, especially given that EMD has already been used for mesh optimization.

 - The presentation of the paper needs to be improved. There are many notations not explained (e.g., the # operator in Eqn. 5).

 - While the proposed method seems general, the scope of this paper is quite limited to cortical structures. The authors may consider trying the proposed method on general shapes and compare the results on common benchmarks (if any).



### Questions
1. I am not sure if the computation of chamfer distance (CD) should be slower than that of SWD. Some paper argues that the complexity of SWD is similar to CD [2]. And by using KD-tree for nearest neighbor retrieval or some recent methods [3], one should be able to compute CD much faster. I would like the authors explain the speed difference between CD and SWD shown in Fig. 3.

2. There are some improved variants of CD, such as [4]. Just out of curiosity: how do they perform compared to SWD?
