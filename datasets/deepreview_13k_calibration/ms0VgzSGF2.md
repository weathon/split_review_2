## Abstract
Representations are at the core of all \emph{deep} reinforcement learning (RL) methods for both Markov decision processes (MDPs) and partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs). Many representation learning methods and theoretical frameworks have been developed to understand what constitutes an effective representation. However, the relationships between these methods and the shared properties among them remain unclear. In this paper, we show that many of these seemingly distinct methods and frameworks for state and history abstractions are, in fact, based on a common idea of \emph{self-predictive} abstraction. 
Furthermore, we provide theoretical insights into the widely adopted objectives and optimization, such as the stop-gradient technique, in learning self-predictive representations.
These findings together yield a minimalist algorithm to learn self-predictive representations for states and histories. We validate our theories by applying our algorithm to standard MDPs, MDPs with distractors, and POMDPs with sparse rewards. These findings culminate in a set of preliminary guidelines for RL practitioners.}\looseness=-1

### Summary
The paper attempts at providing a unified view at self-predicting reinforcement learning. Different self-predicting representation targets are described, and the prior work is classified according to the target learned. Based on the unified view, a minimalist algorithm learning a self-predicting representation is learned. The algorithm is evaluated on a set of benchmarks.

### Strengths
The paper encompasses a broad range of recent and ongoing work on self-predicting RL, providing a unifying view. Theoretical results are presented, with proofs in the appendix. An algorithm proposed in the paper is evaluated on benchmarks.

### Weaknesses
The results in the paper are either trivial or indecisive. The paper is built around an insight that different works do similar things trying to optimize self-prediction of certain features, but this is, in my opinion, trivial. A classification of things that can be optimized for self-prediction is worth a survey, but this paper is not a survey. The paper uses a lot of abbreviations, the proofs a sketchy and uncommented, and veryfiying or even following the proofs takes tremendous effort.

The empirical evaluation is unconvincing. According to the plots presented in the paper, the proposed unified algorithm does not outperform (and does not always perform comparably) to algorithms from the literature. Looking at the algorithm pseudocode and implementation, this is not surprising, given that the 'minimalist algorithm' is more of a boilerplate, which, when filled with details, reduces to one of the earlier published algorithms. However, any practical implementation requires attending to details, which the unifying minimalist algorithms fails to achieve. 

The paper would be extremely hard to follow, in my opinion, for an outsider, or for someone less familiar with the slang of a particular research group. For example, the paper discusses (and presents theoretical results) wrt to "stop-gradient" technique without formally defining the technique (which is described in passing and requires referring to the cited sources to understand the paper).

I believe that his research may have a potential, but for a publication, I would suggest deciding on a small subset of ideas among those sketched in this submission, presenting them thoroughly and rigorously, with proofs that are possible to follow, and accompanied by an implementation that brings competitive results, in some form.

### Questions
In the introduction, you are writing "However, this abundance of
methods may have inadvertently presented practitioners with a “paradox of choice”, hindering their
ability to identify the best approach for their specific RL problem." 

How does your paper help practitioners identify and use the best approach for their specific RL problem? Can you give an example of application? For example, suggest (and describe) a simple RL problem, and show how your result help choose the best solution.

### Summary
The paper proposes a conceptual framework for unifying many existing techniques for decision-making-focused representation learning based on the concept of "self-prediction". Within this framework, the paper then proposes a simple and seemingly novel "minimalist" approach to construct representations simply by training a model-free agent and simultaneously learning an abstract forward model while preventing gradients from flowing backward through the encoder from the targets. The framework allows a large number of representation learning methods to be evaluated side-by-side while controlling for other factors, which enables the paper to present and evaluate several hypotheses about the various learning objectives. The experiments suggest that the proposed "minimalist" approach works well.

### Strengths
Overall, this is a nice contribution!

The shared framework is helpful for comparing a seemingly endless number of decision-making-focused representation learning methods. It distills these methods down to their core representation learning ideas, which allows for comparing those ideas without needing to worry about the remaining complexity (such as the particular RL algorithm employed). I suspect the community will find this quite valuable.

The paper also offers interesting insights, such as the fact that online targets do not guarantee the same fixed points as the objectives with stop-gradients.

The proposed "minimalist" approach is extremely simple and clean. It's shocking that this hasn't been tried before, yet I cannot think of an example where it has. Time will tell if this approach generalizes to other problems, but if it does, it will greatly simplify many projects that rely on representation learning.

The experiments seem well designed, the baselines seem well chosen, and the results look promising. I particularly liked the experiments measuring the change in matrix rank over time---nice job. That is clear evidence that the method avoids representation collapse.

### Weaknesses
My concerns are minor.

- I'm not familiar with using the phrase "distracted MDPs" to mean MDPs with distracting elements.
- Maybe I'm wrong, but I feel like we already know that ZP + $\phi_{Q*}$ implies RP.
- Top of p5: The use of $\mathbb{P}$ and $\mathbb{Q}$ is confusing, given that $P$ and $Q$ are often overloaded in RL. The notation should be chosen to minimize the chance of confusion.
- Towards end of sec 4.2, last para: "...cosine similarity between columns of the learned $\phi$. As expected by Thm. 3, [...] stay several orders of magnitude smaller when using stop-gradient." How does Thm 3 predict low absolute cosine similarity? Because we start with full rank? It's not clear how the theorem implies this specific behavior.
- Fig 3. Kind of hard to distinguish lines. The plots could be improved for better readability.
- Sec 5, first para: would be helpful to summarize the findings when introducing the hypotheses. This would provide better context for the reader.
- p7, penultimate para: I don't know about similar sample efficiency in ant. It seems a lot worse. I also don't know if I agree with the conclusion that "the primary advantage ALM(3) brings to model-free RL, lies in the state representation rather than policy optimization, except for Humanoid." I feel like it's too soon to conclude something as sweeping as that. The evidence for this claim is not entirely convincing.
- Fig 5. A little difficult to read. See if maybe log return would help? The scale of the returns makes it hard to discern differences.
- Top of p9, minigrid experiment. This feels like a minor bait-and-switch. Normally minigrid uses pixels, no? And why does detached rank drop on minigrid when theory suggests it should remain high? The discrepancy between theory and experiment needs further clarification.
- "Validation of end-to-end hypothesis" (and throughout). It's a bit hard to keep track of which is which. Text uses $\phi_o$, $\phi_L$, but fig uses OP, ZP, RP+OP, RP+ZP. The inconsistent naming makes it difficult to follow the arguments.

### Questions
Do the authors have a clear recommendation on when to use OP vs ZP vs RP+[*]? It would be nice to have some clear takeaways after all this analysis.

### Summary
The paper proposes a unification of various state representation learning algorithms under the umbrella of self-predictive representations. They draw relations between different algorithms under their terminology and even suggest why stop-gradients are useful when learning self-predictive representations.

### Strengths
1. I agree very much with the paradox of choice that is stated in the paper. I think a unification is much needed, and this paper is valuable from that point of view.
2. The paper is generally well-written.
3. Table 1 and Figure 1 are useful to understand the framework.

### Weaknesses
1. While the main message of the paper seems clear, I am struggling to understand the core message of the empirical section. Few questions:
  - Should we be using minimalist over everything else? If so, ALM outperforming minimalist in Figure 3 on multiple occasions would not support that.
  - Is minimalist better than $\phi_{Q^{*}}$? I think this is somewhat obvious, which is the reason we have all these works on representation learning (this is not a criticism, just a remark).
  - Is it broadly to categorize the entire zoo of representation learning algorithms into their essential components i.e. $\phi_{Q^*}$, $\phi_L$, $\phi_O$ and just study how they perform empirically?
  - Misc point: 
     - I understand the point of the different loss function and representation collapse experiments, and those are useful.
     - It would be very useful to include $\textit{why}$ it is important to test the questions that are posed in Section 5, and what the final algorithm recommendation should be.
     - The paper discusses this paradox of choice, but I still find it unclear how to make a choice at the end of the paper.
2. The sample efficiency claims in Section 5.1 are unclear to me. It appears that ALM(3) outperforms $\phi_L$ in all cases. It is true that $\phi_L$ does better than $\phi_{Q^*}$, but the former does not seem to be. I would suspect that ALM(3) will do better because it is explicitly learning a reward model, whereas $\phi_L$ is suggesting that the reward model/representations are implicitly learned based on their implication graph.
3. Is there intuition for why $\phi_O$ may struggle with distractors? The question is posed in the empirical section, but it’s a bit unclear what motivates this question.

I should note that I do like the paper, but the above things are confusing. I would be willing to re-evaluate the score based on the response to the above.

### Summary
The work overviews existing abstractions for state/history representations and their "conditions", and, with an implication graph, shows how are they connected (supported by proofs). It overviews various RL algorithms and classifies them by which abstraction and conditions they use. Finally, based on their theoretical findings, the authors suggests a minimalist algorithm (and its variants), which they empirically evaluate and compare, from various angles.

### Strengths
The paper is concise and clearly written. It is noteworthy that the studied topic is very large and requires lot of details, and that the Appendix contains some interesting details and even novel contributions (e.g., details regarding the implication graph), which implies that a journal format would suit this work better. Nevertheless, the authors manged to fit the most interesting information in the page limit, and hence I will focus only on the main text. 

Given by the number of works focusing on representation learning (Table 1), it is clear that it is an important topic. Hence the theoretical connections given in the paper between the individual parts of the abstractions is very significant to avoid double and superfluous work. Also, the contribution about stop-gradients, connection to representation collapse and the experiments showing the rank of the weight matrices is very interesting. The theoretical part of the paper is very well done and would alone justify my rating of the paper. 

In the experimental section, the authors verify their theoretical contributions. The experiments about stop-gradients are good. The experiments showing different variants of the minimalistic algorithm (Figure 3) are somewhat inconclusive, or require further discussion (e.g., claims about better/similar performance compared to ALM(3), or no justification for superior performance of ALM on Humanoid). I appreciate the negative result in 5.2 for ZP objective hypothesis.

### Weaknesses
As mentioned, the paper sometimes outsources interesting details into the Appendix and the experiment in 5.1 is inconclusive and requires unbiased and fair discussion (also see questions).

Specifically, the claims about better/similar performance compared to ALM(3) in Figure 3 lack sufficient statistical rigor and discussion. The error bars are quite large, and it's not clear if the differences are significant. The discussion should include a more detailed analysis of the variance in performance across different runs, and perhaps include statistical tests to support the claims. Furthermore, the superior performance of ALM on Humanoid is not sufficiently justified. While the authors mention the use of SVG policy optimization, they do not provide a clear explanation of why this approach is particularly advantageous in high-dimensional tasks like Humanoid compared to the other environments. A deeper analysis of the gradient information and its impact on policy optimization in the Humanoid environment is needed.

### Questions
- In Sec. 5.2, you write: "Surprisingly, model-free RL (ϕ_{Q∗}) performs worse than ϕ_O." Isn't that expected?
- Given the scope of the article, why did you preferer conference vs. journal? (not answering this question can be understandable)
- Please elaborate on "This suggests that the primary advantage ALM(3) brings to model-free RL, lies in state representation rather than policy optimization" from Sec. 5.1. Isn't your model based on ALM? How does the stripped-down version of ALM (that you use as a basis for your augmentations) compare to ϕ_Q∗ (TD3)? Is it the same?

Suggestions:
- define FKL / RKL abbr. - good place good be on p. 5 after "includes forward and reverse KL".
- p. 5: detached from the computation graph [OR] using a copy ...
- in Fig. 6 caption, mention that RP+OP / RP+ZP are phased; it is not obvious what the difference is and why they should perform worse

Nitpicking:
- legend in Figure 5 is slightly different from the graphs
