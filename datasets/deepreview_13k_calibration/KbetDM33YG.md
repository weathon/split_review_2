## Abstract
Evaluating the performance of well-trained GNN models on real-world graphs is a pivotal step for reliable GNN online deployment and serving. 
Due to a lack of test node labels and unknown potential training-test graph data distribution shifts, conventional model evaluation encounters limitations in calculating performance metrics (\eg, test error) and measuring graph data-level discrepancies, particularly when the training graph used for developing GNNs remains unobserved during test time.
In this paper, we study a new research problem, \textit{online GNN evaluation}, which aims to provide valuable insights into the well-trained GNNs' ability to effectively generalize to real-world unlabeled graphs under the test-time graph distribution shifts.
Concretely, we develop an effective \underline{\textbf{\textsc{Le}}}arning \underline{\textbf{\textsc{Be}}}havior \underline{\textbf{\textsc{D}}}iscrepancy score, dubbed \textbf{\method}, to estimate the test-time generalization errors of well-trained GNN models. 
Through a novel GNN re-training strategy with a parameter-free optimality criterion, the proposed \method~comprehensively integrates learning behavior discrepancies from both node prediction and structure reconstruction perspectives.
This enables the effective evaluation of the well-trained GNNs' ability to capture test node semantics and structural representations, making it an expressive metric for estimating the generalization error in online GNN evaluation.
Extensive experiments on real-world test graphs under diverse graph distribution shifts could verify the effectiveness of the proposed method, revealing its strong correlation with ground-truth test errors on various well-trained GNN models.

### Summary
In this work, the authors proposed a new online GNN evaluation problem, which aims to provide the reference for practical GNN applications on real-world test graphs under test-time distribution shifts. To achieve the goal of estimating the test-time errors, the author proposed a novel GNN retraining strategy with a parameter-free optimality criterion, and this could lead to an effective LEBED score, as the output and the metric to evaluate well-trained GNNs in online setting. Experiments cover diverse distribution shifts, and on different gnn models, it also show correlation with true test error, demonstrating its effectiveness.

### Strengths
S1: Problem: online GNN evaluation is a relatively fresh research topic to me, I think the problem that the author identified is novel. And the evaluation definition, setting, and graph distribution shift types, are clear.

S2: Methodology: the author retrained previously trained GNN on the test graph and used a criterion to indicate the GNN is well optimized in a parameter-free manner. Following this, the distance between GNN training parameters is utilized to calculate the LEBED score. I think the entire methodology looks clear and with soundness.

S3: Experiments: the experiments are well designed, and the author attempted to cover different test graph distribution shift cases, which is good and looks convincing. The results in terms of Spearman rank correlation rou and linear fitting R2 well presents the effectiveness of LEBED. Different GNN models are covered in their evaluation. Ablation study, running time, hyperparameter sensitivity, correlation visualization are properly provided.

### Weaknesses
W1: in page 4, the authors argued that DPred. is used as the supervision signal for instructing the GNN retraining and DStru. as the self-supervison stop criterion, and according to my understanding, it might be not hard to use both of them to instruct GNN retraining, why only use the Dpred? It seems that using both could potentially lead to a more robust retraining process, especially if the structure-based loss provides complementary information to the prediction-based loss. The justification for using only DPred. is not entirely convincing, and a more thorough explanation of the potential benefits and drawbacks of incorporating both losses would be beneficial.

W2: in page 5 stage2, it seems like the proposed method requires the retraining process have the same initialization GNN model parameters? how to make sure this point? The paper does not clearly specify how the initial parameters of the GNN are preserved and reapplied during the retraining phase. This is a critical detail, as different initializations could lead to different retraining outcomes and affect the reliability of the LEBED score. The method should explicitly state the mechanism for ensuring consistent initialization.

W3: for the domain shift experiments, the author used 1/1/369 splits with three domains A, D, C in table.1, for example, does this mean, the training and validation implements on ACM dataset, but 369 test graphs from D and C? this part is not clearly clarfied enough. The description of the domain shift experiment setup is confusing. It is unclear how the training, validation, and test sets are constructed across the different domains. The paper should provide a more detailed explanation of the data splits and the specific graphs used for each stage of the experiment, including the number of graphs from each domain used in each set.

### Summary
This paper studies the training-test graph data distribution shift problem along with GNN model evaluation problem. 
Its method contains a GNN retraining part and a parameter-free optimality criterion. It develops a metric LEBED to estimate the test-time errors of trained GNN models, and this proposed metric can be taken as an indicator to show the performance of GNN on real-world test graphs without labels. Its experimental parts involves many evaluation models and graph datasets with distribution shifts covering node feature, domain, and temporal, the experimental results could demonstrate the metric's effectiveness under the online test-time GNN evaluation scenario.

### Strengths
1. The proposed online GNN evaluation problem under test-time graph distribution shift is insightful. It attempts to understand the well-trained GNN models' performance in the practical GNN model deployment and service scenario, which could be useful to real-world GNN development.

2. The introduction of the proposed evaluation metric is thoughtful with a relatively clear problem definition. The main idea of leveraging the GNN retraining discrepency to align the training-test graph discrepancy is comprehensible when the online scenario does not allow to access the training graphs.

3. The paper tests and evaluates their proposed LEBED metric on a wide range of real-world potential graph distribution shift datasets, it could provide empirical evidence of its practical utility as they claimed. Their findings can be interesting in that some existing CNN evaluation metrics would not commit consistent performance for GNNs.

### Weaknesses
1. In the dataset part, could you provide more details about how the graph distribution shifts are simulated in the experiments? And can these test graph datasets be publicly released?

2. Given the proposed GNN re-training process on test-time graphs, is the parameter-free criterion in Eq.(6) used for stopping the retraining but not being optimized in retraining? More explanations are needed here.

3. How is the ground-truth performance (test error) of these distribution-shifted test graphs on the online GNN models?

### Summary
This work proposed a metric named LEBED, learning behavior discrepancy score, for a new research problem "online GNN evaluation" in terms of the graph distribution shift issue during test time. By imitating the learning behavior in GNN training parameters, this metric could indicate the GNN model performance without the test graph labels through the parameter space distance between the training and test graphs. Moreover, this work contains a parameter-free optimality criterion which introduces graph structure information to guide GNN retraining on the test-time graphs. Experiments under different training-test graph shifts could verify its effectiveness.

### Strengths
The strength of the work:

(1) The overall idea and research topic of "online GNN evaluation" is interesting and novel for understanding the real-world GNN model performance, especially the graph distribution shift issue is also considered, making it more applicable.  This can be a new research direction that inspires future work on GNN model understanding and real-world deployment.

(2) The solution with the proposed LEBED metric for estimating test-time generalization error on graph data appears logical to me. With retraining GNN on the test unlabeled graphs with distribution shifts, its parameter space metric with the context of learning behavior discrepency is reasonable for GNN model evaluation, especially given its graph structure discrepency-related criterion.

(3) The experiments involve graphs with diverse distribution shift cases, domains, and scales, making this metric relatively convincing. And the performance of this method seems effective enough as they argued to indicate the test-time GNN performance.

(4) The paper is well-structured, and easy to understand. Its logic and writing look good to me.

### Weaknesses
Q1: How to explain that some baseline methods with some cases positive values but other cases negative values, more explanations of the experimental results should be provided here.

Q2: How easily can the proposed LEBED be integrated into existing GNN frameworks or pipelines, considering it seems a general GNN model evaluation method covering different models and test graph data?

Q3: Does retraining the GNN on unlabeled test graphs introduce significant computational overhead, and what about the time complexity?

### Summary
The paper explores the challenge of evaluating well-trained Graph Neural Network (GNN) models in real-world scenarios where test graph data lacks labels and may differ from the training data's distribution. To address this, the authors propose "Learning Behavior Discrepancy" (LEBED) as a score to assess a GNN's generalization ability under test-time distribution shifts. LEBED measures differences in learning behavior between a GNN trained on the training graph and one retrained on the test graph, considering both node prediction and structure reconstruction discrepancies. A novel GNN re-training strategy is introduced for this purpose. The paper's experiments demonstrate that the LEBED score strongly correlates with ground-truth test errors for various GNN models, offering an effective evaluation metric. The paper acknowledges certain assumptions and suggests addressing more complex distribution shifts in future research.

### Strengths
1.	Novel Research Problem: The paper addresses a novel research problem, online GNN evaluation. Previous works only consider test the GNN performance after training it. This paper proposes a new research problem that how to evaluate GNN’s performance under distribution shifts and no access to the original training data. From my perspective, it is an important and practical concern in the field of graph neural networks. This is a significant contribution as it explores the evaluation of GNNs under real-world conditions with distribution shifts and the absence of test node labels. It also paves the way to pre-training large-scale GNN models.

2.	Proposed Metric (LEBED): The paper introduces a novel metric, LEBED (Learning Behavior Discrepancy), which aims to estimate the generalization error of well-trained GNN models under distribution shifts. It re-trains the GNN under test data and then calculate the discrepancy of optimal weights between training and test data. Fig 2 gives a clear framework.

3.	Experimental Validation: The paper conducts extensive experiments on real-world test graphs under diverse distribution shifts, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed method. Datasets of various distribution shifts scenarios are provided, including node feature shifts, domain shifts and temporal shifts.

### Weaknesses
1.	Table 1 shows the test-time graph data. I wonder where did you get the pre-trained GNNs? What datasets were used for pre-training?
2.	In S2, GNN is re-trained was test data. However, if the same training data is used during S2, it will also cause difference of the optimal weights due to the randomness. Will this affect the LeBed score? In other words, is part of LeBed score caused by the randomness of training process? 
3.	Eq. 4 shows that Psuedo label $\mathbf{Y}_{\mathrm{te}}^*$ is from pre-trained GNN with test-time data, which has distribution shifts from original training data. Why is it can be used for the supervision of re-training? More explanations are expected here.
