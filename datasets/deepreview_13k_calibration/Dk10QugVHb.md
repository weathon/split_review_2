## Abstract
We propose the first experimental study to causally measure bias in social perception in the latent space of multi-modal models. Previous studies compute correlations between a model's social judgments and protected attributes, such as race, age, and gender, using observational wild-collected human-annotated datasets, such as FairFace. In order to establish causal links between protected attributes and algorithmic bias, we use a synthetic dataset of face images instead, CausalFace, where both legally protected attributes and potential confound attributes, such as facial expression, lighting, and pose, are controlled independently and systematically, and thus allow an experimental exploration, which lets us reach causal conclusions. Our analysis is based on measuring cosine similarities between images and word prompts, including valence words drawn from the two leading social psychology theories elucidating human stereotypes: The ABC Model and the Stereotype Content Model. We find that non-protected attributes are powerful confounds and profoundly influence social perception, injecting variability in measurements whose size is comparable to that induced by legally protected attributes. Clear intersecting biases of race, gender, and age only emerge when these unprotected attributes are controlled for, which is only possible using CausalFace. FairFace does not permit a similar level of insight due to spurious correlations introduced by uncontrolled attributes and a lack of specific annotations.

### Summary
In this work the authors investigate social perception biases in CLIP through the lens of social psychology. For this analysis, the authors use real-images and synthetic image datasets. The analysis reveal several interesting findings: pose and facial expression can have strong social perception, legally protected variables do not introduce greater biases than non-protected attributes.

### Strengths
**1. Originality:** I found this paper sufficiently novel. It deviates from the traditional way of measuring biases and systematically controlling the factors while measuring the biases.

**2. Well explained motivation:** The motivation provided in the introduction is excellent. It lays out the  disadvantages of the current bias studies and how they aim to solve those.

**3. Strong analysis along multiple axes:** The authors did an excellent job in providing detailed analysis along multiple axes eg: intersectional biases in Figure-2.

### Weaknesses
 **1. Clarity:** I found the paper little difficult to follow especially in the sections 3.2 in which the authors describe about theoretical frameworks of social phycology. The authors can provide more context about these frameworks and how are they related in the proposed study in the form of examples, figures etc. Specifically, the connection between the chosen social psychology frameworks (like the Stereotype Content Model) and the actual methodology of measuring biases in CLIP is not clearly articulated. It's unclear how the dimensions of warmth and competence, for example, are mapped onto the image features and the subsequent bias analysis. The paper would benefit from a more explicit explanation of this mapping, perhaps through a diagram or a more detailed walkthrough of the analysis process.

**2. Unaddressed questions about biases in synthetic datasets:** The authors didn't include discussion about potential limitations in the synthetic faces created using GANs. This is a significant oversight, as GANs are known to have biases in their training data, which could propagate into the generated images. For example, if the GAN is trained primarily on images of one demographic group, it might not be able to generate realistic images of other groups, or it might generate images that reinforce existing stereotypes. This could skew the results of the bias analysis and limit the generalizability of the findings. The authors should have discussed the potential impact of these biases on their results.

### Questions
1. Can these findings be applicable to other vision-language models?

2. Is there any reason to authors not using bias metrics like max-skewness or NDKL?

### Summary
The paper studies biases in CLIP using a synthetic dataset of images generated by GAN, which they refer to as CausalFace. The authors argue that synthetic data offers the opportunity to control for possible confounding factors, such as lighting and pose, leading to a more accurate assessment of biases in CLIP. In their experiments, they consider different labels (e.g. "friendly", "conservative", etc) that are borrowed from prior works in social psychology (namely the the ABC Model and the Stereotype Content Model) and compare their embeddings with the image embeddings using cosine similarity.

Using this setup, the authors present several interesting findings. First, they find that non-protected attributes, such as pose and smiling, can have a non-trivial impact. In particular, the variance in the cosine similarity by changing lighting, smiling, and pose is comparable to the variance induced by changing protected attributes. In fact, the impact of "pose" is stronger than the impact of "age." The authors study the effect of such factors at a greater depth; e.g.  image-related confounding factors, such as lightning, have less effect that subject-related factors, such as pose and smile. So, non-protected attribute can cause a significant amount of noise when doing bias-related analysis of CLIP. Second, the authors show that because such confounding factors can be controlled in CausalFace, new patterns emerge in CausalFace that are not visible in datasets like FairFace. This is demonstrated, for example, in Figure 2. 

Overall, the paper offers an interesting and useful insight when studying biases in multimodal systems. It highlights that confounding factors need to be taken into account, and that correlational studies would typically underestimate biases in models such as CLIP (because of the noise introduced by the confounding factors).

### Strengths
The paper offers several interesting insights in a topic that is becoming increasingly important. The experimental results are convincing, and the overall message is quite useful to the community. The authors take care in handling several potential issues; e.g. by demonstrating that synthetic data are statistically similar to real images, among others.

### Weaknesses
 - The first limitation is that the authors use a single dataset only in their analysis, which is FairFace. There are other datasets such as UTK Face and CelebA that can be included to support the argument further. It's not clear if the conclusions in FairFace would continue to hold so showing that they hold in other datasets would strengthen the argument. In addition, MIAP (https://paperswithcode.com/dataset/miap) is quite different from FairFace in that it collects images in natural settings (not just face images) so I would expect those confounding factors to be even more prominent in that dataset. This would be a useful message to point out.
- There are important places that need further clarity. For instance, can you please provide a precise mathematical definition of "markedness," similar to how WEAT is defined in the appendix? Page 5 explains it a bit but a precise definition should be included. Also, which specific prompts did the authors use to create various levels of "pose," "lightning", and "smile"? They are not described in the paper or the appendix as far as I can see.
- The authors focus on sentiment related attributes, such as warmth, communion, competence, etc. It would make sense for these attributes to be impacted by confounders, such as pose and smiling. But, there are other equally important association biases, such as relating gender with occupation, that may not be as sensitive to those issues. These are not studied in the paper.

### Questions
- What does "neutral lightning" mean? It seems from Figure 3 that neutral lightning may lie at the middle of the scale, which would reveal a pattern that is different from random noise.
- When comparing the impact of "smiling" in Figure 3.b, why did you choose to compare -1.5 with 3.0 instead of going for the extreme ends; i.e. -2.5 with 4.0? 
- In Section 4.4,  the authors claim that "black males" deviate from the expected pattern in Figure 3.b because they are "the only subgroup showing amplified positive associations with intensified smiles." I'm curious to know why the authors think this is unexpected? Shouldn't the fact that the other groups don't exhibit this be the unexpected pattern?
- Which specific prompts did the authors use to create various levels of "pose," "lightning", and "smile"?

### Summary
This paper conducts an analysis of bias in CLIP using a generated dataset of faces, leveraging its generated nature to draw more precise, causal-type conclusions. They examine cosine similarity in CLIP space to various words from well-known social psychological frameworks. They present a number of empirical takeaways, including that conclusions from finely-controlled generated data can differ from pre-existing, real data and that several confounding variables (e.g. "smiling") can also affect bias measurements.

### Strengths
- this is an interesting empirical analysis which makes some important points about bias evaluation 
- makes intelligent choices in evaluation design, a good example of what this can look like
- interesting takeaways around difference between synthetic and real data, as well as confounding variables

### Weaknesses
 - I think the title should be a little more precise - specifically this is around "social bias in CLIP for face images" or something, it's not studying all areas of bias
- Figure B.1 was unclear to me - I'm not sure how to read the point about within vs cross valence similarities off this plot
- Sec 4.2: I get a little confused about a few of the evaluation procedures here. For instance, I think "mean cosine similarities" could be explained a bit more - I can guess what it might be but don't know for sure. Also I think markedness is not explained so clearly: not clear what "relative preference frequency" is or a "neutral prompt" - again I could guess but should be written out.
- I think the point about positive correlation between positive and negative terms is a good one, I think this could be shown more strongly with a "control group" of words: is it that some images are just correlated to all words? words of a certain type?
- the word "intensity" is used without definition - what does this mean?


Small notes:
- typos: bottom of p1: 'sd',
- Sec 3.4: unclear how these thresholds are determined or what they really mean (e.g. 0.7 for age)
- what is the x-axis in Fig 3a?
- Fig 3b and commentary at end of 4.4: if I'm reading this correctly, most groups negative associations decrease as smiles intensify - it's stated here that this is unusual for black males.

### Questions
- I think the observation that "the widely held belief that age- and gender-induced variations are strong factors needs to be reconsidered" is misguided (end of 4.5 and 5). The authors seem to believe that social factors like gender receive special attention since they are causes of particularly strong deviations - I think this misses an important point. It isn't that these factors necessarily cause the largest deviations (of course other visibly salient factors will matter), it's that these factors are important for socially determined reasons, and therefore measuring model impacts and mitigating disparities/harms where they exist matters more

### Summary
The paper analyzes social bias in CLIP image and text embeddings by comparing the cosine similarity between images of faces and attributes extracted from social psychology. The paper claims to study causality rather than correlations using a synthetic dataset, CausalFace.

### Strengths
The paper is well-written and well-motivated, it is easy to read and understand and it does a good job at positioning itself with respect to the related work, which is relevant and up-to-date.

### Weaknesses
W1. The novelty of the paper may be limited, as there is already abundant literature studying correlations between image and attribute embeddings in CLIP (many already cited in the related work). The contributions of this study are 1) using attributes from social psychology instead of a self-defined list of words, and 2) claiming causality instead of correlation. The first contribution may not be enough by itself, whereas the second contribution is challenged in the following point.

W2. The paper argues that the analysis conducted on the CausalFace dataset, in contrast to FairFace, implies causality and not only correlation because the elements/confounders in CausalFace can be controlled by the generation process. However, it could be argued there is not enough evidence to assume there are no confounders in CausalFace just because it has been generated synthetically. 

Specifically, images in CausalFace have been generated using a GAN by imitating a training distribution. The training distribution may very likely present biases, which could be learned and transferred to the synthetic images. Hence, concluding that using synthetically generated images implies causality may not stand. It would be interesting to discuss how the potential biases in the image generation algorithm can affect the results of this study.

W3. I would say the main paper is not self-contained. Many necessary details to understand the flow of the paper and its conclusions are placed in the supplementary material. This is a subtle way of evading the 9-page limitation. The supplementary material should be used for extra information only. Some examples:
- The metrics computation, especially the cosine similarity between the image and attribute embeddings is essential to understand the results in, e.g. Table 1, but its definition is in Appendix A1.
- The whole section 4.1 discusses results that are not in the paper but in Appendix B.

### Questions
- I am curious to know why the authors chose to use the phrase “*legally* protected attributes” to refer to demographic attributes such as race, gender, or age, as the adjective *legal* (i.e. referring to the law) has different interpretations in different places of the world.

- Why only use 3 groups (Asian, Black, White) from FairFace instead of all the data?
