## Abstract
Accelerated stochastic gradient descent (ASGD) is a workhorse in deep learning and often achieves better generalization performance than SGD. However, existing optimization theory can only explain the faster convergence of ASGD, but cannot explain its better generalization. In this paper, we study the generalization of ASGD for overparameterized linear regression, which is possibly the simplest setting of learning with overparameterization. We establish an instance-dependent excess risk bound for ASGD within each eigen-subspace of the data covariance matrix. Our analysis shows that (i) ASGD outperforms SGD in the subspace of small eigenvalues, exhibiting a faster rate of exponential decay for bias error, while in the subspace of large eigenvalues, its bias error decays slower than SGD; and (ii) the variance error of ASGD is always larger than that of SGD. Our result suggests that ASGD can outperform SGD when the difference between the initialization and the true weight vector is mostly confined to the subspace of small eigenvalues. Additionally, when our analysis is specialized to linear regression in the strongly convex setting, it yields a tighter bound for bias error than the best-known result.

4: You are confident in your assessment, but not absolutely certain. It is unlikely, but not impossible, that you did not understand some parts of the submission or that you are unfamiliar with some pieces of related work.

### Summary
The authors analyze stochastic gradient descent with momentum in the overparametrized linear regression setting and they study excess risk bounds, showing that the variance of this algorithm is never better than for SGD and that the bias is also larger for the subspace of largest eigenvalues. They show that for the subspace of the the lowest eigenvalues, the bias of the algorithm is smaller than that of SGD

### Strengths
In the strongly convex regime, the authors get better bias error term than previous work (except for a term, that the authors claim that can be removed but that wasn't removed). They extend the techniques in Jain et al 2018 to the overparametrized setting which allows them to specify what happens in their setting with ASGD
The paper is well written.

### Weaknesses
It is known from before in many settings that accelerated gradient descent does work very well with noise, and in fact, this is what is corroborated by this work for the setting of overparametrized linear regression. The variance is shown to be greater, the bias is shown to be greater for the subspace of large eigenvalues, which are the most important ones. The claim in the abstract about ASGD outperforming SGD if the initialization minus optimizers lives in the subspace of the small eigenvalues is true but a bit useless, since it is very unlikely this happens. It is a low dimensional subspace and most of the rest of the space is dominated by the large eigenvalues.  It is informative and of value to have all of the details in this setting that are provided in this work, but the results are weak, essentially a negative result that could have maybe been anticipated for this kind of algorithm.

### Questions
Can you provide any examples of settings in which you can guarantee you can initialize to be in the good regime that you show for ASGD, i.e. when $w_0 -w^\ast$ is essentially aligned with the subspace associated to small eigenvalues?

Finally, sufficient experiment verify the effectiveness of the theoretical findings.

### Strengths
1. The theoretical findings are solid.
2. This paper is well-written and easy to follow.

### Weaknesses
The experimental results do not provide strong support for the theoretical findings in this paper.

### Questions
1. How is overparameterization reflected in Theorem 4.1?

2. Please provide a more detailed explanation of the challenges encountered in theoretical analysis and how to address them in the submission.

3. Can you provide more instances that satisfy Assumption 3.2?

4. The experiments are not comprehensive enough, for example, the paper finds that the variance error of ASGD is always larger than that of SGD, but there is not enough experimental support for this claim.
