## Abstract
The idea of decision-aware model learning, that models should be accurate where it matters for decision-making, has gained prominence in model-based reinforcement learning.
While promising theoretical results have been established, the empirical performance of algorithms leveraging a decision-aware loss has been lacking, especially in continuous control problems.
In this paper, we present a study on the necessary components for decision-aware reinforcement learning models and we showcase design choices that enable well-performing algorithms.
To this end, we provide a theoretical and empirical investigation into algorithmic ideas in the field.
We highlight that empirical design decisions established in the MuZero line of works, most importantly the use of a latent model, are vital to achieving good performance for related algorithms. 
Furthermore, we show that the MuZero loss function is biased in stochastic environments and establish that this bias has practical consequences.
Building on these findings, we present an overview of which decision-aware loss functions are best used in what empirical scenarios, providing actionable insights to practitioners in the field.

### Confidence
4: You are confident in your assessment, but not absolutely certain. It is unlikely, but not impossible, that you did not understand some parts of the submission or that you are unfamiliar with some pieces of related work.

### Summary
The paper investigates the known decision-aware models like InterVAML and MuZero. It comes up with a framework called $\lambda$-AC that includes both these models. The authors discuss the benefits of decision-aware models over other models like BYOL and how different design choices affect the performance. The authors evaluate these models on continuous domain tasks for which they modify models like MuZero were designed for discrete action spaces.

### Strengths
(1) The paper discusses the different design choices of MuZero and InterVAML and their effects on their performance. 

(2) They show that in stochastic dynamics, InterVAML produces unbiased results but MuZero produces biased value functions.

(3) They adapt these models to continuous domains over which they compare these with BYOL.

### Weaknesses
 (1) The authors do compare design choices, and raise research questions but the story is still incomplete. They do not come up with any answer to these questions. They do not present any new algorithm or an unknown insight.

(2) The framework $\lambda$-AC seems to be vague. Towards the end, when the authors discuss about using model for policy learning or not, both of these will fall under this framework as per the definition: "and an actor-critic algorithm to obtain policy".

(3) If presenting an evaluation paper, why not compare more model-based methods like Dreamer and using discrete settings as well.

### Questions
(1) A small preliminary on model based value gradients like SVG should be presented.

(2) When it is established in the first experiment, that the auxiliary loss does not add the MuZero, why is it still used as it is adding additional bias. What will happen if I use the MuZero directly (without auxiliary loss) in Section 4.3?

### Summary
This paper investigated the $\lambda$-AC framework for model-based reinforcement learning with decision-aware models. It intensively compares the performance of three different loss functions - IterVAML, MuZero, and BYOL. This paper is interested in showing what components of algorithms lead to performance differences in practice. It shows that with a sufficiently flexible function class, IterVAML can recover an optimal deterministic model for value function prediction. And MuZero is a biased method such that it will not recover the correct value function in stochastic environments even if the correct model is used and the function class is Bellman complete. With theoretical analysis, it shows that MuZero is most susceptible to the noise among all three loss functions. This paper also empirically shows that decision-aware losses IterVAML and MuZero have better performance over the simple BYOL loss in changeling tasks for both value function learning and policy improvement.

### Strengths
1. From a theoretical perspective, this paper did a mathematical analysis for decision-aware losses IterVAML and MuZero. It confirms that IterVAML is able to recover an optimal deterministic model for value function prediction. But MuZero is a biased method such that it will not recover the correct value function in stochastic environments even with the correct model and Bellman completeness.

2. Their empirical results show that MuZero is most susceptible to the noise among all three loss functions. This observation supports their theoretical results.

3. They empirically show that decision-aware losses IterVAML and MuZero have better performance over the simple BYOL loss in challenging tasks for both value function learning and policy improvement.

### Weaknesses
1. This paper assumes too much background on the reader. It uses jargon without clearly and sufficiently introducing them, for example, latent model, decision-aware learning framework, IterVAML, MuZero, BYOL loss, and so on. Most importantly, it is very hard to figure out what is the contribution of this paper. Both the introduction and the conclusion did not clearly point the main contribution out.

2. The readability of this paper could be greatly improved by deleting unnecessary words and sentences. More tables should be introduced in place of large paragraphs of words.

3. The author should directly articulate their research goal at the beginning of the research paper. Currently, readers cannot understand the research goal until the first full pass of the paper.

4. In terms of contribution, a comparison among three different loss functions in three environments may not be significant enough to offer strong insights. And the novelty of this work is limited because it is a direct completeness extension and evaluation of previous works cited in section 2.1.

### Questions
Why do you choose IterVAML, MuZero, and BYOL loss functions as benchmarks to compare? Are they broad enough to give a representative comparison of model-based RL methods?

### Summary
This paper studies decision-aware model-based reinforcement learning, in which the objective of model learning also takes into account the value of the policy. It proposes the $\lambda$-AC framework for characterizing such model-based algorithms, which includes a latent model, a decision-aware model loss, and a model-based actor-critic algorithm. Specifically, it focuses on analyzing decision-aware model losses from two existing approaches, IterVAML and Muzero: it shows that IterVAML can learn a sound expectation (deterministic) model for stochastic environments under some conditions. At the same time, Muzero doesn’t share this nice property. Empirical results of instantiations with the two losses on a difficult task validate this theoretical finding. In addition, the paper also provides some other insights on $\lambda$-AC algorithms.

### Strengths
The main strength of this paper is its originality. The paper shows the soundness of learning an expectation (or deterministic) model using IterVAML in stochastic environments for the first time, which sheds light on the promising approach to learning deterministic models. Meanwhile, it also establishes the issue of MuZero’s value loss. These original results may be of interest to relevant model-based RL researchers and inspire further research.

In addition, the paper is well-organized and easy to follow in general. Nevertheless, here are some suggestions for improving the clarity further:
1. Including a table like Table 1 in the main text may be helpful when explaining the $\lambda$-AC framework and the instances. In addition, the caption of Table 1 seems to be outdated.
2. Since the weaker performance of MuZero on the walker-run seems to be an outlier, consider using results on another, more representative task.

### Weaknesses
Speaking of weaknesses, the paper is weak in its significance and soundness, in my opinion. For the significance part, the paper mainly focuses on analyzing two existing value-aware losses and obtains a few insights that only apply to the two specific losses. In addition, the paper proposes a framework that contains three components, while only two instances pivoting the value-aware loss component are investigated. It may be worthwhile to step further and understand the effect of other components.

On the soundness of the paper, some statements are not well justified:
1. It is claimed that “$\lambda$-IterVAML leads to an unbiased solution in the infinite sample limit, [conditions]…” However, as discussed at the bottom of Page 4, Proposition 1 only shows the existence of such an unbiased solution. It’s not immediately apparent that $\lambda$-IterVAML *leads to* it. If this is an implied result, it may be helpful to clarify this.
2. In the caption of Figure 6, the performance decrease of IterVAML is explained to be due to the lack of real reward signal in the value function loss, which is not supported by evidence.

### Questions
1. This question doesn’t impact the assessment. Are there results similar to Proposition 1 when $\mathcal{X}$ is a discrete space? If not, how likely could there be such a result?

Minor clarification questions and typos that don’t have an impact on the assessment:
1. On page 2, “​​refer to approximate model[s]”
2. Be consistent with the style of superscripts. For example, the n-step deterministic model is $\hat f^j$ in Eq. (3) but $\hat f^{(j)}$ in Eq. (4). For another example, in Section 2.2, there are $\hat x^0$ vs. $x^{(0)}$ and $\hat x^j$ vs. $\hat x^{(j)}$, which appears to be the same variable.
3. On page 5, “stabilizing loss” is used without a definition or introduction. From the context, it can be inferred that it’s $\mathcal{L}^n_{\text{latent}}$. However, it is quite confusing.
4. On page 5, “sepcifically”
5. On page 5, “compare Section 5” seems to be grammatically incorrect.
6. On page 5, there should be a comma after “In Proposition 1”
7. On page 6, there is something wrong in “the bias to impact the solution”
8. On page 6, what is “the model’s value function”?
9. On page 9, redundant period “..”

### Summary
The paper proposes a new framework for analyzing decision-aware model learning, which aims to learn a model for the environment and requires the model to sufficiently accurately represent the value functions associated with the environment. The paper first shows the relationship between existing SOTA methods IterVAML and MuZero. The paper then proposes $\lambda$-AC as a unifying framework for analyzing the two algorithms, and investigates the design choices that lead to the different performances the two algorithms achieve on various continuous control tasks.

### Strengths
- The paper is well-written and easy to follow. The discussions offer good insight into the design choices made by the paper and the contribution of the work in relation to prior literature.
- The included experiments are comprehensive and illustrates how design choices and the environments themselves lead to the performance differences between MuZero and IterVAML.
- The provided experiment details are comprehensive and should be sufficient for replicating the results in the paper.

### Weaknesses
1. While the paper is well-written overall, there are some technical details and notations that can make key formulas harder to parse (see the minor comments below). For a paper with relatively heavy notation, as it needs to consider ground-truth models, estimated models, transitions collected from interactions, and transitions from learned models, such mistakes, while understandable, can make some key concepts hard to grasp. As someone with little prior knowledge on MuZero and IterVAML, I found the mathematical details behind both losses hard to understand. Specifically, the distinction between the various transition functions (ground truth, learned, and sampled) and their associated distributions is not always clear, making it difficult to follow the derivations. The use of superscripts and subscripts, while necessary, could be made more consistent to avoid confusion. For example, the notation for the learned model $\hat{f}$ and its application in equations (3) and (4) needs further clarification to distinguish between different iterations or applications of the model. The lack of clear definitions for the distributions over which expectations are taken in equations (1) and (2) also adds to the difficulty.
2. The legends and labels in the figures are slightly confusing. The paper's text seems to use $\lambda$-MuZero and $\lambda$-IterVAML to refer to the variants of the two losses under the $\lambda$-AC framework, and MuZero and IterVAML to refer to the "vanilla" versions of the algorithms. However, I cannot find $\lambda$-MuZero nor $\lambda$-IterVAML in figures 4 - 7, which seems to suggest that the experiments are done on the "vanilla" algorithms themselves. Is this the correct interpretation? 

Minor Comment
1. I am slightly concerned by the correctness of eq (1) and eq (2) as written here. Particularly, eq (1) takes expectation over some $\mu \in \Delta(S \times A)$ (even though here the paper lets $\mu$ be a distribution over the state space only), whereas in eq (2) the samples follow a distribution where the initial state $x_{i_1}$ is drawn from some $\mu \in \Delta(S)$, and actions $a$ and subsequent states are drawn from the ground-truth transition kernel $p$ (which generates $\mathcal{D}$). Without any assumption on $\mu$, I am not sure if (2) provides an unbiased estimate of (1). Note that the cited work (Farahmand, 2018) also seems to take expectation over some joint distribution over state and action.
2. In Algorithm 1, $\mathcal{L}_{\rm Latent}$ is used instead of $\mathcal{L}_{\rm latent}$ and the notation is not consistent.
3. In eq (4), is $\hat{f}^{(j)}$ a typo? Should it be $\hat{f}^j$ instead? If not, what is the relation ship between the two?
4. Shouldn't the sample-based versions of MuZero and IterVAML depend on some policy $\pi$ as well? Aren't the actions $a_{i_j}$ are collected by some particular policy $\pi$?

### Questions
1. Would it be possible to generalize the $\lambda$-AC framework to other decision-aware losses, such as the ones discussed in the related work section?
2. I am not familiar with either MuZero or IterVAML, so my assumption may be misguided. However, shouldn't it be expected that MuZero will always have some bias? From equation (3), my understanding is that the loss function uses some deterministic mapping to estimate the transition. As such, the assumption is inherently not compatible with stochastic transition. Is this intuition oversimplifying the problem? (Of course this is not to say the theoretical results are trivial or not interesting. Rigorous proofs cannot be replaced by hand-waving "analysis".)
