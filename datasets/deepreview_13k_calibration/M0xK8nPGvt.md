## Abstract
Posterior sampling allows exploitation of prior knowledge on the environment's transition dynamics to improve the sample efficiency of reinforcement learning. The prior is typically specified as a class of parametric distributions, the design of which can be cumbersome in practice, often resulting in the choice of uninformative priors. In this work, we propose a novel posterior sampling approach in which the prior is given as a (partial) causal graph over the environment's variables. The latter is often more natural to design, such as listing known causal dependencies between biometric features in a medical treatment study. Specifically, we propose a hierarchical Bayesian procedure, called C-PSRL, simultaneously learning the full causal graph at the higher level and the parameters of the resulting factored dynamics at the lower level. We provide an analysis of the Bayesian regret of C-PSRL that explicitly connects the regret rate with the degree of prior knowledge. Our numerical evaluation conducted in illustrative domains confirms that C-PSRL strongly improves the efficiency of posterior sampling with an uninformative prior while performing close to posterior sampling with the full causal graph.

### Summary
Posterior sampling guarantees sample efficiency by exploiting prior knowledge of the environment's dynamics. In practice, the class of parametric distributions can be cumbersome and uninformative. This paper proposes a hierarchical Bayesian procedure, C-PSRL, that uses the (partial) causal graph over the environment's variables as the prior. Its Bayesian regret is associated with the degree of prior knowledge. Empirical experiments show that C-PSRL improves the efficiency of posterior sampling with an uninformative prior.

### Strengths
The idea of replacing an uninformative prior with a causal graph is attractive. Additionally, the byproduct of weak causal discovery reveals the possibility of how to utilize reinforcement learning in the causal discovery field.

### Weaknesses
My biggest concern is why not learn directly from the parents of the reward, given that we want to utilize causal prior knowledge? If I understand correctly, this paper focuses more on the parents of actions and states. As we all know, the value of a variable depends only on the values of its causal parents (line 122). If our goal is to learn the policy that maximizes the reward, shouldn't we primarily focus on the parents of the reward for greater efficiency and simplicity?

1. Line 92: I'm a little confused about why the DAG is divided into X and Y parts. If X is the state-action space and Y is the state space, where is the reward in the DAG? In common DAGs, each node represents a random variable, but here, each node seems more like a realization of the tuple (s, a) or just state 's', which makes me doubt the interpretability of the DAG.
2. Figure 1 (right): The set Z includes 9 different DAGs. However, shouldn't the set of factorizations consistent with G_0 contain 2x2x3=12 possible FMDPs? Or did I miss some selection criteria for the set Z?
3. Algorithm 1: From line 5 to line 6, could you provide more details on how to obtain F_* from F_k?

### Summary
The paper proposes a novel approach to posterior sampling for reinforcement learning (PSRL), namely C-PSRL, that exploits the partial causal graph (which is given as prior knowledge) as a prior. C-PSRL iteratively samples the causal graph which induces FMDP and updates the posterior. As a result, C-PSRL improves the Bayesian regret to $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(\sqrt{K/2^\eta})$ where $\eta$ represents a degree of prior knowledge. An interesting property of C-PSRL is a weak causal discovery, i.e., it discovers the sparse super-graph of the ground-truth causal graph as a byproduct. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.

### Strengths
- The manuscript is well-written. As one who is not an expert in PSRL literature, it was not too difficult to follow the paper.
- The problem setting where only the partial causal graph is given is interesting. Also, the motivation is clear; in many practical scenarios complete true causal graph is often not accessible but only partial causal relationships are known.
- The paper suggests a neat solution that extends PSRL and provides the Bayesian regret analysis, though I did not check the proofs. Empirical validation demonstrates its effectiveness compared to naive PSRL.

### Weaknesses
 - It is unclear what is the implications of the weak causal discovery result. It states that the $Z$-sparse super-graph of the ground-truth causal graph can be recovered, but it does not speak for itself, and difficult to understand what is the takeaway message. For example, is it fundamentally impossible for the C-PSRL to recover the ground-truth causal graph? If this is the case, then is it still possible for the C-PSRL to obtain (converge to) optimal policy? Is the degree of the difference between the true causal graph and super-graph associated with the convergence rate or optimality?
- The assumption that the (correct) partial causal graph is given as a priori is understandable. However, it is also important to discuss what would happen if this assumption does not hold. For example, how would C-PSRL behave if the initial partial causal graph is wrong (i.e., when some of its edges are non-causal)? Specifically, the paper does not address the implications of incorporating spurious causal relationships into the prior, potentially leading to suboptimal exploration or biased posterior estimates. This is a significant gap, as real-world causal knowledge is often incomplete or noisy, making the robustness of the algorithm to such misspecifications a critical consideration.


### Questions
- How can the byproduct (i.e., super-graph of the ground-truth causal graph) be utilized? Also, if one is interested in recovering the ground-truth causal graph, do you think there is any way to further prune the super-graph to obtain the true graph?
- It would be interesting to see the performance of C-PSRL given the low prior knowledge (e.g., $\eta = 0, 1$). The experiment only shows the case of $\eta=2$.

### Rating Number

### Confidence
3: You are fairly confident in your assessment. It is possible that you did not understand some parts of the submission or that you are unfamiliar with some pieces of related work. Math/other details were not carefully checked.

### Summary
This work proposes an extension of Osband & Van Roy (2014, NeurIPS) where only partial knowledge of the causal graph is needed as opposed to full knowledge. More specifically, the aim is to still provide competitive rates in terms of Bayesian regret with such partial knowledge. The authors also find that their method also performs a weak notion of causal discovery as a byproduct.

### Strengths
- An extension of an interesting frameowork 
- clear statement about what are the new contributions

### Weaknesses
Some issues in clarity of presentation and about what are the interventions here ? The paper is not written in causality notation 
- Not clear how much computational complexity is added wrt to PSRL; eg what is the complexity of step 2 in Algo 1 ? 
- defintions in Sec 2.1 are currently wrong or incomplete: the Markov factorization is not what makes an CBN, since it applies to standard BNs. See definitions of CBN in eg [Pearl, 2009, Definition 1.3.1] , it's about *all* interventional distributions having the Markov fact. and other constraints. 
- I'm not understanding in Alg 1 about step 7, are these posteriors in closed form ? If not, what approximations are used and how do they affect the regret ?

### Questions
- Could you compare with the regret bounds of Lattimore et al (2016) that also use knowledge of the causal structure to improve regret in the context of bandits instead of RL ? Are there connections?  See also the extension with unknown graph in Lu et al (2021)

### Summary
This work proposes a posterior sampling algorithm to address the reinforcement learning problem given a partial causal graph. The method utilizes the knowledge of a partial causal graph to construct a set of plausible factored MDPs (FMDPs). Then, it is framed as a hierarchical Bayesian model, with a prior over the factorization (equivalently, the complete causal graph) at a higher level and priors over the transitions and rewards at a lower level (given the factorization). The proposed posterior sampling C-PSRL algorithm proceeds by first sampling a factorization from the posterior, then sampling the MDP's parameters from the posterior given the factorization, and computing the optimal policy given the sampled FMDP. The paper proves that the Bayesian regret of the proposed C-PSRL algorithm is sublinear in the number of episodes and shows that C-PSRL can identify a super-graph of the true causal graph.

### Strengths
The motivation behind tackling the RL problem using a partial causal graph is compelling and essential for improving the practicality of posterior sampling algorithms in the RL context. The proposed algorithm is intuitive and incorporates Bayesian regret analysis. 

Although the theoretical analysis is based on the PSRL approach in FMDPs in Osband & Van Roy (2014) and the hierarchical posterior sampling method in Hong et al (2022b), the paper analyzes the connection between the degree of prior knowledge in the partial causal graph and the Bayesian regret, which is interesting. The paper also provides a result on the weak causal discovery.

### Weaknesses
1. The experiment section is quite brief. There may be some missing details.

   a. In particular, the construction of priors is not discussed in detail. Although the priors are discussed in lines 173-178, it is not very clear to me about the distribution of the latent hypothesis space. For example, how do we select the support of this distribution (given the sparseness Z) and assign the prior probability of each factorization? What are the priors of the transition probabilities and rewards? How are the posterior distributions updated (do we need conjugate priors)? Specifically, the choice of prior over the causal graphs, which is a crucial component of the algorithm, is not fully elaborated. The paper should detail how the support of this distribution is chosen, especially given the sparseness constraint Z, and how prior probabilities are assigned to each possible factorization. The description of the priors over transition probabilities and rewards also lacks detail. It is unclear if conjugate priors are used, which would allow for closed-form posterior updates, or if other methods are employed.

   b. Is the assumption in Lemma D.1 satisfied by the baseline with uninformative priors in the experiments?

   c. Additionally, it might be beneficial to include an experiment involving F-PSRL with the causal graph set to the partial causal graph.

2. Could the author provide justification for the assumption made in Definition 2 that any misspecification in $\mathcal{G}_{\mathcal{F}_k}$ negatively affects the value function of $\pi_k$? This assumption seems strong, as it implies that any deviation from the true causal graph will necessarily lead to a suboptimal policy. It is possible that some causal relationships are irrelevant to the optimal policy, and thus misspecifying them may not affect the value function. The authors should provide a more detailed justification for this assumption or discuss the conditions under which it holds.

A minor issue: in line 180, line 9 does not exist in Algorithm 1.
