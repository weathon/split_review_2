## Abstract
Reinforcement learning (RL) is gaining popularity in addressing the traffic signal control (TSC) problems. Yet, the trial and error training with environmental interactions for traditional RL-based methods is costly and time-consuming. Additionally, it is challenging to directly deploy a completely pre-trained RL model for all types of intersections. Inspired by recent advances in decision-making systems from offline RL, we propose a general offline actor-critic framework (Offline-AC) that considers policy and value constraints, and an adaptive decision-making model named OfflineLight based on Offline-AC. Offline-AC is further proved general and suitable for developing new offline RL algorithms. Moreover, we collect, organize and release the first offline interaction dataset for TSC (TSC-OID), which is generated from the state-of-the-art (SOTA) RL models that interact with a traffic simulation environment based on multiple datasets of real-world road intersections and traffic flow. Through numerical experiments on real-world datasets, we demonstrate that: (1) Offline RL can build a high-performance RL model without online interactions with the traffic environment; (2) OfflineLight matches or achieves SOTA among recent RL methods; and (3) OfflineLight shows comprehensive generalization performance after completing training on only 20% of the TSC-OID dataset. The relevant dataset and code are available at anonymous URL:https://anonymous.4open.science/r/OfflineLight-6665/README.md.

### Summary
This paper introduces Offline-AC, a general offline actor-critic framework for traffic signal control, addressing the limitations of traditional RL methods that rely on costly trial and error training. They also propose OfflineLight, an adaptive decision-making model based on Offline-AC. Additionally, the paper presents TSC-OID, the first offline dataset for traffic signal control, generated from state-of-the-art RL models, and demonstrates through real-world experiments that Offline RL, especially OfflineLight, can achieve high performance without online interactions with the traffic environment and offers impressive generalization after training on only 20% of the TSC-OID dataset.

### Strengths
It's evident that this paper addresses a significant challenge in the field of RL-based traffic signal control by focusing on training policies using offline datasets. This approach is highly practical, as acquiring online samples from high-fidelity traffic simulators like CityFlow and SUMO can be challenging, particularly in scenarios involving large and dense traffic networks. The fact that the proposed offline dataset is publicly accessible is a commendable aspect, as it not only supports the research presented in the paper but also encourages and facilitates further studies and advancements in this area.

### Weaknesses
To the best of my understanding, OfflineLight treats each traffic signal as an independent RL agent. Nevertheless, since there are multiple agents, it is crucial to clarify the definitions of state, action, and reward in order to comprehend the problem thoroughly. It would be highly beneficial if there were a well-defined problem formulation, possibly following a POMDP framework. Additionally, I'm interested in gaining a clearer understanding of the objective function. It seems unusual to aim for maximizing the expected reward over historical trajectories when the rewards for these trajectories are already given. Both Offline RL and Online RL generally share a common objective, which is to find an optimal policy that maximizes the expected return within the true MDP. I would appreciate a more detailed elaboration on your objective.

It's worth noting that OfflineLight does not take into account the interactions between multiple traffic lights. In contrast, many studies in Traffic Signal Control (TSC) have explored such interactions using various techniques like the CTDE framework and graph neural networks. I would like to suggest that integrating these approaches could substantially enhance the performance of the proposed model.

Regarding offline RL, it's important to emphasize the significance of the size and quality of the offline dataset for the algorithm's performance. Unfortunately, there is a lack of analysis regarding the dataset's quality. Providing statistics on the offline dataset, such as the maximum reward contained within it, the distribution of rewards, and the diversity of states and actions, would greatly enhance the understanding of its characteristics. Furthermore, it is unclear how the dataset was generated, specifically which RL algorithm was used and what exploration strategy was employed, which are all crucial for understanding the dataset's properties and potential biases.

### Questions
I have some detailed questions regarding your work:

1. State and Reward Definitions: Could you please provide more information about the definition of the state? Is the state considered a global state or local information for each agent? Additionally, is the reward shared among all agents or individually assigned? This is a critical matter to address, as most RL-based Traffic Signal Control methods operate in a decentralized Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) framework with a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP) setting.

2. Offline Dataset Collection Procedure: I'm interested in understanding the specifics of the offline dataset collection procedure. According to appendix B.2, the offline dataset is collected through three epochs of training. However, this may seem insufficient to attain high-reward solutions. Furthermore, I couldn't find information about which RL method is used to generate the dataset for each scenario. Lastly, could you provide some statistics regarding the reward distribution in the dataset, as the quality of the dataset is crucial for Offline RL performance.

3. Experiment Section: Can you provide more details about the training and evaluation procedures in your experiments? I'm particularly curious about how the offline RL models are trained and evaluated in the New York scenario, given that there is no available offline dataset. Please elaborate on this aspect.

I hope you can provide more insight into these questions to better understand your work.

### Summary
This paper creates an offline dataset (TSC-OID) collected with trained reinforcement learning policies on real-life datasets for traffic signal control task (TSC) to stress the problem that the trial and error training procedure is unsuitable for the traffic signal control problem. Based on the collected dataset, the author also proposed a novel offline-AC algorithm to train offline agents, taking a conservative exploration strategy. The result shows that the offline trained agents have performance close to SOTA online training agents and, at the same time, have the ability to transfer to unseen datasets.

### Strengths
1. The motivation for this work is good. TSC is not an environment like a based environment; the traditional trial and error exploration strategy is unsuitable for this high-stack training strategy. The idea of taking online training of TSC to offline training is necessary and important
2. The paper is mostly well-written, with a clear description of the motivation and algorithm. Most of the motivation for designing the offline-AC is clearly explained.
3. The experiment result is consistent with the claims made in the paper, and the transferability discussion is essential to justify the motivation, which is why we need to train an agent offline with a dataset collected from trained RL agents.

### Weaknesses
1. The novelty is not clear for this work. The offline-AC brings in ideas from policy smooth regularization (PSR), and conservative Q-learning combines these ideas and transfers them into the application of traffic signal control. Though the attempts are reasonable, the novelty is not recognized as a novelty closely related to representation learning.
2. Though the algorithm is well explained, the most crucial part is that the dataset is not well explained. Some details are very critical to judge the quality of this dataset. For example, how many policies did the author use to collect the data? Does this policy train on all datasets? These are the major components of this paper but need to be well discussed.

### Questions
1. For the dataset, how did the author collect data? Is the policy trained on some other dataset or all the datasets used later? Is the RL agent already well-trained before interacting with the environment? If it is trained on all datasets, then the transferability evaluation is not feasible to evaluate the generalization of this offline-AC performance. Could the author give a very detailed description of this part?
2. In the appendix Figure 4. The comparison seems not convincing. If the advanced MPLight performs very well on the transferred dataset, then the transfer ratio is also low. Could the author provide another metric to evaluate the performance?
3. In section 4.2.1, the J(\theta) is calculated over n and t. But in the formula, Q is independent of n and t. Should the action and state subscribe with n and t?
4. How could the author conclude the Discussion “Why is the Offline-AC the abstract method?”. To justify this idea, more experiment results should be conducted.

### Summary
RL methods have gained popularity in the traffic signal control (TSC) problem, since they can learn from the traffic environment’s feedback and adjust the traffic signal policies accordingly.
To avoid trial and error training, this paper considers offline RL for adaptive and efficient TSC.
To this end, this paper introduces a general offline actor-critic framework  (Offline-AC)  and develop an adaptive decision-making model, namely OfflineLight, based on the Offline-AC for TSC.
The proposed method improves the generalization ability under a variety of traffic conditions.
The authors also release the first offline dataset for TSC.

### Strengths
1. This paper collect and release the first offline dataset for TSC problem, which should benefit the community.
2.  The proposed method shows reasonable performance in the experiments over several datasets.

### Weaknesses
1. Several math formulas are incorrect. For example, Eq. 1 should be something like $G = E_{\rho_{0}} E_{a_0, a_1,\ldots, \sim \pi}[\sum_{t=0}^\infty \gamma^t r_t]$, where $\rho_0$ is the initial state distribution. Also problematic is the definition of $\pi^*$ two lines after Eq. 2 and the $Q(s,a)$ in Section 4.2.2 (missing the expectation and what is $r^n$?).
2. The proposed "offline Actor-Critic framework" may not be considered as the contribution of this paper. For example, Eq. 3 in this paper is the same as Eq. 7 in BRAC [1]. Eq. 5 is the same as Eq. 2 in CQL [2]. The authors should clarify what is the novelty of their framework, given that it seems to be a combination of existing methods.
3. There are many typos and inaccurate words/punctuation marks/notations in the paper, making the paper hard to follow. 
4. In Table 1, CQL has similar overall performance but shorter error bars than the proposed method OfflineLight, so it may be overclaim to say that the proposed method "shows more robust performance among offline-RL methods."
5. The main paper is not self-contained, the authors may remove/reduce Section 5 and move the results of Section 6.6 & 6.7 onto the main paper.

### Questions
1. What is the reward function you use for the RL formulation of the TSC problem?
2. What this the meaning of this sentence: "the Critic is applied to address overestimated values of the Critic"?
3. I don't understand this sentence in Section 4.3.1: "where $\pi_{\theta'}$ is the target policy network by constraining the policy." Wouldn't the "target policy network" being an exponential moving average of the learning policy as in BEAR [3]?
4. For the sentence "In general, the Actor implementation applies PSR to overfitting to narrow peaks in the value estimate..." Why applying PSR to **overfitting** to narrow peaks?
5. "Our method provides new insights into the OOD problem of offline RL" --- Could you be more specific about what are the new insights?
6. How many seeds do you use in composing Table 1?
