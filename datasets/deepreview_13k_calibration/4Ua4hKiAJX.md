## Abstract
Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are popular models for machine learning on graphs that typically follow the message-passing paradigm, whereby the feature of a node is updated recursively upon aggregating information over its neighbors. While exchanging messages over the input graph endows GNNs with a strong inductive bias, it can also make GNNs susceptible to \emph{over-squashing}, thereby preventing them from capturing long-range interactions in the given graph. To rectify this issue, {\em graph rewiring} techniques have been proposed as a means of improving information flow by altering the graph connectivity. In this work, we identify three desiderata for graph-rewiring: (i) reduce over-squashing, (ii) respect the locality of the graph, and 
(iii) preserve the sparsity of the graph. We highlight fundamental trade-offs that occur between {\em spatial} and {\em spectral} rewiring techniques; while the former often satisfy (i) and (ii) but not (iii), the latter generally satisfy (i) and (iii) at the expense of (ii). We propose a novel rewiring framework that satisfies all of (i)--(iii) through a locality-aware sequence of rewiring operations. We then discuss a specific instance of such rewiring framework and 
validate its effectiveness on several real-world benchmarks, showing that it either matches or significantly outperforms existing rewiring approaches.

### Summary
This paper proposed a sequential rewiring method, LASER, that improves connectivity, and preserves locality in the original graph, and theoretically alleviates the over-squashing problem. Empirical experiments show that LASER outperforms the baselines on some LRGB and TUDatasets.

### Strengths
- This paper gives a good summarization of spectral and spatial rewiring methods.
- The anti-over-squashing and sparsity motivation of the paper makes sense.
- The sequential rewiring idea is pretty good so that edges are not added at once but more carefully selected.
- The connection between sequential rewiring and multi-relational GNN is novel
- The writing is good and clear.

### Weaknesses
 - The paper does not explain why adding distant edges is not a good choice. In other words, why must we respect the locality and inductive bias of the given graph? Therefore, the paper does not fully convince me of their significance, although the sparsity motivation is good, the method is novel, and the experimental results seem good.
- The paper selects some spectral rewiring baselines but does not compare with DRew [1] and SP-MPNN [2] in the experiments, which also attend multi-hop neighbors in their message passing scheme and should be considered as spatial rewiring baselines. On LRGB datasets, DRew seems even better.
- As this is a rewiring approach, it does not seem to make sense to do experiments with PCQM-Contact, which is an edge prediction task
- The choice of connectivity measure in equation (8) is not efficient. The matrix multiplication would also be O(N^3). If the matrices are sparse, then the complexity would be at least O(N^2 * d_max).

### Summary
This paper explores the concept of graph rewiring, which involves altering graph connectivity to improve information flow. Three essential objectives for graph rewiring are identified: (i) reducing over-squashing, (ii) preserving the graph's local structure, and (iii) maintaining its sparsity. 

The authors highlight that there is a trade-off between two primary techniques in graph rewiring: spatial and spectral methods. They argue that spatial methods tend to address over-squashing and local structure but may not preserve sparsity, while spectral methods generally handle over-squashing and sparsity but might not maintain local properties. 

To tackle these trade-offs, the paper introduces a novel rewiring framework. This framework employs a sequence of operations that are sensitive to the graph's local characteristics, aiming to simultaneously meet all three objectives: reducing over-squashing, respecting the graph's locality, and preserving its sparsity. Furthermore, the paper discusses a specific instance of this proposed framework and evaluates its performance on real-world benchmarks.

### Strengths
The authors gave a nice taxonomy of rewiring methods and the issues that they suffer from

### Weaknesses
 * In the paper they constantly cite spectral methods such as Arnaiz-Rodríguez et al., Black et al., 2023 and transformer-based methods such as Kreuzer et al., 2021; Mialon et al., 2021; Ying et al., 2021; Rampasek et al., 2022. But in the tables, there is no comparison with these methods.

* The results are very poor, especially when it comes to the task of graph classification, where the method is not able to outperform the few selected models.

### Questions
* Why do you say that spectral methods are not local, since most of them combine long-range information (by bypassing the bottleneck) and initial neighborhood? For instance, Arnaiz-Rodríguez et al. combine the CT model (long-range) with MPNN with the initial adj.

* Is there any study of the parameter k? For instance, what happens for large k values? How does it affect the relationship between the distance of nodes of the same cluster (locally) and nodes of different clusters (globally)?

* Can there be any attention mechanism between the snapshots, attending to those snapshots that contribute more to the representation of the graph, as they do in multiple papers where they explore different adj  (Abu-El-Haija et al., 2019; or FSGNN (Improving Graph Neural Networks with Simple Architecture Design)?

### Summary
This paper presents a framework for graph rewiring. Specifically, the paper suggests having two competing metric - one for oversquashing and one for distance to the original graph that should be balanced. The paper presents a specific instantiation of the framework and present numerical experiments to show the benefit of the framework.

### Strengths
**Originality**

The framework presented in the paper is new. However, the idea of preserving the original graph structure is not new, further as the authors themselves state the idea of using relational GNNs is not new either. Though they do have an original extension of the framework. 

**Quality**

Please see weaknesses. 

**Clarity**

The paper is well written and places itself very well in the context of prior work. This I think is the papers biggest strength. The framework is clearly presented. However, the paper's clarity degrades in Section 5. For example Proposition 5.2 is not clear and there is no formal statement or proof anywhere in the paper. 

**Significance**

The paper's method does seem to perform better than SDRF and FOSR. However, I have certain concerns about the experiments, highlighted in the weakness section.

### Weaknesses
I think there a few weaknesses. Part of my concern with the paper is that as detailed in point 2a, there are now many different rewiring techniques. However, I do not think we understand oversquashing yet. Hence for me new papers in the area either need to a thorough comparison with prior work to show empirical improvement. Or contributes to understanding oversquashing and I think this paper, unfortunately, does not do either. 

1) One big weakness is Proposition 5.2. The statement in the paper is informal and incomplete. However, the paper does not have a formal statement or a proof. This is a big concern. For example, for the informal statement $\mathcal{G} = \emptyset$ vacuously gives us the result. However, that version is meaningless. Hence a formal statement is needed. There is space in the paper for this discussion, the first few pages are quite repetitive. 

I see that page 14 has something that is called a proof. But without a formal statement the notion of proof does not make sense to me. And there is no formal statement. A.2 is thought of to be formal statement but it refers to a lower bound in 5.2 which is not clear. 

2) I have a few concerns about the experiments. 

    a) First, I think the paper compares against very few prior works. The paper does a good job of citing many prior works in the area but then only compares against two of them. The paper should compare against most of the following or explain why it is not relevant to do so: GTR (Black et al. 2023), BORF (Nguyen et al. 2023), DRew (Gutteridge et al 2023), DIGL (Gasteiger et al 2019), Expander propagation (Deac et al 2022), DiffWire (Arnaiz Rodriguez et al 2022). The paper even cites Brüel-Gabrielsson et al., 2022; Abboud et al., 2022, and  Banerjee et al., 2022 as further works with rewiring techniques. 

   b) I also have some concerns with the experiments that are present. First, as the paper notes the network from FOSR is the case that $L=1$. However, for the method proposed in the paper, the paper uses $L \in \{2,3,4,5\}$. Since for each $\ell \le L$ we have a different weight matrix, this implies that the networks for LASER are bigger than the networks used for FOSR and SDRF. This is an inequity that could account for the improved performance. 

   c) Hyperparameter tuning. The paper mentions that they tune $L$ and $\rho$ for their method. However, they do not perform any hyper parameter tuning for the comparison methods (SDRF and FOSR). They fix the number of edges to be 40. This is another thing that could account for the inequity between the methods. It is also not mentioned what number is reported, I am assuming that the experiments trained models for each of the hyperparameters, picked the setting with the best validation performance and then reported the test error, however it would good if this were explicitly mentioned (since Figure 3 reports the metrics on the test data for all hyperparameters). 

3) I think the fairer version for the experiments would be to sequentially rewire the datasets with FOSR and SDRF such for each $1 \le \ell \le L$ all sets $E_\ell$ have the same size. I think this would help determine if part of the reason for increased performance is the rewiring or the new GNN architecture.  

The next couple of concerns are more minor. 

4) In terms of the context for the work, I think the following could be clarified. The notion of oversquashing in Alan and Yahav 2021, and the other papers Topping et al 2022, Black et al., 2023; Di Giovanni et al., 2023 are subtly but in my opinion importantly different. Alon and Yahav 2021, is a more information theoretic issue that is highlighted. Vectors of a certain size can not aggregate too much information. However, the issue in Topping et al 2022, Black et al., 2023; Di Giovanni et al., 2023 is more about optimization rather than information theory. These papers talk about how the Jacobian has a small norm. Hence while both phenomena can be labelled as oversquahing I do think they are different and should be treated as such. 

5) The paper measures the "information" provided by the graph structure as preserving locality. Specifically, they say ``while the measure $\nu$ is any quantity that penalizes interactions among nodes that are ‘distant’ according to some metric on the input graph.'' However, local structure of the graph and the information stored in the graph are not the same thing.

### Summary
This paper focuses on graph rewiring, a technique used to reduce the over-squashing problem in GNNs. It analyzes three desiderata for graph-rewiring, pointing out that previous methods fail to satisfy all of them. Based on this, the authors propose a novel rewiring framework that satisfies all three desiderata, considering locality by a sequential process. Finally, they validate the method on various real-world benchmarks.

### Strengths
1. The paper clearly points out that previous graph rewiring fails to satisfy three aspects, and suggests a new method satisfying all aspects.
2. The paper is overall well written and structured.
3. The theoretical analysis provides an explanation on why the suggest method works well.

### Weaknesses
1. The background for preserving sparsity seems to be weaker compared to the background for preserving locality, where the authors give effective resistance as example for preserving locality. It would be more persuasive if the authors gave an experiment result or paper for the question, “some of these new connections introduced by spatial rewiring methods may be removed with affecting the improved connectivity.”
2. Authors have used “effective resistance” throughout the paper to support their claim. However, the paper does not have any comparison with the graph rewiring method that uses effective resistance$^{[1]}$.

### Questions
1. The paper used the number of walks for the connectivity measure $\mu$. According to the preliminaries in section 2, it seems that the connectivity measure is an unnormalized adjacency matrix. However, in the theorem 4.1 of the citated paper (Di Giovanni et al., 2023), the number of walks are divided by power of minimum node degree. Following this, doesn’t the adjacency matrix should be normalized using the node degree?
2. For the necessity of sequential rewiring, authors claimed that instantaneous rewiring easily violates either locality or sparsity constraint. In Figure 3, authors conducted an ablation study on the number of snapshots. Is there any comparison with an instantaneous rewiring, i.e., snapshot being 1?
3. The connectivity and locality measures are only computed once over input graph to make the rewiring process efficient. However, it seems that these measure might change after some sequential steps of graph rewiring. For example, the shortest-walk distance between two nodes might get smaller after some graph rewiring steps, leading to another graph rewiring rather than the authors intended. Is it just that the performance gap of computing measures once and at each rewiring step did not differ much?
