## Abstract
Efficient high-dimensional integration enables novel approaches to calibrate and control model uncertainty during training. In particular, the recently-proposed projective integral update formulation of variational inference derives model uncertainty from expectations that extract the local loss topography. Thus, we propose random-affinity sigma-point (RASP) quadratures, which are designed to eliminate integration errors from basis functions that drive Gaussian mean-field updates. Using only 3 gradient evaluations, RASP quadratures can extract locally-averaged gradients and Hessian diagonals from the loss, while eliminating errors from over half of all quadratic total-degree terms. Alternatively, we can use 6-point RASP quadratures to obtain 5th-order exactness in all univariate terms as well as 3rd-order exactness for two-thirds of bivariate terms. This work presents the design of RASP quadratures, theoretical guarantees on exactness, and analysis of expected errors. We also provide an open-source PyTorch implementation of RASP quadratures with quasi-Newton variational Bayes (QNVB), i.e. the projective integral update algorithm for Gaussian mean fields. Although RASP quadratures are designed to support QNVB, they are also compatible with other forms of variational inference, such as stochastic gradient variational Bayes (SGVB). Our experiments compare alternative integration schemes and training methods using three different learning tasks and architectures, demonstrating that efficient integration can improve generalizability for architectures with suitable loss structure.

### Summary
This paper proposes a "random-affinity sigma-point (RASP) quadrature" method for numerical integration w.r.t. high-dimensional Gaussian distributions. The point is to use very few integration nodes. RASP quadrature is constructed by "scaling" a quadrature method on a low-dimensional reference space to higher dimensions by retaining the quadrature weights and picking random coordinates (and doing sign-changes) of the original quadrature nodes.

RASP quadrature is applied to some large-scale problems that I am not qualified to comment on. In this review I focus on the quadrature part of the paper.

### Strengths
The paper is well and clearly written. In some of the experiments the proposed method is observed to outperform some competitors. I suppose the RASP quadrature being quite simply can also be seen as a strength.

### Weaknesses
I am rather skeptical about novelty of the proposed quadrature. Having never worked in a setting in which even n = d + 1 nodes is prohibitive, I cannot provide any references. However, the limited and superficial literature review on pages 4 and 9 does not convince me that the authors know the relevant quadrature well enough to say with any confidence that something like this has not been tried before.

I would like to see some language reflecting this inserted in the paper.

However, the quadrature method does not necessarily need to be novel. I am not against accepting this paper if the consensus is that the overall variational inference methodology presented here constitutes a useful contribution to the field.

### Summary
This paper proposes a new randomized quadrature scheme, random-affinity sigma-point (RASP) quadrature, for the purpose of mean-field variational inference (MFVI). RASP is combined with a recent variational inference method proposed in a separate paper based on a method called projective integral updates. The resulting method essentially combines RASP with MFVI using quasi-newton-like preconditioning.

### Strengths
* The paper proposes a new randomized quadrature scheme they call RASP.

### Weaknesses
The paper lacks reference to a number of highly relevant related work that develops a context for the current paper. Here are some places (non-exhaustive list) where I think a citation is needed, with specific recommendations:
* Section 1 first paragraph: cite something for Markov-chain Monte Carlo (MCMC). Although this is folk wisdom, a citation is required for the claim "MCMC is not practical for large learning architectures that often contain billions of parameters."
* Section 1 second paragraph: cite something for mean-field variational inference (MFVI). MFVI didn't appear out of thin air. The development/popularization of MFVI is often attributed to [1-3].
* Section 1.2 last sentence: stochastic gradient variational Bayes (SGVB) was independently developed by [4-6], where the use of SGVB for general Bayesian inference is commonly attributed to [4,5]. I suspect the intended citation here was Kingma and Welling [6]?
* Section 2.1 first sentence: cite something for variational inference. In general, people cite these two well-known reviews [7,8].

Probably due to the issue above, the paper misses a very important line of related works:
* Randomized quasi-Monte Carlo (RMQC) for variational inference [9]
* RQMC and stochastic quasi-Newton optimization for variational inference [10]

While I'm not claiming that the method lacks novelty, this paper does not do a good job of putting the work in the context of this line of work. Does this method improve over these works? Is it different from the (randomized) quasi-Monte Carlo schemes that are used in these works? This leads me to the next point.

The choice of baselines and the overall design of the experiments makes the conclusion of the experiments unclear. In particular, the experiments do not appear to be doing an apple-to-apple comparison. Also, some experimental details are missing.
* Variational inference is fundamentally a method for approximating the posterior. How was the joint likelihood obtained here? Was a prior set on the parameters of these models? Was an improper flat prior set on the parameters? What were the hyperparameters? It is, in fact, known that the choice of prior in deep learning models affects the result a lot [11].
* The paper only compares against the following combinations: RASP + QNVB, MC + SGVB, MC + QNVB, QMC + QNVB. Why was RASP + SGVB not compared against? Also, the closely related works based on randomized QMC [9,10] and the QNVB algorithm proposed in [10] should also have been included.


### Minor Comments
* When denoting the variational approximation q, it is non-standard to denote conditioning on $\varphi$. This is because the variational parameters $\varphi$ are not considered to be random variables (their probability density has not been defined)
* Section 1.1 third paragraph second from the last sentence “... Hessian diagonal of the training loss, which can be expensive to compute.” I believe saying that it is noisy is more accurate. In fact, noisy estimates are cheap to obtain, as shown by [12].
* Section 2.2 last sentence: is there any evidence that alternative integration schemes scale better in terms of dimensionality? Because quasi-Monte Carlo methods, while converging faster with respect to the number of samples, have an explicit dimension dependence, unlike regular Monte Carlo. I suspect RASP would have similar behavior, although it is hard to tell since the author did not present a convergence bound akin to those in the QMC literature. Nonetheless, when the number of samples is small, I am not sure if the method can be claimed to be scalable in terms of dimension.

### Summary
The authors proposed RASP quadratures which serve as an evaluation-efficient method for high-dimensional integration. RASP quadratures minimize the error corresponding to basis functions that dominate variational updates for Gaussian mean fields.

### Strengths
The idea of  using RASP quadrature for QNVB is interesting and new.

The performance of the proposed method is demonstrated through a range of experiments.

### Weaknesses
The related work section should be expanded to include more discussion. Clearly, QMC is very relevant and other quadrature methods are also relevant.

It is unclear how the proposed RASP quadrature method compares to existing methods in terms of computational cost, especially for high-dimensional problems. The paper would benefit from a more detailed analysis of the computational complexity of RASP compared to alternatives like standard Monte Carlo or other deterministic quadrature rules. The current discussion lacks a rigorous comparison of the number of function evaluations required to achieve a given level of accuracy.

Furthermore, the paper does not provide a clear explanation of how the basis functions are chosen, and how this choice impacts the performance of the method. The connection between the basis functions that dominate variational updates and the choice of quadrature nodes needs to be more explicitly justified. The current explanation is somewhat vague and lacks the necessary detail for reproducibility.

### Questions
Is there any theoretical justification for the number of nodes (and corresponding function evaluations) in general?
