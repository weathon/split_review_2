## Abstract
Mixture models are traditionally represented and learned by \textit{adding} several distributions as components.
Allowing mixtures to \textit{subtract} probability mass or density can
    drastically reduce the number of
    components needed to model complex distributions. 
    However, learning such subtractive mixtures while ensuring they still encode a non-negative function
    is
    challenging. 
    We investigate how to
    learn and perform inference on deep subtractive mixtures by \textit{squaring} them. 
    We do this in the framework of probabilistic circuits, which enable us to represent tensorized mixtures and generalize several other subtractive models.
    We theoretically prove that the class of squared circuits allowing subtractions can be exponentially more expressive than traditional additive
    mixtures; 
        and, we empirically show this increased expressiveness on a series of real-world distribution estimation tasks.

### Summary
The authors consider the problem of learning a mixture model where the separate components do not have to be positive.

This can be naively done by squaring the additive MM but this is computationally inefficient.

The authors develop a method based on probabilistic circuits allowing to square different model structures without excessive computational cost.

### Strengths
The paper is reasonably clear and proposes simple yet interesting idea which appears to work well on selected synthetic/small scale experiments.

The authors provide the code for the experiments (which I did not reviewed).

The figure in page 1 nicely summarises the benefit of relaxing the requirement of positive components. Overall the figures in the paper help to understand the introduced concepts.

I think the paper is an interesting read.

### Weaknesses
The clarity of the paper in pages 4,5,6 could be improved, the presentation is very dense and discusses multiple threads. The paper would benefit from focusing on core ideas and describing them in more detail while the less important parts could be moved to the appendix.

I have concerns that a few points in the paper are overselling the method (i.e the result in Fig 5. on test data appears very small if statistically significant at all but using ^2 introduces additional computational cost). I would welcome the balanced discussion describing advantages and disadvantages of the method.

The authors do not discuss in detail how much additional computational cost is needed to achieve these results (a plot log-likelihood improvement vs CPU time would make the paper stronger). 

Error bars in Figure 2 would help to understand the significance of empirical results.

In my eyes, the empirical improvements warranted by the proposed method are rather small and mostly shown on synthetic data.

The authors somewhat addressed three different questions in the empirical section but I feel it would be nicer to provide strong evidence for just one question: Does NPC^2 provide strong gains in performance without substantial increase in computational cost?

In Figure 4 the authors show that while NPC^2 outperforms MPC for LT and BT separately, for the cross comparison NPC^2(LT) vs MPC(BT) the latter can be better (similarly in table F5). This begs the question: is the RG doing the heavy lifting? If so, more empirical analysis would be helpful.

The authors should also elaborate on the selection of RG for improved clarity.

Why the differences reported in F2(a) are so small?

Can the authors elaborate on the statement 105-106 regarding batching? I appears not fully clear to me. I cannot see how one can perform batching in (4) without introducing the bias to the gradient due to the presence of $\nabla log Z$. Normally calculating  $\nabla log Z$ requires sampling from the mode with every update of the parameters; it would be useful to provide exact update rule for clarity. Is the learning rule unbiased?

Since $\log c(x)^2 = 2 \log c(x)$ the majority of the difference between maximising MM and MM^2 comes from the difference in the gradients of $\log Z$ for MM and MM^2, I think this requires more clarity/explanation.

### Summary
Motivated by mixture models, the paper investigates a class of functions that is a squared mixture of arbitrary functions with potentially negative weights and functions that do not necessarily represent a density function. After motivating this in the "shallow" regime, the authors propose extensions to deep mixtures based on tensorized circuits.

### Strengths
- [S1]: Originality -- as far as I can judge it's a novel and very interesting 
- [S2]: Significance -- seems to often work better than mixture models and other alternatives such as flows
- [S3]: Clarity -- While the part related to tensor computations is a bit dense and could benefit from a more higher-level treatise, the paper is clearly written

### Weaknesses
 - [W1]: Missing discussion / limitations: Maybe I overlooked this, but I could not find an actual discussion about the restriction of the approach, e.g., 
    + what are the limitations of the approach?
    + how restrictive is the induced functional form by using squared functions? Specifically, while the approach is motivated by mixture models, it is unclear if the squaring operation limits the ability to model complex multimodal distributions effectively. Are there specific types of distributions that this approach would struggle with compared to standard mixture models or other flexible density estimators?
    + how expressive is the approach in the shallow or small-K setting? (Fig. 5 e.g. indicates that $\pm$ is worse for small $K$) This is particularly important since the motivation is based on shallow mixtures. It would be beneficial to see a more detailed analysis of the expressiveness in this regime, perhaps by comparing the learned densities to the true densities for a range of small $K$ values.
    + is it possible to extend the approach to a conditional setup? It would be useful to understand if this approach can be used in scenarios where the density is conditioned on some other variables, and what modifications would be necessary.
- [W2]: Experiments: The paper addresses the computational costs of the approach from a theoretical point of view and even provides some empirical evidence for the computation of the normalization constant, but empirically investigating a couple of scaling aspects such as 
    + the scaling in $D$ or Specifically, how does the computational cost (both time and memory) scale with the dimensionality of the data $D$ for both training and inference? This is a critical factor for the applicability of the method to high-dimensional data.
    + a comparison with other appraoches such as the MAFs in terms of runtime A direct comparison of training and inference times with other common density estimation methods like Masked Autoregressive Flows (MAFs) would provide valuable practical insights into the efficiency of the proposed method. This should also include a comparison of the number of parameters used by each method to make it a fair comparison.

    would provide further valuable insights (e.g. related to "fairness" when tuning different methods). 
- [W3]: Presentation (minor): Some of the graphics are rather hard to read:
    + relatively small and dense (Fig. 4) The scatter plots are difficult to interpret due to their size and density. It would be beneficial to either enlarge the plots or provide zoomed-in versions to better visualize the distributions.
    + the x or y-axis labels are sometimes missing (Fig. 4) or hard to find (not centered; Fig. 5, C1) The lack of clear axis labels makes it difficult to understand the plots. In Figure 4, the absence of x-axis labels is particularly problematic. In Figure 5 and C1, the axis labels should be centered for better readability.

### Summary
Mixture models traditionally are represented as convex combinations of simpler probability distributions. This paper proposes loosening this constraint to any linear combination, and squaring the result at the end to ensure non-negativity. This modification is then applied to probabilistic circuits (by allowing negative weights in sums, and then squaring). Theoretical and empirical analysis confirm:

1. Better distribution approximations for a given number of parameters (with a theoretical example showing exponential separation)
2. Preservation of smoothness and decomposability when converting a PC to a squared NPC.

### Strengths
- Simple and effective idea
- Empirical results show better performance than baseline on some tasks

### Weaknesses
 - Paper's motivation can be stronger. e.g. add a real world motivating example. It would be interesting to see how the better density estimation can be used for an improved downstream task as well.
- The NPCs use fewer parameters but in a more complex way. What is the impact of this on training cost. This question is not explored empirically.

### Questions
Questions/Suggestions:
- GPT2 distillation experiment should compare other tractable models
- Exponential separation is established theoretically for a restricted class of functions (unique disjointness). Is it possible to establish that for a more general class of distributions?
- Definition A.1 in Appendix A seems to have a typo. The sum nodes should use sc(n_i), instead of sc(c_i)?

### Summary
Mixture models (herein called MPC) are probability density functions over a domain $X$ that are composed by adding together multiple simpler probability density functions. The authors propose a more general framework, (called NPC), where any functions over the domain $X$ (or specific dimensions of $X$) may be multiplied, added, subtracted together and finally squared to return a non-negative scalar which, under the right conditions the authors prove, can also be normalised yielding a probability density. Given the same number of parameters, the proposed NPC models have far more expressive capability than traditional MPCs, in fact proven exponentially more capacity.

The authors describe a range of concepts, rooted graphs, tensor circuits, to lead to the conditions for a given NPC to be marginalizable. Theoretical relationships with related work is described and finally experiments demonstrate the efficacy of the propoosed approach.

### Strengths
- extensive theoretical evaluation
  - proof of conditions for normalization which significantly affects model design
  - proof of exponential expresivity
  - proofs of connections to related methods

- simplicity
  - take some functions over the space $X$, functions over disjoint subsets of dimensions
  - multiply them (across disjoint groups)
  - add them together (functions within a disjoint group)
  - sum the output and square it to get a single non-negative scalar value
  - if we followed the rules, we can find the partition function/normalising constant in one forward pass of the function
  - I feel this is very intuitive and surprisingly simple, and most importantly  avoids difficult normalisation (e.g. MCMC) while yielding a big improvement in expressiveness over standard mixture models. Analytic normalisation also enables conditioning. Sampling is briefly mentioned in the Appendix and appears to be one point to be harder than MPCs.

### Weaknesses
While I feel confident I understood the method paper and the paper, I am not familiar with the surrounding literature hence my comments are mainly on the general practicalities and the paper presentation.

## Major Comments

The main four big questions I have mostly relate to practical considerations  
- How do I normalise $c(X)$? Much of section 3 is building foundations to finally reach proposition 1 which successfully solves the issue of normalization (which is a significant strength of the paper in my view)
- For a given dataset, how do I find the rooted graph? The issue is not so carefully discussed, and presumably there is no theoretical or provable result and in practice one must simply employ some sort of architecture search. If not already, this should be clarified in the main paper as I feel it may be an obstacle for practitioners.
- Given the exponentially more expressiveness, could this easily lead to overfitting? A quick word search in the document doesn't yield results, this is not mentioned once?
- How do I generate samples? This is described in the appendix and appears to be not as easy compared to MPCs, 

I understand if the authors would like to argue this is a more theoretical paper and such practicalities are beyond scope.

## Minor Comments (Presentation)

### Content Density
Upon first reading, I was exhausted by section 5, however upon second reading the paper made much more sense.
  - Sections 1, 2 were simple and easy to follow
  - section 3 was hard work on first reading but very clear on second reading (see details below)
  - section 4 contains multiple short sharp deep dives into a range of related fields.
  - section 5 was very short and I personally didn't truly understand the benchmarks nor get a feel for implementing the method or its practicalities or failure modes, (e.g. overfitting, sensitivity to rooted graph, sampling)

Given the main paper introduces a range of concepts, then proposes a new method, provides proven results and proves connections to related fields and then benchmarks, I feel like this is a (very nice) journal paper that was heavily compressed into 9 pages and all of the overflow was placed in the appendix. 

The theoretical treatment is extensive. The authors may consider moving some of the less significant content regarding other works in Section 4 to the appendix in order to extend section 5 with more "hands on" details about the using NPCs, e.g. a worked illustrative example or failure modes or sensitivity to the rooted graph.

### Section 3 detailed comments
I understand computational graphs have nodes that are operations and the links are tensors, 
- Definition 1 was very hard to follow, the ambiguous notation that $\ell$ represent a layer as well as a numerical output tensor from a layer. 
- Figure 2 b, c, blur the boundary of "nodes" and "edges", there are rectangles with operations, and there are volumes between them also with operations (hadamard product and $W$). Even now I struggle to parse these diagrams.

### questions:
 - In Figure 2,b,. the sum layer must output dimension $S=K$ in order to be accepted by the following product layer?
- how does one find the rooted graph/division partition or variables? Try a handful of graphs and choose the maximum likelihood graph?
- there is much discussion on tensored circuits which have a tensor output, I presume the final layer is a sum to scalar layer?
- the authors justify the naming of "tensorized circuits" as a way to encompass and simplify other methods. If I understand correctly, these  are standard computational graphs, the bread and butter of all pytorch or tensorflow users, is a new name really required?

### Summary
The paper proposes a way to learn and represent mixture models with negative weights by squaring the linear combination defined by these models. The resulting model is cast into the Probabilistic Circuits (PCs) framework and thus further extended to deep mixture models, resulting in the main contribution of the paper, squared non-monotonic PCs (or NPC$^2$s). NPC$^2$s are theoretically proven to be more expressive efficient than regular (or monotonic) PCs, which translates to strong empirical results in a number of benchmarks.

### Strengths
The work is novel and certainly relevant for the Tractable Probabilistic Models community, since it adds a new and provenly more expressive model to the class of Probabilistic Circuits. More importantly, the main ideas are well developed in the text and thoroughly analyzed both theoretically and empirically, allowing for a well-rounded understanding of this new class of models. The text itself is well written and easy to follow, and the related work develops important connections to other methods and models in the literature of Probabilistic Circuits and beyond.

### Weaknesses
The paper is very well executed, and honestly I cannot think of any major flaws or possible improvements besides the couple of questions I outline below.

Unless I missed it, there is no mention of how the number of parameters of the MPCs used in the experiments compare to that of MPC$^2$ and NPC$^2$. I assume the authors used the same number of parameters for all models, which is probably the most natural comparison, but it would be interesting to compare the squared models with an MPC of size equal to that of the unrolled model (e.g. as in the right hand side of Figure 1). I imagine MPC$^2$ and NPC$^2$ would still perform better because, despite being less flexible than the unrolled MPC, they effectively share weights among components, which probably facilitates learning. Would the authors share the same opinion? Weight sharing might be important in practice, and the paper could benefit from exploring this aspect a bit further in the text or experiments.
How does the optimization of NPC$^2$ with SGD compare to that of regular MPCs? Some would argue that optimization is one of the main bottlenecks holding PCs back, since they tend to converge relatively fast, probably quickly getting stuck in local minima. Have the authors observed any notable differences in convergence or stability of the optimization process of NPC$^2$s as compared to MPCs? Even though NPC$^2$s are provenly more expressive than regular MPCs, their utility is heavily tied to how easy they are to learn, and it would be useful to have more insights in that sense.

Small remarks:
- I believe the signed logsumexp trick, or a very similar solution, was already used in previous works to compute expectations of arbitrary functions using PCs [1, 2]. The PCs used there did not have negative weights, of course, but the signed logsumexp trick was needed to propagate negative values through the networks since the functions one would compute the expectation of could take negative values. I am not sure the trick is actually mentioned in the papers, but it is certainly used in their respective implementations.
- Line 227: “they” is repeated.
- Line 303: The “to” after “answer” is not necessary.
