## Abstract
Neglecting the effect that decisions have on individuals (and thus, on the underlying data distribution) when designing algorithmic decision-making policies may increase inequalities and unfairness in the long term---even if fairness considerations were taken in the policy design process.
In this paper, we propose a novel 
framework for achieving long-term group fairness in dynamical systems, in which current decisions may affect an individual's features in the next step, and thus, future decisions. 
Specifically, our framework allows us to identify a time-independent policy that converges, if deployed, to the \emph{targeted} fair stationary state of the system in the long-term, independently of the initial data distribution.
We model the system dynamics with a time-homogeneous Markov chain and optimize the policy leveraging the Markov chain convergence theorem to ensure unique convergence.
We provide examples of different targeted fair states of the system, encompassing a range of long-term goals for society and policy makers.
Furthermore, we show how our approach facilitates the evaluation of different long-term targets by examining their impact on the group-conditional population distribution in the long term and how it evolves until convergence.

### Confidence
3: You are fairly confident in your assessment. It is possible that you did not understand some parts of the submission or that you are unfamiliar with some pieces of related work. Math/other details were not carefully checked.

### Summary
This paper considers fair RL and proposes an algorithm that converges to a desirable fair policy. The paper also discussed several fairness measurements and conduct extensive simulations.

### Strengths
The paper is well-written. The fairness issue is important for RL. The discussions on fairness are clear. The simulations are extensive.

### Weaknesses
The paper lacks enough novelty to be accepted by ICLR. There is a significant amount of space used to explain basic MDP and Markov Chain properties. The novel contribution of this paper is rather limited. Theorem 4.1 is an established result instead of the authors' new contributions. The discussions on different definitions of fairness are also standard. In summary, I struggle to see the novelty of this paper.

### Summary
The paper examines setting where akin to performative prediction point of view machine learning algorithms via their decisions can affect the data/individuals they operate on creating a closed loop between predictions and datasets. In this type of setting they explore how long-term fairness can be achieved from a dynamical systems perspective. Particularly, the assume that the interaction between the algs and people can be modeled via a Markov chain and under assumptions such as irreducibility, aperiodicity and homogeneity it is guaranteed to converge to a single stationary distribution regardless of initial conditions. Given this setting they define an optimization problem to find a policy such that, if found, guarantees that the system converges, irrespective of the initial state, to a pre-defined targeted fair, stationary
data distribution. In their setting the probem in question is a linear constrained optimization problem and they can readily employ any efficient black-box optimization methods for this class. They consider a handful of different fairness metrics (that can be plugged in in the framework) and end with simultations.

### Strengths
The paper examines a very interesting and important problem working on the interplay between ML algorithms and the data they operate on. The framework is flexible and as long as the statespace is not too large allows for solving the problem in question using a plethora of readily available techniques.

### Weaknesses
I am not perfectly convinced about the modelling assumptions in the paper. Markovian assumption (memoryless behavior, linear systems) and even further the stronger assumption than the controller has the power to induce a MC with a unique attracting stationary distribution does not seem realistic to me.

First of all, there are recent paper that examine dynamics in such settings but the dynamics driven by the agents strategically adapting their data are non-linear as the dynamics typically are in game theory. Of particular interest in this case is [1], where it is shown that such dynamics can be formally chaotic and in fact have periodic orbits of all possible periods. What this means is that these systems have infinitely many stationary distributions. (take the uniform probability distribution on each periodic orbit of length N for arbitrary N). This also happens for relatively simple settings of performative prediction with standard optimization/game theory dynamics. This is a dynamical system perspective that it is in stark contrast with the current one.

Now there are some models of agent dynamics in the literature using MC (e.g. [3] and follows-ups) but in those papers there is a very expansive description of why the specific choices appropriate. In the current paper, I felt that these assumptions are largely there to make the setting tractable and reducible to a problem that we already know how to solve. Is there any way to connect game theoretic models (e.g. [3]) to yours?

Given that there no new computational or analytic tools developed I believed the main contribution of the paper is on the modeling side, hence I would like to see a more careful discussion of these choices instead of generic theory of MCs.

### Questions
Why is a linear, memoryless model with appropriate? Why is it a reasonable assumption that the system controller can enforce the assumptions of the Markov Convergence Theorem and instead not have many possible stationary distributions?

2: You are willing to defend your assessment, but it is quite likely that you did not understand the central parts of the submission or that you are unfamiliar with some pieces of related work. Math/other details were not carefully checked.

### Summary
This paper presents a framework for achieving long-term group fairness in dynamical systems, in which current decisions may affect an individual’s features in the next step, and thus, future decisions. The framework is largely characterized by two steps: defining the characteristics of a long-term fair distribution in the decision-making context, and transforming it into a constrained optimization problem. The framework is evaluated on a loan repayment dataset.

### Strengths
1. The paper is clearly presented and easy to follow.
2. The considered problem is interesting and relevant to ICLR.

### Weaknesses
First, I must admit that I am not an expert in this field and am unfamiliar with the literature. However, I have some concerns regarding the novelty and technical soundness of this paper.

1. In terms of novelty, this paper appears to be closely related to (Zhang et al., 2020), as acknowledged in the paper. However, the differences between the two have not been adequately discussed. From my perspective, both the models and techniques applied in this paper seem quite similar to those in (Zhang et al., 2020).

2. Additionally, this paper only considers one dataset, which raises questions about the generalizability of the framework to other datasets. For instance, (Zhang et al., 2020) considered two real-world datasets: the FICO dataset (same as in this paper) and the COMPAS dataset (which is not addressed in this paper). It would be much more beneficial to explore the performance of the model on multiple datasets to assess its applicability more comprehensively.

### Questions
1. What is the conceptual and technical novelty of this paper, compared to (Zhang et al. 2020)?
2. What is the reason for considering only one dataset?

### Summary
This paper proposes a general framework using Markov Chains to model long-term fairness in dynamic system where decisions can change the underlying states. Modeling the problem as a constrained optimization, a time independent policy can be identified using Markov Chain convergence theorem. Examples of long-terms fairness formulation were given together with simulations.

### Strengths
1.	The model has a general formulation which can incorporate different long-term fairness objectives.
2.	The convergence to the stationary distribution is guaranteed as long as the assumptions for Markov Convergence Theorem are satisfied.
3.	The paper is well organized with good background summary.

### Weaknesses
1. The main weakness of the paper is in the contribution. As claimed in the introduction, the drawback of using RL based methods for unknown dynamics is the requirement of large amount of training data. In this paper, however, it is assumed that the model is already learned. So the problem is changed to an optimization problem with known parameters. Therefore, it does not seem to be a fair comparison that this is an improvement over RL based methods.
2. As cited in section 6, there are many existing works with different long-term fairness constraints. It is not clear what is the advantage of having a unified framework. For example, can this new framework solve the problem faster especially for more complex dynamics with large state space? Otherwise, the new model framework seems like a reformulation of existing models.

### Questions
1.	The key operation of the framework is solving the optimization problem as described in section 5. It would be better to give more information on the details of the complexity of solving this constrained optimization problem. 
2.	The description of the simulation is not very clear. For example, from the results, what is the target fairness state? Why would $P(Y=1|S=0)$ be different from $P(Y=1|S=1)$?
