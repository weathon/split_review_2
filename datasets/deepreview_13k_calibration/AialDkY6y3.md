## Abstract
Viewing Graph Neural Networks as network dynamical systems on graphs has proven a fruitful inspiration for designing interesting GNN architectures. This work introduces the Dirac-Bianconi Graph Neural Network (DBGNN) based on Bianconi's topological Dirac equation on graphs. While heat equations based on network Laplacian tend to smooth out differences, Dirac equations typically feature long-range propagation. We indeed find that the DBGNN layer does not lead to an equilibration, or smoothing, of nodal features, even after hundreds of steps. A further distinguishing feature of the topological Dirac equation is that it treats edges and nodes on the same footing. Consequently, we expect DBGNN to be useful in contexts where edges encode more than mere logical connectivity, but have physical properties as well. We show competitive performance for molecular property prediction and superior performance for predicting the dynamic stability of power grids. In the case of power grids, DBGNN achieves robust out-of-distribution generalization, showing that structural relations are learned.

### Summary
Deviating from the traditional Laplacian based GNNs, on this paper the authors propose Dirac-Bianconi Graph Neural Network (DBGNN) which are based on the topological Dirac equation on the graph. The major advantage of the proposed method is that it does not lead to over-smoothing of the node features when a large number of layers are stacked.


The paper is difficult to read at times. Especially for readers not having a background in topological data analysis. The paper is well motivated but lacks insights when using Dirac-Bianconi operators. Although Figure 5 demonstrate that the proposed method enabling heterogeneous representations even after 500 layers, giving more insights will help improving the paper.

### Strengths
1. The work is well motivated and the main advantage seems to avoid over-smoothing and also use input edge features in learning representations.

2. Figure 5 is a good demonstration of avoiding over-smoothing.

3. Slight performance improvement on power grid data.

### Weaknesses
1. In abstract, you mention "we expect DBGNN to be useful in contexts where edges encode more than mere logical connectivity, but have physical properties as well". Also the introduction motivates for the same. However, the datasets used in the evaluation do not consider any useful edge information. Including datasets with useful input edge features will enrich the paper. The current evaluation does not fully validate the claims made about the method's ability to leverage edge features. The experiments should include datasets where edge attributes are crucial for the task, such as weighted graphs representing physical connections or social networks with interaction strengths. This would provide a more compelling demonstration of the method's capabilities.

2. In Table 2, it is shown that only 1 layer of DBGNN suffices. This is deviating from the story that stacking more layers helps in complex (hard) datasets. This result undermines the motivation for using a deep architecture. The paper should provide a more thorough analysis of why a single layer is sufficient for the power grid dataset, and whether this is a general property of the proposed method or specific to the dataset. It would be beneficial to explore the receptive field of a single DBGNN layer and compare it to the effective receptive field of deeper GNNs on similar tasks.

3. The Dirichlet energy is constant over 500 steps in Figure 5? Why? Is it just for this experiment? It does not seem to change a t all.. The lack of change in Dirichlet energy over 500 steps is concerning and requires further explanation. It is unclear whether this is an artifact of the specific experiment or a fundamental property of the method. The paper should investigate the behavior of the Dirichlet energy under different conditions and provide a more detailed analysis of its convergence properties.

### Questions
1. Why do we need at least 13 layer GNNs for power grids? Is it true for all type of GNNs? Some powerful GNNs might need fewer than 13 layers.

2. Please clarify using the notation $e_{ij}$ = $ - e_{ji}$.

3. What is the performance of the proposed method on node classification tasks on citation networks such as Cora, Pubmed, etc?

4. The Dirichlet energy is constant over 500 steps in Figure 5? Why? Is it just for this experiment? It does not seem to change a t all..

### Summary
This paper proposes a new Graph Neural Network, the Dirac-Bianconi Graph Neural Network, derived from an Euler discretization of the generalized Dirac-Bianci equation on a network. While the graph Laplacian operator-based GNNs cause over-smoothing, the proposed method is designed to capture long-range interactions between nodes. This paper confirms that the proposed method does not cause over-smoothing evaluated using Dirichlet Energy. Also, this paper applies the proposed method to estimating power grid stability and predicting binding affinity and compares its prediction accuracy with existing methods.

### Strengths
* The proposed method improves the accuracy of power grid stability prediction compared to existing methods, especially for the out-of-distribution problem setting.
* Numerical results show that the over-smoothing evaluated using Dirichlet Energy can be alleviated for the model trained on real data.
* The paper is well-written, and the derivation of the proposed model is carefully described, making it accessible to readers unfamiliar with the Dirac-Bianconi operator.

### Weaknesses
 * If I understand correctly, the Dirac-Bianci operator is called the boundary and co-boundary operators in the simplicial complex theory on graphs. Existing studies propose GNNs that use or extend them (e.g., [1--4]. Also, [5] does not use (co-)boundary operators but extends GNNs on simplicial complexes.) Therefore, it is debatable whether the proposed method has (theoretical and experimental) novelty and significance in terms of using the Dirac-Bianci operator.
* This paper claimed that one of the advantages of the proposed method is that it solves over-smoothing. However, since there exist models that tackle over-smoothing, such as GCNII [6] and DRew [7], I have a question about whether the proposed method is superior to them. While the paper demonstrates improved performance on the power grid task, it is unclear if this is due to the specific architecture or simply the increased depth of the model. The comparison to state-of-the-art models specifically designed to address over-smoothing is missing, making it difficult to assess the true contribution of the proposed method in this regard.
* In the task of binding affinity prediction, this paper argues that the proposed method with ten steps is comparable with 3-layer GCN. However, the deeper the model is the greater the computational complexity and memory usage. Since existing models overcome the over-smoothing, as I mentioned above, more is needed for a deep model to be comparable in performance to a shallow GNN. The choice of a 3-layer GCN as a baseline seems insufficient to demonstrate the potential of the proposed method, especially given the claim of capturing long-range dependencies. The dataset used for binding affinity prediction might not be ideal for demonstrating the advantages of the proposed method, as it may not require long-range interactions.
* One of the advantages of the proposed method is that both node and edge features can be used equally. However, in the numerical experiments on real data, only node features are available to GNNs (in the binding affinity prediction task, edge features are used for graph construction but not as features). Therefore, it is unclear whether the proposed method can take advantage of this feature in real data.


### Questions
* How were the hyperparameters chosen? In particular, the numerical experiments use networks with 48 and 10 steps in total, respectively. However, it is yet to be known whether these hyperparameters are optimal. That is, a model with fewer steps might be sufficient. I suggest conducting ablation studies to see the sensitivity of performances to the number of steps.
* In Figure 5(a), the Dirichlet energy of untrained DBGNN is almost constant regardless of the number of steps. Is this expected from the theory?

### Summary
The paper introduces the Dirac-Bianconi Graph Neural Network (DBGNN) based on Bianconi's topological Dirac equation for graph-based network dynamics. DBGNN preserves long-range information propagation and treats edges and nodes equally. This approach is beneficial when edges convey physical properties. The paper demonstrates competitive performance in molecular property prediction and superior performance in predicting the dynamic stability of power grids. In the case of power grids, DBGNN exhibits robust out-of-distribution generalization, indicating learned structural relations.

### Strengths
The development of the Dirac-Bianconi Graph Neural Network (DBGNN) based on a modified generalized Dirac-Bianconi equation represents an innovative approach. The incorporation of learnable weights, nonlinearity, and multiple time steps for evolving features offers a unique solution to address long-range dependencies in graph neural networks. The integration of fundamental quantum equations into GNN research is relatively rare, demonstrating a level of innovation. The paper upholds a high standard of quality in its methodology, showcasing the effectiveness of the DBGNN architecture in challenging tasks, including power grid analysis and molecular property prediction. The model's performance underscores its robustness and practicality. The competitive performance and out-of-distribution generalization observed in power grid tasks, along with enhanced molecular property prediction, demonstrate the practical relevance of this work.

### Weaknesses
The theoretical part of this paper lacks an analysis of the time complexity of the Dirac-Bianconi Equation. The paper does not provide a detailed theoretical explanation of the integration of the Dirac-Bianconi equation with Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). It focuses on the properties of the Dirac-Bianconi equation itself, dedicating substantial space to this, but does not elaborate on the theoretical foundation for its fusion with GNNs. 
The paper applies the DBGNN model to two vastly different tasks, power grid analysis and molecular property prediction, without tailoring the model for the specifics of each task. This lack of task-specific optimization could limit the model's performance and applicability. The experimental setup in section 4.1.2 appears to have some shortcomings in terms of training parameters and code implementation. This raises concerns about the reproducibility and robustness of the experiments, which are essential in scientific research.
The paper's comparison with other models, particularly using only GCN with three layers, is not comprehensive and may not represent a fair benchmark. Comparing models with varying numbers of layers and different architectural complexities would provide a more meaningful evaluation. Lack of clear improvement in accuracy with the use of the Dirac-Bianconi equation within GNNs could be seen as a weakness in the paper's claims regarding its advantages.

### Questions
Can a more detailed theoretical explanation be provided regarding why the Dirac-Bianconi equation was chosen for integration with GNNs and how they are combined to enhance graph representation capabilities?
Given the vastly different nature of power grid analysis and molecular property prediction, is there a plan to introduce task-specific optimizations within the model to leverage the unique characteristics of each task?
Could more detailed experimental settings and parameter choices be provided to ensure experiment reproducibility while also considering the robustness of the model?

### Summary
Summary:
The paper presents a new graph neural network layer called the Dirac-Bianconi Graph Neural Network (DBGNN). The layer is inspired by the topological Dirac equation on graphs proposed by Bianconi (2021). In DBGNN, the edges and nodes are treated on an equal footing, with features attached to both and the Dirac operator mixes edge and node features. Additionally, DBGNN avoids over-smoothing problem that affects traditional GNNs like GCNs. 

The DBGNN layer implements a discretized, generalized version of the Dirac-Bianconi equation. Multiple DBGNN layers with shared weights are stacked to enable propagation across longer distances in the graph.

The DBGNN is evaluated on two tasks: i) Predicting power grid stability. (ii) Predicting protein-ligand binding affinity 
In (i) it outperforms previous approaches, especially for out-of-distribution generalization. While in (ii), DBGNN achieves par with deeper GCNs.

In summary, this work presents a new GNN layer that can be helpful for long range tasks in graphs with some demonstration shown in the paper.

### Strengths
Strengths:  
(i) well motivated combination of ideas from physics and GNNs. The Dirac equation is a natural model for directional propagation on graphs.  
(ii) good empirical results on two relevant graph tasks. Outperforms prior models on power grids.   
(iii) experiments analyzing model dynamics and over-smoothing.

### Weaknesses
Weaknesses and questions:  
i) Limited ablation studies. It can be made further clear for how much performance gain comes from Dirac structure vs other enhancements.  
ii) the paper does not exploit edge features on binding affinity task. It may be unsure if Dirac structure helps here.  
iii) although one of the experimental task is related to long range dependency, it is not sure for the second task. A robust study on some long range dataset benchmark would be required to verify holistically the claims of the model on long range tasks as is mentioned in multiple instances in the paper. The paper would be strengthened by a more in-depth analysis of what long-range effects the model is capturing in this domain.  
iv) For binding affinity task, did you try using edge features? Does the Dirac structure help in that case?

### Summary
Edit: I have increased my score in light of your responses.

It is has been noted that the message passing operations in standard GNNS are essentially equivalent to heat propagation over the network. This can lead to desirable smoothing on relatively shallow networks. However, letting heat propagation proceed for too long leads to oversmoothing and loss of information. Therefore, the authors instead proposed an alternative approach based on the Dirac-Biaconi equation.

The authors cite as an example GNNs aiming to predict the stability of power grids. In this setting 13 layers are needed. It is also to treat nodes and edges as equally important.

The author utilized the Dirac-Bianconi operator which was previously introduced (in the graph setting) by Bianconi in 2021. They derive message passing type operators which pass information from edges to nodes and vice versa. From there they derive graph dynamics and a layerwise update rule which discretizes the time domain and adds in learnable weight matrices.

Network architecture consists of linear layer, then use DB layers with skip connections followed by a final MLP. They demonstrate good results compared to a couple of baselines in limited experiments.

### Strengths
Going beyond the vanilla MPNN approach and avoiding related oversmoothing problems is important and the authors provide an interesting setting, optimizing power grids, for needing to go deeper than standard DNNs. The approach is both well motivated from physics and novel in the context of GNNs.

The paper is generally well-written and well-explained.

### Weaknesses
The alternating procedure of DB and linear layers could be more clearly explained. What does a linear layer mean in this context and why are they needed? Specifically, it is unclear how the linear layers interact with the output of the DB layers. Are they simply projecting the output of the DB layers to a different dimension, or are they performing some other operation? The motivation for this particular architecture is not entirely clear.

Neither of the datasets considered include non-trivial edge features. Perhaps you could have flux along an edge in a powergrid or something? It is not clear how the method would handle more complex edge attributes, and this limits the scope of the experiments.

Not clear how the baseline methods where chosen? Are these also methods meant to address oversmoothing and long range dependencies? Are they at or near s-o-t-a? It would be helpful to know the specific criteria for selecting the baselines, and whether they are directly comparable to the proposed method in terms of their ability to handle long-range dependencies.

x' and e'_{i,j} are not defined in equations 6 and 7. I am assuming they mean the output of delta_{DB}(x, e), but this should be made more clear. The lack of explicit definitions makes it difficult to follow the derivation.

The setup assumes a symmetry on the edge features e_{j,i} = e_{i,j}. This is a strong assumption that may not hold in many real-world scenarios, and the paper does not discuss the implications of this assumption.

The leap from 8 to 9 should be made more clear. This appears to solving \partial_t - \partial_{DB} \pm \beta =0, or something but this should be made explicit. The connection between the continuous-time dynamics and the discrete update rule is not sufficiently explained.

Table 2 is interesting, that one DBGNN layer = 3 GCN layers, but it would be more convincing if you also showed results with DBGNN outpeforming GCN in addition to other baselines. It is not clear if the DBGNN layer is actually more effective than a comparable number of GCN layers, or if the performance gain is simply due to the increased number of parameters.

### Questions
Is there any connection by the DB equation and the wave equation?

Is there any way to use the DB operator to define Riesz transforms ($\partial_{x_i}\Delta^{-1/2}$ in the Euclidean setting)?

Where does the network include non-linearitiees? Why do these not induce loss of energy? 

What is the computational complexity of DBGNN vs other methods?

Paper could be improved via more thorough experimentation and also analysis of / references too the theoretical properties of the DB operator.
