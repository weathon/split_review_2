## Abstract
Generative models of language exhibit impressive capabilities but still place non-negligible probability mass over undesirable outputs. In this work, we address the task of updating a model to avoid unwanted outputs while minimally changing model behavior otherwise, a challenge we refer to as a minimal targeted update. We first formalize the notion of a minimal targeted update and propose a method to achieve such updates using negative examples from a model's generations. Our proposed Targeted Negative Training (TNT) results in updates that keep the new distribution close to the original, unlike existing losses for negative signal which push down probability but do not control what the updated distribution will be. In experiments, we demonstrate that TNT yields a better trade-off between reducing unwanted behavior and maintaining model generation behavior than baselines, paving the way towards a modeling paradigm based on iterative training updates that constrain models from generating undesirable outputs while preserving their impressive capabilities.

### Summary
1. The paper tackles the problem of modifying the generative distribution of LLMs to reduce the likelihood of generating undesirable tokens whilst simultaneously not deviating too much from the original distribution.
2. Concretely, the authors present their approach (dubbed Targeted Negative Training, or TNT), wherein for each prefix and continuation from an already trained model, if the target token is annotated to be undesirable then the approach minimizes a divergence between the original distribution from the already trained model and a modified distribution based on setting the logit of the undesirable token to 0 and renormalizing for the target model. Otherwise the objective minimizes a divergence between the original and the learned model distribution.
3. The authors explore different instantiations of divergences: (forward KL, forward KL), (reverse KL, reverse KL) and (reverse KL, forward KL) for the (negative token signal, positive token signal), which they dub (D_{n}, D_{p}) respectively. In addition to that, they also explore with (forward KL, maximum likelihood) and (reverse KL, maximum likelihood) for (D_{n}, D_{p}).
4. The results presented show that the proposed method allows for better tradeoffs between controlling for hallucinations and keeping the model close to the original distribution.

### Strengths
1. The proposed method for leveraging sentence level annotations in order to modify model behaviour is quite interesting. 
2. I quite like the extensiveness of explorations in terms of exploring the different divergences for both the positive and negative signals. From the results, both TNFF and TNRF seem to achieve a pretty good tradeoff between being faithful to the original distribution and controlling for hallucinations.

### Weaknesses
1. For the different proposed models, without an equivalent table similar to Table 1, it is hard to understand the effectiveness of the approach. Concretely, similar to the TNFLL and TNRLL rows, it would also be good to have an equivalent row for TNFF, TNRR and TNRF.
2. From Table 1, for both the TNFLL and TNRLL approaches, the performance is considerably worse compared to the baseline method. For TNFLL, it the hallucination rate is substantially higher, while for TNRLL, the BLEU score is much lower. Given this observation, I am hesitant to believe that the proposed approach is actually substantially than the baseline approach.
3. In my opinion, intuitively, because this approach minimizes the KL at a prefix level, especially considering the fact that the annotations obtained are from a noisy source, it is possible that this approach would steer the model towards not predicting certain words in certain contexts. Concretely, (based from the example in Figure 5), for the sentence "In some regions of the country, the sex ratio is still quite concerning", because the annotations are noisy, the word "sex" would be (incorrectly) marked as offensive. Consequently, because of the proposed objective, the model might not be able to produce the token "sex" for a similar prefix as "In some regions of the country, the", even if it did make sense in the context. I think this is a reasonably big limitation of the approach, and it would have been nice to have some discussion on this in the paper.

### Questions
1. Would it be possible to rows for TNFF, TNRR and TNRF in Table 1 ?
2. Would it be possible to provide some clarification on how Figure 2 was constructed ? Specifically, is the level of hallucination mapped to a different value of \alpha used (so higher \alpha -> lower hallucination rates and original distribution fidelity) ?

### Summary
This work provides a fine-tuning-based algorithm to update a language model to suppress harmful content generation while remaining as close to the original model as possible. Given a set of harmful responses to avoid (defined by a function that takes in a string and produces binary output), the authors define the ideal target model as one that matches the original model conditioned on never producing an undesirable string. The authors optimize a loss function based on this definition and find that the resulting model better satisfies the desired notion of safety.

### Strengths
1. The paper's key problem is relevant to practice and is well-specified 

2. The paper's solution is similarly elegant and was a natural consequence of the problem specification, providing a tractable solution to the proposed problem. 

3. The results demonstrate a solid improvement over reasonable baselines to provide targeted updates to the model.

### Weaknesses
1. The authors are missing connections to existing methods. For example, [Korbak et al, 2022](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.11275) (among others) show that PPO would converge to the same closed-form presented in Eq. 2 when using the positivity/negativity classification as a reward function; this method would also avoid the drawbacks mentioned in the related work for inference time procedures.

2. The paper demonstrates their technique on some relatively easier benchmarks, and it would be much more interesting to try more complicated schemes. There are three ways in which I find them weak
    - In the specific case where p_neg is defined as the presence of a bad token in the string, there is no need to do any training, and by simply ignoring bad tokens at decoding, one recovers the true optimal solution for both greedy and temperature decoding with zero overhead. Both the toxicity and hallucinations benchmarks provided in this text are dangerously close to "reject any sentence with a bad (word/entity)", which makes the application rather uninteresting. It would be cooler to see benchmarks where the reward model may still be automated but captures some global property of the sentence that requires a learning-based technique such as yours to solve.
    - For the toxicity benchmark, the authors mention that 1.6% of the time, the completion is toxic. I believe a very natural baseline to this problem is performing temperature 1 decoding and regenerating anytime the output is toxic. I get the sense this will very rarely require few regenerations for this specific benchmark, making the learning rather excessive. Having a benchmark that requires a larger change will be a true test of this problem.
   - For baselines, as mentioned in Weakness 1, I believe PPO is a more natural baseline for learning from a reward model

### Questions
1. At the top of page 7, the paper mentions that all experiments were done with greedy decoding. Does that mean fine-tuning was also based on greedy generations? If only 1.6% of model generations were toxic, would the model get any gradient signal for 98.4% of the generations?

2. Why is TNRLL not called TNFR?

3. Just to be clear, does "token level annotations" refer to a function that can take a sentence and assess whether it is negative or positive? This was not super clear to me, even though there were a few sentences dedicated to it on page 4. If it is a function, it might be better specified as such.

### Summary
Summary:

The paper introduces Targeted Negative Training (TNT), a method for minimally updating language models to prevent unwanted outputs. Unlike previous techniques, TNT fine-tunes models using negative examples generated by the model itself, with the goal of closely aligning the updated model's distribution to the original while avoiding specific undesired behaviors. The method operates by minimizing reverse KL-divergence, ensuring the updated model does not deviate significantly from its initial training. Experiments demonstrate that TNT effectively maintains original model performance better than other negative training approaches while reducing unwanted behaviors. However, it requires access to the original model and detailed token-level annotations, presenting potential practical challenges. TNT's iterative nature also suggests it could be used to enhance model safety over time through continuous refinement.

### Strengths
Advantages:
 - Iterative Model Updates: TNT allows for iterative updates to language models without needing all negative tokens to be specified upfront. This flexibility is advantageous for practical applications where updates may be continuous and ongoing.

 - Maintained Model Performance: The experimental setup indicates that TNT can effectively maintain the original model's performance better than baseline methods while also reducing unwanted behaviors.

 - Reproducibility and Accessibility: The experiments are reproducible, with the promise of making the code public and using publicly available datasets, which enhances the credibility and utility of the research.

### Weaknesses
 Disadvantages:
 - Limited Novelty: The core ideas and methods of TNT may not be as novel as claimed, given the prior existence of the NADO algorithm [NeurIPS 2022, https://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.14219.pdf] framework which appears to address similar goals using related techniques. Further more, NADO has proven its objective to be the **theoretically closed form solution** of the shared targets of TNT/NADO, which weakens the value of the approximated solution (step-level branch-cutting) given by TNT. TNT's flexibility is also less than that of NADO as it requires auxiliary negative annotation, which is a closer setup to that of the FUDGE algorithm [NAACL 2021, https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.05218].

 - Oversight in Literature Review: Even if TNT can differ itself from NADO and FUDGE (since the two previous methods study different tasks, yet essentially with similar mathematical setup), the absence of a citation and/or discussion of these existing works suggests a possible gap in the literature review process, which might question the thoroughness of the background research conducted for the paper.

### Questions
What is the essential different between TNT and previous constrained decoding algorithms (FUDGE, NADO, Neural Logic, etc.) that aim to maximize/minimize a given (emplicitly through a symbolic process or implicitly through negative samples) sequence boolean function that defines the negativity of samples?

### Summary
This work tackles the problem of updating a language model to reduce undesirable behavior (e.g. generating offensive content or hallucinations), while minimally changing generations elsewhere. The authors propose a method, TNT (Targeted Negative Training) which aims to keep the probability distribution of text close to the original except for instances which are intended to be removed. The paper presents some experiments with a T5 model on reducing hallucinations in summarization and in avoiding toxic responses.

### Strengths
1. The topic studied by this work is timely, and progress in this direction would be of interest to many in the community.
2. The proposed method is novel and a significant contribution to the literature

### Weaknesses
1. The experiments could be greatly strengthened. The authors study a single model T5, at a fairly small scale (220M) parameters. No purely autoregressive model is studied. Only two tasks are examined. This lack of breadth makes it hard for readers to access the generality of the claims in the paper. I believe this paper would benefit greatly from more experiments and ablations.
2. There are very few comparisons to previous work, which in many cases tackle the same tasks presented in the experiments. As an example, avoiding toxic generations has been studied by [1,2]

I have no questions.
