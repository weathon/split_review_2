## Abstract
Sparse mixture of expert architectures (MoEs) scale model capacity without significant increases in training or inference costs.
Despite their success, MoEs suffer from a number of issues: training instability, token dropping, inability to scale the number of experts, or ineffective finetuning.
In this work, we propose \name, a \emph{fully-differentiable} sparse Transformer that addresses these challenges, while maintaining the benefits of MoEs.
\name performs an implicit soft assignment by passing different weighted combinations of all input tokens to each expert.
As in other MoEs, experts in \name only process a subset of the (combined) tokens, enabling larger model capacity (and performance) at lower inference cost.
In the context of visual recognition, \name greatly outperforms dense Transformers (ViTs) and popular MoEs (Tokens Choice and Experts Choice).
Furthermore, \name scales well: \name Huge/14 with 128 experts in 16 MoE layers has over $40\times$ more parameters than ViT Huge/14, with only 2\% increased inference time, and substantially better quality.

### Summary
The following paper proposes Soft Mixture-of-Experts (MoE), a fully-differentiable sparse transformers capable of passing different weighted combinations of all input tokens to each expert. Compared to other MoEs, experts in Soft MoE only process a subset of (combined) tokens, resulting in larger model capacity (and performance) with lower inference cost. Thanks to this, Soft MoE are able to alleviate training instability, token dropping, scalability issues, and ineffective finetuning process that is apparent in previous type of MoE. Experiments on visual recognition tasks in Section 3 and 4 show the superiority of Soft MoE over dense Vision Transformers (ViT) and popular MoEs not limited to Tokens Choice and Experts Choice. In addition to that, Soft MoE provably scales well; since while the Huge/14 version of it has $40\times$ more parameters than ViT Huge/14, it bring substantial improvement in terms of classification accuracy with only 2% gain in inference.

### Strengths
- Paper is well-written, easy to understand, and provided with source codes that model how Soft MoE is being implemented.
- Experiments are comprehensive and detailed with respect to its domain, with emphasis not only on performance, but also in terms of inference and wall-clock time.
- High potential to bring improvement when it is deployed towards various modalities such as Large-Language Models (LLMs).

### Weaknesses
Aside from the weaknesses mentioned in the paper, I would like to address concerns that is apparent in the paper:
- The experiments performed in Sections 3 and 4 seem to focus only on vision-related tasks. It would be great to be able to observe results on different modalities such as NLP-related tasks based on GLUE or SuperGLUE benchmark that is performed in [1]. 
- Unfortunately, the dataset that is being used for training is not publicly available; making it hard to be used for benchmarking with other papers.
- As mentioned in Section 6, the memory footprint will be huge when we leverage a large number of experts, and usage in auto-regressive decoders is problematic due to the preservation of past and future tokens during training.

### Questions
- Is it possible to see the result of MoE in GLUE or SuperGLUE benchmark as seen on [1]?

### Summary
This paper introduces a novel soft MOE method that keeps the benefits of sparse MOE (processing a subset of tokens for lower cost), and also has full differentiability and better performance. The proposed method let the MOE experts to process a number of slots, where each slot is a combination of all tokens. The idea of processing a number of slots is how the inference cost is controlled. It outperforms dense (non MOE) networks and also typical sparse MOE networks: with similar inference cost, the accuracy metric is much better.

### Strengths
Originality
The idea of this soft MOE is new. I have not encountered previous work that uses this idea. It combines the idea of sparse MOE with an attention-like mechanism to get the benefits of both. The major part that I like is that this combination is very practical in large scale model that requires model parallelism. The author also clearly contrasted its difference with other existing works and multi-head attention in Section 5. 

Quality
The quality of the paper is high. 
-	The author provides very good details of how the method is implemented and some details of implementation.
-	The experiments settings are clearly stated and the hyper-parameter searching is transparent and properly done for contrast models (dense models and other MOE models) as well.
-	The design choices (slots per token and expert numbers) are well studied and concluded.
-	The experiments conducted are at large scale datasets and on various tasks/settings, and the improvement of the proposed methods are convincingly large.

Clarity
The clarity of the paper is good. The demonstration of the method and experiment conclusions are clear and well supported by experiments.

Significance
This is very exciting work that can impact the community greatly. The proposed method shows convincing performance dominancy over other MOE methods or dense models on image classification task and contrastive learning tasks. It shows that with similar inference cost, it can achieve much better accuracy metric, even against strong baselines. It is also very practical that it can be used in modern large scale parallel learning platforms without too much extra optimization needed.

### Weaknesses
as mentioned already by the author, the main weakness of this method from my perspective is: each expert do not handle multiple tokens well (i.e. one expert one token is better). In practice, this may cause inefficient increase of number of parameters (memory). But the authors have already recognized it, and I think it doesn't hurt the significance of the existing contribution of this paper.

### Questions
I hope the authors can release as much details as possible of the implementation details. Looking forward to the adaptation into different fields.

### Summary
Instead of sending each expert a bag of vectors from the input the vectors entering each expert are composed of a weighted sum of all input vectors. My understanding of the implementation was assisted by [Phil Wang's replication][lucidrains] in PyTorch, which I have shortened below:

```
def forward(self, x):
        """
        einstein notation
        b - batch
        n - sequence length
        e - number of experts
        s - number of slots per expert
        d - feature dimension
        """
        slot_embeds = self.slot_embeds

        logits = einsum('b n d, e s d -> b n e s', x, slot_embeds)

        # get dispatch and combine weights (softmax across right dimensions)

        dispatch_weights = logits.softmax(dim = 1)

        combine_weights = rearrange(logits, 'b n e s -> b n (e s)')
        combine_weights = combine_weights.softmax(dim = -1)

        # derive slots by weighted average of input tokens using the dispatch weights from above

        slots = einsum('b n d, b n e s -> b e s d', x, dispatch_weights)

        # route the slots per expert to each expert

        out = self.experts(slots) # vectors are mapped across dim e to each expert

        # combine back out

        out = rearrange(out, ' b e s d -> b (e s) d')
        out = einsum('b s d, b n s -> b n d', out, combine_weights)
```

The contributions of this paper are mainly the experimental results, the experiments aim to demonstrate that a soft-MoE layer allows faster inference and shorter training time on some large scale training benchmarks. Specifically:

- Soft MoE L/16 vs ViT H/14:
    - Half the training time
    - 2x faster inference
- Soft MoE B/16 vs ViT/14:
    - 5.7x faster at inference time

These results are demonstrated comprehensively with ablation experiments investigating the different assumptions, such as whether the weighted sum is necessary, whether the weighted sum can be uniform and whether the weighted sum at the output is necessary; finding that the decisions all improve performance.

The results are demonstrated on expensive large scale benchmarks, including training many ViT style models on JFT-4B and further experiments testing these models on a contrastive benchmark using WebLI. The results presented support the contributions of the paper, demonstrating improved performance across the experiments compared to other MoE methods.

The authors also note that the proposed method would violate the causal assumption if used in an autoregressive model, meaning it can't be used as defined above for autoregressive language modelling.

### Strengths
The paper makes a clear contribution of an architectural improvement that requires extensive experimental justification to prove. It then provides the experimental results to back up this assertion on expensive benchmarks. The results are presented clearly and it is easy for the reader to find relevant information.

### Weaknesses
Minor presentation issue:

- Figure 2 is confusing, the relationship between dispatch and combine weights to the tokens is illustrated with two downward arrows, but they don't really mean anything so it doesn't help the reader
- Better signposting about all the different results that may be found in the experiments section as it is the most valuable part of the paper. For example, in the introduction some of the inference time and training time benefits are mentioned but not where these results are found.

It would be useful to see the complexity results described in Section 2.3 verified by experiment, perhaps looking at throughput in practice. I think Figure 6 implies something to do with this but the relationship is not entirely obvious.

### Questions
The authors mention that autoregessive modelling is an area for future work, but it's not totally clear to me how to achieve that with this type of model. The Token mixing weights would need to have a causal mask similar to the attention causal mask, but that seems like it might affect performance or throughput. Do they have any ideas how to approach this issue?

### Summary
This work focuses on a number of issues in vanilla Sparse MoEs, and proposes Soft MoE. Instead of hard assignment of tokens, Soft MoE “softs” the tokens by weighted averaging them before assigned to experts. Experiments with ViT models and CV tasks demonstrate that Soft MoE outperforms both Sparse MoEs and dense models.

### Strengths
This work is novel and sound. The soft assignment by learnable weighted combinations helps tackle many limitations of vanilla Sparse MoEs. Extensive empirical results show that Soft MoE outperforms vanilla Sparse MoEs and dense models in terms of model ability (precisions/accuracies/...) and improves the training and inference speed/throughput compared with dense models.

### Weaknesses
The proposed technique cannot be integrated with main-stream foundation models (e.g., auto-regressive LLMs), which may limit the applications.

### Questions
When assessing the training and inference speed, the authors chose dense ViT as the baseline. I would be better to include the results for Sparse MoEs additionally.

The experiments focus on CV tasks (in particular, ViT-based MoEs). It makes me wonder how Soft MoE would be on NLP tasks. Although in Section 6 the authors have discussed that Soft MoE is difficult to use in auto-regressive models, attempts on BERT- or T5-based MoEs should be suggested.
