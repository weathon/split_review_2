## Abstract
Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection aims to detect testing samples far away from the in-distribution (ID) training data, which is crucial for the safe deployment of machine learning models in the real world. Distance-based OOD detection methods have emerged with enhanced deep representation learning. They identify unseen OOD samples by measuring their distances from ID class centroids or prototypes. However, existing approaches learn the representation relying on oversimplified data assumptions, \eg, modeling ID data of each class with one centroid class prototype or using loss functions not designed for OOD detection, which overlook the natural diversities within the data. Naively enforcing data samples of each class to be compact around only one prototype leads to inadequate modeling of realistic data and limited performance. To tackle these issues, we propose \textbf{P}rototypic\textbf{A}l \textbf{L}earning with a \textbf{M}ixture of prototypes (PALM) which models each class with multiple prototypes to capture the sample diversities, and learns more faithful and compact samples embeddings to enhance OOD detection. Our method automatically identifies and dynamically updates prototypes, assigning each sample to a subset of prototypes via reciprocal neighbor soft assignment weights. To learn embeddings with multiple prototypes, PALM optimizes a maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) loss to encourage the sample embeddings to be compact around the associated prototypes, as well as a contrastive loss on all prototypes to enhance intra-class compactness and inter-class discrimination at the prototype level. Compared to previous methods with prototypes, the proposed mixture prototype modeling of PALM promotes the representations of each ID class to be more compact and separable from others and the unseen OOD samples, resulting in more reliable OOD detection. Moreover, the automatic estimation of prototypes enables our approach to be extended to the challenging OOD detection task with unlabelled ID data. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of PALM over previous methods, achieving state-of-the-art average AUROC performance of 93.82 on the challenging CIFAR-100 benchmark.

### Confidence
3: You are fairly confident in your assessment. It is possible that you did not understand some parts of the submission or that you are unfamiliar with some pieces of related work. Math/other details were not carefully checked.

### Summary
This paper presents an outlier detection model, which assumes each class has multiple centroids in feature space, instead of one centroid that many existing models assume. A model called PALM is proposed that minimizes the MLE loss and prototype contrastive loss. The prototype centroid is updated during the model training. Experiment results demonstrate that the proposed model outperforms baselines in OOD and unsupervised OOD tasks.

### Strengths
Overall, the novelty of this work is clearly presented, understandable and consistent with the intuition. Experiment comparison is comprehensive.

### Weaknesses
There have been some OOD detection benchmark datasets, such as Openood: Benchmarking generalized out-of-distribution detection. Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems 2022, 35, 32598-32611. Most of the datasets used in experiments are based on standard benchmark datasets. How are these datasets, such as CIFAR are used for OOD in this work?

One of the reasons that the proposed model outperforms the compared baselines is it better estimates the class or sample distribution due to the multi-centroid assumption. How about the comparison with generative based models, such as GAN based model?

### Summary
The paper introduces the PrototypicAl Learning with a Mixture of prototypes (PALM) for Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection in machine learning. Unlike traditional methods that oversimplify data assumptions, PALM models multiple prototypes per class for accurate representations. Experimental results highlight PALM's effectiveness, especially on the CIFAR-100 benchmark.

### Strengths
-The paper provides extensive experimental settings, particularly in the ablation studies.
-The proposed method introduces an automatic prototype learning framework that incorporates a mixture of prototypes to represent hyperspherical embeddings, effectively capturing the natural diversities within each class.
-The proposed method achieves a significantly improved performance.

### Weaknesses
 -I have some concerns about scalability. The introduction of multiple prototypes and their dynamic updating could lead to scalability issues, especially when handling very large datasets or a vast number of classes. Specifically, the computational overhead of calculating soft assignment weights using the Sinkhorn-Knopp algorithm for each batch, while efficient, could still become a bottleneck with increasing data and prototype counts. The memory footprint of storing and updating multiple prototypes per class, although seemingly small, could also become significant for extremely large-scale problems.
-The effectiveness of PALM is highly dependent on the quality of the prototypes. If the prototypes do not accurately represent the underlying data distribution, the model may face challenges in OOD detection. The method's reliance on EMA for prototype updating and assignment pruning, while beneficial, might not be sufficient to guarantee high-quality prototypes in all scenarios, especially with complex or multimodal class distributions. The initialization of prototypes could also have a significant impact, and the paper does not fully explore the sensitivity to different initialization strategies.
-In terms of computational cost, PALM might demand additional computational resources. While the paper claims the overhead is minimal, the multiple prototype calculations and the Sinkhorn-Knopp algorithm could still lead to increased training time and resource consumption compared to simpler single-prototype methods, particularly when considering the need for hyperparameter tuning for the prototype learning process.

### Questions
The experimental results from tables 1, 2, and 3 all indicate that PALM does not achieve optimal performance on the texture dataset as it does in other tasks. I am quite curious as to why this phenomenon occurs.

### Summary
This paper proposes PALM (PrototypicAl Learning with a Mixture of Gaussian) to address the out-of-distribution detection problem via a distance-based method underlied by a mixture of prototypes. This work is a direct extension of the compactness and dispersion regularized loss (CIDER) by Ming et al. to a probabilistic setting. Although CIDER, and other distance-based OOD detection methods have shown strong results against OOD benchmarks, they indeed tend to make stringent assumptions in their formulation . For instance, CIDER models all samples of each class with only one single prototype, and requires data samples of each class to be compact around a single prototype. These oversimplifying assumptions make the methods quite limiting. This paper addresses some of those limitations to formulate and shape the embedding space.

### Strengths
This paper is well-written and mathematically sound. The method PALM that is proposed nicely extends an already strong OOD detection method called CIDER. PALM is extensively analyzed via a thorough ablation study, and extensively evaluated against multiple OOD benchmark datasets and methods. PALM boats strong ID-OOD discrimination in almost all of the experiments by outperforming previous supervised and unsupervised methods by a large margin.

### Weaknesses
1. PALM, like its predecessor CIDER, heavily relies on the hyperspherical representation of the learned embeddings to formulate and shape the embedding space. In CIDER, this representation was crucial in achieving strong ID-OOD separability and ID classification. However, since PALM is a mixture of Gaussian, that assumption that the embeddings need to be normalized to unit-norm or need to lie in a hyper spherical space may not necessarily be needed. I wonder if this assumption could be lifted so as to make PALM more general.

2. The second limitation pertains to how the prototypes are updated. While in small data regimes, one can expect the observations to behave similarly in nature, (i.e.; samples of the same class appear somewhat similar throughout the training process), in large data regimes, it's very likely to have samples of the same class behaving differently. In other words, even within the ID distribution, there could be outliers that could affect the ID classification. As a result, maintaining one value of $\alpha$ throughout the training process for the prototypes update seem quite limited to me. One suggestion to the authors is to make $\alpha$ adaptive by integrating its learning as part of the whole training process.

3. It is unclear from the manuscript how the mixture proportions $\omega_{i, k}$ are learned. As the authors may know, GMMs are very sensitive to the initialization of the mixture proportions. A suboptimal initialization may lead to the model getting stuck in a local minimum.

4. It has sounded quite unintuitive to me why the likelihood of a sample would be expressed as a mixture of prototypes given the strong ID separability flavor the authors would want to endow to their ID detection method. This concern is somewhat assuaged by the assignment pruning, but I think more justification is needed as to why one would want to enforce separability and yet mix the prototypes.

5. By having K dedicated prototypes for each class, PALM significantly increases the memory footprint unlike its predecessor CIDER and other distance-based OOD detection methods. This needs to be addressed in the manuscript.

### Questions
It'd be great if the authors could address the limitations that I raised above.

### Weaknesses
Major Points:

1.  **Hyperparameter Settings:** While it's commendable that ablation studies were performed for the introduced hyperparameters like $K$ (number of prototypes) and $\alpha$ (momentum), how do we choose these hyperparameters for different models or datasets? Is there a potential performance dip with varying settings? Specifically, the paper lacks a clear methodology for selecting these parameters beyond the ablation studies performed on a single dataset (CIFAR-100). The impact of these hyperparameters on the learned embedding space and subsequent OOD detection performance across diverse datasets remains unclear. A more detailed analysis of how these parameters interact with dataset characteristics is needed.

2.  **ID Accuracy Impact:** What's the influence of PALM on ID classification accuracy? It is crucial to understand if the improvements in OOD detection come at the cost of in-distribution classification performance. The paper should provide a thorough analysis of this trade-off, if any, and compare it to existing methods.

3.  **Intra-class Heterogeneity:** Fig. 5(c) shows varying prototype effects across datasets. Is this due to different levels of intra-class variability? Do authors have any insights or experiments on why this happens? The paper needs to delve deeper into the reasons behind these variations. It is not clear if the prototypes are truly capturing intra-class diversity or if the observed variations are due to other factors such as the inherent difficulty of OOD detection for different datasets or the similarity between ID and OOD data.

4.  **Technical Contribution:** The paper's core idea, i.e., prototypical learning with a mixture of prototypes, seems like a straightforward and easy extension of CIDER. I acknowledge the improvements shown in experiments and welcome further discussion on this. The paper needs to provide a more compelling argument for the novelty of the approach beyond simply adding multiple prototypes. The technical challenges and insights that led to this approach are not sufficiently highlighted.

Minor Points:

1. Figure 5 is presented before Figure 4.

2. Figures 4 & 6 are too small to recognize when printed. Consider resizing for clarity.
