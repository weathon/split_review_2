## Abstract
The dynamic nature of proteins is crucial for determining their biological functions and properties, for which Monte Carlo (MC) and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations stand as predominant tools to study such phenomena. % background
By utilizing empirically derived force fields, MC or MD simulations explore the conformational space through numerically evolving the system via Markov chain or Newtonian mechanics. 
However, the high-energy barrier of the force fields can hamper the exploration of both methods by the rare event, resulting in inadequately sampled ensemble without exhaustive running.
Existing learning-based approaches perform direct sampling yet heavily rely on target-specific simulation data for training, which suffers from high data acquisition cost and poor generalizability. % previous
Inspired by simulated annealing, we propose \method, a novel structure-to-structure translation framework capable of zero-shot conformation sampling with roto-translation equivariant property.
Our method leverages an amortized denoising score matching objective trained on general crystal structures and has no reliance on simulation data during both training and inference.
Experimental results across several benchmarking protein systems demonstrate that {\method} outperforms previous state-of-the-art generative structure prediction models and can be orders of magnitude faster compared to long MD simulations.

### Summary
This paper introduces a technique for sampling equilibrium distributions of proteins, eliminating the dependency on costly Molecular Dynamic simulations. The suggested technique utilizes the ESMFold protein embeddings and trains an equivariant denoising diffusion model using samples from the Protein Data Bank, predominantly featuring single folded states (i.e., absolute minima of the equilibrium distribution). During the testing phase, the model diffuses to a specified noise level, partially erasing the protein structure but not entirely, and then it denoises it again, resulting in a different protein conformation. This translation from one structure to another is employed to sample different conformations, starting from the folded structure. The method's effectiveness is assessed using various metrics such as validity (defined as the non-clash) fidelity (defined as the JS between reference and samples TICA distributions) and Diversity. The method seems to outperform previous works.

### Strengths
- The motivation and goals of this work are very relevant. Being able to sample protein equilibrium distributions without need of computing expensive molecular dynamics can have a high impact in the sampling community.
- The metrics used in the paper to assess the quality of the equilibrium distributions show the proposed method outperforms previous works.
- The paper contains many metrics assessing different aspects of the generated distributions.

### Weaknesses
1)
A more thorough review of prior studies could be beneficial. For instance, EigenFold (Jin et al, 2023) is a diffusion model trained solely on PDB samples with the same aim to generalize to protein distributions. It would be highly useful for readers to have a more detailed comparison between the proposed method and EigenFold, specially considering the apparent superior performance of the proposed method.

1.1 What is novel in the proposed method w.r.t. EigenFold?
1.2 Is the performance gap between EigenFold and the proposed method attributed to a difference in the conceptual approach or is it due to a more technical element such as the use of ESMFold in place of OmegaFold embeddings?

I think answering these questions can really benefit future works when trying to spot the key aspects of the model without need to dig into the codebase.



2) 
The validity metrics analyze the non-clash ratio, but it would also be as relevant to examine the distributions of bonds and ensure no bonds are breaking when categorizing a sample as valid. Have the authors conducted this analysis?

### Questions
1)
The core part of the proposal of this method is described in 3.2 (forward-backward Dynamcis) where I think a more elaborate explanation could be done here.

For example, when sampling a conformation T ~ p(T | x_0), is x_0 consistently the initiating folded structure, or could it be a T derived from a preceding sampling step?  This is not clear to me from the text. I imagine that if setting it always to the folded structure it would bias the distribution to the minima. Could the authors provide a more precise description of this in the method section?

2)
In section 3.1, could the authors provide more details, or cite relevant literature, explaining how the side chain atoms are derived from the backbone atoms?

3)
In the following sentence "Empirically, increasing T_delta leads to enhanced diversity yet it may hurt exploitation by demanding more reverse steps".

Is this true for any T_delta value? I would suspect that if T_delta goes to a large enough amount of noise (reaching the gaussian distribution), the result would be equivalent sampling from the trained PDB distribution, resulting again in sampling from the folded minima instead of a diverse equilibrium dataset.

4) In section 3.2 (Score Network architecture), the authors indicate that there have been minor modifications to IPA to include pair representations with edge layers. Could the authors provide more context as to why this is necessary and not arbitrary?

5) In Appenix B, Algorithm 2
How is the algorithm returning x_0? Based on the paper wasn't x_0 the starting point?

6) Better interpretation on why the method works:
Given that the model is optimized on the PDB dataset, we would expect it to only learn the PDB landscape. However when degenerating the process with the proposed approach it actually learns to generate samples close to the equilibrium distribution. Because it never had access to a Force Field and only to the folded state it is quite surprising it is able to "make up" that information. Could it be this is only possible because of the ESMFold embeddings? I.e. do these embeddings contain information about the protein landscape beyond the folded structure, and then are you recovering that information present in the ESMFold embeddings with the proposed method? It would be interesting to know the authors interpretation about this.

### Summary
The authors propose STR2STR, a structure-to-structure framework to perform conditional conformation sampling of protein structures. The goal of conformation sampling is to sample new stable, energetically favorable structures from an initial protein structure. DIirecting atomistic modeling of protein structure is often intractable due to the size and high degrees of the system. Rather than sampling the entire structure at once, the authors reformulate the task into multiple conditional sampling tasks. The backbone is generated conditioned on a ground truth conformation. The backbone and ground truth conformation are used to then generate the side chains and carbonyl oxygen on the backbone. The authors present an updated implementation of the invariant point attention from AlphaFold and show that their confirmation sampling process is SE(3) equivariant. Compared to recent deep learning methods, STR2STR has comparable validity while improving fidelity and diversity of generated conformations.

### Strengths
* The authors present a novel representation decomposition for protein structures to enable structure-to-structure translation using a diffusion model.
* The amortized learning objective which uses only pre-confromed data and does not require new simulated sets is significant and can reduce the cost of training future models.
* The improved diversity and fidelity of the model while not relying on simulated conformations is also significant. Improvements over EigenFold, a similar diffusion model is interesting.

### Weaknesses
 * The benchmarks set is small and make it difficult to judge the results provided.
* Some presentation issues (refer to clarifications)

### Questions
* “We notice that the ensemble diversity is not the higher the better and depends on the characteristics of the target system”
Could you please elaborate more on this?
* Is there a reason run times are provided only for a single target protein rather than all 12 (other than the high cost of sampling)?
* Any particular reason why 100ns MD simulation runtimes are not compared with STR2STR runtimes?
    * According to Table 1, smaller trajectories sometimes outperform the proposed model. Having all the data allows the reader to have a more complete understanding of the capabilities of the proposed model

### Summary
The authors present Str2Str, a score model for protein conformation sampling. The model is trained on crystal structures from the PDB and could generate diverse conformations for unseen protein systems. Unlike previous mothods (e.g., EigenFold), Str2Str is sequence-agnostic. The model learns protein conformation distribution without knowing the amino acid residue sequence. Through the proposed forward-backward dynamics, which is similar in vein to simulated annealing, the model is able to effectively explore different potential energy minima without suffering from rare event sampling problems.

I find this manuscript well-written and provides promising results towards solving the protein conformation sampling challenge. Please see some of my main concerns below.

### Strengths
- The major contribution of this work is the proposed forward-backward dynamics using a structure-based score model trained on the PDB dataset. From Fig. 5 and Fig. S3, it is clear that Str2Str outperforms other existing protein conformation sampling methods.

### Weaknesses
See questions.

### Questions
- What is the difference between the proposed Str2Str pipeline and applying forward-backward dynamics using a pretrained FrameDiff?

- Is it possible to provide an additional ablation study on a few fast-folding proteins, where only alpha-Carbon coordinates are modeled? Maybe you can just turn off the rotation loss. I am curious whether frames are essential for accurate protein conformation sampling.

- From Appendix >> Inference Stage on page 22, the ensemble structures is obtained by merging samples from each perturbation scale, in total 1,000 conformations for fast-folding proteins. It is surprising that metrics such as JS-PwD/MAE-TM remains so small even though $T_{\delta}$ can be as large as 0.7. I expect that many samples are quite different from the starting conformation, especially for large $T_{\delta}$. Could you please explain this behavior?

- Since the model is sequence-agnostic, the model should sample many "outlier" conformations, which is not accessible from the given protein sequence. In Fig. S5, are most of the shown structures valid conformations for each protein system?

- Page 18, I do not understand why reweighting could not help improve relevant distributional metrics. Does that mean the model likelihood estimation is not accurate, or model diversity originates from model uncertainty? Quick check, if we manually make $\log p_{X}$ a constant value across all samples, would it improve the metrics?

- Would you mind showing model performance on the apo/holo dataset for a fair comparison with EigenFold?

- Could you please (1) provide the source code in supplementary materials; (2) make the benchmark data open-access for reproducibility?

### Summary
This paper aims to capture the dynamic protein structures and obtain various protein conformations. Instead of the resource-demanding MD and MC methods, the authors take inspiration from simulated annealing and propose a structure-to-structure translation framework for zero-shot conformation sampling. Roto-translation equivariance is appropriately guaranteed. Experiments on the 12 proteins in a newly established benchmark confirm the validity, fidelity, and diversity of the produced conformations. Ablation analysis and case study are provided for readers to have a deeper understanding of this paper. The problem under study is significant and this proposed idea is interesting.

### Strengths
- Strucutre-to-structure translation seems a novel way to sample various conformations of a target protein. It requires less computational resources than MD and MC. 
- The experiments are described in details, which is very helpful for the readers the understand the proposed method.
- The paper is well-written and easy to follow. More explanation about the formulas would further increase readability.

### Weaknesses
 - Although the overall structure-to-structure translation for protein conformation sampling is novel, there may not be adequate points to support the whole paper. The forward-backward process is most similar to a diffusion process, where the forward process adds noise (or heating) to data distribution and the backward process denoise (or annealing). The learning objective is similar to DenoisingIPA, except the minor edge translation layer.
- Proper discussion of MC and MD-based related studies for protein conformation sampling could give readers a more thorough picture of where this paper is located.
- Also, I'd like to see MC and MD-based baselines in the experiments. Though they are slow, I'm wondering how they perform in terms of validity, fidelity and diversity.

### Questions
- What is the total number (or dimension) of variables T, R, v, X? Does this have something to do with the number of residues in each protein?
- The score matching objective is the supervision signal. That is, the model is required to approximate the distribution of atom positions/angles of a target protein. I'm wondering how the proposed method encourages diversity of the sampled conformations. 
- Please properly use the term dynamics. Not sure if the authors properly interpret this term. To the best of my understanding, the concept of dynamics should have something to do with time and is usually used to indicate a temporally changing variable. Here in this paper, I do not see the conformation of a target protein changes with time. Instead, this paper cares more about different candidates of stable conformations. The proposed forward-backward process seems like a dynamics but essentially is a process of heating-then-simulated-annealing, which is different from the dynamics of protein conformation. Please properly modify some statements, especially those regarding dynamics.
- How similar are the 12 proteins in the benchmark to the training protein data? Need to ensure zero-shot by quantifying the dissimilarity of train/test proteins at sequence and structure levels.
