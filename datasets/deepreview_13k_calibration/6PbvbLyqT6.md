## Abstract
Counterfactual regret minimization (CFR) is a family of iterative algorithms showing promising results in solving imperfect-information games. Recent novel CFR variants (e.g., CFR+, DCFR) have significantly improved the convergence rate of the vanilla CFR. The key to these CFR variants’ performance is weighting each iteration non-uniformly, i.e., discounting earlier iterations. However, these algorithms use a fixed, manually-specified scheme to weight each iteration, which enormously limits their potential. In this work, we propose Dynamic Discounted CFR (DDCFR), the first equilibrium-finding framework that discounts prior iterations using a dynamic, automatically-learned scheme. We formalize CFR’s iteration process as a carefully designed Markov decision process and transform the discounting scheme learning problem into a policy optimization problem within it. The learned discounting scheme dynamically weights each iteration on the fly using information available at runtime. Experimental results across multiple games demonstrate that DDCFR’s dynamic discounting scheme has a strong generalization ability and leads to faster convergence with improved performance. The code is  available at https://github.com/rpSebastian/DDCFR.

### Summary
The paper introduces a Reinforcement Learning framework to manage the decaying parameters of Discounted CFR dynamically. In order to do so, the paper proposes a game-agnostic neural policy that receives as input the iteration and current exploitability and outputs DCFR's parameters and a time window for which those parameters will be used.
The proposed algorithm is proven to maintain the same (ignoring constants) regret guarantees than CFR, and experiments validate the approach of training a general policy in simple games and then evaluating it on a suite including much larger games. Ablations are provided, showing the value of each piece of the algorithm presented.

### Strengths
* simple idea. The whole paper is built on an initial observation and a single concept. This makes the paper follow a linear and clear structure
* clear presentation. The paper is well written and answers almost all the questions one may have on the topic.
* clear and sound experimentation framework. Experiments answer all the questions.
* good empirical results. The results are encouraging and worth of publication

### Weaknesses
 * the tradeoff between computational power and significance of the results is arguable, While I agree on the amortized costs of training on small games and use the same policy on larger instances, the computation of accurate exploitability is a hard constraint of the technique as presented in the paper. While I think that this is the largest weakness on the scalability of the technique, I do not think that such a constraint should be circumvented in this paper.
* the comparison with RL algorithms could be explored a bit more. I'm convinced that PPO is a bad choice in the given setting due to long horizons and sparse rewards, but I'm not convinced on the multi-task nature of the RL challenge at hand. In my view, the task is identical and there is just stochasticity induced by the distribution over games during training. I'd expect a multi-task problem to explicitly pass to the policy the task as observation in order to condition the policy. My suggestion is to expand a bit more on the topic in the paper.(e.g. why wouldn't sset gamma=1 solve the long horizon problem?)

Minor suggestions:
* Is equation 4 wrongy formatted? Especially the parentheses and the $\ast$ symbols
* add the default DCFR parameters as a constant line in the plots in Figure 4



### Questions
* in section 3.4, you say that the exploitability computation can be done in parallel. I'm not conviced about this, since to run a CFR computation you need the parameters, which depend on the explotability of the average strategy **after** the latest iteration. Am I missing something? The only parallelizable step is the computation of the gradient in the ES subroutine
* what happens in the first 500 iterations of DDCFR? Why are those hidden?

4: You are confident in your assessment, but not absolutely certain. It is unlikely, but not impossible, that you did not understand some parts of the submission or that you are unfamiliar with some pieces of related work.

### Summary
The paper introduces a dynamic weighting scheme for iterates of CFR, employing an MDP to determine optimal weights based on the algorithm's state. The empirical results support the effectiveness of this approach. Their scheme/framework is modular and can be applied to state-of-the-art CFR variants including DCFR and PCFR$^+$.

### Strengths
I reviewed a previous version of this paper.

The reviewers have adequately addressed the concerns brought up by the reviewers in this version of the paper. This includes applying their framework to PCFR$^+$ and comparing DDCFR directly to PCFR$^+$, as well as comparing to Greedy Weights.  Additionally, they provide a convergence analysis of their algorithm.

### Weaknesses
The algorithms' numerical performances are depicted starting at 500 iterations. It would be nice to show the performance of the algorithms in early iterations. 

While the paper notes that the time spent training the network to be used for the dynamic weight calculation is amortized by the number of times the policy computed is applied in application of the framework to equilibrium computation in different games, it never explicitly states how much time was spent training the network.

### Questions
I would suggest using a log-scale on the x-axis and start the x-axis at the first iteration. This allows easy comparison of the algorithms being compared and makes clear both short-term performance and long-term performance. It is confusing that the exploitability starts at small values at the beginning of the graph and then doesn't seem to change much in Kuhn, for example.

Could you note the actual amount of time required to training the policy in Section 3.4? Additionally, I would suggest ordering "(i)", "(ii)", and "(iii)", in the same order you state them in Line 264.

### Summary
The paper offers an interesting extension to counterfactual regret minimization inspired by reinforcement learning for learning the Nash equilibrium in imperfect information games. Specifically, the paper proposes an MDP formulation of adjusting the discount rate in DCFR algorithms, a provable guarantee for the proposed RL approach, empirical tips and tricks for speeding up the convergence of the RL algorithm, and simulation studies on incomplete information games.

### Strengths
1. The problem studied by the paper is an interesting one and the approach taken is intriguing.
2. The paper provides the learned models in the supplemental materials, which make the results easier to verify.
3. The paper offers a comprehensive overview of the problem setting and discusses well its contributions in context of existing works.
4. The set of games considered in the experiments is comprehensive.

### Weaknesses
1. The paper could be better organized. Admittedly the problem studied here is a challenging one and necessitates heavy notations, as well as a collection of specific terminologies in both AGT and RL. However, some concepts are not used (or at least used explicitly), causing the paper to appear to be overwhelmingly dense at a first read. Assuming that the paper is targeted at audience with a game theory background, perhaps it would make more sense to spend some time describing and motivating the key algorithmic contributions from the RL angle. For instance, it might be useful to defer the mathematically rigorous definitions of *information set reach probability* or *interval history reach probability* to the appendix, and keep in the main body only an intuitive description of these concepts, as the paper's key contribution lies in the MDP-based approach proposed later. This takes up space and takes attention away from more important concepts such as exploitability $e$ and "realized" exploitability $E$.
2. On are related note, there are some overloaded notations that make the paper harder to parse. For instance, the letter $a$ refers both to the actions taken by the agents in the "Game Theory" part of the paper and the action taken by the learner in the "Reinforcement Learning" part of the paper.
3. For the experiments, it would be nice if the authors could provide the wall-clock times for DDCFR. DCFR has an added benefit that the algorithm requires little computation complexity at each round (the discount rates are specified beforehand) and it would be a fairer comparison to consider the computational aspect as well. (I am convinced by the arguments in Section 3.4, but adding these results will better validate the claims in Section 3.4 empirically.)
4. Theorem 1 requires the action space to be discretized, yet this is not stated explicitly (also see the following section for question on boundedness of $\tau_t$.
5. It appears that experiments are only run once, yet multiple runs are required to demonstrate that the proposed approach convincingly outperform DCFR, and the figures in the paper are not due to luck alone.

### Questions
1. Shouldn't there be (at the very least) some mild assumptions on boundedness of $\tau$? In the degenerate case, suppose the initial policy always select $τ \to \infty$ and some really poor choice of discount rate. Will the algorithm still converge at the rate provided in Theorem 1?
2. Purely out of curiosity, why should we directly "jump" to RL which, as the paper points out, "notably sensitive to hyperparameters". Does it make sense to consider a bandit-based approach for optimizing the discount rates?

### Summary
This paper studies the CFR framework in the setting of incomplete information games, and proposes a modification that allows for equilibrium finding using a dynamic, automatically-learned scheme. To do so, the authors formulate CFR’s iteration process as an MDP and give a transformation that frames the (CFR) discount scheme as a policy optimization problem wherein the dynamic discounting scheme is an agent that interacts with the MDP. The primary motivation of this framework is to be able to learn discounting policies that can generalize over different IIGs, rather than having to be carefully designed for specific games. In this direction, the authors design a training algorithm based on evolution strategies that can generalize well, even to games that are not seen in the training process.

### Strengths
The core idea of the paper, namely the dynamic policy optimization procedure for learning discount schemes, is conceptually important since it allows generalization to unseen games, circumventing the need for suboptimal fixed discounting schemes. Moreover, the experiments prevented are convincing, showing not just benchmarking against current state of the art but also ablation studies which gives a stronger idea of what aspects of DDCFR makes the most improvement over standard CFR approaches. The DDCFR methodology is also shown to be effective in modifying other CFR variants, which is a useful property to have. Moreover, the paper is well written in the way that motivations are clear, and any potential concerns are discussed in fair detail (for instance, the discussion about the potential additional computational costs).

### Weaknesses
The framework introduced seems to be useful in practice and effectively stitches together several well-established ideas. A minor weakness would be that there isn’t much technical novelty, since all the results and techniques used are taken from prior works. However, this doesn’t diminish the quality of the results greatly to me. Another minor weakness is that currently the explanations in the ablation studies section feel quite vague and handwavy. My suggestion to the authors would be to highlight several key results in the table and provide a more substantiated explanation for each. It would also have been nice to see running time comparisons in the experiments to properly verify the authors’ claims about additional computational costs not causing major increases in running time.

### Questions
- How does the DDCFR technique compare to deep methods like Deep CFR when it comes to larger scale games? 
- How does DDCFR empirically scale to games with more players? In principle, it seems to me that it would provide similar benefits compared to current CFR methods in multiagent settings but I’m curious if this is something the authors have explored.
