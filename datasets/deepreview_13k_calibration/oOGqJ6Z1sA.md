## Abstract
In observational studies, balancing covariates in different treatment groups is essential to estimate treatment effects. One of the most commonly used methods for such purposes is weighting. The performance of this class of methods usually depends on strong regularity conditions for the underlying model, which might not hold in practice. In this paper, we investigate weighting methods from a functional estimation perspective and argue that the weights needed for covariate balancing could differ from those needed for treatment effects estimation under low regularity conditions. Motivated by this observation, we introduce a new framework of weighting that directly targets the treatment effects estimation. Unlike existing methods, the resulting estimator for a treatment effect under this new framework is a simple kernel-based $U$-statistic after applying a data-driven transformation to the observed covariates. We characterize the theoretical properties of the new estimators of treatment effects under a nonparametric setting and show that they are able to work robustly under low regularity conditions. The new framework is also applied to several numerical examples to demonstrate its practical merits.

### Summary
This study proposes a novel framework for average treatment effects (ATEs) estimation by using uniform transformation. The authors develop an estimator that does not employ the exact estimation of the propensity score. Then, they show the finite-sample nonparametric minimax optimality for the estimator (but I think the estimator is not nonparametric in a usual sense...?) and asymptotic distribution.

### Strengths
Firstly, I note that I could not grasp the contributions of this study, especially the novelty of the proposal of the uniform transformer. Therefore, I could not assess this study well. If possible, I want to deepen my understanding and clarify the contributions of this study through an interaction with the authors.

The reasons why I could not understand the contributions are based on the following three points.

1. Necessity of the exact estimation of the propensity score.
In the 2000s, there were enormous arguments about what kind of weighting functions are effective in ATE estimation. As a result of long arguments, researchers found that using the **true** propensity score does not achieve the asymptotic lower bound proposed by Hahn (1998). That is, some finite-sample bias improves the asymptotic efficiency of estimators, as shown by Hirano et al. (2003). Does this study lie in those literature or completely discuss different topics?

2. Significance of the use of a kerne-based U-statistics.
To the best of my knowledge, existing studies such as Hirano et al. (2003) employ kernel-based U-statistics, at least in theoretical analysis. What is the difference from the existing approaches?

3. Minimax rate.
I could not understand why the authors use the minimax optimality for nonparametric estimators. The estimator used by the authors is typically referred to as a semiparametric estimator, which is characterized by nonparametric and parametric estimators. Then, the authors are interested in the estimator error of the parametric part of the semiparametric estimator. Therefore, I believe that the nonparametric minimax optimal rate is a bit meaningless in this context (in other words, I think that although the authors say that the proposed estimator is nonparametric, the estimator is (semi)parametric). Furthermore, the asymptotic variance in Corollary 1 is not efficient from the viewpoint of the semiparametric efficiency bound proposed by Hahn (1998). Is the estimator really efficient or minimax optimal?

Additionally, I could not understand connections to existing estimators whose asymptotic variance aligns with the semiparametric efficiency bound; that is, the authors' estimator cannot be more efficient than the existing efficient estimators. Overall, I could not understand the author's intent in this study.

My assessment may be biased my knowledge of existing literature of this topic, and I am not confident on my assessment. I hope that I can deepen the understanding via communication with the authors.

### Summary
The paper introduces a method for estimating treatment effects using balancing weights, involving two key steps:
- a uniform transformation ensuring a uniform distribution density on the weight's denominator
- a density estimation of the transformed numerator

Under some regularity conditions and given that the density on the denominator is known, the authors establish an upper bound on the estimator's error rate and show that this rate of convergence is minimax. Additionally, they propose an adaptive uniform transformer that, when combined with the estimator, yields consistent treatment effect estimation.

### Strengths
- The authors introduce a novel effect estimation strategy utilizing balancing weights through uniform transformation, together with a new adaptive uniform transformer.

- The paper provides a sharp characterization (in terms of minimax optimality) of effect estimation through uniform transformers, which is new to the literature. 

- The paper is clear and well-written.

### Weaknesses
 - The use of a uniform transformer is not well-motivated. It is not clear to me, from the paper, why a uniform transformation is preferred over an estimator with densities $f_T(X)$ and $f_C(X)$ estimated separately without any transformation. The paper does not provide a clear explanation of the benefits of this transformation, particularly in terms of bias and variance reduction compared to direct density estimation. It is unclear if the uniform transformation is simply a mathematical convenience or if it offers a genuine statistical advantage in this context. Specifically, it's not clear how this transformation simplifies the estimation problem beyond potentially allowing for the use of U-statistics, and whether this benefit outweighs the potential loss of information or introduction of bias from the transformation itself.

- The upper bound in Theorem 1 still relies largely on having accurate knowledge of $f_C$ (and also its smoothness level due to the $\alpha,\beta<\gamma$ constraint), and it doesn’t seem to me that the proposed method with the adaptive uniform transformer is able to achieve the minimax rate in general. The dependence on the smoothness parameter $\gamma$ and the requirement that $\alpha, \beta < \gamma$ are quite restrictive and limit the applicability of the theoretical results. The practical implications of this constraint are not fully explored, and it's unclear how the method performs when these conditions are not met. Furthermore, the paper does not adequately address how the adaptive transformer handles situations where the true density $f_C$ is far from uniform after transformation, which could lead to suboptimal performance.

- The minimax optimality results are only for a very restricted class of problems. The paper focuses on a specific class of problems and does not discuss the generalizability of the results to more complex scenarios. The limitations of the minimax optimality results should be more clearly stated, and the paper should discuss the potential challenges in extending the proposed method to other settings, such as those with higher dimensionality or more complex treatment assignment mechanisms.

### Questions
- What is the difference between estimating both the densities of $f_T(X)$ and $f_C(X)$, as compared to the proposed strategy? In particular, under the conditions on $f_C(X)$ estimation posed in Corollary 1, is it possible for an estimator without the transformation to achieve the same rate?

- In general, what is the rate that can be achieved using the adaptive transformer? When adding strong enough regularity conditions, can it in general achieve the rate specified in Corollary 1? And what would those conditions be like?

- What is the advantage of using the proposed method, as compared to a conventional doubly robust estimator?

### Summary
The authors study the average treatment on the treated (ATT) in the Holder smooth paradigm of Robins et al. (2008), where minimax rates are known. Previous work characterizes the lower bound and shows that a higher order influence function estimator attains it. This paper proposes an alternative estimator based on kernel smoothing to also achieve the minimax lower bound. In the “hard cases” where the nuisances are non-smooth, relatively few estimators have been shown to have good properties; for the “easy cases” where the nuisances are collectively smooth enough, this is a very mature literature.

### Strengths
Originality: To my knowledge, this proposed estimator is new.

Quality: The results are cohesive. I recommend the authors mention Appendix B in the main text; I did not notice it at first.

Clarity: The writing is clear.

Significance: Proposing alternative estimators that achieve the minimax lower bound in hard cases is theoretically interesting, though perhaps not practically significant.

### Weaknesses
The introduction is too general for a paper that is ultimately about ATT only. 

The kernel balancing weight literature is rich with many recent installments that should be at least mentioned in the introduction: Kallus (2020), Hirshberg et al. (2019), Singh (2021), and Bruns-Smith et al. (2023).

In Corollary 1, the convergence in distribution result for “easy” cases ends up being similar to several works that are unreferenced. It is not clear how this result advances the literature on efficient estimation in the smooth case.



### Questions
What are the advantages of this approach versus the higher order influence function approach, which seems to have the same kinds of guarantees?

How do we choose the bandwidth in practice?

Is Theorem 2 a straightforward extension of the Robins et al. (2008) lower bound result? What are the aspects of it that are new? Close comparisons would help here.

I will raise my score if these are addressed.
