## Abstract
By employing neural networks (NN) to learn input-solution mappings and passing a new input through the learned mapping to obtain a solution instantly, recent studies have shown remarkable speed improvements over iterative algorithms for solving optimization problems. Meanwhile, they also highlight methodological challenges to be addressed. In particular, general non-convex problems often present multiple optimal solutions for identical inputs, signifying a complex, multi-valued input-solution mapping. Conventional learning techniques, primarily tailored to learn single-valued mappings, struggle to train NNs to accurately decipher multi-valued ones, leading to inferior solutions. We address this fundamental issue by developing a generative learning approach using a rectified flow (RectFlow) model built upon ordinary differential equations. In contrast to learning input-solution mapping, we learn the mapping from input to solution distribution, exploiting the universal approximation capability of the RectFlow model. Upon receiving a new input, we employ the trained RectFlow model to sample high-quality solutions from the input-dependent distribution it has learned. Our approach outperforms conceivable GAN and Diffusion models in terms of training stability and run-time complexity. We provide a detailed characterization of the optimality loss and runtime complexity associated with our generative approach. Simulation results for solving non-convex problems show that our method achieves significantly better solution optimality than recent NN schemes, with comparable feasibility and speedup performance.

### Summary
The authors present a generative learning framework for the map between input and solutions for non-convex multi-input optimization problems, which has a wide range of applications in science and engineering. This framework leverages a generative model to learn the 
mapping from input to a solution of distributions.  A benefit of this framework is when we sample from the input-dependent solution distribution the corresponding sample with the highest probability should correspond to a feasible solution. Lastly, the authors theoretically characterize optimally the characterized solution and empirically show RectFlow outperforms other generative models in solving this task.

### Strengths
The strengths of the paper are:
* Finding a novel application for the RectFlow model.
* Theoretical contribution- Providing a statement about the optimally gap decreasing as the number samples increase from the learned distribution.
* Solving an important problem that has a lot applications in engineering and science domains. 
* The experiments that were provided have strong empirical evidence the proposed method is better than other generative models and baselines.

### Weaknesses
The paper could improve improve in the following ways: 
* The motivation of the problem formulation could be more clear because there is a lack of context on the benefits of solving the problem in a generative framework. It is unclear why the authors chose to solve these particular types of non-convex problems with a generative model and why practitioners should adopt this framework.
* The experimental section lacks plethora of empirical evidence, the proposed method is demonstrated on two toy problems. There is no evidence provided the proposed method would help you solve a particular engineering problem and perform better than current methodologies. 
     * Mirror weakness- Figure 3 would be more clear if colors associated with the samples of the probability were given as heat map.

### Questions
1). What are the benefits of using a generative framework to solve these types of optimization problems?

2). Could the authors provide a framework for practitioners on how to adopt this methodology? What requirements are needed?

3). Could the authors provide the probabilities of the samples in Figure 3?

### Summary
The rectflow model is applied to approximate the one-to-many solution mapping function in this paper. Given the Boltzmann distribution assumpation, this work transforms RectFlow model (Liu et al., 2022) to solve (potentially) nonconvex optimization problems. The experiments showcase RectFlow is better than some other generative models rather than state-of-the-art models for each nonconvex problems.

### Strengths
Solution generation is well motivated in the paper and the background is clearly written. Despite the straightforward application of RectFlow, the effect of the method is manifested in experiments by evaluating on simple optimization problems. The optimality loss and runtime complexity analyzed to show the efficiency.

### Weaknesses
1) Experiments are too simple and only easy problems are tested. The first simple function estimation with a limited feasible interval is oversimplified. The second combinatorial optimization experiment uses three relatively simple problems that have simple constraints. In this sense, the constraint handling power and the mapping power under complex scenarios are not showcased. More complex problems with multiple constraints can be added to enhance the experimental part.
2) Many generative models are designed for optimization problems. Despite the comparison with basic generative models, the generative models for optimization problems should be compared. A lot of them learn solution distributions rather than single-valued mappings, which share the same motivation in this paper. I believe they can be easily used in the tested problems in this paper. Please refer to A GNN-guided predict-and-search framework for mixed-integer linear programming, DIFUSCO: Graph-based Diffusion Solvers for Combinatorial Optimization, SurCo: Learning Linear Surrogates For Combinatorial Nonlinear Optimization Problems
3) The method is too straightforward by applying RectFlow, lowering the novelty of this work. Although the complexity is analyzed, the empirical results do not support the theory that the method is able to solve complex problems with multiple constraints.

### Questions
1. Can the authors clarify the constraints of the problems used in experiments?
2. The authors claim nonconvex leads to more multiple-valued input solution associations. But convex problems like multi-solution TSP may also have many one-to-many mappinps. Is there any explainations on this viewpoint?
3. The authors claim "existing studies endeavor to identify a single possible mapping from the potential multiples". It is not totally correct as considerable research focuses on estimating solution distributions given instances and many diversity techniques are adopted to encourage models finding more near-optimal solutions. 
4. Despite the analysis of complexity, did authors try to solve large or complex problems? Any empirical insights on performance of the method in problem scales and constraint handling?

### Summary
This paper presents a learning-based method to compute solutions for multi-valued non-convex optimization problems. The method is based on RectFlow method.

### Strengths
The proposed method addressed an important optimization problem. The concept of instead of learning input-output mapping, training a model to learn input-output-distribution is a novel concept. The authors provided concrete theoretical framework, and reasonable amount of empirical evidence to support the claims. The writing of the manuscript is clear and easy to understand.

### Weaknesses
The sampling portion of the manuscript can be further improved. The authors imply that due to the inexact approximation of NN vector field, and the discretization error when solving the forward solution of the ODE, the final results may not be as optimal as theoretically shown. This is fully understandable, however I would expect the authors to provide a more clear explanation, and also provide empirical solutions to address them. In the current version, the authors seem only point out to possible solutions.

Secondly, the explanation of the experimental results needs to be clarified.

### Questions
1. Section 4.3, it is understandable that there are issues in forward ODE solve. The authors pointed out a few possible solutions. Are these methods used to generate the results reported in section 6? 

2. I would like to see expanded text of Section 4.3, and some ablation study if there are multiple solutions. 

3. Section 6.2, Table 3, what are the `speedup` column compared against?

### Summary
This paper considers the problem of learning neural approximations of multi-valued input solution mappings arising from solutions of non-convex optimization problems. Previous work on learning single-valued mappings struggled to approximate such multi-valued mappings, compromising between poor optimality performance and high computational complexity. This paper proposes a generative approach based on rectified flows, which is inspired by the recent successes of generative models for modeling complex multi-modal distributions. 

The authors propose to process multiple samples in parallel, project them onto the feasible region, and keep only the best one, leading to high quality feasible samples.
This is also quantified in a theorem, which gives an upper bound on the probability of selecting a sample that has optimality gap larger than $\delta$, elucidating the dependence of sample quality on the dataset quality, the approximation error of the learned vector field, the number of ODE discretization steps and the number of samples. Additionally the runtime complexity is characterized, giving insights into the tradeoff between increasing the number of samples and increasing the number of ODE discretization steps.
Experimentally, the proposed approach is compared to various baseline on a synthetic multi-valued dataset and three graph-based combinatorial optimization problems. The proposed approach is shown to strongly outperform previous neural-network based approaches in terms of optimality gap while preserving a strong speedup in runtime.

### Strengths
I really enjoyed reading this paper. It is built on a great idea of applying the recently popular diffusion-based models to learning solutions of optimization problems. The method and results are presented with great clarity, and the text reads very well overall. The quality of the paper is high, with interesting theoretical insights that have useful implications, as well as convincing experiments.
I believe this paper makes a very significant contribution, and I agree with the authors that it could pave the way for future research in learning multi-valued solution mappings of optimization problems.

### Weaknesses
- Some parts of the proof of the theorem are a bit unclear, see questions.
- The paper could have benefitet from more diversity in the experiments, e.g. including one of the motivating applied examples from the introduction could have made the paper even more of a slam dunk (e.g. AC optimal power flow problems in real-time power grid operations, semi-definite programming-based real-time scheduling, coding operations in modern wireless communication systems). However, I believe the given experimental evidence still makes it a good paper and I believe is sufficient for acceptance.

### Questions
- The paragraph after equation 27, in particular how equation 28 follows, was unclear to me.
- In the proof of the theorem, some Lipschitz assumptions are made. It would be good to make these explicit in the theorem statement, in which they are currently not mentioned.
- The step from equation 31 to equation 32 could be explained in a bit more detail.
