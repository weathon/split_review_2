## Abstract
The accumulation of data in the machine learning setting is often presented as a panacea to address its many modeling problems---including issues with correctness, robustness, and bias. But when does adding more data help, and when does it hinder progress on desired model outcomes? We model data accumulation from multiple sources and present analysis of two practical strategies that result the addition of more data degrading overall model performance. We then demonstrate empirically on three real-world datasets that adding training data can result in reduced overall accuracy and reduced worst-subgroup performance while introducing further accuracy disparities between subgroups. We use a simple heuristic for determining when the accumulation of more data may worsen the issues the additional data is meant to solve. We conclude with a discussion on considerations for data collection and suggestions for studying data composition in the age of increasingly large models.

### Summary
The authors model data accumulation from multiple sources and present an analysis of two strategies that result in adding more data, degrading the overall model performance. They empirically demonstrate on three real-world datasets that adding training data can reduce overall accuracy and reduced worst-subgroup performance while introducing further accuracy disparities between subgroups.

### Strengths
- the authors tackle the well-known issue that more data does not always lead to better machine learning outcomes: data quality (the whole dataset composition should mirror the data we will receive at inference time) is of primary importance.
 - the paper is of good quality: the authors propose several scenarios and work with real-world data to draw conclusions
 - the paper is well-structured and written

### Weaknesses
 - the authors did not consider research on domain adaptation, which could be considered key in this particular setting
 - the authors did not check for data-based techniques used in active learning settings that can help identify data relevant to machine learning models

### Questions
We consider this research interesting and relevant. Nevertheless, we would like to point to the following improvement opportunities:
1. "training data is often considered to be set in stone and imposed as a pre-existing and static constraint." -> The authors should consider that while sometimes this is true, the fact that distribution shift exists and takes place should be, therefore, evaluated on training sets too. We encourage you to reframe the sentence stating such an evaluation as a best (and often forgotten) practice.
2. *Criteria for rejecting more data*: The problem posed by the authors resembles active learning and some specific data-based strategies. Furthermore, some research has been performed on active learning and stopping criteria. The authors may be interested in researching these areas. Here, we list two works they may find useful: (a) Fu, Yifan, Xingquan Zhu, and Bin Li. "A survey on instance selection for active learning." Knowledge and information systems 35 (2013): 249-283, and (b) Zhang, Yexun, et al. "Stopping criterion for active learning with model stability." ACM Transactions on Intelligent Systems and Technology (TIST) 9.2 (2017): 1-26.
3. *Experimental setup*: we consider the experiments valuable and valid. Nevertheless, the authors should consider enriching them with some scenarios where domain adaptation is used to mitigate distribution differences. The authors may be interested in the following work: Farahani, Abolfazl, et al. "A brief review of domain adaptation." Advances in data science and information engineering: proceedings from ICDATA 2020 and IKE 2020 (2021): 877-894.
4. *Results and analysis*: Do the authors venture some hypothesis as to why the XGB model is robust to data from different distributions, suffering a lower accuracy loss?

### Summary
Describes how the way data is added to a model (data accumulation) affects performance against the reference test set. Two methods are presented. First, a data mixture method where data is added in the same subgroup mixture as the original dataset. Second is sequential - this is where datasets are added one after another with no guarantee that the mixture of subgroups is the same as the original data. The authors point out that sequential additions can harm model performance especially when there are distinct distribution differences between the datasets (i.e. high KL divergence).

### Strengths
Well written and useful analysis, and especially suitable for this track.  It guides researchers on what to expect when adding new datasets, what circumstances lead to good outcomes and which one might not. Also great caution to the assumption that more data (except perhaps noisy or corrupt data etc) is always good for the model.

### Weaknesses
Overall this was an interesting paper to read. Most of these are about clarifications and how the authors have interpreted their results.

It is unclear how the target dataset is constructed. It should not matter in the mixture set-up but it would be consequential in the sequential set-up. The target set should be a sample from all n datasets, unless it is updated each time a new dataset is added.
It is also not clear how long the model is re-trained with the new examples. This can help us better understand if the examples can’t be learned or if the model just did not have as many iterations to incorporate these new examples. 
The implications of this work are not clear. In real-world settings, if there exists a datasets similar to one that we currently have but has high divergence does it mean it should not be included in the analysis? Doesn’t not doing so restrict the model from better generalising? Eg. Yelp reviews in MN vs SD.
Thirdly, it looks like adding more data reduces performance disparity between groups and in general helps the least performing group. Reducing disparity is perhaps indicating that the model is generalising better and getting more robust and these should be good things.

### Questions
1. How is the reference test set constructed? If it's in the appendix, it should included in the main paper because it is consequential.
2. How long do you retrain after adding new datasets?

### Summary
The paper introduces models for data composition changes in single-source and multi-source settings, analyzes the effects of data scaling on performance, and presents empirical findings for three real-world datasets. The authors also use a heuristic for determining when the addition of more data could be detrimental based on measuring excess KL divergence. The paper only focuses on tabular data scenarios.

### Strengths
- I appreciate the theoretical result provided by the authors as Lemma 3.2. 
- The authors evaluate on 3 real-world datasets and conduct multiple diverse experiments throughout the paper.

### Weaknesses
In my opinion, there are multiple issues with the work originating from the simplicity of the findings, mismatch in motivation/setting, and a lack of consistent evaluation throughout. I provide more details on these below, but due to these reasons I am leaning towards rejection as I believe the paper does not meet the bar for acceptance at ICLR:

- **Simple Empirical Findings and Lack of Generalizability**: The experiments conducted as well as the results obtained are quite simple. Both the Sequential and Mixture model settings are quite trivial, and the obtained results are unsurprising to me. For instance, it seems intuitive that multi-source dataset scaling could lead to worse outcomes on a reference test set, and that it might lead to better generalization (Section 5). The only results that look at data scaling more deeply are located within Section 5.1, but still by themselves those cannot motivate this work. Furthermore, the results obtained (as well as the approach undertaken) are highly dataset dependent (for e.g., what if I sample the reference test set differently for Folktables? Or use a different state altogether?) This issue is also showcased via the accuracy results for both the Yelp and MIMIC-IV datasets under the Sequential paradigm (refer to Figure 6a and Figure 7a, respectively). These figures (for obvious reasons) show very different trends across both datasets for the same model.
- **Inconsistent Evaluation Across Datasets**: The experiments are mostly conducted on the Folktables dataset, with a few results for Yelp and MIMIC-IV. For consistency in evaluation, all the datasets should be used and conclusions can be drawn from the results more adequately. For instance, all the results for Section 5.1 (such as those on the generalized test set) consider only the Folktables dataset, and Yelp and MIMIC-IV are not considered. Furthermore, it is not always mentioned in the text when the other datasets are being used and what the motivation is to discard others, which can be confusing for readers.
- **Limited Scope and Applicability**: The biggest drawback of the work is the mismatch in whether this work tackles a useful practical problem and its actual motivation. The original outlined motivations in the abstract and introduction imply that the paper will aim to provide more insights on data scaling in useful practical scenarios. However, the work only considers tabular data and very simple models (the most complex is the MLP). The focus on tabular datasets significantly narrows the paper's scope, especially considering that data scaling is a critical concern in large language models (LLMs) and other domains outside of tabular data (such as NLP and Vision). The paper fails to provide insights or implications for these broader and arguably more impactful areas (such as deep learning), limiting its relevance, scope and applicability. In its current form, I do not think the paper provides insights that are useful for a real-world practical application scenario.

### Questions
- Could the authors provide an appropriate justification or real-world scenario as an example for concentrating exclusively on tabular datasets? In this scenario, if models are not deep learning based would they be prone to large data scaling issues?
- In this simpler paradigm with models such as Logistic Regression etc, instead of continuously adding more data for generalizability, would it not make sense to just focus on approaches that curb distribution shift and retrain the model cyclically over certain time periods? 
- Please feel free to respond to any of the other weaknesses listed above.

### Summary
The work is devoted to exploring the difference between two ways of sampling data from different sources facing shifts in them compared to the general distribution. The authors demonstrate that sequential sampling expectedly results in the shift of performance. The work contains large experimentations resulted in observational study of the effects.

### Strengths
- Intensive experimental evaluation and analysis

### Weaknesses
I see a notable weakness of this work in the novelty and the contribution. The paper seems to state claims that are more-or-less known in research community. So, even if there are no publications on the topic, e.g., the fact of having shift of distributions (and thus, lower performance) in the case you sample not from the target distribution is common knowledge and directly follows from ML grounds. So, such knowledges are also referred to as folklore. So, in my opinion, the paper contribution is narrowing down to experimental analysis, which is good but looks like an observational study without clear new insights (besides the ones expected by folklore knowledge). It is not enough for this venue. I would assume that such an analysis is a good illustration / help for students that study ML / statistics and might be published through some books on the topic.


Another related weakness is the problem setup. The authors try to explore some effects when sampling not from the underlying distribution D in different ways knowing that they sample with shifts. What is the problem to be solved? If the practitioner face a situation, knowing D, then they will sample from it. If they have no access to D, then they try to sample some distribution such that it is most close to D. If they face two sources and expect that they have representation of D (they believe that their union is close to D), then they will sample randomly from the union. And etc. In any way, the practitioner knowing basics of ML, will attempt to be close to the best knowledge of D for them. It is hard for me to imagine situations described in the work, where a practitioner is aware of ML grounds and is increasing samples without carrying about the general population. I assume, it might be the case when this practitioner is working with ML tools without knowing ML grounds (so, in this case, a book on ML grounds might help). Overall, the work lack of clear problem statement: what is known for a practitioner, what is not, which decisions they can take, what are limitations. 


Sec.3.1 serves for me as support of absence of clear problem statement in the work. The authors write “While in reality the test set cannot be accessed, we assume we can use some part of the training set (e.g., the D_s_1 ) that is similar to the test distribution).” Seems that it means that the practitioner believes that D_s_1 IS the distribution D. So, when receiving D_s_2 they should take D_s_1 united with D_s_2 as D, or not considering D_s_2 at all.

### Questions
In section 3.1: “While in reality the test set cannot be accessed, we assume we can use some part of the training set (e.g., the D_s_1 ) that is similar to the test distribution).”

-	I see two closing parentheses while having only one open one.

-	What do you mean saying “that is similar to the test distribution” it is unclear


In Section 4: “data composition on model outcomes as measured on a test set sampled exclusively from the initial dataset Source A (e.g., SD) – which we call the reference test set.”

-	I do not understand: at the beginning of the work it was stated that “test set” is the union. Here, it is stated that it is just D_d_1.
