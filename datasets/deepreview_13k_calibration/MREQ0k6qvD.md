## Abstract
Exposing meaningful and interpretable neural interactions is critical to understanding neural circuits. Inferred neural interactions from neural signals primarily reflect functional interactions. In a long experiment, subject animals may experience different stages defined by the experiment, stimuli, or behavioral states, and hence functional interactions can change over time. To model dynamically changing functional interactions, prior work employs state-switching generalized linear models with hidden Markov models (i.e., HMM-GLMs). However, we argue they lack biological plausibility, as functional interactions are shaped and confined by the underlying anatomical connectome. Here, we propose a novel prior-informed state-switching GLM. We introduce both a Gaussian prior and a one-hot prior over the GLM in each state. The priors are learnable. We will show that the learned prior should capture the state-constant interaction, shedding light on the underlying anatomical connectome and revealing more likely physical neuron interactions. The state-dependent interaction modeled by each GLM offers traceability to capture functional variations across multiple brain states. Our methods effectively recover true interaction structures in simulated data, achieve the highest predictive likelihood with real neural datasets, and render interaction structures and hidden states more interpretable when applied to real neural data.

### Summary
The paper discusses an extension of generalized linear models for a population of neurons used (binned spike trains under Poisson firing rate assumption)  that involves latent states and factorized latent-state-dependent inter-neuron connection weights.  The latter goes beyond previous work with a specific factorization that involves a mixture factor over at the simplex, which at its extremes provides a one-hot encoding that determines the existence of a connection and its sign (excitatory or inhibitory), and the state-dependent weight magnitude. Estimation of the parameters of this model requires an expectation maximization algorithm, which is briefly described. Baseline models from the literature and additional novel baselines are constructed by involving various aspects of the proposed approach. Results are presented for a synthetic experiment and two real-world data sets, with known task/stimulus/environmental timing.

### Strengths
The paper is an original contribution for GLM models of neuron spike trains. The method and results are well-presented and clear. The figures and equations are clear. A number of baselines are compared and the results are consistent.  From the results it would seem that the latent state inference is meaningful, this could be significant for neuroscientists who wish to study.

### Weaknesses
The synthetic study seems quite limited to the type of data the model is designed for (a single global state).  It is not clear to me how well it will work if the neurons are organized into groups with their own state dynamics (which evolve largely independently) and only rarely communicate. I.e. the topology of the network could be loose connections between tightly interconnected subnetworks.

A principled approach for the selection of the number of states is not discussed. At one point the paper mentions that the log-likelihood is higher with additional states although these states are rare: "there are many sessions with rarely occupied states, and the distinction
between states becomes subtle". This seems to be a flaw in the modeling if someone does not know how many true states. Should the reader be suggested to look at the distribution of states to decide? Perhaps a model selection criterion is needed. 

Along similar lines, an analysis of the decoding of task information from the latent state would help understand in the real-world tasks the utility of the state estimate. 

Questions of scaling could provide better significance:

How scalable is the model and/or the algorithm? New recording technology including optical calcium imaging can record from hundreds to close to thousands of neurons.  The number of neurons in the synthetic study could be ramped up to see this. 

It is not clear how quickly can inference be performed after model fitting. If a neuroscientist wants to use the inferred state to control a stimulus is it possible to operate in real-time with a minimal delay?

### Questions
How would the number of states be selected in practice? 

How scalable is the model in terms of subpopulations with their own dynamics?

How scalable is the model and algorithm in terms of the number of neurons?  

How quickly can inference be done at run time?

### Summary
This paper proposes a prior-informed state-switching generalized linear model with hidden Markov models (HMM-GLM) called one-hot HMM-GLM (OHG), capable of estimating dynamically changing functional interactions under different states. Learnable priors are introduced to capture the state-constant interaction and reveal the underlying anatomical connectome. Experiments on simulated data demonstrated its effectiveness and practical applications achieved interpretable interaction structures and hidden states with the highest predictive likelihood.

### Strengths
1. This paper proposed a novel OHG framework to estimate time-varying functional interaction in multi-state neural systems. The one-hot prior yielded better connectivity patterns and hidden states and provided more biological plausibility.
2. This paper provided detailed algorithms of the proposed model and conducted extensive experiments on both synthetic and real neural datasets to demonstrate its superiority.

### Weaknesses
1. This paper seems to propose two frameworks: the naïve one is GHG and the effective one is OHG. What’s the relationship between them? In the abstract, the authors only mention the two priors (Gaussian and one-hot) without the names of the frameworks. In the conclusion, only OHG is mentioned. Thus, it is confusing.
2. In the method, the authors first describe OHG and then introduce GHG. They are both variants of HMM-GLM but OHG outperforms GHG. Thus, the order seems unreasonable. What’s more, the experimental results showed that GHG was unable to achieve this paper’s goal. Then what’s the value of GHG?

### Questions
1. As shown in Table 2, the results of different numbers of states were similar to that of one-state GLM. It can be explained that global static connection patterns dominate functional interactions in all states as mentioned in the manuscript. Then was the state division biologically reasonable? Perhaps only the features of the global prior were extracted or there was only one state.
2. The experiments fixed the generative hyperparameters and claimed that this set was noninformative priors and insensitive to different datasets. Is there any support for this declaration?

### Summary
The authors address the challenge of modeling dynamic functional neural interactions. They note that existing methods often lack biological plausibility, primarily because they don't account for the influence of anatomical structures on functional neural interactions. To rectify this, the authors introduce a one-hot prior to the GLM model. The method was evaluated on one synthesized dataset and two real-world datasets, achieving state-of-the-art results.

### Strengths
This paper is technically robust. The underlying problem is well-defined and builds upon a lineage of substantial research. Drawing insights from neuroscience, the authors convincingly argue that anatomical structures influence dynamic functional neural interactions. Their approach to address this hypothesis is adeptly framed, straightforward, and effective. The evaluation is comprehensive, encompassing a broad spectrum of models related to the problem, and it's tested across varied datasets. The inclusion of the whisking dataset is particularly intriguing, and the visual illustrations enhance clarity. Overall, this paper is commendable and would be a valuable contribution to the ICML community, showcasing the intersections of machine learning and neuroscience research.

### Weaknesses
(1) While the overall presentation of the paper is commendable, there is room for improvement in Sections 2 and 3. These sections could benefit from more intuitive and lucid explanations accompanying the mathematical equations, making it more accessible for readers. Specifically, the transition between the general Hidden Markov Model (HMM) framework and the specific Generalized Linear Model (GLM) instantiation could be smoother. The authors should clarify how the parameters of the GLM are updated within the HMM framework, and how the one-hot prior is incorporated into this process. The current description could lead to confusion about the exact mechanism of parameter estimation and the role of the prior.

(2) I believe the prior work by Glaser et al. [1] deserves acknowledgment. It might also be valuable to include it in the comparative models, given that their focus on cluster (population) structures aligns with the theme of underlying structures.

### Questions
I'm keen to understand the authors' future direction and insights drawn from this research. Does incorporating an increasing number of biological constraints into models always lead to better outcomes? Or are there potential trade-offs to be mindful of? Going forward, are the authors considering other factors that might influence interactions? For instance, within an E-I balanced network, given identical anatomical structures and brain states, interactions could vary based on the stage and phase of short-term synaptic depression. This suggests that intrinsic governing features could arise when adding more biological constraints or features. I'd appreciate the authors' perspective on this.
