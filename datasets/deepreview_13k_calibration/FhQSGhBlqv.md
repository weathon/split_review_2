## Abstract
Most existing causal discovery methods rely on the assumption of no latent confounders, limiting their applicability in solving real-life problems. In this paper, we introduce a novel, versatile framework for causal discovery that accommodates the presence of causally-related hidden variables
 almost everywhere 
 in the causal network (for instance, they can be effects of observed variables), based on rank information of covariance matrix over observed variables. We start by investigating the efficacy of rank in comparison to conditional independence and, theoretically, establish necessary and sufficient conditions for the identifiability of certain latent structural patterns. Furthermore, we develop a  Rank-based Latent Causal Discovery algorithm, RLCD, that can efficiently locate hidden variables, determine their cardinalities, and discover the entire causal structure over both measured and hidden ones.
We also show that, under certain graphical conditions, RLCD correctly identifies the Markov Equivalence Class of the whole latent causal graph asymptotically. Experimental results on both synthetic and real-world personality data sets demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed approach in finite-sample cases. Our code will be publicly available.

### Summary
This work expands on the use of the rank of the covariance matrix to identify causal structures with latent variables in linear models. The authors give sufficient and necessary conditions under which latent variables of the causal graph can be identified using the rank. This insight is then used to devise an algorithm that can identify linear latent causal graphs upto an indeterminacy.

### Strengths
- Very well written and a pleasure to read. The paper is well structured and the exposition is clear.
- Claims are well justified.

### Weaknesses
 - SID and SHD are more natural metrics for graphical evaluations
- Assumptions are not justified. (this might be for the field in general)
	- Assumptions are made on unmeasured variables and graphical structure that are hard to verify. Justification of why these are relatively weak (compared to previous work) would make this more useful.
- Relation to previous work does not contain enough information. It makes it hard to judge the exact contribution of this work. Some detail is given in the introduction.
	- Related work has been moved to the Appendix but there is not enough information about what the differences to similar works are. It would be useful if the most related works (e.g. Huang et al. 2022) are described in more detail.
	- For example, Hier. rank, that uses rank to discover hierarchical structures, is not described in sufficient detail. This leaves the question in the readers mind: what specifically allows for the identification of children of latents and mediatior latents etc as opposed to this work.

### Questions
- The assumptions in condition 1 are on unmeasured latent variables, how would you verify this before carrying out the graph search procedure? 
- Similarly, how can you verify assumptions in condition 2? This seems particularly strong to me, 
- Is Lemma 10 a contribution or has this been stated by previous work? If so, a reference is missing.
- Similar to the above, is Theorem 4 a contribution?

### Summary
The paper presents a novel rank-based latent causal discovery algorithm to identify equivalence classes of directed acyclic graphs which can have both measured and latent variables. The causal relationships among the variables can be quite general compared to restricted patterns in the literature. They prove the discovery algorithm is asymptotically correct and degenerates to existing algorithms when certain aspects of the algorithm are simplified. Simulations and real data examples demonstrate the utility of their method.

### Strengths
1. The paper addresses a very important problem in causal discovery, i.e., identify graphs with latent variables
2. The graph pattern considered in the paper is quite general compared to existing methods.
3. The learning algorithm has theoretical guarantee in the large sample size limit. 
4. Real-world example is quite convincing. 
5. The paper is very well written.

### Weaknesses
No major weakness is found. Just a few minor ones; see the questions.

### Questions
1. Can the author explain the minimal-graph operator and the skeleton operator in addition to their definitions? Perhaps giving some examples will be helpful for readers to understand what equivalent graphs they entail.
2. Corollary 1 says it degenerates to PC when there is no latent variable. I suppose that is under the assumption that the causal model is linear as assumed throughout in this paper. In other words, if the truth is not linear, the PC is asymptotically correct but the proposed algorithm may not -- is it right?

### Summary
The authors propose a method for causal discovery in the presence of latent variables (`RLCD`), which makes use of observational rank information under the assumption of an underlying linear latent causal model, in which measured variables can be adjacent. The authors show how the rank information can be used to locate the presence of hidden variables and how their approach can reliably discover the causal structure over both measured and latent variables, asymptotically up to their Markov equivalence class.

### Strengths
The work is rigorously described for the most part and quite technical, yet the authors have managed to present intricate information in a reasonably clear manner. The approach seems to be an original extension of previous work on hierarchical structure and has potentially significant application, since it allows the user to uncover part of the latent causal structure under relatively mild assumptions. The differences between the proposed method and related work, including the PC algorithm and methods for identifying latent hierarchical structures, is clearly explained.

### Weaknesses
The paper is rigorously written for the most part, but I think there some parts are missing important details. For example, the steps in Algorithm 1 after Phases 1-3 are not described in detail, specifically how the cluster information is aggregated after the first three phases. It is also not very clear how the additional information is added into the CI skeleton.

I also think a bigger focus on the evaluation in the main paper would be warranted, since the experimental section seems a bit sparse. It is not quite clear to me why and where RCLD performs so much better than the competitors, just by looking at the F1 score. It would have been helpful to see the output of these different algorithms on a running example. 

*Miscellaneous comments:*
- some references are duplicated (Judea Pearl - *Probabilistic reasoning in intelligent systems*, Shohei Shimizu et al. - *A linear non-gaussian acyclic model for causal discovery*.
- page 1, first paragraph in introduction: "ICA-based techniques ... that further **leverage**"
- page 2: repetition in "our main contributions are mainly three-fold"
- page 3: instead of the unusual construction ", - we basically", I would employ a semicolon, or simply start a new sentence.
- page 3, Section 3.2: I would not start a sentence with "E.g", but instead say 'For instance,'
- page 5, Algorithm 1 is introduced too early in the paper. I would move it to Section 4.2, where it is first explained.
- page 5, before Theorem 7: "uesful"
- page 6, Figure 3 is introduced too early in the paper. I would move it to Section 4.2, where it is first used to explain Alg. 1
- page 6, Figure 3(c) caption: "**Take** variables from..."
- page 6, Condition 1: "triangle structure" should be defined
- page 7, Section 4.2, second paragraph: I believe "Condition (i)-(iv)" is supposed to be **conditions (i)-(iv)**.
- page 7, last paragraph before Section 4.4: "We further determine the **neighbour** set... "
- page 7, last paragraph: "we **increase** *k* by 1"
- page 8, Table 2 appears too early in the paper, since the experiment section is on the next page.
- page 9, Section 7: "causal discovery approach that allows causally-related variables" seems to be an unfinished thought

### Questions
1. I am not convinced about the claim on page 1 that, for algorithms like FCI, "the research relies on the assumption that all hidden variables are independent of each other". Could you perhaps point to where that assumption is made? As far as I know and have checked, any maximal ancestral graph (MAG) is learnable from conditional independence using FCI, and a MAG is also valid if obtained from marginalizing over dependent latent variables.
2. By "latent ones" do you mean latent variables? If so, I would say latent variables instead, because it is not immediately clear what "ones" refers to.
3. In Theorem 7, what is the distinction between $\mathbf{X}$ and $\mathbf{X}_\mathcal{G}$?
4. Why is it so important to have a unified causal discovery framework, in the sense that rank constraints are used for finding the CI skeleton in Phase 1 of the procedure? I imagine it is more important to find an accurate CI skeleton, so do rank constraints provide more accurate *d*-separation statements than conditional independence tests? Could it also be better to mix different types of tests?
5. I imagine FCI would perform quite poorly in terms of the skeleton F1 score for all variables (Table 2), since it does not explicitly identify any latent variables, but how do you explain a score of 0.00? Does that mean that FCI did not get any edge right at all, not even between observed variables, as Table 3 also suggests?
6. What happens after Phase 3 in Algorithm 1? How is the information from $\mathcal{G''}$ transferred to the Markov equivalence class? How are the rest of the orientations performed? I am also confused by the fact that $\mathcal{G'}$ is supposed to be the skeleton on the observed variables (output of Algorithm 2 from PC), yet toward the end it becomes the MEC over both observed and latent variables (output of Algorithm 1). What am I missing here?
7. The idea of learning part of the latent structure explicitly has important ramifications. Could the authors perhaps comment on what extra information can be ascertained relative to methods like FCI, for which the latent structure is implicit? Put a different way, does the difference lie solely in the fact that some latent variables can be identified? Will RLCD always provide more structural information than FCI or other CI-based causal discovery algorithms?

### Confidence
3: You are fairly confident in your assessment. It is possible that you did not understand some parts of the submission or that you are unfamiliar with some pieces of related work. Math/other details were not carefully checked.

### Summary
This paper presents a new framework for causal discovery in the presence of unmeasured confounders and linear structural causal models (SCMs).

### Strengths
Overall, I like this paper, and I think the contribution made in this paper is quite huge. 

1. The introduction is written in a straightforward and neat manner. The contribution is expressed clearly.
2. All the results seemed technically sound to me. 
3. Every result is accompanied by examples, which greatly helps understanding the paper. 
4. Experimental studies are conducted extensively, providing strong empirical benefits.

### Weaknesses
One minor weakness/limitation of the paper is that its method is confined to linear SCM. If the variables are mixtures of discrete and continuous random variables, or if they follow a nonlinear SCM, are there any opportunities for the proposed method to contribute?

### Questions
1. It’s a minor comment. I think the definition of $\Sigma_{\mathbf{A},\mathbf{B}}$ should be within Theorem 3. 
2. If $\mathbf{A},\mathbf{B}$ are not t-separable, what does Theorem 3 imply? 
3. I am curious about the benefits of the proposed algorithm in terms of running speed and time complexity compared to other existing algorithms, such as FCI or LiNGAM.
