## Abstract
Robustness and compactness are two essential attributes of deep learning models that are deployed in the real world. 
The goals of robustness and compactness may seem to be at odds, since robustness requires generalization across domains, while the process of compression exploits specificity in one domain. 
We introduce \textit{Adaptive Sharpness-Aware Pruning (AdaSAP)}, which unifies these goals through the lens of network sharpness. 
The AdaSAP method produces sparse networks that are robust to input variations which are \textit{unseen at training time}. 
We achieve this by strategically incorporating weight perturbations in order to optimize the loss landscape. This allows the model to be both primed for pruning and regularized for improved robustness. 
AdaSAP improves the robust accuracy of pruned models on image classification by up to +6\% on ImageNet C and +4\% on ImageNet V2, and on object detection by +4\% on a corrupted Pascal VOC dataset, over a wide range of compression ratios, pruning criteria, and network architectures, outperforming recent pruning art by large margins.

### Summary
This paper presents a sharpness-aware structured pruning paradigm, AdaSAP, which can make a model more ready for pruning. The resulting model is more robust than other (sharpness-unaware) pruning methods. The proposed method has 3 steps, (1) Apply a proposed adaptive weight perturbations to optimization to adaptively penalize sharpness in order to prepare the network for pruning. (2) Prune the network (3) Continue training the model while uniformly penalizing sharpness across the network to encourage robustness. The key to improving robustness is step (1). Many specific pruning algorithms can be used in step (2). Empirically, the model of the proposed method is trained on the clean dataset (e.g., ImageNet), while showing superior performance than other SOTA structured pruning methods on OOD datasets (e.g., IageNet-C), in classification and detection tasks, with four networks.

### Strengths
1. Sharpness-aware pruning is an interesting topic and of rising importance these days since model robustness is attracting more attention.

2. The proposed method via weight perturbation is technically sound and sounds novel to me.

3. Empirically, the proposed method achieves superior performance than the other sharpness-unaware counterparts, showing the encouraging potential of the method.

### Weaknesses
1. Some of the experimental results look unconvincing. E.g., Taylor / GReg / ABCPruner are more advanced pruning methods than magnitude pruning, esp. for Taylor and GReg, their papers have shown they perform better than magnitude pruning. But here, in Tab. 1, for different sizes, Magnitude consistently performs better than the above three methods. I am wondering if the authors have correctly done their experiments.

2. Presentation.

2.1 Page 8, Tab. 1 and 2 seem too big and the text looks too narrow.

2.2 Typos and grammar mistakes.
- Tab. 1 caption: various -> various
- HALP (NeurIPS’23 (Shen et al., 2022b)) -> NeurIPS'22
- Sec. 4.5, first sentence misses a period.
-- These small glitches, not very serious though, make me feel this paper is sort of rushed out.

3. As mentioned in Sec. 4.6, the method requires twice the training time. The total training cost (e.g., how many GPU hrs) should be discussed in the paper.

### Questions
In Tab. 1, for the results of comparison methods, are they from the authors' rerun with the same base unpruned model, or, cited from the original papers?

### Summary
The paper proposes AdaSAP, an optimization paradigm to produce sparse yet robust models against distribution shift. It unifies the goals of sparsity and robustness through the lens of loss landscape sharpness. The method has three steps: 1) Adaptive weight perturbations before pruning to push unimportant neurons into flatter minima, reducing the impact of pruning them; 2) Pruning unimportant neurons based on any criteria; 3) Sharpness-based optimization after pruning for overall robustness. Experiments on image classification and object detection show AdaSAP outperforms SOTA pruning techniques with higher robustness while maintaining accuracy. Analysis indicates AdaSAP results in flatter loss surfaces, explaining its robustness advantages. By effectively unifying sparsity and robustness through sharpness, this exploration presents a promising direction for robust and efficient models.

### Strengths
1. Unifying sparsity and robustness through the perspective of sharpness is an interesting idea.
2. Good results are achieved on both image classification and object detection tasks.

### Weaknesses
1. Although the idea to improve both sparsity and robustness sounds good, the method to improve robustness via weight perturbation is indeed not novel. Is there any special designs closely related to pruning?
2. In the experiments, the authors only conduct experiments in terms of robustness on convolutional networks. Nevertheless, there are a lot of works that have reported competitive robustness results, such as [a, b]. It is better to discuss or include these SOTA results into comparisons.

[b] "Robustifying token attention for vision transformers." ICCV 2023.

3. While the proposed AdaSAP method demonstrates notable effectiveness in concurrently optimizing sparsity and robustness, it is better for the authors to include a discussion of other relevant works that aim to achieve such dual objectives. This would provide readers with a better understanding of where AdaSAP stands in this field and allow for comparisons with existing literature.
4. In the experiments on image classification, evaluating AdaSAP on additional pruning criterias would provide a more comprehensive assessment the effectiveness and generality of AdaSAP.
5. The experiments and analysis on object detection are inadequate with only one model. More detection models should be evaluated. Furthermore, comparisons with other pruning methods are needed to further verify efficacy.

### Confidence
2: You are willing to defend your assessment, but it is quite likely that you did not understand the central parts of the submission or that you are unfamiliar with some pieces of related work. Math/other details were not carefully checked.

### Summary
This paper proposes to use a different optimization paradigm, that encourages flatter optima, for obtaining robust compressed models. The idea is based on the hypothesis that flatter minima encourage deep networks to be both robust and good generalisers. The optimization paradigm can be used with any exsiting pruning algorithm (demonstrated in experiments by using HALP and L2 norm structured pruning). The method is shown to improve both benign and adversarial performance on unseen OOD samples.

### Strengths
S1. The problem is well motivated and the justifications for the used solution makes sense.

S2. The experiments show marginal improvement in adversarial robustness upon using AdaSAP.

### Weaknesses
W1. Writing needs to be improved especially within section 3.1 where mathematical preliminaries need to be set well. Also, variables are being used much before their description/introduction.

W2. Lack of ablation with respect to $\rho_{min}, \rho_{max}$.

W3. Lack of adherence to ICLR template. Text is wrapped around images, tables, and algorithms.

### Questions
Q1. In each of the cases of AdaSAP pruning procedure, can you please report the accuracy numbers for the models post Adaptive Weight Perturbation Step (warmup)? It would be interesting to note the difference in numbers pre and post pruning.

Q2. When computing $\alpha_i$ (equation 2), did you intend to write $\rho_{max}$ instead on $s_{max}$ in the first term? The expression looks odd otherwise. If yes, can you explain the choice of using $\rho_i = - \alpha_i s_i$ ? It is unclear why would you require a negative sign. If no, can you please explain the choice behind defining $\alpha_i$ in such a way?

### Summary
This paper proposes an adaptive sharpness-aware pruning including pre-pruning optimization and pruning procedures. It claims that the proposed method improves the robustness and efficiency and providing evaluation on different version of ImageNet.

### Strengths
* The evaluation of the proposed method is solid and comprehensive including robustness evaluation and the efficiency evaluation with different metrics. 
* The presentation of the proposed method is clear and the paper is overall well-written.

### Weaknesses
 * As mentioned by the author, SAM as a post-pruning training can help pruning has already been studied by several works, this work seems to be a modification or extension of using sharpness-aware neuron-level perturbation to enhance the pruning. So there exists a lack of novelty and clarification on the difference between this method and the vanilla SAM method, as well as the motivation for proposing AdaSAP optimization to surpass common SAM. 
* There is no discussion of the hyperparameter tuning used in the method since it is especially critical for SAM-type methods.
* (minor) The paper may benefit from discussing a few more recent works [1][2] about the relationship between pre-pruning optimization and pruning performance in Related Works.

### Questions
* In Section 4.5 and Table 4, will the results be consistent if we use some other way to measure the sharpness like Hessian Top-eigenvalue or trace?
