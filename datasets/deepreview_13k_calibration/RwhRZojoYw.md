## Abstract
Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are widespread in graph representation learning. *Random dropping* approaches, notably DropEdge and DropMessage, claim to alleviate the key issues of overfitting and oversmoothing by randomly removing elements of the graph representation. However, their effectiveness is largely unverified. In this work, we find experimentally that they have a limited effect in reducing oversmoothing, contrary to what is typically assumed in the literature. These approaches are also non-parametric and motivate us to question if *learned* dropping can alleviate the  propagation of redundant or noisy edges. We propose a new information-theoretic approach, in which we learn to perform dropping on the data exchanged by nodes during message passing via optimizing an information bottleneck. Our approach is superior to previous dropping methods in oversmoothing reduction and has promising performance in the case of deep GNNs.

### Confidence
3: You are fairly confident in your assessment. It is possible that you did not understand some parts of the submission or that you are unfamiliar with some pieces of related work. Math/other details were not carefully checked.

### Summary
In this paper, the authors empirically show that existing DropEdge and DropMessage operations have limitations, and propose Learn2Drop to mitigate the oversmoothing issue. Specifically, they propose to optimize a mutual information objective using the information bottleneck principle, and conduct experiments on several datasets to evaluate the effectiveness of Learn2Drop.

### Strengths
- The paper studies the oversmoothing issue in GNNs, which is a key issue when applying GNNs.
- Both analysis and emprical results are provided to show the limitations of two existing works.
- Open-sourced code helps improve the reproducibility.
- Empirical experiments are conducted to show the effectiveness of the proposed method.

### Weaknesses
 - One major concern is from the evaluation part. First, in addition to DropEdge and DropMessage, there are other methods that aim to address the oversmoothing issue. The authors may consider to compare with them. Although the authors mention that the aim of this paper is to isolate and understand the specific impacts of different techniques, it is still encouraged to show to what extent can the proposed method solve the oversmoothing issue compared with the recent, more complex methods. Second, more interpretations related to Table 1 can be provided.

- The authors claim that DropMessage at testing time may introduce a high amount of variance in the model predictions. They may provide more evidence (e.g., some experimental results) on this.

- The writings of the paper can also be improved.

### Questions
- Why use Dirichlet energy instead of mean average distance?
- What does DO mean in Table 1?

### Summary
This paper empirically evaluated the influence of DropEdge and DropMessage on the oversmoothing effect of graph neural networks. The findings reveal that random dropping methods are insufficient in mitigating oversmoothing. The authors then propose a non-random dropping approach that learns which element to drop. This method can be used in both training and testing. Empirically, the proposed method alleviates oversoothing and improves performance accuracy.

### Strengths
- The oversmoothing experiments in Section 3 are very thorough. I particularly appreciate section 3.2, where the authors investigate the importance of randomness to DropEdge (Figure 2).
- The proposed information bottleneck approach (Section 4.1) seems to be principled and effective.

### Weaknesses
The paper relies on a normalized variant of Dirichlet energy to measure oversmoothing. As the authors themselves pointed out in the paper, however, this metric does not correlate with performance accuracy well. On the one hand, I understand that there is no universally agreed metric for evaluating oversmoothing, and I agree that the normalized Dirichlet energy metric used by the authors is a sensible one. On the other hand, I believe that whether a smoothing effect qualifies as an "oversmoothing" depends on whether the node features give rise to bad final performance (in an extreme case, if constant node features yield the best results, then it is debatable about whether these constant node features are "oversmoothed" or "appropriately smoothed.") Hence, to enhance our understanding of how dropping interacts with oversmoothing effects, I recommend the authors to either: 

(i) Plot the normalized Dirichlet energy (x-axis) vs. accuracy (y-axis) frontier for models. This could be informative as the normalized Dirichlet energy alone may not fully reveal oversmoothing in node features.

(ii) Use perhaps more than one metric to evaluate oversmoothing. The Dirichlet energy is one such metric, but other metrics exist. For example, another way of evaluating oversmoothing is to use the influence scores of nodes (Xu et al. 2018), among many other ways.

### Questions
Does it make sense to compare test-time DropMessage (where we average different outcomes to reduce variance) with Learn2Drop? As the authors pointed out, while DropMessage can stabilize the Dirichlet energy, applying it at test time can introduce high variance in prediction. However, the variance can be reduced with multiple forward passes, each with a different realization of DropMessage. This will introduce some compute overhead, but seems to be a sensible baseline for Learn2Drop to compare.

### Summary
The paper investigates the effects of random dropping approaches for addressing the problem of oversmoothing in GNNs. The paper empirically found that methods like DropEdge and DropMessage which applied randomly and exclusively during training, has limited effect in reducing oversmoothing at test time. Then the paper proposes learning to drop (Learn2Drop) which learns which elements to drop and shows that Learn2Drop is able to successfully mitigate oversmoothing at test time and has better performance than DropEdge and DropMessage.

### Strengths
1.	Overall the paper is clearly written and easy to follow. 
2.	Investigating the effects of current methods on oversmoothing under both metrics for oversmoothing and model performance is important in order to understand them better and develop more powerful GNNs.
3. Dropping information in an informed way is well-motivated.
4.	If we take NDE as a valid metric to interpret oversmoothing, it is an interesting observation that random dropout methods such as DropEdge and DropMessage applied exclusively during training has little effect on oversmoothing at test time. However, see weakness below why the NDE metric can be not well-defined and not interpretable.

### Weaknesses
1. Wrong reference. To the best of my knowledge, Rusch et. al (2022) is not the original paper which first proposes the use of Dirichlet energy to analyze oversmoothing in GNNs. The first paper is Cai and Wang (2020). Please correct the citations in Section 3.1.

2. Missing state-of-the-art literature on oversmoothing. Recently there has been substantial progress made in terms of theoretical understanding of oversmoothing in GNNs such as Keriven (2022) and Wu et al. (2023), where these works rigorously show that there is a “sweet spot” between smoothing and oversmoothing in order for GNNs to perform well for node classification tasks. It is thus not appropriate to claim that "an important takeaway from our work is that the true causes and consequences of oversmoothing are vaguely understood, especially its relationship with overfitting and generalization." Please improve literature review.

3.  No explicit mathematical form for the normalized Dirichlet energy (NDE) and NDE is not a good metric to measure oversmoothing due to at least the three following issues:

- It does not satisfy the criterion proposed for node similarity measure in Rusch et al. (2023), which the authors has relied on as a gold standard for measuring oversmoothing. NDE does not satisfy the criterion proposed in Rusch et al. (2023) because NDE = 0 does not imply all nodes having the same representation vector. It is thus invalid to conclude from NDE that "oversmoothing is still occurring according to the formal definition introduced by Rusch et al. (2023)" from NDE.

- It is obscure to interpret. The reasoning in the paragraph above section 3.2 is entirely heuristic. 

- It is not well-defined for 1-d features (all 1-d features have NDE = 0) and cannot be grounded in practice, as it disconnects oversmoothing from model performance.  Consider the following example: suppose that one wants to do a classification task for two group of nodes, where we have one-dimensional, linearly separable features: group 1 all have representation -1, group 2 all have representation 1. Now NDE is 0, which indicates "oversmoothing" according to the paper, but classification result is perfect.

Due to the above reasons, the observation and interpretation drawn upon oversmoothing based on NDE in this paper is not valid.

4. Insufficient empirical evaluation. 
- DropEdge and DropMessage can also easily be applied during test time. Although the authors argue that random dropping methods could introduce too much noise during test, the paper does not provide empirical evidence. Please add experiments supporting the claim that using them at test time really reduces model performance.
- In Figure 1, it seems a GNN with skip connections are perfect remedies for oversmoothing, but it is not discussed in the paper and not included as a baseline method in Fig 3. and 4. Please add it as a baseline and discuss.

### Questions
1. In Figure 1, it seems that skip connections are perfect remedies for oversmoothing. Why not just go with them?

### Summary
The paper delves into a crucial issue within Graph Machine Learning, namely, the challenge of excessive smoothing in graph data. The authors aim to tackle this problem by applying the information bottleneck principle and demonstrate its effectiveness through the introduction of a new metric they've coined, the "normalized Dirichlet energy." In their research, the authors illustrate the advantages of their method, as it succeeds in reducing the Dirichlet energy while also yielding some improvements in classification accuracy.

### Strengths
The paper outlines a novel application of the information bottleneck principle for mitigating oversmoothing in graph data. Additionally, the paper endeavors to demonstrate that there is no discernible correlation between oversmoothing and test performance, as suggested by their research findings.

### Weaknesses
I encountered challenges in comprehending certain sections of the paper, particularly sections 4.1 and 4.2. I believe the clarity of these sections could be significantly improved with revisions by the authors. Additionally, I have a few follow-up questions:

1. Although the authors correctly emphasize the absence of a strong correlation between oversmoothing and test performance, it is essential to explore the specific conditions under which this correlation holds. This inquiry is vital because scenarios exist where the Normalized Dirichlet Energy may approach zero, yet the test accuracy remains high. For instance, consider a stochastic block matrix with two classes, where all nodes within one class map into a single representation, and the same occurs for the other class (to a different single representation. In this case, the Normalized Dirichlet Energy would be small, but test accuracy would be high. This raises questions about the circumstances in which oversmoothing genuinely matters and whether the metric employed is appropriate.

2. Building upon the first point, the connection between oversmoothing and generalization performance appears to be meaningful primarily when oversmoothing occurs across different classes. Oversmoothing within the same class might not be as relevant. Therefore, it would be valuable for the authors to provide commentary, theory, and experimental evidence in this context, while also demonstrating the efficacy of their method in comparison to other approaches.

3. My concerns extend to the topic of reproducibility. I was unable to locate any provided code or information regarding hyperparameter ranges. Inclusion of this information is crucial for transparency and for ensuring that other researchers can replicate the experiments.

In conclusion, the authors do illustrate that their method reduces the Normalized Dirichlet Energy. However, the actual benefits of their method for node classification tasks remain unclear, as well as its performance when applied to more complex graph architectures. Furthermore, it's uncertain whether their method is effective in the context of homophilic or heterophilic graphs. Therefore, based on these questions and concerns, I am inclined to recommend rejecting the paper. However, I am open to reconsidering this recommendation if the authors provide satisfactory responses and address these issues adequately.
