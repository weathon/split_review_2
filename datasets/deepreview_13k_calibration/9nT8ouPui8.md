## Abstract
Due to their capacity to generate novel and high-quality samples, diffusion models have attracted significant research interest in recent years. Notably, the typical training objective of diffusion models, i.e., denoising score matching, has a closed-form optimal solution that can only generate training data replicating samples. This indicates that a memorization behavior is theoretically expected, which contradicts the common generalization ability of state-of-the-art diffusion models, and thus calls for a deeper understanding. Looking into this, we first observe that memorization behaviors tend to occur on smaller-sized datasets, which motivates our definition of effective model memorization (EMM), a metric measuring the maximum size of training data at which a learned diffusion model approximates its theoretical optimum. Then, we quantify the impact of the influential factors on these memorization behaviors in terms of EMM, focusing primarily on data distribution, model configuration, and training procedure. Besides comprehensive empirical results identifying the influential factors, we surprisingly find that conditioning training data on uninformative random labels can significantly trigger the memorization in diffusion models. Our study holds practical significance for diffusion model users and offers clues to theoretical research in deep generative models.

### Summary
In this work, the authors present a detailed study on memorization in diffusion models by investigating various factors that may be responsible for increased memorization of training samples. In particular, the authors vary the amount of data in the training set, the time that the model was trained for, the size and the configuration of the model, and the existence of various types of embeddings in the model, and analyze their respective impacts on memorization. The study provides a deep investigation on small-scale data sets like CIFAR-10, and discusses unconditional versus conditional generation.

### Strengths
1. First, the paper is very well structured with strong motivation for why memorization is natural in diffusion models, and then going on to present preliminary results on how, on small datasets, diffusion models tend to memorize. 
2. Second, the study is very comprehensive in terms of the breadth of the factors that the authors assess that could lead to memorization. In particular, I enjoyed the section on data distribution, which discusses data dimensionality and diversity with two different formulations. I enjoyed reading these two formulations because these are facets of memorization that are seldom discussed, and most prior work typically only discusses factors like model size and data size. 
3. Third, the paper is very thorough in the effects of embedding, and in particular, the finding that using Fourier embeddings versus positional embeddings can cause a significant change in memorization was surprising. 
4. Fourth, the work acts as a great guide for practitioners who might want to understand the effect of memorization and will be useful for future research.

### Weaknesses
1. First, the analysis of memorization is done in complete isolation of the model's generalization or analysis of aspects of image generation or image quality such as inception score or pressure distance. And I do not think that any analysis on memorization can purely happen in the absence of the latter because we might end up analyzing models that do not make any sense for practitioners. 
2. Second, the experiments are performed on very small datasets and it is unclear how these findings actually take shape in real scenarios where you have huge datasets and you are training on millions of samples with almost similarly sized models. 
3. Third, I don't think that the authors should perform a set of experiments where they try to fine-tune a stable diffusion model on a small dataset which may still be a reasonable analysis where people might want to use a custom stable diffusion model on a particular style by further fine-tuning it on a certain type of data. However, the setting that the authors discuss while it is very helpful in creating the analysis that they do is also very, very restrictive and does not generalize to realistic settings that practitioners actually care for. And I would encourage the authors to explore that. 
4. Fourth, a lot of the paper is about showcasing a finding but does not actually explain the reasons for why a finding actually makes sense. For instance, in particular, the section on the type of embedding was rather weak in my opinion in terms of explaining the effect. Similarly, the section on why data diversity does not influence memorization so much was pretty weak and this paper can significantly be strengthened if the authors actually discuss the results in more detail and why they should happen in a particular way. And I would say that this is true for most of the sections where currently this paper reads as a reporting of a result rather than a scientific discussion of a phenomenon.

### Summary
- The paper discusses that the training objective of diffusion models has a closed-form optimal solution that can only generate training-data replicating samples, and hence a memorization behaviour is expected. 
- A new metric called Effective model memorization(EMM) is introduced which quantifies the maximum number of training data points at which a diffusion model demonstrates the aforementioned memorization behaviour.
- The impact of various factors like data distribution, model, training procedure and conditional generation on memorization behaviour are discussed.

### Strengths
- Extensive experiments on the impact of various factors like data dimension & diversity, model configuration, training procedure and conditional generation on memorization behaviour.
- The theory behind memorization behaviour of the optimal solution in diffusion models is discussed in detail and a new metric called Effective model memorization(EMM) is introduced.

### Weaknesses
There is no detailed comparison with related work in these areas. The effect of various factors on memorization in diffusion models has been discussed in literature before.
- The effect of dataset size on memorization in diffusion models has been discussed before in [1]
- The effect of text conditioning and dataset complexity is also discussed in [2].

### Summary
This paper focuses on understanding memorization in diffusion models. The work shows that memorization behavior is theoretically expected under the training objective of diffusion models. The paper then focuses on identifying and quantifying when memorization happens in diffusion models, by focusing on three facets i.e training distribution ($P$), the architecture ($M$) and training procedure ($T$). The paper shows results on how data diversity, model size etc has an impact on memorization. Lastly, results are shown for how much input conditioning plays a role in memorization for diffusion models using actual and varying number of random classes labels assigned for CIFAR-10.

### Strengths
1. Overall the writing quality of the paper is quite good. The writing was clear, easy to understand and instructional.
2.  The results and experimental setup are easy to understand, and useful for the research community. The analysis itself is quite timely, with ubiquitous deployment of diffusion models and copyright lawsuits that surround them.
3. The results regarding resolution of dataset, data diversity and model size are interesting. The results confirms the expected monotonic behavior, showing that diffusion models memorize samples more when data dimension and data diversity is small, and model size is large. 
4. The results regarding the impact of time embedding are also quite surprising. It would be interesting to analyze this further, and understand why random Fourier features impact memorization in DDPM++.

### Weaknesses
1. The work focuses on a simple toy setup using a subset of CIFAR-10. While such simple setup are useful for analysis, presented in this work it does leave a taste for more. It would be good to ablate setups that plague large datasets, such as dataset duplication which was discussed to be a cause for memorization in diffusion models [3, 4, 5].

2. I also expected to see at least a few of these analysis, on another simple  dataset such as SVHN or CIFAR-100. The authors do not provide any justification for why they did not test on more datasets, and given the relatively low computational cost of doing so, it is unclear why they limited themselves to just a subset of CIFAR-10.

3. The results don't discuss other relevant metrics, such as quality of generations or loss convergence. For example, high weight decay in this work is shown to have a large effect on memorization but it isn't discussed how much it comes at the cost of quality of generations. Without this information, it is hard to know whether the proposed method is actually improving the model, or just trading off one desirable property for another.

4. Several results presented in this paper, especially regarding dataset and model complexity are generally expected based on previous work on other generative and discriminative models [1, 2]. While the authors do acknowledge this prior work, they do not sufficiently explain what is novel about their findings in this context. The paper would be stronger if it highlighted the unique aspects of memorization in diffusion models, as opposed to simply replicating known results from other types of models.

### Questions
1. The memorization criteria used throughout the paper should be clearly explained. What's the reasoning for using an $l_2$ threshold in the image space and comparing it to the second nearest neighbor? How was the factor 1/3 derived? The top and worst matches obtained as a result of using this criterion and its drawbacks should be discussed further. Are the results the same, if the memorization criteria is changed? For example, Somepalli et al [1] used SSCD for memorization.
2. Results regarding weight decay and EMA aren't very informative. Is the model convergence much worse when weight decay is set high? I would suggest discussing this in more detail.
3. It would be interesting to show how noise schedule in diffusion models impacts memorization? 

Things that impact clarity, but didn't affect score -

1. Skip connection results figures could be better, Figure 4a & 4c some markers are too close to understand. The main observation while comes out clearly, the results about number of skip connections is hard to parse from the figure.
2. The memorization criterion can be easily explained in words.  I had to look up the referenced paper, as the notation using $j$-th closest sample was taking a while to parse.

### Summary
Diffusion models can produce identical training images during the inference time, which is called memorization. The authors observe that a memorization behavior is expected according to the training loss. The authors observe that memorization behaviors tend to occur on smaller-sized datasets. They analyze how different data distributions, diffusion model configurations, and training options influence memorization. Besides, they also observe that conditioning training data on uninformative random labels can significantly trigger memorization in diffusion models.

### Strengths
- The discussed topic is interesting. Mitigating the memorization of diffusion models is important.
- The empirical study is through. The authors consider the effect of data data distribution, diffusion model configurations, and training options on memorization.

### Weaknesses
The empirical study is thorough, covering the effects of data distribution, model configurations, and training options. However, the paper lacks a discussion of state-of-the-art text-to-image diffusion models, such as stable diffusion. The absence of experiments or analysis involving these advanced models limits the paper's scope and applicability to current research trends in the field. Furthermore, while the paper identifies the problem of memorization, it does not provide clear mitigation strategies or guidelines based on the empirical results. This makes it difficult for practitioners to apply the findings to improve their models.

### Questions
I appreciate the thorough empirical study. I am curious is there any memorization mitigation strategy given the empirical results?

### Summary
In a series of small experiments authors evaluate how different aspects of the model and dataset influence memorization of training examples in Diffusion Models.

### Strengths
- Authors tackle a very interesting problem of diffusion models that is not yet widely studied, while at the same time bears a great significance
- There is an interesting insight on the fact that adding conditioning, even in a form of random labeling increases memorisation. This observation is worth further studying to shed some light on the nature of memorisation.
- The work follows a nice structure and is therefore easy to understand

### Weaknesses
 - The scientific contribution of this submission is limited. The problem of memorisation in diffusion models was already noticed in several works (as mentioned in the related works section). The observation that in the theoretical optimum of diffusion models they can only replicate training data is new, but it is quite expected since the simplified training objective of DDPMs [Ho et al. 2020] is to directly denoise all training examples with a simple MSE loss.
The main contribution of this work is therefore, a set of experiments that measure the memorization across different model sizes, widths, dataset sizes etc. Except for one experiment described in the strengths sections the results are rather intuitive and expected (e.g. diffusion models memorize more examples from smaller datasets, or when trained with wider models), and are presented in a form of report without in-depth analysis of the root-causes of memorization. The interesting hypothesis is proposed only for the analysis of the class conditioning influence, but it is denied right away in the next paragraph.
- The memorization is only studied with respect to the direct pixel-by-pixel comparison of training and generated samples. Some works (e.g. Carlini et al. mentioned in this work) show that diffusion models can also memorize by generating simple interpolations between similar training examples.
- The evaluation is performed using only one dataset (CIFAR10). It would be interesting how diffusion models memorize more detailed dataset e.g CelebA.

### Questions
- What is the statistical significance of all of the experiments? In some plots, there is small difference between different setups, it is unclear if it should be taken into consideration.
- What was the performance of the model when trained with large weight-decay values? What is the trade-off between the quality of samples and memorization?
