## Abstract
Recent advancements in Natural Language Processing (NLP) have witnessed the groundbreaking impact of pretrained models, yielding impressive outcomes across various tasks. This study seeks to extend the power of pretraining methodologies to facilitating the prediction over tables in data science, a domain traditionally overlooked, yet inherently challenging due to the plethora of table schemas intrinsic to different tasks. The primary research questions underpinning this work revolve around the establishment of a universal pretraining protocol for tables with varied structures, the generalizability and transferability of learned knowledge across tasks, the adaptation to diverse downstream applications, and the incorporation of incremental columns over time. 
In response to these challenges, we introduce UniTabE, a straightforward yet effective method designed to process tables in a uniform manner, devoid of constraints imposed by specific table structures. UniTabE's core concept relies on representing each basic table element with a module, termed TabUnit. This is subsequently followed by a Transformer encoder to refine the representation. Moreover, our model is designed to facilitate pretraining and finetuning through the utilization of free-form prompts. 
In order to implement the pretraining phase, we curated an expansive tabular dataset comprising approximately 13 billion samples, meticulously gathered from the Kaggle platform. This research primarily centers on classification and regression tasks involving tabular data, and conducts rigorous experimental testing and analyses to validate the effectiveness of our methodology. The experimental results demonstrate UniTabE's superior performance against several baseline models across a multitude of benchmark datasets. This, therefore, underscores UniTabE's potential to significantly enhance the semantic representation of tabular data, thereby marking a significant stride for tabular data analysis.

### Summary
The paper proposes a transformer model for table classification and regression. The authors curated a large set of Kaggle datasets for training and evaluation. The central component of the proposed architecture is the TabUnit, which embeds data type, column name and column value respectively, and fuses as well as links the embeddings via gates. The authors propose to use a Transformer encoder and LSTM as decoder. The model is pre-trained by different strategies, namely cell and column masking and siamese triplet loss based on (partial-) row contents. Fine-tuning then entails predicting missing columns for a new dataset specialisied prompts for tasks such as question answering. The authors trained the Transformer on a self-collected dataset comprising 13 billion tables. The approach is evaluated for standard, fine-tuned as well as combined version (with XGBoost). Part of the evaluation is done for Kaggel tasks (12), where the approach is compared to XGBoost and TransTab. The rest of the evaluation is performed for 7 public datasets, where a larger amount of competitors is compared against. The results show that the proposed approach often achieves superior performance in terms of AUC/R2. In addition, multiple ablation studies also highlight, among others, robustness of the approach towards missing data.

### Strengths
The chosen topic of the paper is highly relevant to the venue, as tabular machine learning is, as argued in the paper, often overlooked but highly important in industrial applications.

The proposed approach to learn designated embeddings for data type, column name and values within the TabUnit is sensible and is different to existing approaches. In addition, the authors collect a large dataset for training their Transformer. It would be value adding to open-source such a model.

The work incorporates a large number of competitors in part of the evaluation (on open datasets): The authors include more than 10 baseline approaches of recent papers to compare the performance of their approach on a selected sample of open datasets. The chosen baselines, here, are well-chosen. The authors also provide ablation studies wrt to ther model design, highlighting the implications of omitting parts of the architecture. Lastly, the predictive performance of the approach is often better than the competitors.

### Weaknesses
It is unclear why only part of the evaluation was done for all Transformer-based competitors and why no regression results for a XGBoost regressor have been generated. It would have been highly insightful to have the same evaluation as for the open datasets.

It would also have been insightful to compare to a representative AutoML approach in order to see the boundaries of the approach. Of course, it does not have to be assumed that the model has to beat the best tuned models, but it should come close enough. 

While the results are promising, the gap between the competitors is often rather small. This is not to reduce the quality of the predictive performance, as the task at hand is very difficult and competitive, it just shows that competitors are already strong. 

While part of the evaluation is exhaustive in terms of baseline approaches, the evaluation contains relatively little open datasets compared to some of the competing papers. It would be beneficial to add more thorough design decisions to why the datasets have been chosen or why they are sufficiently representative.

The ablation study with respect to robustness is very interesting and highlights another benefit of the method - being able to deal with missing data. It would be intersting to know if this result holds over the other competitors too.

A minor point (as many competitors were looked at): It would have intersting to see the performance of TUTA, as similar to the proposed approach, more refined embeddings are learned.

### Questions
Will get code / the trained model be made available?

Why was the evaluation only in part conducted with all competitors?

What are the most challenging datasets you tested the method on?

What are other advantages of the proposed approach next to pure predictive performance? Is the method's robustness superior to the other competitors as well?

### Summary
This paper presents UniTabE - a universal pretraining method for tabular data that consists of three components: tabular unit decomposition, encoding, and decoding. Compared to prior work, a key novelty of this model is that it is trained from scratch, and it involves innovations in terms of developing a TabUnit splitter and a simple decoder. The compilation of a large dataset for model training is also an interesting undertaking. The evaluation section provides a large number of experiments, showing the improvement brought by UniTabE on fine-tuned and zero-shot classification, regression tasks, and missing data prediction, whereas a series of ablations show the benefit of each aspect of the method.

### Strengths
S1) The paper is well-written and easy to follow. It provides information that should suffice to reproduce the presented method.

S2) The methodological contributions are clearly indicated and well-justified by the paper. 

S3) The paper contributes a novel dataset and set of models, that should be interesting to practitioners working with tables.

S4) The experimental section shows the benefit of this method against competitive baselines. Ablation studies are provided to ensure that the improvement comes from the expected method components.

S5) To my knowledge, the undertaking to create such a foundational model for tables is novel. I agree with the authors that it can be very impactful given the amount of tabular data online.

### Weaknesses
W1) The paper lacks a discussion of the ethical and legal aspects of the data, including biases, copyright, and licensing.

W2) The proposed method has a strong performance against the baselines consistently, but the baseline choices are inconsistent across the experiments. Can the authors motivate the reason for selecting certain baselines for each experiment, especially for Tables 4 and 5? It is unclear why, for instance, in Table 4, only a fine-tuned and randomly initialized version of the model are used, while other baselines are excluded. Similarly, in Table 5, the rationale for choosing TransTab-LSTM and a 'UniTabE scratch' model, while excluding other potentially relevant baselines, needs further clarification.

W3) The paper talks about generalization to tables with more columns, but the generalization to tables with more complicated structures (e.g., multi-row and multi-column blocks) is not discussed. I am wondering how are such tables handled by the UniTabE. Specifically, the method's ability to handle hierarchical column structures, where columns are grouped under higher-level categories, is not addressed. This is a common scenario in real-world tabular data, and the paper should clarify how UniTabE would process such tables.

Minor:
* Figure 3a is impossible to read - please enlarge the figure for the follow-up version, and ideally provide more guidance/commentary about it in the paper.
* Typo: "Expect for " -> "Except for"
* The commentary of Table 3 (page 9) is unclear, as it refers to "a slight performance enhancement", even though the two versions seem to perform more-or-less on par.

### Questions
Q1) Given that a pretty large amount of data from Kaggle is used for pretraining of UniTabE, I would appreciate it if the authors could comment on the aspect of data licensing, copyright, and ethics of use. Also, what would the use of this model as a foundational model for tables entail given the specific tables used for pretraining?

Q2) Can the authors motivate the reason for selecting certain baselines for each experiment, especially for tables 4 and 5?

Q3) How does UniTabE handle tables with more complicated structures, where the organization of columns and rows is less obvious?

### Summary
The paper delves into the application of large language models (LLM) to tabular data, presenting a novel approach utilizing the transformer model.

To address the unique characteristics of tabular data, the authors introduce "TabUnit", a method to amalgamate data type, column name, and cell values into comprehensive cell vectors. These vectors are then processed through transformer-based encoders and fed into a shallow LSTM decoder to regenerate tokens for the target label column.

Upon pre-training the UniTabE model using 13B samples from Kaggle, the authors fine-tuned it on 12 chosen classification and evaluation datasets. The results reveal a significant improvement over prior methods that lack pre-training.

### Strengths
1. Quality:
The paper's quality stands out as it presents a model pre-trained on an impressively large tabular prediction dataset encompassing 13B samples. The authors conducted a meticulous evaluation of the model with contemporary tabular prediction baselines.

2. Significance:
The results offered by the authors are particularly enlightening. While they tout the enhanced performance derived from pre-training on expansive tabular data, a closer examination (as reflected in Table 3) indicates only a slight uplift in downstream task performance post-fine-tuning, especially given the model's exposure to 13B samples. This subtle observation underscores the intricate challenges posed by tabular data prediction, taking into account its inherent heterogeneity and noise. It's pivotal to recognize that these findings could potentially delineate a performance benchmark for similar BERT-inspired methods in tabular prediction. This could galvanize researchers to delve deeper into innovative tabular modeling paradigms and re-evaluate data processing strategies for tabular prediction.

### Weaknesses
1. Evaluation:
Given the vastness of the training data, with 13B samples spanning 303 diverse domains, the evaluation datasets chosen seem somewhat narrow in scope. The comprehensive variety of training domains calls for an equivalently diverse evaluation to genuinely test the model's versatility and adaptability. Authors should consider widening their evaluation scope by leveraging an even more diverse array of tabular datasets.

2. Results:
While Table 3 does indicate that UniTabE marginally outperforms other baselines, the incremental gain appears to be disproportionate to the extensive computational overhead of the pre-training phase. It's noteworthy that the performance between a ground-up UniTabE (from scratch) and a pre-trained plus fine-tuned UniTabE are remarkably similar, prompting questions about the efficiency of the elaborate pre-training process.

3. Method:
The paper's tab unit processing technique, although novel in its implementation, seems to draw heavily from precedents like TransTab and FT-Transformer. Additionally, the supervised strategies, such as multi-cell masking and contrastive learning, bear significant resemblance to methodologies detailed in prior research.

### Questions
1. Table 3 Variants:
The descriptions of the three UniTabE variants presented in Table 3—namely scratch, +XGBOOST, and fine-tune—appear to be absent. Notably, UniTabE scratch seems to rival the performance of UniTabE fine-tune and even surpasses UniTabE+XGBOOST in many instances. Given that UniTabE has been exposed to 13B tabular samples, this outcome raises questions. What factors might account for this similarity in performance, especially between the scratch and fine-tuned versions? Moreover, would broadening the evaluation across a more diverse set of datasets provide deeper insights into the tangible benefits of UniTabE pre-training?

2. Llama2 13B Training:
Regarding Llama2's tabular prediction training, how exactly was the model trained to handle tabular data predictions?
