## Abstract
The study of rigid protein-protein docking plays an essential role in a variety of tasks such as drug design and protein engineering. Recently, several learning-based methods have been proposed for the task, exhibiting much faster docking speed than those computational methods. In this paper, we propose a novel learning-based method called ElliDock, which predicts an elliptic paraboloid to represent the protein-protein docking interface. To be specific, our model estimates elliptic paraboloid interfaces for the two input proteins respectively, and obtains the roto-translation transformation for docking by making two interfaces coincide. By its design, ElliDock is independently equivariant with respect to arbitrary rotations/translations of the proteins, which is an indispensable property to ensure the generalization of the docking process. Experimental evaluations show that ElliDock achieves the fastest inference time among all compared methods and is strongly competitive with current state-of-the-art learning-based models such as DiffDock-PP and Multimer particularly for antibody-antigen docking.

### Summary
This paper proposed a deep learning method called ElliDock on solving rigid proteins docking. Firstly, they use a pair of elliptic paraboloids to estimate docking interfaces and then use equivariant neural network to learn rotation and translation. The first part is interesting. They compared with classical docking method HDock and deep learning based methods, EquiDock, DiffDock-PP, multimer. Experimental results show some minor improvement on these old deep learning baselines and much worse than HDock. My major concern are: 1) they didn't compare with the latest method, 2) the setting is not realistic. see weaknesses i listed as follow.

### Strengths
- this paper predicted a pair of elliptical paraboloids as two proteins' binding interfaces. This idea is interesting.

- this method compared both classical docking method, e.g., HDock and deep-learning based docking method, e.g., EquiDock, Multimer.

- it's glade to see experimental comparison on both general protein complex and antibody-antigen complexes. The last one is important in the field of drug design.

### Weaknesses
 - so small font size in figures, for example, Figure 1.

- the improvement is minor on DB5.5 when comparing with EquiDock and DiffDock-PP and much worse than Multimer and HDock.

- [1] and [2] are stronger baselines on solving antibody-antigen complex.

- This paper claims ElliDock solves steric clashes well. I guess one reason is this experiment uses native unbound structure as the input. There is a trade-off between steric clashes and dockq if you use predicted structures. When using predicted structures, there is no perfect pocket to fit ligand on receptor.


### Questions
- HDock performs much better than ElliDock. I guess the major reason is the input rigid structure is native unbounded structure. However, using native unbound structure as docking method's input is not realistic. What's the performance if you dock predicted structures.

- the pair of elliptical paraboloids are with the same shape. How to handle large protein or samll proteins?

### Summary
This paper proposes a rigid protein-protein docking model, ElliDock, that functions by predicting a pair of paraboloids on the ligand and receptor with the same shape and aligning them via roto-translation such that they coincide. The paper's main competitors are EquiDock, DiffDock-PP, and AlphaFold-Multimer, all of which rely on different methods. ElliDock outperforms all of these models in terms of inference time. It outperforms EquiDock and DiffDock-PP on the DB5.5 dataset, and all models on the SAbDab dataset.

### Strengths
1. The is high-quality and presented very well.
2. The argument as to why EquiDock suffers compared to ElliDock is developed well.
3. The method paraboloid matching in the context of protein-protein docking is seemingly novel and mathematically developed very well in the paper.
4. The results are convincing.

### Weaknesses
1. The paraboloid formulation is elegant, but I would like to see some discussion as to why this is the right choice compared to other considered options. Specifically, while the paper mentions that paraboloids allow for closed-form SE(3) transformations, it does not discuss the limitations of this choice. For instance, how well can a paraboloid approximate complex binding interfaces that may have concavities or multiple contact points? A more detailed discussion of the trade-offs between the simplicity of the paraboloid and its ability to model diverse interfaces is needed.
2. The argument of why ElliDock's formulation is better than EquiDock seems to be developed sufficiently well, but I would like to see some more discussion contrasting with DiffDock-PP and AlphaFold-Multimer. The paper highlights the computational efficiency of ElliDock compared to DiffDock-PP, but it does not delve into the specific architectural differences that lead to these performance gaps. A more detailed analysis of the computational bottlenecks in DiffDock-PP and how ElliDock avoids them would be beneficial. Similarly, a discussion of the fundamental differences in the problem formulation between ElliDock (rigid docking) and AlphaFold-Multimer (structure prediction) would help clarify why ElliDock is more suitable for this specific task.

### Questions
1. The inference time is reported in Table 1, but not in Table 2. Could you please report the values for Table 2?
2. Could you please report the inference time in Table 3. It would be interesting to see which losses could be removed for even more speed-up, but without accuracy loss.
3. Since DiffDock-PP is a diffusion-based model it is capable of modelling multiple conformations. How does ElliDock fare when the ligand-protein pair has multiple possible conformations?
4. Could you argue a bit about why ElliDock's training objective is more suitable than DiffDock-PP's?
5. Why do you think ElliDock outperforms AlphaFold-Multimer on SAbDab?

### Summary
The paper introduces a novel supervised learning approach for protein docking, focusing on predicting the interface between ligand and receptor proteins in the form of an elliptic-paraboloid. This method operates under the assumption that the true docked pockets are precisely situated along our predicted interface. The primary aim of this learning process is to identify elliptic-paraboloids that align with these ground-truth docked pockets. This objective is complemented by additional constraints, such as the loss associated with elliptic-paraboloid overlap, which ensures spatial separation of protein pairs at the interface, and the standard dock loss, quantifying the difference between predicted and ground-truth rotation and translation matrices.

The authors illustrate that the key advantage of this method lies in its efficiency during inference. Once the elliptic-paraboloid interface is predicted, it enables the efficient calculation of docking poses. Furthermore, this proposed method exhibits equivariance to arbitrary rotations and translations of the proteins, a crucial feature ensuring the generalization of the docking process.

To evaluate the performance of their approach, the authors conducted experiments using two specific benchmark datasets: "Docking benchmark version 5" and "The Structural Antibody Database." They compared their method to four baseline machine learning-based docking techniques: HDock (pretrained), Multimer (pretrained), EquiDock (trained from scratch), and DiffDock-PP (trained from scratch).

In the first benchmark dataset, the authors demonstrated that their ElliDock outperforms most of the baseline methods in terms of docking accuracy while achieving a significant reduction in inference time, with the exception of the pretrained model.

In the second benchmark dataset, the authors showed that ElliDock outperforms most of the baseline methods, except for HDock. The authors noted that HDock's superior performance may be attributed to the possibility of data leakage. They further conducted an ablation study to highlight the importance and effectiveness of each training objective function introduced in the ElliDock method.

### Strengths
The concept of streamlining the learning process through the introduction of an inductive bias that transforms a complex docking learning problem into the prediction of coinciding elliptic-paraboloids is truly interesting.

The experimental findings are particularly compelling, notably the notable enhancements in terms of inference efficiency. The experiments were conducted with great attention to detail, involving thorough comparisons with state-of-the-art machine learning-based docking methods.

The paper was thoughtfully composed, and it's commendable that the source code is available as open-source, making it accessible for others to explore and implement.

### Weaknesses
Challenging the assumption that elliptic-paraboloids precisely correspond to ground-truth docked pockets is a substantial step. To validate this assumption, it would be beneficial for the authors to consider conducting experiments using an established docking database, providing empirical evidence regarding the validity of this premise.

The results in comparison to models trained from scratch are indeed remarkable. While the authors suggest that the success of baseline models like HDock may be due to potential data leakage, it can be exceptionally challenging to definitively prove such claims. More compelling evidence supporting the presence of leakage in HDock would be valuable.

The authors demonstrate a significant improvement in inference time for their method compared to baseline approaches, yet the exact source of this efficiency enhancement remains somewhat unclear. An in-depth complexity analysis would be helpful in shedding light on the reasons behind this improvement. Typically, if a method directly predicts rotation and translation matrices, inference time should be as swift as the execution of these operations.

In addition to comparisons with machine learning-based docking methods, it would be beneficial to provide an overview of results in comparison to well-established docking methods that do not rely on machine learning techniques.

Furthermore, sharing the splits of the second benchmark dataset used in your experiments would be advantageous, as it would enable others to replicate the results more easily and conduct experiments with the same splits in the future. This transparency promotes reproducibility in the research community.

### Questions
Would you kindly offer substantiating evidence or theoretical findings to validate the assumption that elliptic-paraboloids accurately align with the ground-truth docked pockets?

    Could you furnish more compelling evidence to substantiate the assertion of potential data leakage in HDock, as stated in the paper?

    Can you provide a more comprehensive explanation regarding the reasons behind the improved inference time compared to other methods?

    Could you consider releasing the splits of the second dataset utilized in your experiments to facilitate reproducibility efforts within the research community?

### Summary
The paper studies the problem of rigid-body protein-protein docking, which is important for drug design and protein engineering. The proposed method, ElliDock, models the protein-protein docking interface using an elliptic paraboloid approximation. By aligning the interfaces of two unbound proteins, ElliDock ensures roto-translation equivariance. The experimental results show the method outperforms other deep learning-based methods and achieves the fastest inference speed.

### Strengths
1. The paper addresses a significant real-world problem and offers a comprehensive discussion of the related work, to the best of my understanding.
2. The idea of using an elliptic paraboloid to approximate the docking interface is interesting. This paper thoroughly discusses the advantages of this paraboloid-centric method over previous point cloud registration techniques. Furthermore, the introduction of various loss terms to derive meaningful interfaces improves the rationale behind the proposed method.

### Weaknesses
1. The major concern about the method lies in the comparison with traditional template-based methods, e.g., HDOCK. As shown in Tables 1&2, HDOCK outperforms other methods by a significant margin, suggesting it may already effectively address the rigid-body docking challenge. Although the ElliDock’s inference speed is much faster than HDOCK, its performance is unsatisfactory. Given real-world applications, the value of faster inference time seems negligible, especially if the docking challenge doesn't necessitate high-throughput situations. Please correct me if I’m wrong.
2. Despite the considerable depth in the methods section discussing the rationale and procedure of using an elliptic paraboloid for approximation, it remains unclear how this looks like on real-world data. It would be good if there are some visualization experiments showing the learned paraboloid interfaces.
3. The paper's notations appear cluttered and confusing. For example, iEq.(8) denotes the other protein as $H_{-p}$, which is unconventional. In Eq. (12), the FC layer maps representation to $4$-dim without explanation. Meanwhile, Eq. (13) introduces the hyperparameter $M$ without elaboration. The bracket notation further complicates understanding. For better clarity, consider excluding the $p$, since most operations apply similarly to both proteins, and employ subscript notation for indexing.
4. A deeper exploration and connection with surface-based methodologies, such as MaSIF, would be beneficial. It would be insightful to include a comparison with it in the benchmarking section.

### Questions
1. In Eqs. (3)(4), the coefficient $\alpha_{j\to i}$ appears to merely normalize the inner product of $q$ and $k$, without taking into account the keys from other edges. This approach seems to limit the attention mechanism's capacity to capture interactions among edges or nodes. Given this, wouldn't it be more straightforward to directly map the message $m_{j\to i}$ to a scalar coefficient $\alpha_{j\to i}$?
2. In Sec. 4.3, there's a mention that pre-trained models like HDOCK could be prone to data leakage issues. From my understanding, HDOCK functions as a template-based model and doesn't utilize learning in its scoring function. Could you provide a more detailed explanation regarding the concerns of data leakage?
3. In Eq. (12), while $F_p$ is identified as a 4-dimensional vector, its fourth element seems not to be used in the main paper.

Overall, I appreciate the method introduced to address the rigid-body docking problem. I’m willing to raise my score if all the concerns listed in the Weakness section can be addressed during rebuttal.
