## Abstract
General purpose agents will require large repertoires of skills.  Empowerment---the maximum mutual information between skills and states---provides a pathway for learning large collections of distinct skills, but mutual information is difficult to optimize.  We introduce a new framework, \textit{Hierarchical Empowerment}, that makes computing empowerment more tractable by integrating concepts from Goal-Conditioned Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning.  Our framework makes two specific contributions.  First, we introduce a new variational lower bound on mutual information that can be used to compute empowerment over short horizons.  Second, we introduce a hierarchical architecture for computing empowerment over exponentially longer time scales.  We verify the contributions of the framework in a series of simulated robotics tasks.  In a popular ant navigation domain, our four level agents are able to learn skills that cover a surface area over two orders of magnitude larger than prior work.

### Summary
This paper relates to the skill discovery problem of a reinforcement learning agent, which is an important topic in the domain. The authors follow the "Empowerment" approach, which maximizes the mutual information between skills and states, to enable an agent to acquire a diverse set of skills. The authors propose a new variational lower bound derived from the goal-conditioned policy formation, in order to make the mutual information optimization tractable. Successively, when expanding to long-horizontal tasks, the authors introduced a hierarchical approach.

Evaluations are done in a specially hand-modified simulation environment based on (Ant, Half Cheetah). The authors provide justifications for the selection of evaluation domains.

### Strengths
- Well-written backgrounds and motivations.
- Well-developed methodology: The reviewers find the methodology development of the paper easy to follow in Sections 2 and 3. 
- The reduction of the second term in Eq.(2) to a goal-conditioned objective (Eq. (3) is novel to me and very easy to follow.

### Weaknesses
 - The reviewer views the contribution of introducing goal-conditioned MDP formation as not novel, nor brings significant performance improvement, due to the two reasons.
(1) As a follow-up work of computing the Empowerment loss term, the key challenge is i) high-dimensional state-action space, and ii) without access to the environment's dynamic model. However, after examining the proposed method, the above two key challenges are not well addressed. Specifically, the method does not propose any mechanism to handle the curse of dimensionality in the state-action space, nor does it offer a way to learn the dynamics model or circumvent the need for it. The reliance on sampling from the environment remains, which is a common limitation in many RL algorithms.
(2) instead, the authors propose a goal-conditioned policy formation, that makes the mutual information term an alternating optimization between goal-space policies and goal-conditioned policies, which seems reasonable to me, but the contribution is not significant. This alternating optimization, while a practical approach, does not introduce a fundamentally new way to tackle the core problem of efficient skill discovery. The method essentially reformulates the problem into a goal-conditioned setting, which is a common practice, and does not offer a novel solution to the underlying challenges of empowerment maximization.
- The reviewer found it hard to justify the effectiveness of the proposed method, due to the following issue.
(1) Only the Ant Field-small and Half-cheetah-small simulation tasks are evaluated against three baselines. If results on more complex tasks can be provided, the soundness of the method will be improved. The limited evaluation scope raises concerns about the generalizability of the proposed approach. The absence of results on more challenging and diverse environments makes it difficult to assess the true potential and robustness of the method. The current evaluation does not adequately demonstrate the method's ability to scale to more complex scenarios.

### Questions
Could the authors explain why the error bars in Fig. 3 and 4 have a large deviation?

### Summary
This paper considers the problem of maximizing empowerment for agents with a large set of skills which is challenging as the objective function is difficult to optimize. This paper firstly proposed a new variational lower bound objective for Goal-conditioned empowerment  that does not require handcrafted goal space in advance. Instead of a fixed goal space distribution,  the proposed new MI variational lower bound within goal-conditioned empowerment model the goal distribution with  parameterized uniform distribution.  Secondly, this paper proposes a hierarchical architecture for scaling the proposed Goal-conditioned empowerment to a longer time horizon. Through simulated robotic navigation tasks, the proposed framework outperforms the baselines.

### Strengths
The proposed hierarchical framework handle the long time horizon problem naturally with a well pre-designed hierarchical structure. By parameterizing the goal space distribution, the proposed method can learn the parameters for goal space distribution and goal-conditioned policy at the same time. The proposed method is valid and novel. This paper presents sufficient empirical evidence and simulations that validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

### Weaknesses
1. The proposed hierarchical framework highly depends on designer's implementation which need strong expert knowledge. It won't be a scalable solution in general for long-time horizon RL tasks. 
2. While the experiment setup can show the effectiveness of the proposed method, there remains a scope of further demonstration in more complex environments.

### Questions
The authors did not provide enough discussion on how to decide on k and how to design the structure. It will be great if the authors can provide explanations and more insight on this.

### Summary
The paper introduces a new framework, Hierarchical Empowerment, as a new method for calculating empowerment, or the mutual information between skills and states. The framework propose to use an objective from goal-conditioned RL as a variational lower bound on the empowerment objective. The paper also propose to define hierarchies at multiple levels (instead of the usual two-level hierarchy) as a way to address exploration and credit assignment. The authors evaluate their method on the Brax simulator using Ant and Half Cheetah, with and without barriers. Some qualitative results are also presented.

### Strengths
* The authors go beyond the standard two-level hierarchy that is typically used in HRL
* The paper tries to provide a new solution for maximizing empowerment, which is known to be difficult to optimize
* The paper introduces more compositional versions of the base Ant and Half Cheetah environments. Such compositionality is key for HRL to be succesful.

Maximizing the mutual information between states and skills has been the core of a long series of paper. In spirit the objective is intuitive, but it rarely leads to diverse skill unless stronger assumptions are made. This has been recently shown very well in [1].

Most of recent work in HRL only leverages a two-level hierarchy, from this perspective the paper investigate a setting that is rarely investigated.

### Weaknesses
 * The baselines presented are outdated. Moreover the quantitative results show results for only 4 seeds
* The presentation of the paper could be greatly improved. Some sections feel unnecessary and some claims do not seem correct
* The qualitative evaluation does not show any in-depth analysis

The paper compares to baselines that are from a few iterations of research ago. There have been recent advances in maximizing empowerment. Moreover, the general evaluation is too narrow: it only focuses on empowerment-based HRL methods. [2] has recently establishes a new state-of-the-art across many domains, where it greatly improves upon empowerment-based methods. Without such baselines it is impossible to evaluate the merit of the method.

The presentation of the paper could be improved: for example, what is the role of section 2.2? Is it absolutely necessary for understanding the contributions? If not it should go in the appendix. More central to the method itself, the paper claims that a new objective is derived for empowerment. However equation (3) is essentially the same objective that we have seen across the literature on empowerment-based methods. It seems like the only difference is the way the variational distribution q is parametrized. In itself this is not a bad thing, but coupled with strong claims that "it explicitly encourages skills to target specific states" and that the objective itself is "new" does not help the paper's quality.

Moreover, despite claims that the method learns larger spaces and diverse skills, the qualitative evaluation is very limited, for example Figure 5 of Section B. Much more work is needed in order to convince the reader that this is indeed the case.

### Questions
One of the contributions of the method is to learn multiple levels of hierarchy (this was investigated [3] but the paper is not cited), however there are no experiments that separate the effect of the objective for empowerment with the multiple levels. Which one provides the gains?

"The benchmarks either (i) do not provide access to a model of the transition dynamics" Why is the model of the transition dynamics needed?

"The entropy term H ϕ(Z | s 0) encourages the goal space policy µ ϕto output larger goal spaces." This surely can't be right, as the goal space is predefined. Perhaps the authors mean that the distribution of generated goals will cover more space?

"q(· | s_0, s_n) is a diagonal Gaussian distribution with mean s_n and a fixed standard deviation s_0 set by the designer." What happens when the states are pixels?

"skills are an instance of noisy channels from Information Theory" This seems a bit strong, perhaps it can be interpreted but it doesn't not have to be an instance of something else.

"hand-crafted goal space may only achieve a loose lower bound on empowerment" Little justification for this is given.

### Summary
This paper tackles hierarchical goal-conditioned RL through the lens of empowerment. The main contributions are twofold: (1) a novel objective to jointly train a goal proposal distribution and a goal-reaching policy based on empowerment with a reparameterization trick and (2) a hierarchical architecture that combines multiple goal-reaching policies in a hierarchical manner. The authors evaluate their method in several Ant/HalfCheetah goal-reaching tasks, showing that their hierarchical architecture enables long-horizon goal reaching.

### Strengths
- The reparameterized variational (goal) empowerment objective in Eq. (7) seems novel and intriguing.
- The proposed hierarchical structure does expand the area of reachable goals.

### Weaknesses
## Weaknesses
- One major weakness of the proposed approach is that it assumes that the goal distribution $p_\phi(z|s_0)$ is a uniform distribution over a *box*. This significantly limits the scalability of the method, because the set of feasible goals can form an arbitrary shape even in simple environments (e.g., mazes). For instance, in a maze environment, the reachable goals might be constrained to a narrow corridor, making a uniform box distribution highly inefficient and potentially leading to the proposal of many unreachable goals.

- Another major weakness of this work is its limited empirical evaluation. For me, the proposed method is much closer to previous unsupervised GCRL methods (e.g., Skew-Fit, EDL, LEXA, etc.) than empowerment-based methods (e.g., DIAYN, DADS, HIDIO, etc.) given that (1) the latter uses a separate latent skill space $Z$ that is not "grounded" to the state space and (2) the former has the two-stage structure of goal proposal and goal reaching, similarly to the proposed approach. The two-stage structure of goal proposal and goal reaching, along with the grounding of the latent skill space to the state space, makes this method fundamentally different from methods like DIAYN, DADS, and HIDIO. However, the authors only compare their method with empowerment-based approaches, which have already been known to struggle to reach distant goals (as shown in multiple prior works, such as EDL and LSD). I believe comparisons with unsupervised GCRL methods are necessary to assess the effectiveness of this method, especially regarding the claim of improved goal-reaching capabilities.

- Moreover, the experiments are only conducted in Ant and HalfCheetah environments with $x$-$y$ goal spaces without obstacles. It is unclear how the proposed method performs in more complex environments (e.g., AntMaze) or other types of environments (e.g., Fetch manipulation environments), both of which are standard benchmarks for goal-conditioned RL. The lack of evaluation in more complex scenarios raises concerns about the method's general applicability.

- The proposed method seems to assume access to the ground-truth transition dynamics function, which prevents its applicability to general environments. Specifically, the use of a model to generate transitions for both goal-conditioned and goal-space policies suggests a reliance on perfect environment knowledge, which is often unavailable in real-world scenarios.

- In terms of writing, I feel Section 3.1 is not sufficiently clear. Please see my questions below.

## Minor issues
- "The major problem with using empowerment for skill learning is that mutual information is difficult to optimize.": Do the authors have any supporting evidence for this claim? It would be beneficial to cite relevant literature or provide a brief explanation of the challenges associated with optimizing mutual information in this context.

- In Equations (4)-(5), I would suggest using $I^{GCE}(Z; S_n|s_0)$ to denote the mutual information (not its variational bound) and replacing "$=$" in Equation (5) with "$\geq$", following the convention.

- "However, the existing empowerment-based skill-learning approaches that learn the variational distribution $q_\psi(z | s_0, s_n)$ also require a model in large domains to obtain unbiased gradients of the maximum likelihood objective.": I'm not sure if this can justify the second limitation because (1) albeit biased, previous empowerment-based approaches can still work without a model and (2) we can relabel $z$ as in P-HER to make it (much) less biased with respect to the current skill discriminator. In this regard, I think "First, similar to other empowerment-based skill-learning methods, our framework assumes the agent has access to a model of the environment’s transition dynamics." is a bit misleading. The statement is misleading because it implies that the model requirement is a common limitation, while in fact, the proposed method's reliance on the model for generating transitions for both goal-conditioned and goal-space policies is a more stringent requirement than in previous approaches.

- I would suggest using a higher-resolution image (or a vectorized pdf file) for Figure 3.

### Questions
- I found Sec 3.1 to be a bit confusing. Specific questions:
    - What is $g$? Is it just an affine function?
    - Is $h$ a learnable function, or just a projection to the goal space?
    - "instead of sampling the skill z from the fixed variational distribution": Why do we need to sample $z$ from the variational distribution? Isn't $z$ deterministically determined by $\epsilon$ and $\mu_\phi(s_0)$?
- Where exactly does the proposed method use the ground-truth dynamics model? Is it required only for training higher-level policies, or is it used by the low-level policy as well?
- The authors argue that the proposed method can reach much more distant goals (800x800) than DADS (30x30). However, I'm not sure if this is an apples-to-apples comparison given that (1) their environments are different (MuJoCo vs Brax), and (2) their episode lengths may be (very) different. What is the maximum episode length used in this paper?
