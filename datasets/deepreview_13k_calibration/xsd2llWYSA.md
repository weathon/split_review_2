## Abstract
Motion trajectories offer reliable references for physics-based motion learning but suffer from sparsity, particularly in regions that lack sufficient data coverage.
To address this challenge, we introduce a self-supervised, structured representation and generation method that extracts spatial-temporal relationships in periodic or quasi-periodic motions.
The motion dynamics in a continuously parameterized latent space enable our method to enhance the interpolation and generalization capabilities of motion learning algorithms.
The motion learning controller, informed by the motion parameterization, operates online tracking of a wide range of motions, including targets unseen during training.
With a fallback mechanism, the controller dynamically adapts its tracking strategy and automatically resorts to safe action execution when a potentially risky target is proposed.
By leveraging the identified spatial-temporal structure, our work opens new possibilities for future advancements in general motion representation and learning algorithms.

### Summary
This paper introduces a latent dynamics model and control policy to track periodic and quasi-periodic functions. The paper extends a PAE network (Starke 2022), which encodes a motion trajectory into a latent embedding used to generate a set of fourier coefficients. These coefficients are used to build a dynamics model assuming constant frequency, amplitude and offset, but time varying phase. The dynamics model predicts a future latent, which is decoded to produce a resultant motion. Control policies are also trained to generate frequency parameters that result in motion sequences that match some desired trajectory. A fallback mechanism compares the desired trajectory to the generated trajectory, and decides whether this is safe to follow (if both are similar), following a more conservative predicted motion if this is deemed unsafe.

### Strengths
The latent dynamics model proposed seems of value to a broad class of periodic/ quasi periodic motions, and nicely extents the periodic autoencoder architecture (PAE - Starke 2022) to the motion generation use case.

The proposed approach allows for a natural fallback mechanism (detection of infeasible target motions, and fallback to sensible behaviours that lie within the training set.)

The proposed model produces expressive motions with a more compact trajectory representation than prior work.

The paper is very extensive, with a number of interesting ablations and visualisations.

### Weaknesses
The motion learning/ control policy part of this work needs a clearer problem formulation. It is unclear what the exact goal is here, and a lot is left to the readers to infer. I gather the goal is to learn to generate a series of motions that track a desired motion sequence, using the motion prediction, but it is unclear to me why you need to generate control parameters to do so, instead of just encoding the target motions directly.  A clearer problem description will help avoid confusion like this.

Much of the interesting work around control policies is in the appendices

Missing related work:

This work appears closely related to a phase functioned neural network Holden et al. Phase-Functioned Neural Networks for Character Control, which computes network weights using a cyclic function controlled by phase. The proposed approach uses an autoencoder and has clear differences (PFNN does next state prediction), but the core idea is similar and PFNN also considers aspects like motion blending etc. The paper is mentioned in passing in the introduction, but I would recommend some discussion on this in the related work given the similarity in the core idea.

Minor:

The term Generative Latent Dynamics is rather general, and not particularly descriptive of the proposed approach.

The paper is extensive, with a number of detailed appendices. This is good, but I found references to appendix figures in the main text body rather distracting.

Assumption 1. I think it is worth pointing out earlier that since the latent space is learned, this can be enforced. 

5. Experiments - These experiments are motivated in terms of real world applicability to real robots, but character animation is not robot control, and this statement should be used with caution.

### Questions
Figure 5 is confusing, I assume the right y axis is an error metric? Please label axis and caption to indicate these measures.

Fig S7 - this is used to motivate fixing frequency amplitude and bias, could you provide more detail on the motion encoded in this example? It seems that this would be motion dependent.

### Summary
In this paper, authors tackle the problem of motion representation. Inspired by prior work that takes into account periodicity of motion, the proposed method extends the periodic autoencoder to add a generative capability. Based on the insight that some elements do not change during periodic motions, the paper propose GLD, where subsequent latent representation is trained to be predicted, assuming phase can be advanced incrementally. Using the trained network, the method proposes to train to learn policies that aligns the predicted state and the state of the observation. Then during inference, the authors propose to filter out potentially dangerous or difficult states using a fallback mechanism. They compare the difference between the designated state and the actual predicted states, and if the error is significant, they propose to reject the designated state and fall back to the predicted state. The authors conduct various experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of the actual latent space, as well as the proposed fallback mechanism.

### Strengths
- The proposal to extend the phase autoencoder mechanism to predict the future state, based on the observation that some elements remain consistent throughout certain periodic motion, is very cleverly devised. The observation is used effectively to predict the upcoming $N$ segments, which can be seen from the prediction experiments conducted in Fig. 5. 

- The demonstrations in the supplementary material demonstrates that the fallback mechanism is effective at preventing undesired motion, and maintain the status quo as much as possible.

- The authors applied the proposal to various tasks including motion tracking and motion transition. In both tasks, the proposed prediction method is able to interpolate between motions even when the fallback mechanism is triggered.

### Weaknesses
 - The authors should make better effort to make the paper self-contained in the main manuscript, and not rely excessively on the supplementary material. There is a severe lack of details in the main manuscript, due to the authors moving them to the supplementary material. For example,
1. One form of the skill sampler should be included in the main section. 
2. $\mathcal{U}$ in Fig.2 is unclear from the main section.
3. Section 5.4 seems unnecessary, as all the content is in the supplementary material.

- The figures seem unorganized, as the readers are asked to refer to figures in a random order, including the supplementary material. The colored lines in Figures 5 and 6 is unclear. There should be some sort of explanation of each element in all the figures.

- Despite the comparison of the actual latent space, the reconstruction accuracy seems to be missing. As I presume that the reconstruction accuracy falls as the prediction segment horizon $N$ increases, the authors should discuss the trade-off in comparison to existing methods. 

- The effectiveness of the fallback mechanism must be discussed more quantitatively. The authors only discuss the results in Section 5.3, but there is no concrete evidence that the mechanism worked well. There should be some statistics regarding if the motion prediction actually failed when the fallback mechanism was not introduced. Such objective evidence is lacking for the readers to decide whether it is effective or not.

### Questions
- What happens when no fallback strategy is employed? How are the resulting motions look with and without the fallback mechanism? Some comparison would be desirable.

- Was there any drawback from introducing the assumption that some elements are generally constant throughout a sequence? Were there actions that did not present these characteristics?

- Also, the action classes indicated by the colors in Fig.5 seems to be missing, making the evaluation of these latent spaces difficult. What do each color respond to?

### Summary
This paper presents GLD (Generative Latent Dynamics), a novel self-supervised representation and generation method that captures spatial-temporal relationships in periodic or quasi-periodic motions. GLD improves motion learning by incorporating motion dynamics into a parameterized latent space. The method tracks a wide range of motions, including unseen targets, and adapts to potentially risky targets. Furthermore, the paper presents experimental evidence (on the MIT Humanoid robot) showcasing GLD's effectiveness and long-term learning capabilities in open-ended motion learning tasks.  Additionally, the supplementary experiments demonstrate that GLD possesses long-term learning capabilities, which allow learning agents to strategically progress novel target motions while avoiding unlearnable regions.

The main contributions of this paper are:
1. GLD (Generative Latent Dynamics) is a new method that extracts spatial-temporal relationships in periodic or quasi-periodic motions. It uses a novel self-supervised, structured representation and generation approach.
2. GLD has demonstrated its effectiveness in open-ended motion learning tasks. It has long-term learning capabilities that enable learning agents to strategically advance novel target motions while avoiding unlearnable regions.
3. An online tracking framework powered by GLD has a fallback mechanism. This enables learning agents to dynamically adapt their tracking strategies and automatically identify and respond to potentially risky targets.
4. Recognition of spatial-temporal structures creates new possibilities for future motion representation and learning algorithms.
