## Abstract
Zero-shot cross-lingual transfer utilizing multilingual LLMs has become a popular learning paradigm for low-resource languages with no labeled training data. However, for NLP tasks that involve fine-grained predictions on words and phrases, the performance of zero-shot cross-lingual transfer learning lags far behind supervised fine-tuning methods. Therefore, it is common to exploit translation and label projection to further improve the performance by (1) translating training data that is available in a high-resource language (e.g., English) together with the gold labels into low-resource languages, and/or (2) translating test data in low-resource languages to a high-source language to run inference on, then projecting the predicted span-level labels back onto the original test data. However, state-of-the-art marker-based label projection methods suffer from translation quality degradation due to the extra label markers injected in the input to the translation model. In this work, we explore a new direction that leverages constrained decoding for label projection to overcome the aforementioned issues. Our new method not only can preserve the quality of translated texts but also has the versatility of being applicable to both translating training and translating test data strategies. This versatility is crucial as our experiments reveal that translating test data can lead to a considerable boost in performance compared to translating only training data. We evaluate on two cross-lingual transfer tasks, namely Named Entity Recognition and Event Argument Extraction, spanning 20 languages.

### Summary
=== AFTER THE RESPONSE ===
I would like to thank the authors for taking the time to provide a very detailed response which clarified my main concerns and extra questions. I still think that the method could have been evaluated on a larger selection of tasks, but this doesn't invalidate the soundness of the proposed methodology, and I'm happy to increase my score
===========================

This paper targets cross-lingual transfer for sequence labeling task, where the main problem in previous work has been projecting labeled spans from the source language to the correct spans in the target language, a problem sometimes referred to as the labeled span mismatch. Previous work typically solved this problem via two different approaches: 1) using external word aligners to do the label projection from source to target, or 2) inserting marker tokens directly into the input of a strong (N)MT system and basically conducting a standard translate-train approach (but with those extra markers). However, both prior approaches have issues as the former critically relies on the quality of the external word aligner, while the latter yields to degraded MT performance (due to the insertion of markers).

This paper basically proposes an extension to the latter approach, aiming to preserve the original quality of the MT system by bypassing the direct insertion of markers, and proposes a two-step approach where in Step 1) the original text can be translated (via translate-train or translate-test), and in Step 2) projection is added via constrained decoding, keeping the translation from Step 1 as a fixed template. The main technical contribution is then a computationally feasible technique for the constrained decoding, bypassing the need to conduct exhaustive brute force search while maintaining strong performance. The separation of the translation and marker insertion steps also allows the approach to be applied to the translate-test setting, and the results confirm the usefulness of the technique.

### Strengths
- The paper clearly defines the problem, which is very concrete, and sets out to solve the problem following a clear line of thinking: from the conceptual level all the way to low-level technical execution aiming to improve the performance-versus-efficiency trade-off.
- The idea of constrained decoding which fixes the entire sentence (instead of focusing only on lexical constraints during constraints) is quite new (at least to the best of my knowledge) and could have applications beyond cross-lingual transfer tasks discussed in this work.
- The paper is well written and it is easy to link the main hypotheses to the concrete experiments and analyses. The core section of the paper on "constrained decoding" is also nicely described and easy to follow.
- The results on the two tasks seem to support the main claims although the paper requires more experiments (see also under weaknesses).

### Weaknesses
 - The main issue with the work is 1) the lack of recognition of other (recent and less recent) work on the same problem of cross-lingual label projection, which consequently leads to the 2) lack of more comprehensive comparisons to more baselines. The main baseline is definitely the EasyProject method and I agree with that, but I feel that not enough care has been provided to optimise the word alignment-based baselines which also shows reasonable performance, and is quite competitive in the EAE task.
-- For instance, there has been some recent work on alignment correction for label projection (https://aclanthology.org/2023.law-1.24.pdf), and there are also other very relevant papers which should be cited and discussed (and ideally even compared against): https://aclanthology.org/2021.findings-acl.396.pdf or https://d-nb.info/1203127499/34, 
-- The number of evaluation tasks is slightly underwhelming and the paper should extend the scope of tasks to other sequence labeling tasks (e.g., slot labeling in dialogue, dependeny parsing or semantic role labeling) - NER with only 3 NE classes is a (relatively) simple task (from the perspective of its experimental setup), and the paper would have more impact with a wider experimental setup.
-- I would also like to see a wider exploration of different MT systems and chosen encoder-decoder models and their impact on the performance of both alignment-based approaches as well as EasyProject and CODEC. For instance, how would larger variants of NLLB affect the performance? Would the scale of the NMT system recover for its deficiencies?

### Questions
A similar two-step idea, but which is not MT-based but encoder-based has been investigated here: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.13528.pdf (the idea there is slightly different and is based on classification - in the first step, the system just decides whether something should be a labeled span or not; in the second step, the actual label is added to each span detected as 'labeled span'. The paper should also discuss ideas like this one in related work and they seem highly relevant.

### Summary
This paper focuses on improving label projection for zero-shot cross-lingual transfer learning. They claim that existing label projection techniques cannot generate accurate translation and there for affect the downstream performance. They accordingly propose a constrained decoding to decide which positions to insert markers conditioned on a better translation template. Some heuristic tricks are presented to accelerate the search process. Experiments on NER and EAE show the potential of the proposed method.


==== After response ====
Given that the authors promise that they will make the description clearer and add the translate-test results for EAE, I consider increasing the score.

### Strengths
- The writing is clear.
- The proposed method performs well on two tasks.

### Weaknesses
 - The author say that inserting markers would degrade the translation quality. However, although they provide a translation template to guide the model during translation, the proposed method still relies on markers, which is not completely solving this issue. 
- When searching, they mention the assumption:
```
If we decode the translation template but conditioned on the marker sentence, at the position that needs to be inserted an opening marker, the model would give a high probability to this token, and thus assign a low probability to the token from the template.
```
This assumption largely relies the translation model’s ability to handle markers. Different translators may have different behaviors to handle the markers. I suggest the authors to report the results of different translators to show the stability of the proposed method.
- The proposed method is based on some heuristic. It would be great if the authors can provide some theoretical bound to justify the heuristic.
- It seems like that they follow the experimental setting of previous work (Chen et al. 2023a). However, they consider MasakhaNER 2.0 rather than WikiAnn (reported by Chen et al. 2023a) for NER without any explanation. Is it because that the proposed method works better for low-resource languages? I suggest to report the scores on WikiAnn as well for more comprehensive comparisons.
- I am a little bit confused by the reason for not considering translation-test for EAE. The authors mention that the English gold trigger is needed but not feasible. However, this can be obtained by applying the proposed constraint label project from the target language to English. It would be interesting to study more about this.

3: You are fairly confident in your assessment. It is possible that you did not understand some parts of the submission or that you are unfamiliar with some pieces of related work. Math/other details were not carefully checked.

### Summary
This work proposes a constrained-translation-based label projection method for the cross-lingual transfer of two mention extraction problems (named entity recognition and event argument extraction). Instead of directly translating marked sentences, the proposed the method adopts a two-stage approach: first translate the original source without markers, then perform constrained decoding with the marked source and the translation in the first pass. The decoding algorithm consists several interesting parts, including marker-position pruning, branch-and-bound searching and re-ranking. With evaluations on multiple target languages, the proposed method is shown to provide benefits over existing baselines.

### Strengths
- The paper is well-written and easy to follow.
- The proposed method is intuitive and effective.

### Weaknesses
 - The approach relies on an external MT system, whose performance may influence the effectiveness of the label projection. It would be nice if there can be an analysis on the influence of translation quality.
- In some cases, the proposed method does not perform well, for example, the NER results are worse for Chichewa and Kiswahili, and the EAE results seem close to the baselines. It would be much better if there can be more analysis on why these happen to provide some guidance on how to select the label-projection methods for a new language.

### Questions
- It would be nice to discuss and measure the efficiency of different methods, especially considering the extra stages of the proposed method. This can be important for “translate-test“, and maybe also for “translate-train” if the cost difference is too much.
- I’m wondering whether it would still be effective to replace the searching algorithm with some simpler alternatives, such as greedy pruning (like in a QA-MRC model). Since the problem itself is inserting a pair of markers, the output space is much smaller than the translation.
- For the event task, it seems that the event triggers are assumed already given? How about considering the full event structures? This might be straight-forward since only span-projection would be enough (it would also be very interesting to consider pairs of spans when projecting).

### Summary
This work describes CODEC, a method of generating instances of data in new languages with fine-grained labels transferred from high-resource languages (i.e., English) to low-resource languages (e.g., Bambara). This work intelligently identifies that prior methods such as EasyProject have the drawback of non-natural markers (e.g., BIO tokens) degrading translation quality. To counter this, CODEC instead uses an unconstrained translation as a template and proposes a constrained decoding algorithm to reconcile the template with the annotated input. 

This changes the formula of EN to BAM from:
```
EN -> add markers -> MT -> BAM + markers
```
to:
```
EN -> BAM,    EN -> add markers -> [EN+markers, BAM] -> MT w/ constrained decoding -> BAM + markers
```
This removes the issue of MT errors near annotation tokens and provides some reference to check approximate validity during CODEC. This work applies CODEC to both the translate-train and translate-test scenarios of cross-lingual transfer to identify that CODEC has benefits nearly everywhere we can use silver-standard data in cross-lingual transfer. Experiments on NER and event argument extraction identify how CODEC benefits cross-lingual transfer across a wide range of low-resource languages. Ablations and analysis across multiple languages are honest and interpretable in discussing where CODEC is beneficial and does not improve.

### Strengths
- This is a very original contribution with wide ranging impact to low-resource cross-lingual transfer. Provided a sufficiently user-friendly codebase, the contributions of CODEC to the field could be widespread. This work also provides a more holistic and thoughtful contribution to the problem than the concurrent https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.08943 . Overall, I think this paper absolutely should be accepted.

- The improvement in both translate-train and translate-test scenarios identify the method as a strong new idea with wide applicabiility. Provided _some_ MT capability, this work helps mitigate the cross-lingual transfer gap to languages with very little study. The work smartly focuses on this scenario (i.e., through MasakhaNER) to support that CODEC works in (approx) the lowest resource scenarios available in modern NLP. 

- Succintely describing a constrained decoding method is not easy and this work smartly describes the method visually and mathematically for excellent clarity of the contribution. The frank discussion of complexity and the heuristic approximations for tractability are also honest with tradeoffs discussed in detail to inform future practice.

### Weaknesses
 - [Minor]: the work could be stronger if this could also be extended to larger models (e.g., >1-5B) and the discussion of applicability on more architectures (enc-only, enc-dec and dec-only) could be more details. 

- [Minor]: the paper could also be improved with more comparison against zero-shot results from larger multilingual LLMs. This would be hard on the given 1 48GB GPU setup, but could strengthen the vailidity of the improvement using CODEC. In essence, asking if CODEC works on a larger scale would make the findings more universal.

- [Minor]: it would be enlightening to see CODEC across a benchmark such as XTREME-UP but this likely should be future work not included here.

### Questions
- Constrained decoding is also a large topic in semantic parsing and the authors could acknowledge work such as https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.05093

- The sentence "The intuition is that, if we decode the translation template but conditioned on the marker sentence, at the position that needs to be inserted an opening marker, the model would give a high probability to this token, and thus assign a low probability to the token from the template, as illus- trated in Figure 2 (Step 1)." is very long and hard to parse. Consider revising.

- Math format mistake in F2 caption, k -> $k$

- Consider a bulleted list at the end of the intro to make your contributions clearer.

- I think the introduction of Bambara as a language from Africa undersells the low resource importance. Consider a more quantitative phrasing such as "Bambara is a Manding language primarily from Mali with approximately 15 million speakers", using information from WALS and Ethnologue.
