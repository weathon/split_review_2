## Abstract
Multimodal large language models are typically trained in two stages: first pre-training on image-text pairs, and then fine-tuning using supervised vision-language instruction data.
Recent studies have shown that large language models can achieve satisfactory results even with a limited amount of high-quality instruction-following data.
In this paper, we introduce InstructionGPT-4, which is fine-tuned on a small dataset comprising only 200 examples, amounting to approximately 6\% of the instruction-following data used in the alignment dataset for MiniGPT-4~\cite{zhu2023minigpt}.
To achieve this, we first propose several metrics to access the quality of multimodal instruction data.
Based on these metrics, we present an effective and trainable data selector to automatically identify and filter low-quality vision-language data.
By employing this method, InstructionGPT-4 outperforms the original MiniGPT-4 on various evaluations.
Overall, our findings demonstrate that less but high-quality instruction tuning data is efficient in enabling multimodal large language models to generate better output.

### Summary
The authors performed a series of steps aimed to selecting training data for multimodal large langauge models (MLLMs). They first extracted freatures using a number of heuristics, such as CLIP score, length of the answer, and so on. After that, they cluster the data, train miniGPT-4 on each cluster, and test the results on VQA datasets to get "genuine quality labels". In the next step, they train a network to predict quality labels from the feature vectors. Finally, they recluster the data, and use the trained network to select the best data points. 

The authors compared against the original miniGPT and a random baseline for data selection. The selected 200 data points outperform both.

### Strengths
The paper achieves good results. 200 data points they selected did lead to performance improvements over the original miniGPT-4. 

The paper contains few grammatical errors. I thank the authors for proofreading the paper.

### Weaknesses
The most important weakness of the paper is the lack of baselines. Many data quality and data pruning metrics have been proposed over the years. The authors should consider comparing against Influence Functions, Data Shapley, HyDRA, Diverse Ensembles [1], prototypicality [2], etc. A random baseline is way too weak.

It is not clear how the propose method could scale or generalize to different datasets and models, as it is only tested on a single dataset and a single MLLM. It is also not clear why only four VQA datasets are selected to produce "genuine quality labels", whereas the model is evaluated on bigger benchmarks. 

The writing contains a number of vague descriptions and logic disconnects (see below and the questions). The authors seem to be in a habit of fancy word choices, which may be the result of some large language model. However, word choices, however literary, cannot compensate for logic issues. 

- Page 3: ... steer multimodal language models in learning to generate responses in a particular manner --> what manner is that?
- Page 4: .. can more completely cover the various aspects of multimodal data quality -> More than what? What exactly are the aspects of multimodal data quality?
- Page 4: In equation (1), the dimensionality reduction (DR) technique is written as P(f(x_image), g(x_response)). Does it mean that DR is performed on the concatenation of image features and text features?
- Page 5: I don't understand what is x in the unnumbered equations of Section 2.3. Is x a data point or a cluster? Btw, it's a good idea to number all equations, in case your reviewers want to refer to them. 
- Page 5: What features is the data selector F trained with? The text says "we concatenate these embeddings into a single composite embedding". If a data point has D-dimensional features, and a cluster contains K data points, do we have a KD-dimensional feature vector? If that's the case, how can we apply F on a single data point, as implied in the later part of Section 2.3?

### Questions
- How do you make sure K-means and spectral clustering return clusters of equal size?
- What is the purpose of reclustering the data points? Why not use the "genuine quality label" as the criterion for data selection?
- Why is length such an important feature? Although the feature is very simple, it alone achieves the third best result in the ablation study of Table 5, only inferior to CLIP and the whole feature set. Does this imply the data selection process is utilizing a shortcut feature overfitted to the test?

### Summary
The authors propose a method for automatically selecting high-quality diverse subsets of large multimodal instruction datasets. The method works by using a small network to learn the relationship between a set of indicator features and dataset quality (measured through loss on a validation set). Additionally, clustering is performed before data selection in order to ensure the selected dataset is diverse. The authors evaluate over a number of benchmarks and find that their model trained on only 200 examples outperforms a model trained on all available data (MiniGPT-4) and a model trained on 200 randomly chosen examples, showing the efficacy of their data selection method.

### Strengths
- The proposed data selection method is reasonable and the evaluation seems to indicate it is effective. The method itself is reasonably novel, not just adapting a text-only method for data selection to the multimodal space, but also improving on approaches such as InstructMining through additional steps.
- Having a more powerful model trained on less data, and a method for automatically selecting quality data, is interesting and useful for improving overall model performance and reducing the compute required to train quality models.
- The evaluation is reasonably extensive, covering both benchmarks and open-ended (GPT-4-based) evaluation.
- The authors ablate each aspect of their method (clustering, indicators, data selector) and justify each decision made. In particular, the ablations exploring the use of single indicators may be useful for future examining data quality.

### Weaknesses
 - As far as I can tell, results with the selected data are from single runs. I worry that when selecting a small number of examples, the variance of the results might be quite high. Seeing results over multiple random seeds with regards to the data selection (training and selection itself) would be useful. However, considering the variance over the random selection is not massive, I think it's clear the selection method is effective in most cases.
- The authors only explore one model/architecture, so it is unclear how well their method would apply to larger/different models. In particular, as models scale, they benefit less from instruction data, so it is unclear if the rules for selecting quality data derived from smaller models will transfer to larger models.
- The GPT-4 evaluation is performed over only 60 questions, which seems quite small. In particular, I worry that 60 questions is not enough to thoroughly test the model over a diverse set of queries that may expose gaps in performance due to the small number of examples seen in finetuning compared to a fully-finetuned model. This can be seen e.g. in Table 2, where InstructionGPT-4 performs significantly worse than MiniGPT-4 in commonsense reasoning and OCR tasks.

### Questions
- Why do you think there is a big drop in MME performance when moving from two layers to three layers in table 5?
- In Figure 3, it appears that MiniGPT outperforms IntructionGPT-4 in a smaller number of tasks, especially looking at the natural relation and object localisation task. Why do you think this is?
- It would be useful and interesting to see when using the data selection method becomes no better than random selection (if this happens) when increasing the number of data points selected (i.e. extending Figure 7 and adding a line for random data selection).

### Summary
This paper proposes a data selection method for finetuning Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), specifically for MiniGPT4 using the training dataset "cc_sbu_align". The authors evaluate the data quality by dividing the whole dataset into some subsets and evaluating the model performance on validation sets. A data selector is trained based on the obtained data quality as labels. The data selector is used to choose a small subset from the whole dataset for final MLLM finetuning. Specifically, 200 data samples are chosen from around 3k samples, and the resulting MLLM has comparable performance as the model finetuned with the whole dataset.

### Strengths
The main strength is that the authors managed to train an MLLM with fewer samples and obtained a comparable performance as using the whole dataset.

### Weaknesses
 - The authors did not demonstrate the generality of the method. There are many nuances in the method and the experiments are done on only one dataset "cc_sbu_align". It is unclear whether the method will work on another dataset or another MLLM.
- There are many systematic methods in the literature that do something similar to select a subset from a dataset based on the model performance on a validation set. A notable one is Meta-Weight-Net [1] based on meta learning. How does this InstructionGPT-4 compare with the Meta-Weight-Net?
- The method obtained slightly better scores than the MiniGPT4 for some scores, but it is partially weaker than MiniGPT4. Moreover, in the benchmarks MME and MMBench, MiniGPT4 is a weak baseline. The marginal improvement over MiniGPT4 is not convincing. 
- If the data selector $F$ takes a data sample as input (see questions below for this), then in the paper the authors actually assign the same label to every data sample in the same subset $D_i$, which does not make sense because the label is due to the contribution of the whole subset (the model performance after being trained on the subset).

### Questions
- What features of the data samples did the authors use for the clustering algorithms? Are the features flattened images or some extracted image features?
- The description in Section 2.3 is confusing. In the "Training" paragraph, it seems that the data selector $F$ maps from the feature of a __whole__ subset to a score, because the index $i$ is for the subsets and it seems to mean $y_i = F(e_i)$. But in the "Testing" paragraph, it seems that the data selector $F$ maps from the feature of a single data sample to a score. Can the authors clarify it?
- Why did the authors not simply use the quality scores to select a subset for finetuning the final MLLM? It seems that the training data and the testing data for the data selector are the same. What is the meaning of performing the testing if we already have the labels on the data?
- What is the relationship between the validation data used to generate the quality labels and the evaluation data? Why could the model performance on validation data be used as an indicator for model performance on the evaluation (test) data?

### Summary
This paper introduces InstructionGPT-4 which achieves better output with only 200 high-quality examples. The authors propose metrics and a trainable data selector to filter low-quality vision-language data. InstructionGPT-4 outperforms MiniGPT-4, showcasing the efficiency of using less but high-quality instruction data for improving multimodal language models.

### Strengths
1. The question posed by the author is highly significant, namely the impact of instruction data quality on the performance of MLLM, which has been rarely discussed before.
2. The method described in the article is written quite clearly and is easy to understand. The entire method is also concise, and the results on several benchmarks demonstrate its effectiveness.

### Weaknesses
1. The experiments in the article are relatively limited and the dataset used has a small sample size, which raises doubts about the effectiveness of the proposed method when applied to larger datasets. Specifically, the reliance on a single, relatively small dataset (3.4k examples) for training and evaluation limits the generalizability of the findings. It is unclear if the observed performance gains would hold with more diverse, larger datasets commonly used in multimodal learning.
2. The authors should have included some baseline methods for data selection, such as the mentioned instruction mining. It is not surprising that removing low-quality data can improve performance, and having these baselines would provide a better comparison and evaluation of the proposed approach. The absence of established data selection techniques makes it difficult to assess the novelty and effectiveness of the proposed method. Without comparisons to existing methods, it is unclear if the gains are due to the specific approach or simply due to any form of data filtering. The lack of a quantitative comparison to other methods is a significant oversight.


### Questions
1. Regarding the data selector, although it appears to be concise, it can be time-consuming as it requires continuous training of the model on the validation dataset for testing. This becomes particularly challenging when dealing with large amounts of data.
2. The article suggests that the data selector can be directly applied to other multimodality datasets. It would be beneficial if the authors could provide evidence or supporting experiments. 
3. The dataset size of 3.4k in MiniGPT-4 is relatively small in terms of instruction data. It would be interesting to investigate whether the proposed method remains effective on larger instruction datasets.
