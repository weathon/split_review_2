## Abstract
In recent years, multimodal recommendation systems have been widely used in e-commerce and short video platforms. How to effectively utilize multimodal data and avoid the interference of multimodal noise information has become the key research direction of researchers. Many studies add multimodal data as auxiliary features to the model, which brings positive effects. Pictures, text and audio signals in short videos are more likely to attract users' interest than basic attributes. The user's multiple personalized interests largely determine the user's behavioral preferences. In order to effectively utilize user interest to improve model effect, We propose a new Multi-interest Disentangled Representation Learning method for multimodal recommendation (MIDR). Specifically, we first introduce the expected maximum to describe the relationship between interest and predicted target, and establish the optimization object based on multi-interest recommendation. Then, considering the relationship between user interest and multiple modalities, we introduce disentangled representation learning to extract modal sharing and modal specific interest representations. Furthermore, we introduce multi-interest contrast module to help model learning interest representation based on self-supervised learning. We conducted experiments on three real-world data sets, and our proposed MIDR outperformed other state-of-art models. The effectiveness of the disentangled interest representation module and interest contrast module was verified by the ablation experiment.

### Summary
This paper proposes a new Multi-interest Disentangled Representation Learning method for multimodal recommendation (MIDR). Specifically, the author tries to combine multi-interest modeling and multi-modal modeling through mutual information theory for recommendation. The author tries to model the modal interest representation from two views: modal-sharing interest representation modeling and modal-specific interest representation modeling. Furthermore, the author introduces an orthogonal loss function for constraint and a multi-interest contrast module to help model learning interest representation based on self-supervised learning. The author further verifies the validity of the model by testing on three data sets.

### Strengths
This paper innovatively tries to combine multi-interest learning and multimodal learning to model a recommender system. The authors attempt to introduce two kinds of interest-based modeling, modal-shared and modal-specific, for each mode to enhance the model's extraction of valid information. The author constructs the mathematical representation of related concepts through rigorous mathematical reasoning, and gives the modeling steps in detail, and verifies the model effect on three data sets.

### Weaknesses
This paper is a little bit deficient in writing. For example, the article lacks an overview diagram that directly represents the proposed model, making it difficult for the readers to quickly understand the overall structure and characteristics of the model. Also, some key introductions are missing. For example, the symbols “z” and “w” in equation (1) and (2) are not clearly introduced. The “music inequality” in 4.1 (equation (5)) also lacks a brief introduction or citation. Moreover, the paper seems to use different symbols in some places to indicate the same or similar definition (e.g., “G” and “E” in 4.2.3; “R” and “h” in 4.2.3 and 4.2.4(I think it might be better to use “r” instead of “h”)), which puzzled me. In addition, there is too little analysis, comparison, and discussion of the overall experimental effect, which may make readers doubt the effect of the model.

### Questions
1.	In Section 5.4, why does the model effect decrease when the embedding dimension is 512? Logically, the desired situation should have a smaller improvement than 256.
2.	In Appendix C, could the hyperparameters of μ and η be experimented with smaller values to verify that they are actually beneficial to the model effect within a certain range? While the current results can be explained by stability, they can also be interpreted as hindering model performance.

### Summary
The paper proposes a Multi-interest Disentangled Representation Learning method for multimodal recommendation (MIDR). The method aims to address different issues in multimodal recommendation, namely: 1) the existence of noisy information in multimodal content adopted for recommendation; 2) users’ decision may be driven by separate interest factors underlying each modality; 3) the assumption that each multimodal feature should be represented in the same semantic latent space may be wrong. After introducing and formalizing the multi-interest disentangled representation, the authors propose four additional components to the usual recommendation loss function (i.e., binary cross-entropy for the task of click prediction). The loss components account for: 1) modal-sharing interest representation, 2) modal-specific interest representation, 3) interest distribution representation and 4) multi-interest contrast learning. Extensive experimental settings when testing the model’s performance against eleven state-of-the-art (multimodal) recommender systems on three recommendation datasets show the efficacy of the MIDR solution. Moreover, an ablation study, complemented by a hyper-parameter values analysis, further motivate the architectural choices for MIDR.

### Strengths
+ The problem of multi-interest disentangled representation learning in multimodal recommendation is a hot topic in the field.
+ The experimental analysis is extensive with several evaluation dimensions.

### Weaknesses

### Before the rebuttal

- There are numerous conceptual flows in the formal presentation of the methodology. For instance, equation 1 introduces several terms and notions which have not been properly detailed in the preliminaries. Specifically, the meaning of \(p(z_u^m | u)\) and its relation to the user's multi-faceted interests are unclear. The connection between the latent interest space \(z_u^m\) and the observed multimodal features is not rigorously established, making it difficult to understand how the disentanglement is achieved in practice. Furthermore, the use of conditional probabilities to model user interests lacks a clear justification and could benefit from a more detailed explanation of the underlying assumptions.
- From a general overview of the paper, it becomes hard to find the real novelty of the proposed approach, as it encompasses several winning approaches from the recent literature. The combination of modal-specific and modal-shared representations, along with contrastive learning, appears to be a collection of existing techniques rather than a novel methodological contribution. The paper does not adequately articulate how these components are integrated in a unique way that addresses the identified challenges in multimodal recommendation. The lack of a clear, unifying principle makes it difficult to appreciate the overall contribution of the proposed method.
- The performance improvement with respect to the tested baselines seem a bit incremental. The authors may try to run statistical significance tests of MIDR performance with respect to the baselines. The reported gains, while positive, are not substantial enough to convincingly demonstrate the superiority of the proposed approach. Without statistical significance tests, it remains unclear whether the observed improvements are due to the proposed method or simply random fluctuations. This lack of rigorous statistical validation weakens the empirical support for the proposed approach.
- No code of the proposed MIDR approach is released at review time, which makes it difficult to further assess its efficacy and reproducibility.

### After the rebuttal

Dear Authors,

thank you for your rebuttal, which I carefully read.

Indeed, the ablation study shows the efficacy of each introduced module in terms of **recommendation performance**. However, even after considering your rebuttal, I still cannot see the **technical** novelty provided by the overall MIDR approach, which still appears to me as a combination of various winning approaches from the recent literature. 

In this respect, I believe the methodology section from the paper is not helpful to clarify these aspects. As already outlined in my review, it is very hard to follow the formalism and methodology due to the numerous missing conceptual details in section 4, which are sometimes taken for granted.

Moreover, I am still convinced the performance improvement with respect to the other baselines is not quite evident, and it might require further statistical tests. Indeed, the sharing of code at review time would have been useful to test the effectiveness of the approach from an implementation point of view.

In light of above, I would keep the initial rating I gave to the paper. In my opinion, If all such aspects were addressed, the paper could be ready for submission to other venues. I strongly encourage the authors move towards this direction.

### Summary
The paper proposes a Multi-Interest Disentangled Representation Learning method for multimodal recommendation systems. The technique involves disentangled representation learning and a multi-interest contrast module to extract modal sharing and modal-specific interest representations. The proposed method outperforms other advanced models on three widely used real datasets. The paper's main contributions are the proposed method, establishing the relationship between multiple interests and recommended goals and the comprehensive experiment on three publicly baseline datasets.

### Strengths
1. The problem of concern in this paper has a practical background and is reasonably motivated. It has research value.
2. The structure of the paper is clear, the logic is smooth, and the proposed method is clearly demonstrated.
3. Extensive experiments are carried out on three datasets with rich baseline models.

### Weaknesses
1. The author's motivation is reasonable, but it is not well summarized. The motivation in the text is somewhat vague and not specific enough. On top of that, how the different components in the model correspond to the motivation is not well specified. The method is not closely related to the motivation.
2. The method in Section 4.2.3 is confusing. It is not reasonable for modal-specific interest representation and R to maximize mutual information, because S_X in R is modal shared. The authors later additionally minimize mutual information modal specific interest representation and S_X. This raises the question of why to maximize in the first place.
3. There are a lot of notation errors, and I guess in section 4.2.3 the author wanted to use E_X to mean the same thing as G_X. There is also a SZ in Section 4.2.2 that appears without explanation. These errors greatly affect the normal understanding of the method proposed by the authors.
4. The present method introduction and experimental results do not show that the method proposed by the author effectively solves the problems proposed in the motivation. The author should use more convincing explanations or design experiments to show this.
5. I suggest using images to visualize the model.

### Questions
1. How does the proposed approach correspond to the motivation? Is there a strong argument or proof that the method improves the correspondence problem, rather than simply improving the overall performance?
2. The method in Section 4.2.3 is confusing. It is not reasonable for modal-specific interest representation and R to maximize mutual information, because S_X in R is modal shared. The authors later additionally minimize mutual information modal specific interest representation and S_X. This raises the question of why to maximize in the first place.
3. The experimental data of w/o-OC and r/p-IR on the baby dataset in the ablation experiment are strange, which I feel may need an appropriate explanation.

### Summary
In this work, the authors focus on the multimodal recommendation system. Considering the challenge of effectively using multimodal data the authors proposed to mitigate its noise by implementing a Multi-interest Disentangled Representation Learning (MIDR). In particular, they optimize multi-interest recommendations through disentangled interest representation and self-supervised learning. Experiment results on real-world datasets demonstrate MIDR's superior performance compared to existing models.

### Strengths
1. The authors analysed the drawback of multi-modal information in the recommender system. 
2. They authors proposed a new method to disentangle the multi-interests in the item representation learning. 
3. By conducting the experiments on public datasets, the authors demonstrated the effectiveness of their model.

### Weaknesses
1. The novelty of the proposed model is limited. From my reading, the authors just combined the existing modules together, such as contrastive learning and deep learning. 
2. I am not sure how the authors implement their proposed model. From the manuscript, the authors seem to derive the objective of their model, but ignoring the detail of implementation. It is hard to reproduce the proposed model.
