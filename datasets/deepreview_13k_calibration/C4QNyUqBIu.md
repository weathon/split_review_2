## Abstract
Network flow problems, which involve distributing traffic such that the underlying infrastructure is used effectively, are ubiquitous in transportation and logistics. Among them, the general Multi-Commodity Network Flow (MCNF) problem concerns the distribution of multiple flows of different sizes between several sources and sinks, while achieving effective utilization of the links. Due to the appeal of data-driven optimization, these problems have increasingly been approached using graph learning methods. In this paper, we propose a novel graph learning architecture for network flow problems called Per-Edge Weights (PEW). This method builds on a Graph Attention Network and uses distinctly parametrized message functions along each link. We extensively evaluate the proposed solution through an Internet flow routing case study using $17$ Service Provider topologies and $2$ routing schemes. We show that PEW yields substantial gains over architectures whose global message function constrains the routing unnecessarily. We also find that an MLP is competitive with other standard architectures. Furthermore, we analyze the relationship between graph structure and predictive performance for data-driven routing of flows, an aspect that has not been considered by existing work in the area.

### Summary
The paper introduces a new graph architecture for network flow problems, where the goal is to predict the maximum link utilization for a given network topology given some demand matrix. The authors argue that traditional graph learning methods such as variants of message passing neural networks or graph networks are not well-suited for this type of problem, because edges in network flow problems do not have uniform semantics. To address this, the paper proposes a new mechanism, called Per-Edge Weights or PEW, which relies on a different message function per edge when aggregating messages received along each edge. This method builds upon across-relation graph attention networks. The proposed methodology is experimentally assessed on 17 real provided topologies and 2 routing schemes (SSP and ECMP). The authors find that PEW tends to outperform other architectures (GAT, GraphSAGE, GCN), while a standard MLP is competitive with the standard graph architectures.

### Strengths
1. The paper is motivated by a real problem in flow networks, which is ubiquitous in communications, transportation and logistics. This potentially makes this work relevant to a wider audience, e.g., the communication networks community.
2. The main observation behind PEW is meaningful. One expects that edges cannot play the same role in the underlying flow network, so that we cannot uniformly aggregate the messages received along each edge. The fact that the proposed methodology uses a different message function per edge thus makes sense in such a context.
3. The paper uses real network topologies, which makes the results more reliable. The traffic matrices are synthetic but use the gravity model, which is considered quite realistic in the traffic engineering literature.
4. The results for MSE indeed show that PEW is indeed able to outperform other graph approaches as well as MLP. This is aligned with the authors' claim that the PEW trick can improve performance in flow networks.

### Weaknesses
1. The ML/AI contribution seems to be rather limited. Using a different message function per edge as opposed to identical message functions across all edges is meaningful in the context of flow networks, but the novelty is rather low otherwise. The PEW architecture is a variation of the across-relation variant of relational GATS, so the proposed architecture cannot be viewed as a novel contribution of this work.

2. I am not exactly clear what the motivation behind this paper is. The authors describe the challenge that "a priori knowledge of the full demand matrix is an unrealistic assumption, but ML techniques can address this by learning a model trained on past load that can perform well in a variety of traffic scenarios". However, the real network topologies used in this work are rather small. In that case, it is not clear whether an ML model can provide a substantial benefit. Perhaps one could simply run linear programming algorithms to compute the MLU for a new traffic matrix (if demand changes) or for the new topology (if the network topology suddenly changes)? 

3. Continuing point (2), if the authors state that the proposed PEW is the correct architecture for network flow problems, then it would be easier to make such a point if PEW showed potential for devising alternative routing strategies. Currently, the authors have simply used the new architecture with a regression task, i.e., that of computing the MLU. If PEW is the right architecture for general flow problems, then it should show the same potential with other tasks (e.g., classification tasks, or the harder task of learning a policy, for instance via RL). The current setting is too specific and in my view it is not sufficient to show the full potential of PEW.

4. One shortcoming of PEW is that it cannot generalize to new, previously unseen topologies, since the message functions depend on the edge. This can make it cumbersome to use this framework in practice, because one needs to train a separate model for each network topology using lots of different data points. Architectures that would be easily adapted to new networks (e.g., with similar number of nodes/edges but very different topology) would be very helpful.

5. The authors experimented with rather small networks, up to 82 nodes. It might have been useful to consider even larger networks, since small networks may be easier to handle with traditional algorithms. Furthermore, it may have made sense to experiment with synthetic topologies as well, e.g., with networks generated with the BA model, the ER model, or the WS model (all are available in the NetworkX graph analysis package). Strong results on a variety of synthetic topologies (possibly with more nodes) would further strengthen the current claims in the paper. That said, the proposed method may not be easily scalable to large graphs due to having many more learnable parameters (especially, as the number of edges increases).

6. I am not sure I understood Table 1. As mentioned in point (2) above, the authors seem to claim that a motivation of this work is to learn a graph model with high predictive performance under changing topology or demands. To show this claim, the authors would have included the MSE on the varied graph structure. Ideally, we would want the MSE to remain low for a high predictive performance. Instead, the authors mention the WR and the MRR, which is only a relative measure which does not properly reflect the absolute predictive performance. Similarly, in Figure 4 the authors only show how PEW performs with raw demands and GAT with sum demands, but they do not show how PEW performs with sum demands or GAT with raw demands.

7. I am not sure it makes sense to use a fixed number of demand matrices for all topologies. Large topologies would naturally need more training points than small topologies. Normally, we use a dataset that is adequate for learning purposes. The fact that the authors used a fixed number of demand matrices everywhere may be distorting the results, especially for larger graphs.

### Questions
1. Can PEW perform well with other network flow tasks, outside regression (classification, RL, etc.)?
2. For the small graphs considered in this work, couldn't we rerun the linear programming algorithm to compute the MLU whenever the demand matrices change or the topology changes (e.g., a link fails)?
3. Have the authors tried to experiment with larger networks? what about synthetic networks?
4. Could the authors provide clarifications on Table1 and Figure 4? For Table 1, in particular, does the MSE remain low when we apply the learned model to the changed demand matrix or the changed topology?
5. Why did the authors use a fixed number of demand matrices?
6. Can the learned models generalize to new topologies? At the very least, do they achieve high predictive performance on changed demands on the same topology (see also question 5)?
7. Is it necessary to include all the learning curves on pages 17-33? Does that serve a specific purpose?

### Summary
This paper proposes a graph neural network architecture called Per-Edge Weights (PEW) for predicting network flows in multi-commodity network flow (MCNF) problems. The key contributions are:

- PEW uses distinct parametrizations to enhance expressiveness when aggregating messages from neighboring nodes along each edge. 

- The paper conducts an extensive evaluation on 17 real-world network topologies and 2 routing schemes, totaling over 80,000 experiments.

- The results show PEW improves over standard GNN architectures for predicting maximum link utilization. A well-tuned MLP is competitive with other GNNs.

- The paper analyzes how topological characteristics relate to model performance. Performance tends to decrease with larger graph size but improve with greater heterogeneity in node/edge properties.

### Strengths
The paper proposes a novel and simple modification to graph neural networks for network flow prediction problems by using per-edge weight matrices. The writing is mostly clear and easy to follow. Extensive experiments are presented. The analyses provide valuable insights.

### Weaknesses
Regarding PEW:

- Limitation for handing diverse topologies. Graphs are inherently dynamic and can have varying sizes and structures, and GNNs are typically designed with the flexibility to handle that. It is unclear to me how can PEW handle graphs with varying sizes and structures. Do we have to train a respective PEW-GNN for diverse real-world graph topologies? Is there a solid reason for just overfitting a specific topology? The paper mentions experiments with varying graph structures, but it's not clear if this means completely different topologies or just minor variations within a single topology. The practical applicability of training a separate model for each specific network topology needs further justification, as this could be computationally expensive and impractical for large networks with frequent topology changes.

- Variance to node permutation. One importance feature a GNN should possess is invariance to node permutation. It is unclear to me if PEW have such a feature, or if PEW doesn’t need this feature. While the authors may argue that node identities are known, the lack of permutation invariance raises concerns about the model's robustness and its ability to generalize to slightly different network configurations where node labeling might not be consistent.

- Unclear generalizability. PEW seems to be based on some strong assumptions (“node identities are known”) and specifically designed for one problem. What other tasks do you anticipate PEW can excel at? The reliance on edge-specific parameters might limit its applicability to problems where edge features are less critical or where the number of edges is extremely large, leading to an unmanageable number of parameters.

- Unclear scalability. The handled graphs have only dozens of nodes. PEW wouldn't lead to an unreasonable number of parameters for such graph scales. However, is this a reasonable scale for real-world applications? Real-world networks often have thousands or even millions of nodes and edges. The paper does not address how PEW would scale to such large networks, both in terms of computational cost and memory requirements. The per-edge parameterization could become a bottleneck for large-scale graphs.


Regarding experimentation:

- Potentially unreasonable baselines. Prior works related to "ML for routing flows in computer networks" are summarized in the "Related Work" section. However, both discussions of and comparisons against these works are absent. Instead, the authors compare PEW to some widely applicable standard GNNs, which is not convincing enough for me. The comparison should include more specialized methods from the related work section to demonstrate the advantage of PEW over existing approaches in the specific domain of network flow prediction.

- Absence of comparisons with non-learning baselines. Are there any non-learning baselines for this task? If so, comparing PEW against them would be more convincing. While a trivial baseline is mentioned, a more thorough comparison with established non-learning methods, such as traditional routing algorithms or optimization techniques, would provide a stronger justification for the use of a learning-based approach.

- Insufficient validation of motivation. How are the ground truth labels generated? What are the advantages of learning-based prediction over the way the ground truth is generated? Are they verified in the experiments? The paper should clearly articulate the limitations of the existing methods for generating ground truth labels and demonstrate how the learning-based approach addresses these limitations. The advantages of using a predictive model over direct calculation of network flows should be made more explicit.

### Summary
This paper presents PEW, a model designed to predict the Maximum Link Utilization, an evaluation metric of routing schemes. The model does not use weight sharing, but learns a different weight matrix for each edge of the network topology. Then, it uses an attention mechanism to compute a weight for each neighbor of a given node. The proposed model is evaluated on a large number of topologies and it outperforms the baselines on most of these topologies.

### Strengths
- The experimental evaluation of the proposed model is thorough and convincing. Several different network topologies are considered and also several demand matrices are constructed which led to a very large number of training runs.

- The proposed PEW approach outperforms the baseline models on most datasets. On some datasets the difference in performance between PEW and the baselines is significant.

- The presentation is clear and the paper is easy to read.

### Weaknesses
 - The proposed method assumes that there is a single network topology which is static and does not change. This suggests that a different model needs to be trained on each network topology and also that a model trained on one topology cannot generalize to other topologies. This renders the proposed approach impractical for several applications.

- Another weakness of the work (which is also discussed in section 6) is that the number of parameters of the proposed model depends on the number of edges of the graph. In case of network topologies that consist of a very large number of edges, this can lead to very large models which are hard to train and might suffer from poor generalization if not many training samples are available.

- It is not clear whether the comparison against the baselines is fair. Are all models evaluated under the same parameter budget? Based on the values shown in Table 2, I would guess that the answer is no. Furthermore, in the case of GCN and GraphSAGE which do not support edge features, the edge capacities are aggregated and used as node features. This is very likely to have a negative impact on those models' performance. I would suggest the authors replace those two models with other architectures that can handle edge features.

- The paper focuses only on a single property of routing strategies (MLU). It is not thus clear whether the proposed method provides performance improvements in tasks where other properties need to be predicted.

- There are some related works which also use graph neural networks to predict the values of other performance indicators that are not discussed in the paper (see for instance [1] and [2]).

### Questions
- In p.5, the closed and open neighborhood of a node are defined. What is the difference between those two neighborhoods?

- In the appendix, it is mentioned that training and evaluation of the models was performed on CPUs. What was the reason behind that? Wouldn't GPU execution lead to a speed-up?

### Summary
This paper adopts graph neural networks to predict the maximum link utilization of a routing strategy. It presents Per-Edge Weights method where the edges don't have uniform weights. This is different from the traditional message-passing GNNs where the message-passing function is the same for updating all nodes. Empirical study shows that PEW outperforms GAT , GCN, GraphSAGE, and MLP. It is also found that PEW can better utilize the full demand matrix, while GAT can only deal with node-wise sum.

### Strengths
1. Extensive empirical studies are adopted to verify the superiority of PEW on the proposed task.

### Weaknesses
1. Novelty: The idea of utilizing machine learning methods to solve network flow problems has been around for a few years. Assigning different weights to edges when updating node features is not a completely novel proposal either. Actually, this paper spent only half a page on elaborating its method.
2. The problem of MLU prediction is not as significant as routing design.
3. When identifying the problem, it seems like the graph has no capacity information. When defining MLU, the capacity K is used without notation.
4. Presentation: Too much space is spent discussing the experimental setup. The result presentation is unclear due to the scale of Figure 3 and the vague discussion in Section 5.

### Questions
In Section 3.2, the authors argue that the traditional message-passing scheme is not best suited for flow routing problems without demonstrating the reason for this argument.
