## Abstract
Learning generalized models from biased data with strong spurious correlations to the class label is an important undertaking toward fairness in deep learning. In the absence of any prior knowledge or supervision of bias, recent studies tackle the problem by presuming the bias severity to be sufficiently high and employing a bias-amplified model trained by empirical risk minimization (ERM) to identify and utilize bias-conflicting samples that are free of spurious correlations. However, insufficient preciseness in detecting bias-conflicting samples results in injecting erroneous signals during training; conversely, it leads to learning malignant biases instead of excluding them. In practice, as the presumption about the magnitude of bias often does not hold, it is important for the model to demonstrate robust performance across a wide spectrum of biases. In this paper, we propose SePT (Self-influence-based Post-Training), a fine-tuning framework leveraging the self-influence score to filter bias-conflicting samples, which yields a pivotal subset with significantly diminished spurious correlations. Our method enables the quick recovery of a biased model from learned bias through fine-tuning with minimal friction. In addition, SePT also utilizes the remaining training dataset to adjust the model, thereby maintaining robust performance in situations with weak spurious correlation or even in the absence of it. Experiments on diverse benchmark datasets with a wide range of bias strengths show that SePT is capable of boosting the performance of both bias-injected and state-of-the-art debiased models.

3: You are fairly confident in your assessment. It is possible that you did not understand some parts of the submission or that you are unfamiliar with some pieces of related work. Math/other details were not carefully checked.

### Summary
I think the paper works on a significant problem. I think their approach on influence functions on biased data could work. However, the weaknesses of the algorithms outweigh the strengths. First, the proposed approach is not motivated -- no idea why the modification is needed on self influence functions in biased dataset. Secondly, the novelty of the approach is not explained in the paper -- why the proposed approach will work intuitively, no theoretical support. There is some empirical support by showing some outperformance but I think it is not enough. So my decision is reject.

### Strengths
1. Training in a biased dataset is significant problem in machine learning domain. Influence functions have been used in removing noisy labels, detecting mislabeled samples etc. I think it is original to use influence functions in biased dataset. 
2. The paper makes very good introduction of the paper, explains the biased dataset, influence functions in a very good way for a reader to follow to rest of the paper.

### Weaknesses
1. Figure 1 appears very early in the paper; it is very confusing, and not easy for any reader to follow. For example, what are the legends in Figure 1a. What is bias-aligned, bias-conflicting ? It is not explained anywhere before Figure 1 appears. It is also not very clear what Figure 1 tells us. Section 3.1 is supposed to explain why self influence does not work in biased data, but it is not clear first how it is applied in biased data, and then why it does not work and needs to be modified. As far as I can tell, Figure 1 only shows modified SI (which is not yet introduced in the paper till Section 3.1) outperforms SI but does not explain the fundamental reason of this outperformance. 
2. The novelty of the proposed algorithm with respect to self-influence functions is not well-explained. Why training five epochs using GCE (what is GCE by the way ? ) and then using self influence function works but fully trained model does not ? There is also no theoretical backing of the proposed algorithm. If there is no theoretical backing of proposed approach, I would at least expect some intuitive explanation on why the proposed approach will work.

### Questions
1. How are you using self influence in biased data ?
2. Why does SI underperform in the biased data ?

### Summary
Biases in ML models may be caused by biased data samples. One type of samples, named $\textit{bias-conflicting samples}$ has been recognized and utilized as a pivotal subset with significantly diminished spurious correlations. However, the accuracy of detecting such $\textit{bias-conflicting samples}$ has been a challenging topic and inadequacy in this aspect may cause additional error in training. One of the major goals of this paper is to improve the preciseness in this task by introducing $\textit{self-influence score}$ to filter such $\textit{bias-conflicting samples}$ and therefore enables quick recovery of a biased model with minimal cost.

### Strengths
The paper addresses a critical issue, which is the preciseness of identifying bias-conflicting samples. The approach of using a quantitative measure (self-influence function) to identify such subset of samples is a novel approach, and this line of thoughts may be inspiring for designing more refined standard for this task.

### Weaknesses
The utility of this influence function is questionable. Although its definition is simple and standard in the area, I did not find its connections with biases and the issue of fairness overall. The goal of introducing this metric is to identify bias-conflicting data samples, and due to lack of connections with fairness, it is questionable whether this metric is well-aligned with the goal of this framework.

It would be great if the authors could provide more justifications on choosing this metric, either mathematically or conceptually.

### Summary
This paper studies alleviation of spurious correlation caused by the bias in the data.
It proposes a fine-tuning framework to address such bias. Their approach leverages the idea of Influence Function (IF) to identify bias-conflicting samples. Specifically, by compute Self-Influence (SI), which measures a sample’s influence on the accuracy of itself, the framework can reveal data that hinder model generalization. 

However, such a direct application of SI might not generate sufficient samples. Thus the paper further introduces bias-customized self-influence (BCSI), which effectively identifies bias-conflicting samples, with higher BCSI scores indicating pronounced conflicts with bias. They then create a pivotal subset that minimizes spurious correlations by considering BCSI scores of the training samples. Following this, fine-tuning of a biased model through a limited number of iterations is implemented using the selected subset of data, reducing injected bias. Experimental results show that the proposed method manifests effectiveness in low-bias scenarios.

### Strengths
1. This paper focuses on a central research problem in machine learning: spurious correlation/data bias. 

2. This paper provides a fine-tuning method, which avoids the time-consuming retraining of a potential large model. This aligns with the current trend of research.

### Weaknesses
While I acknowledge the significance of the research question addressed in this paper and the presence of certain novel elements, I find the current presentation somewhat perplexing when attempting to decipher the results. Consequently, I have posed some specific questions below.
My current score is tentative, in the hope that the authors might provide additional clarifications.

**1**.  Unclear definition in section 2.1: what is $s_y$ and $b_y$? 
Does it indicate for a single class $y$, there can only be one relevant signal $s$, which is $s_y$, and only one irrelevant signal $b$, which is denoted as $b_y$? If yes, this seems to be the most extreme case of spurious correlation, i.e., the spurious correlation equals 1 for all class $y \in [C]$.
Or does it indicate that, for a single class, there can be one and only one spurious attribute? I.e., one class cannot be correlated with two spurious attributes?

**2**. In Figure 1, are the reported accuracies the validation accuracy measured on a validation set?

**3**. Figure 1(a), the pattern confused me. It seems that the precision is not monotonic w.r.t. The bias-conflicting sample ratio. Although the curve corresponding to 0.5% is at the top, the curve for 5% is above that of 1% and 2%. This makes me confused about the implication of this specific result and worried whether it is due to noise. It might be helpful to show the results averaged over multiple runs.

**4**. When the paper validated the proposed BCSI, it mentioned “In Figure 1(b), our approach exhibits consistent detection precision compared to conventional SI”. Could I ask why Figure 1(b) manifests “consistent detection”? It seems to be a large variation of range across bias ratios. I am confused.

**5**. From Figure 1e-1h, it seems that BCSI consistently outperformed others except for the extreme 0.5% case.

**6**. Regarding the last two paragraphs of Section 3.2: the paper claims that a drawback of many existing methods is that they cannot handle the setting with a lack of biased samples. To address this concern, the proposed solution is to add a simple cross entropy loss to the final loss function. My concern is, I did not see how this is novel compared to the existing methods. First, why cannot the previous methods also add a CE loss when the biased samples are lacking? Second, I am not convinced why adding a CE loss helps. When the pivotal set is small, isn’t it true that adding a randomly sample CE loss have close effect to ERM?
