## Abstract
The cold posterior effect (CPE) \citep{WRVS+20} in Bayesian deep learning shows that, for posteriors with a temperature $T<1$, the resulting posterior predictive could have better performances than the Bayesian posterior ($T=1$). As the Bayesian posterior is known to be optimal under perfect model specification, many recent works have studied the presence of CPE as a model misspecification problem, arising from the prior and/or from the likelihood function. In this work, we provide a more nuanced understanding of the CPE as we show that \emph{misspecification leads to CPE only when the resulting Bayesian posterior underfits}. In fact, we theoretically show that if there is no underfitting, there is no CPE.% This novel interpretation provides a more nuance understanding of the CPE than the existing ones mainly based on model misspecification arguments. %This theoretical analysis (strongly) agrees with the empirical results obtained on synthetic data and real-world datasets for both regression and classification tasks.

### Summary
The authors investigate the cause of the cold posterior effect (CPE) and argue that it is due to model underfitting. They do this both analytically and empirically; they show theoretically that the CPE implies underfitting and further construct experiments to analyse the influence of likelihood and prior misspecification as well as data augmentation. They conclude that each of these settings induces a CPE only if they cause the posterior to underfit. They further show that the CPE exists even for models that allow for exact Bayesian inference and that a "warm" posterior effect can occur too when the likelihood is misspecified. Together, these results explain why certain priors and likelihoods can lead to a CPE, as well as why larger models suffer less from the CPE.

### Strengths
1. The paper presents an elegant unification of previous explanations and observations of the CPE as being due to underfitting. It explains both the role of prior or likelihood misspecification as well as addresses the observed CPE when using data augmentations, which is really remarkable.
2. The experiments are cleverly designed and convey some great insights into the CPE.
3. The paper is well-written, and the authors do a great job of explaining ideas and results that are quite abstract.
4. The paper is original and of high technical quality. It seems bound to become extremely significant for understanding the CPE and will therefore be of great interest to the ICLR community.

### Weaknesses
This might be the first time I have struggled to find weaknesses in a paper. While the usual do-more-experiments comment can always be used, I cannot think of particular experiments that would dramatically contribute to the paper. It seems to be all-round solid work.

### Questions
**Questions**  
1. Your results indicate that larger model capacities should be less susceptible to the CPE since they are less likely to underfit. However, Wenzel et al. (2020), figure 11, actually show the opposite, namely that increasing the depth of an MLP has no effect on the CPE, and that increasing the width makes the effect more pronounced. Do you have any thoughts on this?
2. I am trying to understand what the next steps for research on this topic might be. Did you observe any situations where underfitting could not explain the CPE?
3. Do you have any suggestions for future work?


**Suggestions**  
- Minor thing: the plots seem to have been rasterised with such high resolution that my pdf viewer struggles. I would suggest using vector graphics instead.

### Summary
- The paper claim that if there is cold posterior effect, it means the posterior distribution is underfitted.

- They provide theoretical and experimental evidence which support their claim.

### Strengths
- They address a highly significant issue, and their arguments hold profound implications. If properly substantiated, their work is poised to be regarded as a pivotal study.

- Their notation is clean, and well-written.

### Weaknesses
$f{(Major)}$

According to the definition of CPE, as lambda increases, the test loss should decrease. Additionally, as $\lambda$ increases, the train loss always decreases irrespective of CPE. Up to this point, arguments in Theorem 2, Proposition 3 are accurate but rather self-evident.  

However, they have not demonstrated that the distribution, whose existence was proven, becomes a posterior distribution (which should be definable from a new likelihood or a new prior). Hence, according to the definition “underfitting” defined by authors, Insight 1 may not be correct. Specifically, the authors define underfitting as the existence of another posterior with lower empirical Gibbs and Bayes losses. However, they do not show that this 'other posterior' is derived from a valid Bayesian inference process with a modified likelihood or prior. Without this connection, the claim that CPE indicates underfitting remains unsubstantiated, as the 'other posterior' could be an arbitrary distribution rather than a meaningful Bayesian posterior.

After demonstrating that, I believe at least one of the following two pieces of evidence should be provided. 
1) The original likelihood (or prior) is misspecified, compare to new likelihood (or prior). 
2) An inverse proposition also holds.(i.e., If there is underfitting, there exists CPE). 

In the current manuscript, I believe that their main claim has not been theoretically clarified.

$f{(Minor)}$

It seems that Figure 2 and Figure 3 do not connect well with the main claims of the paper. The common implication in the results appears to merely suggest that "CPE exists in image data analysis."

### Questions
In page 3, authors state that

“In the context of Bayesian inference, we argue that the Bayesian posterior is underfitting if there exists another posterior distribution with lower empirical Gibbs and Bayes losses at the same time.”

Is this a commonly accepted concept or a newly proposed one? If it's the former, it seems appropriate to provide references.

### Summary
The paper presents in a theoretical and empirical setup that the presence of CPE implies the existence of under-fitting along with previous evidence of CPE such as misspecification of the prior and the likelihood. That is in a way that the misspecification of the prior or the likelihood have underfitting as an outcome and therefore the CPE.

### Strengths
-Interesting take on the CPE problem that might give light to new avenues on why CPE exists and how to tackle it.
-Potential of good value if the argument is made more clear or presented in a better way.

### Weaknesses
 -The argument is a bit unclear from my perspective. The authors argue that the problem is under-fitting which comes from misspecification. So is the problem the under-fitting or the misspecification which causes the under-fitting.
-The paper seems to be stepping on previous results and works, claiming that the misspecification of the prior or the likelihood lead to underfitting, and therefore underfitting is the problem that causes CPE. Well if CPE is present when under-fitting is present then the problem falls on either the prior or the likelihood.
-Some of the results are not convincing. A simple linear regression model on synthetic data is not enough in Figure 1. Figure 2 and 3 are also a bit unclear.

### Questions
My main question is what is the argument that the authors are making? Reading the paper it looks like you are arguing that misspecification is causing the CPE by causing underfitting. It is well known that any misspecification in Bayesian setups leads to lower performance. 

I think I have understood the math and the experiments of the paper but the main argument does not seem very novel. Can the authors better explain?

One tip that I can give on the presentation is to add the results of the big models in the main text and the toy experiments in the Supplement. Or have a gradual increase of difficulty in the presentation of the experiments. For instance you start with linear regression on synthetic data, then you have a ResNet experiment on CIFAR10 and then on Imagenet.

### Summary
This work investigates the so-called cold posterior effect, a phenomenon in Bayesian deep learning where it is observed that tempering the Bayesian posterior can counter-intuitively lead to improved test performance. The authors show how the CPE arises as a consequence of models under-fitting the data and demonstrate how this can be remedied precisely by lowering the temperature. They connect their findings with previously established theories surrounding the CPE and show that most such explanations can be unified within their framework.

### Strengths
1. The problem of the cold posterior effect has lead to a plethora of works aiming at understanding it and most of these explanations tackle very different aspects of this problem in very different ways. I think this work is a timely contribution as it tries to unify all these previous approaches in a single more “global” lens. The authors also show great knowledge of the related works, covering most of the contributions to this problem.
2. I really find the result in Theorem 4 quite interesting and also somewhat surprising. I think this is actually the core result of this work although it is not really highlighted like that.

### Weaknesses
1. I find the claims in this work somewhat misleading. The main contribution is the fact that if the posterior is not underfitting, then there is no cold posterior effect. But this statement is almost trivial as (almost) all that is to prove is already assumed in the statement. Underfitting, as defined by the authors, means “a model having training and testing losses much higher than they could be i.e. there exists another model in the model class having simultaneously lower training and testing losses.” Taking the opposite, no underfitting basically means that there is no model with better train and test loss, hence if the Bayesian posterior is not underfitting then of course there is no cold posterior effect. Am I missing something here?  The authors then show that posteriors with smaller temperature having smaller training loss, which is not surprising since the effect of the prior is essentially down-weighted and the model concentrates more on the likelihood, which exactly guarantees a better fit. This, not very surprising fact does all the heavy-lifting here: If one now assumes CPE, then yes, there is a model with smaller temperature and better test loss, which also has smaller training loss but again, not much has been shown here. I also find all the mathematical notation more confusing than helpful here, it makes this relatively simple fact seem more complicated than it really is. I think my issues are somewhat addressed by Theorem 4 which seems to more strongly show the claims made **before** presenting it. I would really appreciate if the authors could clear up my confusion as to what is assumed when words like “underfitting” are used, and what is proved rigorously. 
2. Theorem 4 is a very interesting result and I would have loved to see some empirical verification of it, i.e. if the posterior is optimal at $\lambda = 1$, does the train loss really not change anymore if you add a new sample to the posterior (of course one would need to average over adding the sample)? Can you basically predict optimality of $\lambda=1$ from this property alone? 
3. I think one important theoretical work in the literature regarding the origins of CPE in conjunction with data augmentation has not been treated in this work. While you cite [1] for re-scaling the prior, you don’t discuss their results regarding data augmentation and how the correlations of errors, arising from assigning the same label to augmented samples, influences the resulting posterior. It is not obvious to me at first glance how those results can be casted within the under-fitting hypothesis of this work, especially the correlated nature of the data. Could you elaborate on the connection to your work?

### Questions
In Proposition 3, how does the underlying data distribution $\nu$ enter the picture here? The CPE is clearly a function of the data distribution $\nu$ as it talks about generalisation loss, but the inequality seems to be independent of $\nu$ except for involving training samples that are drawn from it. Could you elaborate how you are able to make this connection?
