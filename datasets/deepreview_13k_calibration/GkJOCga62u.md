## Abstract
Equivariance is an important structural property that is captured by architectures such as graph neural networks (GNNs). However, equivariant graph functions cannot produce different outputs for similar nodes, which may be undesirable when the function is trying to optimize some global graph property. In this paper, we define orbit-equivariance, a relaxation of equivariance which allows for such functions whilst retaining important structural inductive biases. We situate the property in the hierarchy of graph functions, define a taxonomy of orbit-equivariant functions, and provide four different ways to achieve non-equivariant GNNs. For each, we analyze their expressivity with respect to orbit-equivariance and evaluate them on two novel datasets, one of which stems from a real-world use-case of designing optimal bioisosteres.

### Summary
The authors propose an overarching framework for the hierarchy of node-labelling functions via the lens of orbit-equivariances. They do this by allowing an equivalence class of nodes in a graph to be mapped to a multiset of outputs. The hierarchy spans from permutation equivariant functions for graphs (two nodes belong to the same equivalence class obtain the same representation) to the case where all nodes get unique representations (aking to positional embeddings). The authors  introduce max-orbit, which allows for further control of
orbit-equivariant functions - and establish a theoretical connection between 1-Weisfeiler Leman isomorphism test to identification of orbits and thereby categorizing the expressive power of different GNN architecture. Subsequently they study 4 different GNN architectures in terms of theoretical expressiveness. In the experimental front, the authors propose two new datasets to demonstrate the success of using orbit-equivariant GNNs.

### Strengths
1. The paper proposes a hierarchy which brings under one umbrella different GNN architectures. 
2. The paper provides a study of theoretical expressiveness (akin to the WL hierarchy) 
3. The paper shows empirical evidence on simple new datasets (proposed by the authors) to validate their claims
4. The paper is very well written and easy to comprehend

### Weaknesses
 **Minor Weakness**
1. Misses relevant theoretical works which theoretically unifies positional embedding GNNs - to equivariant GNNs, and node labelling works to develop more powerful GNNs [1][2][3]
2. In figure 1, please make it explicit that the 3 Fluorine atoms in the molecule belong to the same equivalence class only if the position coordinates of the atoms - are not used as part of the node features
3. As the authors list in the limitations section - there is a lack of strong experimental results present in many real word molecular datasets, etc.
4. Novelty is definitely present - but not something completely unexpected and draws and builds upon existing literature

### Questions
Please address the minor weaknesses in the prior section.

Additionally, the term orbit-equivariance appears to be a slightly misleading name for the framework - given it is not about learning representations for the elements in an orbit  which are equivariant to something like a permutation action on the orbit itself. But it is rather assigning a multiset as output labels to an orbit. Unfortunately, I do not have an apt name as well - but would suggest the authors ponder about this a bit more.

### Summary
The paper first introduces the orbit-equivariance of a function that takes a graph (with an ordered node set) as the invariance of the multiset of values on each orbit of the graph isomorphism under node permutations. Also, $\texttt{max-orbit}$ is defined as the maximum number of unique values on each orbit, and it is shown that the usual equivariance is equivalent to orbit-equivariance and $\texttt{max-orbit}=1$. Two types of existing GNNs are shown to be orbit-equivariant either deterministically or stochastically. Also, Orbit-Indiv-GNN and $m$-Orbit-Transform-GNN are proposed, which are orbit-equivariant, along with orbit-sorting cross-entry loss as a loss function for orbit-equivariant functions to train the models. The proposed models are applied to real or synthetic datasets that require orbit equivariance to verify their practical prediction performances.

### Strengths
- The significance of introducing the concept of orbit-equivariant functions is appropriately demonstrated by using an example from drug discovery. The mathematical definition of orbit-equivariance is appropriate because it adequately explains the drug discovery example.
- By introducing the concept of max-orbit, the relationship between orbit-equivariance and equivariance is clearly shown (Proposition 3).
- This paper shows the existence of GNNs that are orbit-equivariant by concretely constructing Orbit-Indiv-GNN and m-Orbit-Transform-GNN.
- Numerical experiments show that the proposed models improve accuracy in tasks that require learning orbit-equivariant functions.
- The hyperparameters and datasets are described in detail, and the code is provided, making the experiments reproducible.

### Weaknesses
 - The description of Orbit-Transform-GNN (Figure 5) has room for improvement (see Questions).
- I have a question about whether the learning method of $m$-Orbit-Transform-GNN is appropriate (see Questions).
- The proposed $m$-Orbit-Transform, although constructive, is constructed using operations that are difficult to explain intuitively, such as rewriting output values. In addition, numerical experiments have shown that $m$-Orbit-Transform has yet to achieve good accuracy.
- The definition of the node-labeling function $f$ appears to rely on an implicit ordering of the node set, which is not ideal. For example, if we consider a graph $G$ with nodes $v_1, v_2, v_3$ and edges $\{\{v_1, v_2\}, \{v_1, v_3\}\}$ and two different node orderings $a_1: v_1 \mapsto 1, v_2 \mapsto 2, v_3 \mapsto 3$ and $a_4: v_1 \mapsto 1, v_2 \mapsto 3, v_3 \mapsto 2$, then the resulting graphs $G_1$ and $G_4$ would be considered different by the function $f$ even though they are structurally identical. This distinction arises from the fact that the node set is assumed to be ordered as $V = \{1, \ldots, N\}$, which introduces an arbitrary ordering that the function $f$ uses, rather than relying solely on the graph structure itself. This implicit dependence on node ordering should be addressed to ensure the function's well-definedness with respect to the graph structure alone.
- The claim that a class of models is not orbit-equivariant should be clarified. As it stands, it is unclear whether this means that *all* functions within that class are not orbit-equivariant, or if it simply means that *some* functions within that class are not orbit-equivariant. The current wording could lead to misinterpretations about the capabilities of the model class.
- The training procedure for $m$-Orbit-Transform-GNN involves applying the cross-entropy loss to the output before the transformation, which is counterintuitive. The model is trained to predict the correct labels before the transformation, which seems to contradict the intended purpose of the transformation. It is not clear why the orbit-sorting cross-entropy loss is not used after the transformation, which would be more aligned with the goal of learning orbit-equivariant functions.
- The statement that GCNs would achieve an accuracy of 0 on the Alchemy-Max-Orbit datasets needs further clarification. While it is true that GCNs cannot achieve a good *graph* accuracy on these datasets, it is possible that they could achieve non-zero node accuracy. The distinction between node, graph, and orbit accuracy should be made clearer in this context.

### Questions
* P.2, Section 2: It is appropriate that the input to an orbit-equivariant function (or, more generally, a node-labeling function) is a graph with an ordered set of nodes. Node sets of graphs in this paper are ordered as $V=\\\{1,\ldots, N\\\}$. Also, examples of node-labeling functions are defined using this ordering. If the node-labeling function takes the graph structure only, we need to show that the function is well-defined regardless of the node ordering. If it is well-defined, the function is automatically equivariant.
* P.6, Figure 5: Since $m=o+1(=3)$, it is difficult to understand whether the triples represent $m$ or $o+1$. It would be better to use a different number for both (e.g., $m=5$). In Figure 5, the last element of the partition is 1-index, whereas 0-index is used in the text, which is confusing and should be unified.
* P.6, Theorem 2: Regarding the claim that a function is not orbit-equivariant, does it mean the function is *not necessarily* orbit-equivariant? For example, Unique-ID-GNNs happen to be orbit-equivariant depending on the choice of the underlying GNN (e.g., degenerated GNN that always returns 0.)
* P.7, Section 5: I have a question about whether it is appropriate to apply the cross-entropy loss to the output before transforming in the training of $m$-Orbit-Transform-GNN. This operation implies that $m$-Orbit-Transform-GNN is trained to output the correct labels before the transformation. If I understand correctly, this is different from what is intended.
* P.8, Section 5: GCNs [...] would have achieved an accuracy of 0 on the Alchemy-Max-Orbit, [...]: Does this sentence mean that GCNs have not been tested on the Alchemy-Max-Orbit?
* P.8, Table 1: The graph accuracy of RNI-GCN is 0 for all ten trials in Alchemy-Max-Orbit-2. Is this result due to the nature of RNI-GCN? Or does insufficient training cause it, and RNI-GCN could have non-zero accuracy when appropriately trained?

【Minor Comments】
* P.1, Section 1: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) -> GNNs: The abbreviation for GNNs appears at the beginning of this section. So, there is no need to repeat the full phrase.
* P.2, Section 2: aka -> a.k.a. or also known as (I suggest using the full phrase)
* P.3, Section 2: $f^{\theta'\_{m}}\_{\mathrm{aggr}}$ and $f^{\theta''\_{m}}\_{\mathrm{read}}$ are imposed to be permutation invariant, but both of them are automatically equivariant when receiving a multi-set Isn't it automatically a permutation invariant when both of them receive a multi-set?
* P.4, Section 3: $\\\{0\\\}^{|G|}$ -> $0^{|G|}$
* P.4, Section 3: the number of unique values in $\\\{\\\{ f(G)_v \mid v\in r \\\}\\\}$: wouldn't it be easier to write $|\\\{f(G)_v \mid v\in r\\\}|$ in a mathematical way?
* P.5, Section 4: What does *Indiv* in Orbit-Indiv-GNN stand for? Does it mean individualization?
* P.7, Section 5: $|T|$ is not used.

### Summary
Typical GNNs are permutation equivariant, which, however, are unable to allow antisymmetric behaviors of symmetric nodes in the same orbit. Motivated from the example of molecules transformation and agent learning, this paper defines orbit-equivariance, a relaxation of equivariance which allows for such functions whilst retaining important structural inductive biases. Two orbit-equivariant GNNs are proposed namely Orbit-Indiv-GNNs and m-Orbit-Transform-GNNs. Besides the interesting theoretical derivations, the proposed models are evaluated empirically.

### Strengths
Strengths:

1. This paper is well written and well-motivated. I enjoy the reading. The example in Figure 1 and the illustrated examples in Section 3 nicely help the understanding of the proposed idea. The propositions and theorems are well organized and clearly demonstrated. 

2. The proposed idea of orbit-equivariance is novel and valuable. It allows permutation equivariance between the nodes in different orbits, but breaks the equivariance for the nodes in the same orbit. In this way, while it allows the distinct output of the symmetric nodes in the same orbit, the hierarchy of the graph structure is still represented in an invariant way, which means the multiset of outputs associated with each distinct graph orbit is unchanged. More succinctly, an orbit-equivariant GNN now becomes a set function of orbits other than individual nodes.

3. The design of Orbit-Indiv-GNNs and m-Orbit-Transform-GNNs is meaningful and fulfill the theoretical guarantee derived by Theorem 2. 

4. The experiments, although not as impressive as the methodology part, are still sufficient to support the benefit of the proposed orbit-equivariance and the developed models.

### Weaknesses
1. The introduction of m-Orbit-Transform-GNN is a bit confusing. I have to read it multiple times to understand the process. It seems there are many freedoms to derive an orbit-equivariant GNN that has max-orbit no more than m. It is unclear why the authors choose the one proposed in the paper. And the experiments on Bioisostere show that the performance of 2-Orbit-Transform-GNN is worse than Orbit-Indiv-GNNs. Does it mean the proposed construction of m-Orbit-Transform-GNN requires further exploration?

2. Another concern is that the processes in both Orbit-Indiv-GNN and m-Orbit-Transform-GNN to make them orbit-equivariant are not differential. I would like to hear form the authors’ thinking about if it is possible to derive a learnable equivariance-to-orbit-equivariant layer other the ad-hoc transformations proposed by the authors. Will the learnable ones further improve the performance? 

3. The last concern is about the efficiency of Orbit-1-WL that is applied to determine the orbits, particularly for large-scale graphs in practice. The authors should discuss this point if necessary.

No more question but the concerns in the weakness part.

### Summary
This paper propose to capture a new kind of equivariance called orbit-equivariance.
The orbit denotes node subsets in graphs.
When a function is orbit equivariance, the label subsets containing labels of nodes in orbit are the same if the input nodes indices are permuted.
For the commonly used GNN, it always preserves permutation equivariance $S_n$, and it is also orbit-equivariance and orbit-equivariance is less restricted.
I suggest to give a better conceptual illustration for max-orbit first, and then provide the motivation to give such max-orbit function to make it more clear.

### Strengths
1. The proposed orbit-equivariance is a new symmetry for GNN, and two new datasets are provided with the required symmetry.
2. From the experimental results, the proposed Orbit-Indiv-GCN can achieve much better performance compared to original GCN model on the new datasets.

### Weaknesses
1. The figure and illustration of concept is concrete, but it is better if conceptual understanding is provided. The current writing flow is a little hard to follow.
2. The proposed Bioisostere data is obtain by RdKit which is based on semi-emperical methods, and accurate geometry can be obtained through DFT calculation like QM9 and OC20.

### Questions
1. Would you mind providing some illustrations about the concept of max-orbit?
2. I am not sure whether the proposed model has some connection to the paper like DeepSet [1]. Would you mind giving some insights?
3. The motivation of developing orbit-equivariance is still confusing to me. Would you mind providing more examples and situations that such symmetries are required?
