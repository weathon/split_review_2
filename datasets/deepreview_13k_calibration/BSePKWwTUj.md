## Abstract
This paper studies the multiobjective stochastic linear bandit (MOSLB) model under lexicographic ordering, where the agent aims to simultaneously maximize $m$ objectives in a hierarchical manner. This model has various real-world scenarios, including water resource planning and radiation treatment for cancer patients. However, there is no effort on the general MOSLB model except a special case called multiobjective multi-armed bandits. Previous literature provided a suboptimal algorithm for this special case, which enjoys a regret bound of $\widetilde{O}(T^{2/3})$ under a priority-based regret measure. In this paper, we propose an algorithm achieving the almost optimal regret bound $\widetilde{O}(d\sqrt{T})$ for the MOSLB model, and its metric is the general regret. Here, $d$ is the dimension of arm vector and $T$ is the time horizon. The major novelties of our algorithm include a new arm filter and a multiple trade-off approach for exploration and exploitation. Experiments confirm the merits of our algorithms and provide compelling evidence to support our analysis.

### Summary
The paper tackles the multiobjective multi-armed bandit (MOMAB) problem with objective ordering. Specifically, the paper uses lexicographic ordering to solve the issue of priority in the MOMAB setup. 

The paper proposes STE$^2$LO algorithm, an improvement of already established PF-LEX, and MTE$^2$LO algorithms which use lexicographic ordering to solve MOMAB and prove regret bound for the same. MTE$^2$LO is proved to have a regret upper bound of $\mathcal{O}(d\sqrt{T})$. 

Experimental evidence shows the prowess of the proposed algorithms.

### Strengths
The paper tackles an interesting and important problem of integrating priority of objectives in Multi-armed bandit algorithms. The method proposed is through the utilization of lexicographic ordering. 

The paper provides sufficient explanation and intuition on the novel and interesting improvements from PF-LEX to STE$^2$LO to MTE$^2$LO. 

The regret upper bounds are proved and stated clearly for both the proposed algorithms and experimental evidence is provided. 

Overall the paper is clearly written in terms of mathematical notation, definitions, assumptions, algorithms, and proofs.

### Weaknesses
Three central concerns are highlighted as follows:

1.  **Applying single objective MAB algorithms multiple times**: Would the authors provide arguments as to why it wouldn't be a good idea to just use a standard single objective MAB routine multiple times based on the objective priority order and solve the MOMAB setup? Even with a naive bound, regret of $\mathcal{O}(md\sqrt{T})$ would be achievable. This compared to the current regret bound in this paper $\mathcal{O}((\sum_{i}\lambda^i)d\sqrt{T})$ isn't clear to be a guaranteed improvement at first glance. I am willing to be completely wrong about this point. Specifically, if we were to use a standard UCB algorithm for each objective in order, the first objective would converge to an optimal arm, and then the second objective would optimize within the set of arms that are near-optimal for the first objective, and so on. It is not immediately clear why this approach would not achieve a similar or better regret bound, and a more detailed comparison is needed.

2.  **Intuition and necessity of $\lambda^i$**: Firstly, the paper keeps referencing $\lambda$ when technically it is $\lambda^i$ for each objective (please correct me if this is not the case). Secondly, $\lambda^i$ serves to establish some sort of regularity between the different objectives. I fail to see the need or necessity of doing so. If this is utterly needed, can you provide a counter-example of things going completely haywire in the absence of such regularity condition?

Personally, I am just confused about the need for such a regularity. Hope the authors can shed some light on this. The paper needs to provide a more concrete explanation of why this parameter is necessary for achieving the stated regret bounds, and what specific issues would arise without it. A more detailed analysis of the role of $\lambda^i$ in the theoretical proofs would be beneficial.

3.  **Simulations**: Is it possible to perform a simulation on a real-world dataset? Another query is that the plot appears too linear for all the algorithms even with 10000 steps. Can you either run the algorithms for longer or showcase a smaller setup where the sublinear part of the curve is visible?


### Questions
Is forced exploration required, can we not employ UCB-like schemes that take care of exploration-exploitation inherently? Why was this 
three-part exploration-exploitation preferred over UCB like universal choice?

### Summary
The paper introduces the multi-objective stochastic linear bandit model under lexicographic ordering, where in the priority ordering is given by the indices of the objectives. The work claims to achieve close to optimal regret bounds with the general regret metric.The novelty of the paper lies in the new arm filtering algorithm $LOAF$ and multiple trade off approach for exploration and exploitation in $MTE^2LO$.

### Strengths
The paper gives a clear and significant background on MAB and MOMAB before introducing the main algorithms, leading to ease of understanding.

### Weaknesses
1. Paper fails to reasonably motivate why a simple algorithm such as mentioned below would not do better - 
If we have the lexicographic ordering as defined in the paper then why not apply a simple OFUL just for 1st objective and if there are multiple arms at the end of 1st OFUL then apply OFUL for second objective and so on? Would this not achieve similar to abbasi regret?

2. Further the theorem's mentioned in the paper do not talk about the finiteness or infinite decision set $\mathcal{D}$, if the decision set is finite then the algorithm needs to be compared with that of SupLinUCB regret bounds, and if the decision set is infinite the how is it even possible to filter the arms based on chain relations?

3. I fail to understand how is the new regret formulation different from the previous regret formulation with indicator? Because if the indicator function is false then that would inherently increase the regret of the objective for different $i$.

4. In the paragraph before equation 4, it's mentioned that the decision set for all the times are determined before the game start how is it possible?

5. Having a prior knowledge of parameter $\lambda$ seems infeasible.

6. In section 2.2, it's mentioned that Lu et al., achieves Pareto regret bound that is optimal, doesn't Pareto optimal regret imply lexicographical optimal regret? How does this work go beyond this prior work?

7. Finally, there is little to no intuition on why there are 3 different phases in $MTE^2LO$?

### Questions
Questions mentioned in the above section and on Page 5 what is $SCE^2LO$ is it a typo for $STE^2LO$?

### Summary
This paper considers minimizing the regret with respect to the set of optimal arms defined according to the lexicographic ordering in stochastic linear bandits. It extends the prior work by incorporating linearly parameterized expected arm rewards. Compared to the prior work, it considers a relaxed notion of regret and shows that improved algorithms with regrets on the order of $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{T})$ can be designed. Their upper bounds diverge from classic stochastic linear bandits and multi-objective bandits in the sense that they involve a problem-dependent parameter $\lambda$ related to the rate at which different objective values change.

### Strengths
1) The study of multi-objective bandits under lexicographic ordering is a relatively under-explored area in the bandit literature. To the best of my knowledge, this paper is the first to analyze stochastic linear bandits under this setting. There exist several real-world applications where lexicographic ordering is important, making this topic worthy of investigation.


2) Introduction of $\lambda$ to capture the complexity of the optimal arm and an analysis based on that are the novel parts of this work. This allows the use of a new lexicographically ordered arm filter instead of the chain relation proposed in the prior work and, under the assumptions of the current work, yields new regret bounds.

### Weaknesses
1) It is not true that $R^i(T)$ is more stringent than $\hat{R}^i(T)$. For instance, let $\theta^1=(1,0)$, $\theta^2=(0,1)$, $x_A=(0,0)$, $x_B=(-1,1)$. In this case, $x_A$ is the lexicographic optimal arm. For a policy that always plays arm $x_B$, the $T$ round regrets are $R^1=T$, $R^2=-T$ and $\hat{R}^1=T$, $\hat{R}^2=0$. For his policy, the priority-based regret is greater than the general regret. It is also the case that priority-based regret should be harder to optimize than general regret since for the former, the lower bound is $\Omega(T^{2/3})$, while for the latter, this paper shows upper bounds of $\tilde{O}(T^{1/2})$ (but with dependence on $\lambda$ which seems to be problem-dependent).

2) Huyuk & Tekin (2021) also consider MOMAB under lexicographic ordering. They consider both priority-based regret, which is given in Equation 1, and general regret, which is given in Equation 4 (they call it priority-free regret). They have a lower bound on the priority-based regret, which is $\Omega(T^{2/3})$. This shows that MOMAB under lexicographic ordering with priority-based regret is harder than single-objective MAB for which $\tilde{O}(T^{1/2})$ upper bounds are possible. Therefore, the claim in the introduction saying that “prior work has proposed a suboptimal algorithm since the optimal regret bound for the existing single objective MAB algorithms is $O(K \log T)$” is incorrect. The comparison is flawed because the prior work's lower bound applies to priority-based regret, while the paper's upper bound applies to a different notion of regret. Furthermore, the prior work's algorithm, even when applied to a single-objective bandit, does not achieve the optimal $O(K \log T)$ regret, making the claim about suboptimality misleading.

3) From an algorithmic point of view, this paper provides novel techniques. However, the discussion with the prior work confuses the reader. There are some notable differences between the prior work and this work. The authors briefly mention that their $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{T})$ high-probability upper bounds do not contradict the $\Omega(T^{2/3})$ lower bound on the expected regret in the remark after Theorem 2. The authors justify this by saying that they focus on the pseudo-regret instead of the expected regret. I think that something is missing from the key comparison with the prior work. The proposed regret bounds are not instance-independent as they are given in terms of $\lambda$, an important parameter that represents the tradeoffs between different objectives. Utilizing this prior knowledge is crucial in achieving the time order of $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{T})$. One would expect that if the problem instance is adversarially chosen, then the algorithm proposed in the current work will not be able to achieve the claimed $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{T})$ upper bounds. For instance, given a bound on the $l_2$ norm of the true parameter vectors and $T$-round decision sets, can’t an adversary choose the true parameter vectors and decision sets such that lambda becomes a function of $T$? For the worst choice of lambda what will be the upper bounds? The dependence of the regret bound on $\lambda$ makes the bound less meaningful without a clear understanding of how $\lambda$ scales with problem parameters, especially in adversarial settings.

4) Related to the above question, consider the same $\theta$ values in my first example, and let $x_A = (1+\epsilon, 0)$, $\epsilon>0$ and $x_B = (1,1)$. Clearly, $x_A$ is the lexicographic optimal arm. For these arms, Equation 5 in the paper gives $1 \leq \lambda \epsilon$. Thus $\lambda \geq 1/\epsilon$. Let $\epsilon = T^{-1/3}$. According to Theorem 2, $R^2(T)$ of MTE$^2$LO becomes $\tilde{O}(T^{2/3})$. One should be able to construct similar examples for the case with more than two objectives. When the number of objectives increases, I expect the time order of the regret upper bound to get even worse since $i$th objective’s time order depends on $\lambda^{i-1}$. This example demonstrates that the parameter $\lambda$ is not a fixed problem characteristic but can be manipulated by the choice of arm features, leading to a degradation of the regret bound.

5) Based on the above discussion, the justification that the regret bounds are order-optimal because the scalar linear contextual bandit has a regret lower bound of $\Omega(d \sqrt{T})$ is unclear. Nearly matching upper bounds of algorithms such as LinUCB are minimax. Other than time and dimension of the feature vectors, the bounds only depend on upper bounds on the $l_2$ norms of the parameter and action vectors. It is unclear if the claim at Equation 5 is satisfied under the mild assumptions required to derive the $\tilde{O} (d \sqrt{T})$ for the scalar case (which seems not possible, based on the counter-example above). The comparison to single-objective linear bandits is not appropriate because the problem setting and assumptions are different. The $\lambda$ parameter introduces a problem-dependent complexity that is not present in the standard linear bandit setting, making the optimality claim questionable.

### Summary
This paper studied the linear setting of multiobjective stochastic bandits under lexicographic ordering. It proposed two algorithms: STE$^2$LO and MTE$^2$LO; the latter one is better. The paper provided a detailed description of the setting and explained how they proposed the two algorithms. The proposed algorithms and those existing algorithms are compared both theoretically and numerically.

================

After rebuttal: Thanks for the response. I just increased the score to 5.

### Strengths
1. The paper first introduced naive linear setting and then the multiobjective one under lexicographic ordering. Moreover, it introduced the STE$^2$LO algorithm before the MTE$^2$LO algorithm, which helps readers to understand the better but more complicated MTE$^2$LO algorithm.
1. The paper provides a detailed formulation of the multiobjective linear stochastic bandits under lexicographic ordering.
1. Numerical experiments are conducted to evaluate the performance of proposed algorithms.

### Weaknesses
Notation:
1. There seems to be a major typo among the whole writeup: do both $m$ and $d$ stand for the dimension of vectors? If so, the author(s) should consider to unify the notation. If not, may you clarify what do they mean individually?

Contribution of the work:
1. As no lower bound is provided, is there still space to improve the algorithm? What is the difficulty to provide a lower bound? As Huyuk & Tekin (2021) provided a lower bound for the priority-based regret, is it possible to derive a lower bound on the general regret similarly? Why are we interested in the general regret?
2. The STE$^2$LO and MTE$^2$LO algorithms seem to have similar structures to the SupLinRel and SupLinUCB algorithms. 
    1. The two proposed algorithms seem to be adopted versions to the multi-objective setting. May the author(s) clarify what are the analytical challenge?
    1. For this reason, the author(s) may consider to condense the description of the two algorithms.
3. The fundamental parameter $\lambda$ is assumed to be known in this work. I appreciate the elaboration of importance of $\lambda$ at the bottom of page 2. However, is it reasonable to assume that $\lambda$ is known?
    1. The abstract states that 'This model has various real-world scenarios, including water resource planning and radiation treatment for cancer patients.' However, a more detailed description of real-life application is appreciated. I surmise that this may help me to understand why we can assume that $\lambda$ is known.  
     1. In the example given in the first paragraph, what does 'click-conversion rate' mean?
4. Moreover, experiments with real-world data may make the efficiency of proposed algorithms more convincing.

Presentation:
1. I appreciate that the author(s) discussed many existing results in multiobjective bandits and related settings. However, as different settings/definitions of regret are considered, I think a table would provide a much clearer comparison.
1. I do appreciate that the author(s) introduced the standard linear setting first and the multiobjective one after that. However, the notations are defined throughout the first 3 pages. I think that a notation table may help readers to find notations.

### Questions
Except for the questions in the 'Weaknesses' section, here are more suggestions:
1. In the second paragraph of the introduction, it states that 'Therefore, if the evaluation criterion is Pareto regret, the agent can select any of the m objectives to optimize and ignore other objectives, which is unreasonable.'  
This statement is indeed strong. The author(s) may consider to explain this point a little bit more.
1. Minor suggestion in the second paragraph of  Section 3.1: 'We provide a formal definition of the chain relation to facilitate our presentation' may be a better expression than 'We give a formal definition of the chain relation to facilitate our presentation'.
