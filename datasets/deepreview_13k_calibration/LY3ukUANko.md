## Abstract
Attention-free language models that combine \textit{gating} and \textit{convolutions} are growing in popularity due to their efficiency and increasingly competitive performance.
To better understand these architectures, we pretrain a suite of 17 attention and \textit{gated-convolution} language models, finding that SoTA gated-convolution architectures still underperform attention by up to 2.1 perplexity points on the Pile. 
In fine-grained analysis, we find 82\% of the gap is explained by each model's ability to recall information that is previously mentioned in-context, \textit{e.g.} \textit{Hakuna Matata means no worries Hakuna Matata it means no $\rightarrow$ \texttt{??}}.
On this task, termed \textit{associative recall}, we find that attention outperforms gated-convolutions by a large margin: a 70M parameter attention model outperforms a 1.4 billion parameter gated-convolution model on associative recall.
This is surprising because prior work shows gated convolutions can perfectly solve synthetic tests for AR capability.  
To close the gap between synthetics and real language, we develop a new formalization of the task called multi-query associative recall (${\Task}$) that better reflects actual language.
We perform an empirical and theoretical study of ${\Task}$ that elucidates differences in the parameter-efficiency of attention and gated-convolution recall.
Informed by our analysis, we evaluate simple convolution-attention hybrids and show that hybrids with input-dependent sparse attention patterns can close 97.4\% of the gap to attention, while maintaining sub-quadratic scaling.

### Summary
The authors study the performance gap between Gated Convolution Models (GCM) and Transformers on language modeling. They show that the lacking capability of GCM on the Associative Recall (AR) task can explain most of the perplexity gap in the real world scenario. They further demonstrate two architecture modifications to GCM, i.e., adding extra attention layers or selectively looking-up for associative tokens, can bridge the performance gap. A theoretical bound of the number of parameters required for GCM to solve the Multiple Query AR task is also derived.

### Strengths
The paper provides a comprehensive study of the associative recall capability of neural language models with different neural architectures, and examines its impact on the next token prediction performance of the models on real world data.

The authors empirically demonstrate that boosting the associative recall capability of GCMs can mostly bridge its performance gap with the attention-based model under the scale of 360M parameters.

The authors derive a theoretical scaling bound for data-independent GCMs to solve AR, and validate it with synthetic data.

### Weaknesses
The novelty of the paper is limited. The lack of AR ability of State Space Models (which is a special kind of long convolution model with embedded recurrency) has been analyzed in the H3 paper [1] through synthetic data. The proposed architectural modification of hybridization is a simple replication of the Hybrid-H3.

The scale of the experiments is limited. The authors only empirically examine their hypothesis for models with the size up to 360M number of parameters. It is not clear whether their claims still holds empirically given the shrinking trend of the performance gap that can already be observed under the current setting. 

The paper does not provide important technical details for reproducibility. The implementation details of the proposed modification of selectively look-up is missing.

The research problem that the authors are trying to solve has been alleviated with existing [1,2] or emerging solutions [3,4]. The authors do not examine the empirical AR ability of data-dependant convolutions by claiming technical difficulties, but there does exist data-dependant SSMs, such as Liquid-S4 [2], that support causal language modeling. Not to mention the latest GCM, Monarch Mixer [3], that also supports causality. On hybridization, a previous work [4] on dynamic input subset selection for attention modules has also been proposed for efficiently combining SSMs with attention. The authors should consider comparing the proposed architectural modifications with these works to avoid being outdated upon publication.

### Questions
According to Table 1, it seems that as the number parameters increase the performance gap between GCMs and Transformers is shrinking. Can you explain this phenomenon? Is it possible that GCMs may outperform Transformers on a larger scale such as with 700M or 1B parameter counts?

Can you provide mathematical formulas for calculating the perplexity scores of AR hit tokens mentioned in Table 1 and Table2?

How is the selectively look-up mechanism exactly implemented to produce the numbers in Table 2? Is the attention based look-up trainable or not trainable? How is it added to the GCMs layer? Can you provide a series of formulas to describe a GCM layer that is equipped with the proposed selectively look-up mechanism?

### Summary
This paper demonstrates that convolutional LMs are worse at bigram associative recall (AR) than transformers on real data by demonstrating that the test AR perplexity is sensitive to the number of occurences of the given bigrams in the training set. This possibly suggests that convolutional LMs are worse at in-context learning than previously thought in other works that test on synthetic tasks. This work also proposes a new synthetic task called a multiquery associative recall (MQAR), and uses new theoretical insights to devise a simple convolution-only alternative competitive to attention on AR.

### Strengths
Using the bigram frequency and the test perplexity of real data was insightful.

### Weaknesses
There's a lot of typos and confusing writing. It's hard to properly understand all the theoretical claims of the work. For starters, Proposition 4.3 should say `u \in \{ 0, 1 \}^{N \times \log c}`. The description of definition 3.1 could be improved; a simple example would be quite helpful. In appendix, `N` sometimes means the entire sequence length or the number of triplets in MQAR; this confusion is exacerbated by the fact that the meaning changes in the same theorem/proof.

Page 6 states "[e]ach BaseConv layer uses O(Nd) parameters and ... O(Nd) operations". I believe it uses `O(Nd +d^2)` parameters and `O(d N log N + Nd^2)` FLOPs? This makes me believe that the rest of the theoretical results may have to be carefully revisited by the authors.

Page 26. Proof of C.19. It's unclear how `Q[i, :]` can be set to a zero vector when `i \notin Q` (also boldface 0 suffices to express a vector; no need for a superscript d; also, d is defined as `log(C)` in the same page but `C` is a set. `d = log(c)` small c since `c := |C|`.) and similarly for `K` and `V`, because QKV is actually a linear projection of the input. Linear projection can not implement this non-linear operation of masking some of the activations out. There's a sentence that reads `... where Q, K, V ... are positional embeddings ...`. They are different projections of u.

The calculation of the percentage of gap due to AR hits could be better motivated and justified in appendix.

Other minor typos:
 - `u * k = FFT^{-1} (FFT(u) FFT(k))` (should drop the convolution operation in frequency domain).
 - Page 5: Other tokens: ... `1,000` => `1250`.

### Summary
The authors systematically study the impact of neural architecture on language modeling performance. The authors identify a persisting quality gap between convolution and attention networks. Specifically, they identify a single failure mode, i.e., multi-query associative recall (MQAR), and demonstrate that convolution networks fall short in this. To verify the impact of this gap, the authors conduct systematic studies and provide both empirical and theoretical evidence. Moreover, the authors present strategies for migrating this gap.

### Strengths
The studied problem is important and may have a big impact. The pinpointed failure model (i.e., associative recall) is novel and reasonable. Both empirical and theoretical studies are conducted to support the argument. To further demonstrate the impact of the analyses, the authors examine two alternative strategies, which support the intuition of the author.

### Weaknesses
The proposed attention hybrid method seems to perform well in the experiment. However, it is not clear how it would perform on a larger scale. Specifically, while the authors demonstrate improved performance on the MQAR task, the experiments are limited to relatively small models and datasets. The jump to large-scale language modeling introduces challenges such as increased computational cost, potential instability in training, and the need for careful hyperparameter tuning, which are not fully addressed. Furthermore, the paper lacks a detailed analysis of the computational overhead introduced by the hybrid approach, particularly the selective attention mechanism. It's unclear how the computational cost scales with model size and sequence length, which is a critical consideration for practical applications.

### Questions
As to the training stability and the sensitivity to the training hyper-parameters, I'm wondering how the proposed look-up method and the hybrid method compare with the attention network.
