## Abstract
Preference based Reinforcement Learning (PbRL) removes the need to hand specify a reward function by learning a reward from preference feedback over policy behaviors. Current approaches to PbRL do not address the credit assignment problem inherent in determining which parts of a behavior most contributed to a preference, which result in data intensive approaches and subpar reward functions. We address such limitations by introducing a credit assignment strategy (Hindsight PRIOR) that uses a world model to approximate state importance within a trajectory and then guides rewards to be proportional to state importance through an auxiliary predicted return redistribution objective. Incorporating state importance into reward learning improves the speed of policy learning, overall policy performance, and reward recovery on both locomotion and manipulation tasks. For example, Hindsight PRIOR recovers on average significantly ($p<0.05$) more reward on MetaWorld ($20$\%) and DMC ($15$\%). The performance gains and our ablations demonstrate the benefits even a simple credit assignment strategy can have on reward learning and that state importance in forward dynamics prediction is a strong proxy for a state's contribution to a preference decision.

### Confidence
4: You are confident in your assessment, but not absolutely certain. It is unlikely, but not impossible, that you did not understand some parts of the submission or that you are unfamiliar with some pieces of related work.

### Summary
This work presents Hindsight PRIOR, a novel technique to guide credit assignment to improve reward inference in Preference-based Reinforcement Learning. The key contribution in this paper is the utilization of attention weights from a transformer-based world model to estimate state importance and the formulation of return redistribution to be proportional to the attention-deduced state importance. The authors present information regarding related work, their approach, and an empirical evaluation in the Deep Mind Control and MetaWorld Control Suites. The results with a synthetic labeler are positive, displaying PRIOR achieves high success across a variety of tasks.

### Strengths
+ The proposed method is an improvement to PbRL frameworks. Given the references in the paper and how humans may utilize attention similarly to transformer models, utilizing attention weights to redistribute return may improve preference-based reinforcement learning with  end-users.
+  This paper is well-written and contains sufficient detail to understand the proposed approach.
+ The evaluation is extensive, and touches on several important questions beyond simple performance.

### Weaknesses
 - It would be beneficial to note exactly how many trajectory labels such a framework requires. This would help detail whether such a framework would be feasible with actual end-users. Further, including actual tests utilizing this framework with human end-users would provide further evidence that PRIOR works well.
- Along this thread, it seems the simultaneous learning of a highly parameterized world model and reward model is accomplished faster than other works that simply inferring a reward model, as shown by the sample-efficiency in policy learning. Could you comment on why this is the case? I'm unsure if this relates to a paragraph on page 2 referencing the choice of architecture of the reward network.
- As PRIOR utilizes PEBBLE as its backbone algorithm, this should be touched on in the related work.
-  In the evaluation, there are several references that are not labeled correctly and lead to ??. As several of these baselines are not referenced or explained previously, it leads to confusion regarding the results.
- Could you provide justification on why the attention coefficient for the state and action should be equally waited within the \alpha coefficient?

### Summary
This paper addresses the credit assignment problem in preference-based Reinforcement Learning (PbRL) algorithms. Given sparse feedback, it is challenging to determine where rewards should be assigned in a trajectory, i.e., which states are significant. The proposed solution combines the classical PbRL algorithm PEBBLE with a prior obtained from a world model. This approach assumes that states receiving high attention in the world model are likely to be rewarding, assigning them higher weight when estimating the reward function. The algorithm is evaluated on simulated problems from the DMC suite and MetaWorld control.

### Strengths
The issue of preference-based RL and the credit assignment problem is highly relevant, particularly considering the need for numerous samples to accurately estimate the reward function.

The idea of utilizing the attention layers of the learned world model to identify rewarding state-action pairs is creative and seemingly novel, offering a straightforward but effective solution.

The approach outperforms other methods, demonstrating its effectiveness in comparison.

The paper is well-written and presents its content in an understandable manner.

### Weaknesses
The primary limitation of this work, as acknowledged in the paper, is its reliance on the assumption that states deemed important by the world model are also significant for reward design. While this insight is valuable, the contribution of the paper might be relatively modest, given that the primary novelty lies in a straightforward implementation of this assumption and its evaluation. With that, the quality of the contribution may not fully meet the requirements for acceptance at ICLR.

The paper would benefit from additional work to clarify the extent to which the learned attention in world models aids in task characterization for interpretability and transferability, as these are key applications of reward learning (building on Q3 in the paper).

### Summary
This paper presents a new credit assignment strategy for efficiently learning a reward function in preference-based reinforcement learning (PbRL). The preference-based reward model relies on the well-known Bradley-Terry model, and the basic loss consists of the standard cross-entropy loss between the predicted and the true preference labels. The novel contribution of this paper is an additional loss term that redistributes the expected discounted return to each state-action pair in a particular manner. Specifically, a transformer-based forward dynamics model is learned as an auxiliary task, and the expected discounted return is redistributed to be proportional to the attention weights of the state-action pairs. This additional loss term serves as the prior for reward learning, and the authors hypothesize that it leads to sample efficiency and overall policy performance. The empirical evaluation on Deep Mind Control (DMC) and MetaWorld control tasks suggest positive results.

### Strengths
A major strength of the paper is that the proposed framework is general in the sense that it can be applied to different baseline PbRL algorithms to improve sample efficiency and performance.
In the beginning it was not intuitive to believe that the return should be redistributed according to attention weights of the forward dynamics, but the explanation provided in Appendix I is somewhat convincing that the attention weights are reflective of critical events that summarize the whole trajectory, and thus it is those critical state-action pairs that contribute the most to the success/failure of the trajectory.

### Weaknesses
The authors propose an intriguing approach to boost the performance of PbRL, but some of the empirical results presented in Section 5 reveal some weaknesses. In particular, in the Drawer Open / 4000 task in Figure 2, the success rate of the proposed approach plateaus after 400k steps and is eventually surpassed by some other baselines. This might imply that the hindsight prior eventually hurts the performance of the learned policy as more preference labels become available, potentially due to an overreliance on the prior that does not accurately reflect the nuances of human preferences in this specific task. Similarly, in Section 5.3 the authors find that a large coefficient on the prior loss leads to a collapse of the learned policy. Those observations indicate that such a prior is assistive of policy learning only up to a certain point (e.g. relatively small preference data or small prior coefficient), and it may eventually hurt the performance if we exceed those bars. It would be beneficial to investigate the sensitivity of the proposed method to the amount of preference data and the prior coefficient, and to explore potential strategies for dynamically adjusting the weight of the prior loss during training.

In terms of the presentation of the paper, there is much room for improvement. First, some citations and references are missing and appearing as “?” or “??”. Second, some performance plots in Section 5 have too many curves of similar colors and widths, making it difficult to extract information from them. Specifically, I suggest that the authors use different line styles for Figure 2 (in particular for SAC since it’s an oracular baseline). The left two figures of Figure 3 are also hard to read as there are 8 line plots on each tiny figure. Third, the explanation of hindsight prior is confusing and needs elaboration/clarification. (a) The transformer uses H attention heads, but H does not appear in the definition of the attention matrix A. (b) Equation (4) uses the notation $R_{target}$ and $\hat{R}$, but it is unclear how it is related to $\hat{\mathbf{r}}_{\psi}$ and $\mathbf{r}_{target}$ in the line above. The relationship between the attention weights and the expected discounted return should be made more explicit, and the notation should be unified for clarity.

### Questions
1) In the explanation of equation (3), the authors define H as the entropy. Do you mean “cross entropy” there?


2) A recent study [1] finds that reporting the mean and variance for performance evaluation of RL policies is insufficient, and suggests reporting confidence intervals or performance profiles as more objective measures. Have you considered them at all instead of the t-test?
