## Abstract
We contribute a novel multi-agent architecture capable of learning a discrete communication protocol without any prior knowledge of the task to solve. We focus on ensuring agents can create a common language during their training to be able to cooperate and solve the task at hand, which is one of the primary goals of the emergent communication field. On top of this, we focus on increasing the task's difficulty by creating a novel referential game, based on the original Lewis Game, that has two new sources of complexity: adding random noise to the message being transmitted and the capability for multiple interactions between the agents before making a final prediction. When evaluating the proposed architecture on the newly developed game, we observe that the emerging communication protocol's generalization aptitude remains equivalent to architectures employed in much simpler and elementary games. Additionally, our method is the only one suitable to produce robust communication protocols that can handle cases with and without noise while maintaining increased generalization performance levels.

### Summary
The paper focus on creating a common language among agents to enable cooperation and solve tasks in noisy environments. Then the authors present a novel multi-agent architecture for learning a discrete communication protocol without prior knowledge of the task to solve. The authors introduce a referential game based on the Lewis Game, with added complexity of random noise in message transmission and multiple interactions between agents before making a final prediction. The proposed architecture demonstrates equivalent generalization aptitude to simpler games, while being the only method capable of producing robust communication protocols that handle cases with and without noise.

### Strengths
- The paper introduces a novel multi-agent architecture for learning a communication protocol without prior knowledge of the task, and it explores the challenges of noisy environments and multiple interactions, which adds originality to the field.
- The paper provides a detailed analysis of the learning strategy for both agents, and it presents a comprehensive architecture with different modules for processing messages and images.
- The paper's contributions are significant as it addresses the goal of creating a common language among agents for cooperation and solving tasks. It also explores the impact of noise and demonstrates the ability to produce robust communication protocols. The findings have implications for understanding emergent communication and its applications in challenging environments.

### Weaknesses
However, 

- The paper could benefit from comparing the proposed architecture to existing approaches in the field of emergent communication. This would provide a better understanding of the novelty and effectiveness of the proposed method.
- The evaluation of the proposed architecture is focused on the newly developed referential game. It would be valuable to evaluate the architecture on a wider range of tasks and compare its performance to other architectures to assess its generalizability.
- While the paper mentions the capability of the proposed architecture to handle noise, there is limited discussion on how the architecture specifically addresses and mitigates the impact of noise in the communication channel. Providing more details on this aspect would enhance the clarity and understanding of the proposed method.
- Ablation studies, where different components or modules of the architecture are systematically removed or modified, could provide insights into the contribution and importance of each component. This would strengthen the analysis and understanding of the proposed architecture.

### Summary
The paper introduces a novel multi-agent architecture for emergent robust communication, emphasizing a shared language in noisy environments. The research also presents a new referential game, enhancing complexity and interaction."

### Strengths
1. The research adeptly merges insights from human language evolution with artificial language development, leveraging deep learning to highlight the capabilities of neural agents in autonomous communication.
2. By innovatively adapting the Lewis Game with noise and time elements, the authors elevate its realism, creating a more comprehensive and challenging framework.
3. The paper's emphasis on developing robust communication protocols for noisy environments is both timely and crucial, addressing a pivotal challenge in the field.

### Weaknesses
1. The authors' reliance on established paradigms like the Lewis Game, even with modifications, raises concerns about true innovation. Is this just a repackaging of old concepts?
2. The paper lacks a rigorous empirical validation of its proposed architecture, leaving readers questioning its real-world applicability.
3. While the literature review is extensive, the paper falls short in critically analyzing the limitations of referenced works, resulting in potential oversights in the proposed methodology.
4. The emphasis on noise adaptation, though relevant, is hardly novel in the field of emergent communication. The authors fail to differentiate their approach sufficiently from existing solutions.
5. The comparative approach with Ueda & Washio 2021 feels superficial, lacking in-depth analysis on fundamental differences

### Questions
1. Given the modifications you've introduced to the Lewis Game, how do you justify that these changes bring genuine innovation in the context of multi-agent reinforcement learning, as opposed to simply adding complexity to an existing framework?
2. The concept of noise adaptation in emergent communication is not new. How does your approach fundamentally differ from existing solutions, and what unique challenges does it address in the multi-agent reinforcement learning landscape?
3. Your comparison with the Ueda & Washio 2021 study appears to lack depth. Could you elucidate the fundamental differences in the underlying assumptions, problem formulations, and outcomes between their work and yours, especially in the context of multi-agent dynamics?

### Summary
The authors propose a new architecture for emergent communication in environments without prior knowledge. The proposed method operates under a variation of the traditional Lewis Games where random noise is often added to the messages.

### Strengths
This paper analyses a variation of the popular Lewis Games, MRILG, where the agents can take advantage of more information coming from the others before taking an action. Additionally, in these games noise is added to the messages, which is important because communication is often noisy and it should be investigated how communication can be done under noisy conditions.

### Weaknesses
 * This paper does not explore the type of messages learned by the agents. It would be interesting to visualize in some way some of the messages learned by the agents to communicate.
* The entropy term in the loss is not defined in the paper and the motivations for the use of this term do not seem good enough. Specifically, the paper lacks a clear explanation of how this term contributes to the learning process and why it is necessary for the agents to achieve effective communication. The authors should provide a more detailed justification for its inclusion, perhaps by analyzing its impact on the learned communication protocols.
* In table 2, I wonder about the significance of these results; of course the agents are trained with noise, they will perform better in noisy testing than agents that were not trained with noise. The paper does not provide a strong argument for why these results are significant beyond what is expected. A more thorough analysis of the learned communication strategies under noisy and noiseless conditions is needed to justify the contribution.
* The use of noise is framed as a major contribution. However, using random noise in the messages is not new; the authors give the example of the work with the zipfs law to analyse language properties (page 2) but this is not the only place where noise is used and analysed [1, 2, 4]. The paper should acknowledge the existing body of work that uses noise and clearly delineate the novel aspects of their approach.

Minor:
* In page 3: "When there is no ambiguity, we drop the dependence of for $m(x; \theta)$": "of for" repeated
* In page 5: "and effective game round, $i \in {1, . . . , I}$" it seems that the number of rounds in now defined as $I$ while before in section 2.2 it was defined as $N$
* Throughout section 2, $x$ is referred to both as the original message sent by the speaker and as the prediction made by the listener
* There are too many complex equations written within the text. Some of them should be written instead in equation blocks as the way it is done becomes difficult to read.

### Questions
1. In section 2.2, it is unclear to me what is the $unk$ token and how the noise is applied. From equation (1) I understand it results from the noise function if $p\leq\lambda$, but I fail to understand where $unk$ comes from. Is it a fixed token? If so, I cannot agree that noise is being applied to the message, also because, according to the equation, the message $m$ is not affecting any of the generated noise. Could the authors elaborate on this?
2. It is unclear to me what $\hat{x}$ means. In page 3, it is both stated "where the goal is to try to identify the image $x â\in C$ that the Speaker received, $\hat{x}= x$" and "round when the Listener plays the I don't know (idk) action, \hat{x} = \hat{x}_{idk}". It seems to have different meaning in each case. In the first case it seems to denote the guess of the listener and in the second it seems to define an action. Could the authors clarify?
3. In page 6: "where we linearly increase the noise level in the communication channel from 0 to $\lambda$.". From equation (1) $\lambda$ represents a probability of wether insert noise or not. How does increasing $\lambda$ will increase the level of noise? While it can happen, it does not seem necessarily true that it will happen.
4. In tables 1 and 2, since LG(RL) and NLG are the same but NLG uses noise (as described in section 3.1); how is the accuracy of NLG much higher? is the existence of noise ($\lambda\geq 0$) beneficial for learning?
5. Is the variation LG(RL) a contribution (as stated in section 3.1)? REINFORCE as been used before in emergent communication games [3, 4]
6. do the authors allow the gradients to flow across agents as it happens in works such as DIAL [5], or are they fully independent?

Overall, I have several concerns regarding the contribution of this work and the approaches presented that I would like the authors to comment on.

### Summary
This paper proposes a novel environment for emergent communication. It modifies the original Lewis Game by adding random noise to the communication channel and allowing the receiver to wait for multiple rounds before making the decision. In the experiments, communication protocols that emerged in different variants of the Lewis Game are compared. Protocols produced through this new environment are shown to be more robust and generalizable.

### Strengths
1. This paper brings attention to a new research direction – robust communication in the emergent communication field. It is an important topic worth exploring. Environments and training frameworks are carefully designed for this new task.

2. A comprehensive suite of evaluations is conducted to cover various aspects of the environment and framework design. Also, different tasks and evaluation metrics are considered.

### Weaknesses
1. Multi-round Lewis Game

    a. There are several works introducing the multi-round Lewis Game and its corresponding listener architectures [1,2]. Justification would be better to underscore your contribution by comparing and contrasting these literatures. Specifically, the differences in the listener architectures and the complexity of the game should be highlighted. It's unclear how this work differs from existing multi-round approaches, particularly in terms of the number of tokens used and the method of candidate discrimination.

    b. From the experimental results (Table 3,4,7,8), the accuracies of game variants with/without multiple rounds do not differ a lot. More elaboration or experiments are expected to ablate the contribution of the multi-round setting. The current results do not convincingly demonstrate the necessity or advantage of the multi-round setup. It would be beneficial to explore specific scenarios where the multi-round setting provides a clear benefit over single-round communication.

2. Training and testing in the same noisy environment may not be enough to show that “robust communication” emerges:

    a. We consider the noise may come from the observation beside the communication channel, for example from the sender or receiver sides.  [3] The current setup only introduces noise during message transmission. It is important to consider other sources of noise, such as noisy observations from the sender or the receiver, which could more realistically model real-world communication scenarios.

    b. Instead of also replacing message tokens during testing, other interfering methods to the communication channel can be applied, for example randomly dropping tokens in the messages. The current method of replacing tokens with an *unk* token is a specific type of noise. Exploring other types of noise, such as random token dropping, would provide a more comprehensive evaluation of the robustness of the learned communication protocols.

    c. What will be the result when the agents are trained with $\lambda=0.75$ and test with 0.5 and vice versa? This is an important experiment to evaluate the generalization capability of the model across different noise levels. It is unclear if the model is truly robust or simply overfits to a specific noise level.

    d. How would compare with previous works on adding noise to the communication channel? [4,5] It is necessary to compare the approach to existing methods of adding noise, particularly in terms of the type of noise and the training paradigm (e.g., DIAL vs RIAL). The current work does not adequately contextualize its approach within the existing literature on noisy communication channels.

### Questions
1. What is the maximum number of round $I$ set to? Throughout the training process, does the average number of communicative rounds vary a lot? For example, from more rounds to fewer rounds? This may help validate your multi-round design.

2. There are several references missing on page 6.
