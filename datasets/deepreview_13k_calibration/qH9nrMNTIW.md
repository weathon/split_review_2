## Abstract
Generating 3D ligand molecules that bind to specific protein targets via diffusion models has shown great promise for structure-based drug design. The key idea is to disrupt molecules into noise through a fixed forward process and learn its reverse process to generate molecules from noise in a denoising way. However, existing diffusion models primarily focus on incorporating protein-ligand interaction information solely in the reverse process, and neglect the interactions in the forward process. The inconsistency between forward and reverse processes may impair the binding affinity of generated molecules towards target protein. In this paper, we propose a novel Interaction Prior-guided Diffusion model (IPDiff) for the protein-specific 3D molecular generation by introducing geometric protein-ligand interactions into both diffusion and sampling process. Specifically, we begin by pretraining a protein-ligand interaction prior network (IPNet) by utilizing the binding affinity signals as supervision. Subsequently, we leverage the pretrained prior network to (1) integrate interactions between the target protein and the molecular ligand into the forward process for adapting the molecule diffusion trajectories (prior-shifting), and (2) enhance the binding-aware molecule sampling process (prior-conditioning). Empirical studies on CrossDocked2020 dataset show IPDiff can generate molecules with more realistic 3D structures and state-of-the-art binding affinities towards the protein targets, with up to -6.42 Avg. Vina Score, while maintaining proper molecular properties. https://github.com/YangLing0818/IPDiff

### Summary
The authors present IPDiff for structure based drug design - wherein they propose to factor receptor-ligand pocket interactions into the noising and de-noising of the diffusion models. They do so by training IPNet which models the receptor and ligand as graphs - and is trained to predict the binding affinity. The trained IPNet is then used towards what the authors term as prior shifting - where the diffusion trajectories of forward process are influenced by the interactions. The authors then design a prior-conditioning step to enhance the reverse process by conditioning the denoising of ligand molecules on the previously estimated protein-ligand interactions.

### Strengths
1. The ideas to perform prior shifting and prior-conditioning for structure based drug design are novel to the best of my knowledge.
2. The proposed mechanism achieves SOTA performance on CrossDocked2020 benchmark, and is also able to generate
the molecules with -6.42 Avg. Vina Score (in comparison to -5.67 from prior baselines) while maintaining proper molecular properties. The authors also present the impact of prior shifting and conditioning in their model analysis section.

### Weaknesses
The clarity of the paper could be improved. Specifically
1. The paper cites Sattoras et al - and says its an SE(3) Equivariant neural network - whereas it is E(N) GNN. This is important to consider in the context of protein molecules as chirality is an important property of protein molecules.
2. The paper explicitly uses message passing only over the neighboring nodes as a part of IPNet. This is in contrast to E(N) GNN wherein, messages are passed between all pairs of nodes. Again this is crucial is this what ensures it is a rigid body and allows for E(3) equivariance/ invariances. The authors haven't show their version is SE(3) equivariant.
3. In section 4.2.1 it is unclear how it S is trained to ensure the molecule is not distorted to impossible molecules - as its not a simple translation matrix but positions for every atom - and can lead to arbitrary invalid deformations.
4. Using the pocket structure for the diffusion process is counter intuitive. When we start with the receptor for an unknown ligand (small molecules which we wish to discover) - the pocket or the holo structure of the receptor is not a single conformation (but an ensemble). Moreover, without the presence of the ligand - we only have access to the apo structure of the receptor.

### Questions
Please address the concerns in the weaknesses section.

Additionally, in Section 3/ 4.1 - How are the receptor and ligand graphs constructed - is it based on atom connectivity or distances between atoms?

### Summary
This work is focused on improving the quality of the generated molecular pose within the protein pocket by3D-diffusion protein-ligand models. Authors argue that the different utilisation of the protein-ligand interactions by the forward and reverse process impacts the quality of the  generated structures.  In particular this is because the differences of the pocket binding sites in training samples are neglected by the forward process while leveraged during the reverse process. Authors explored this problem by proposing a solution where they adapt the trajectories such that these contain information about the protein-ligand interactions into the forward process by altering the drift of the diffusion trajectory based on the interactions while conditioning the reverse diffusion trajectory on the estimates of the protein-ligand interaction. 

Authors introduce atom-wise cross attention layer to model intra- and intermolecular interactions of protein ligand pairs which they use  foir pre-training and use the pretrained representations in the diffusion model. 
Authors further  provide comparisons with various methods to demonstrate the strengths of their proposed approach.

### Strengths
- The paper is very clearly written, the authors identified an interesting problem for which they proposed a solution and demonstrated by well designed experiments, that their proposed solution works well. 
- The derivations of actions on the forward and backward diffusion kernels  and training objectives are provided in the Appendix, very clearly written and easy to follow. 
- The ablation study exploring the role of the scaller within the drift correction  of the forward process is provided.
- The experiments are sufficiently described and most likely reproducible.

### Weaknesses
 - There are minor typos on various places of the manustript. 
- The edge cases such as molecules with high number of rotable bonds are not investigated.

### Questions
1. What is the difference in the chemical diversity of the datasets used for training IPNET and IPDfiff? e.g. different scaffolds, molecules with large flexibility, etc. Were the poses used in testing and evaluation of  IPDiff excluded from the training set for IPNet? 

2. How does the model perform when generating the molecules with larger numbers of rotatable bonds? How does the model generalises into unseen targets and novel pockets? 

3. What is the percentage of the  novel molecules generated by the IPDiff? 

4. IPDiff generates molecules in average 31s per molecule. How fast is the docking algorithm on the same hardware and similar sized structures?

### Summary
In this paper, the authors propose to augment standard diffusion-based models for pocked-conditioned 3D ligand generation. The proposed approach, called IPDiff, leverages protein-ligand interactions in both the forward and reverse diffusion processes. The protein-ligand interaction is learned with an auxiliary network (called IPNet) and trained separately on a PDBBind. The authors show good results (on standard metrics) on CrossDocked2020 dataset.

### Strengths
- The main idea of the paper—to leverage protein-ligand interactions to improve generation of 3D ligands—is novel and well motivated.
- The paper shows that ligand generation conditioned on pocket can be improved (at least in the case of diffusion models) if one can successfully leverage protein-ligand interactions.
- The proposed approach achieves good results on benchmark metrics/datasets (however, this method requires labeled data and one extra trained network, so comparisons aren’t really apples-to-apples)

### Weaknesses
 - The proposed method improves over the baseline (diffusion model conditioned on pocket) by relying on supervised learning on PDBbind. This makes the model more complicated to train/use and, more importantly, more difficult to scale. These points needs to be mentioned in the main paper. 
- IPNet is trained on PDBBind and then it is used as a feature extractor to the training of the diffusion model. What if PDBBind contains samples that are similar (or identical) to those on the test set of CrossDocked? If this is the case, the good performance could be due to some kind of “leaking” of information from the test set to the training set. The authors did not mention anything about this on the manuscript.
- The authors use the same metrics reported on previous work. Although this is good for benchmarking, it is well now by the community that these metrics are not great. For example, recent work (eg, PoseCheck and PoseBusters) propose other metrics that can better assess quality of generated molecules. It would be very nice the authors would have shown results on these metrics. 
- Since the authors leverage protein-ligand interactions, it would be nice to compare how good the generated molecules are in terms of protein-ligand interactions with the pockets. Posecheck (mentioned above) proposes a metric to measure to compute this, but many other could be imagined.

### Questions
- Please see the comments on "Weaknesses" above.
- What is the objective used to train IPNet? Was it mean square errors? What is the ground-truth label and what is its range? I feel some details about the training of IPNet are missing.
- In the last paragraph of the Introduction, the authors say that “IPDiff is theoretically able to achieve better likelihood compared to previous diffusion models”. Can the authors elaborate on this? 
- Between equation 10 and 11, the authors mention that they need to approximate X_0^M and V_0^M (since we dont have access to ground truth during generation). How bad is this approximation? How much performance is lost because of this? Would it be possible to do some experiment to analyse it?
- Based on the results on the tables of this paper, the proposed method has better metrics than the reference. This seems a bit strange to me and points to the fact that the metrics used are probably not very informative/useful. What does this mean in the opinion of the authors?

### Summary
This paper introduces a novel approach to 3D molecule generation for structure-based drug design using diffusion models. Recognizing the inconsistency in existing diffusion models that incorporate protein-ligand interaction information predominantly in the reverse process, the authors propose the Interaction Prior-guided Diffusion model (IPDiff). IPDiff integrates geometric protein-ligand interactions into both the diffusion and sampling processes. The methodology involves pretraining an interaction prior network (IPNet) using binding affinity signals, followed by leveraging this network to adjust molecule diffusion trajectories (termed "prior-shifting") and enhance the binding-aware molecule sampling process (referred to as "prior-conditioning"). Empirical studies on the CrossDocked2020 dataset demonstrate that IPDiff can effectively generate molecules with realistic 3D structures that exhibit superior binding affinities towards target proteins, while preserving essential molecular properties.

### Strengths
1. The concept of "Prior-Shifting" is innovative. Adjusting the forward process based on specific data can indeed enhance the efficiency of reverse diffusion.

2. The paper's presentation is well-structured and coherent.

### Weaknesses
1. The author's evaluation seems limited to the CrossDocked2020 benchmark. For a more comprehensive assessment, it would be beneficial to test the method across multiple benchmarks.

2. “In the forward process, the ways of injecting noises are the same for all training samples with different target proteins.” While the statement mentions that the noise injection methods are consistent for all training samples with varying target proteins, it's essential to recognize that the forward diffusion process might differ. Even if the noise injection methods remain the same, the original samples' distinctiveness ensures varied forward diffusion outcomes. The concern here is that the method may not be truly adapting the forward process based on the protein target, but rather relying on the inherent differences in the initial ligand structures.

3. It's noteworthy that there have been prior studies that learned the beta parameters for forward diffusion. A comparative analysis with those works would add depth to this study. Specifically, it's unclear if the performance gains are due to the prior-shifting mechanism or simply a better-tuned noise schedule.

4. Based on"Analog bits: Generating discrete data using diffusion models with self-conditioning," the novelty of the prior conditioning contribution in this paper appears less significant. The self-conditioning approach in the cited work already demonstrates a method for incorporating information from the diffusion process itself, and it is not clear how the proposed prior-conditioning significantly differs or improves upon this.

5. I am also quite curious whether this prior-shifting idea can be used in class-conditional image generation as different classes are very different.
