## Abstract
In many machine learning applications, the most relevant items for a particular query should be efficiently extracted. The relevance function is typically an expensive neural similarity model making the exhaustive search infeasible. A typical solution to this problem is to train another model that separately embeds queries and items to a vector space, where similarity is defined via the dot product or cosine similarity. This allows one to search the most relevant objects through fast approximate nearest neighbors search at the cost of some reduction in quality. To compensate for this reduction, the found candidates are then re-ranked by the expensive similarity model. In this paper, we propose an alternative approach that utilizes the relevances of the expensive model to make relevance-based embeddings. We show both theoretically and empirically that describing each query by its relevance for a set of support items creates a powerful query representation. Additionally, we investigate several strategies for selecting these support items and show that additional significant improvements can be obtained. Our experiments on diverse datasets show improved performance over existing approaches.

### Summary
In this paper, the authors have introduced a novel approach for generating embeddings based on the relevance between query-item sets and item-query sets, which they refer to as Relevance-Based Embedding (RBE). Unlike traditional methods that focus on individual query-item relevance pairs, RBE represents a query with a relevance score based on a defined set of support items, and conversely, it represents items with relevance scores on a set of support queries.

Moreover, the paper also presents strategies for the selection of these support items and queries.

### Strengths
Strength:
1. A Novel approach for query and item representation.
2. Experimental analysis on 7 real world text and recommendation datasets.

### Weaknesses
Comparison with matrix factorizations: The RBE approach is a collaborative filtering recommendation approach. The relevance score collaborative filtering has traditional methods like matrix factorization (low norm decomposition) and mixed filtering approaches like Factorization machines. How does RBE compare to them? It will be nice to have a detailed differentiation and comparison between RBE and matrix factorization.

There can be certain tail queries that are highly relevant to non support items. How does their representation get affected?

### Questions
1. How does RBE based embedding works for ranking in MsMarco query-passage/document datasets?
2. There can be certain tail queries that are highly relevant to non support items. How does their representation get affected?

### Summary
This paper investigates relevance-based embeddings. The authors employ support items to construct relevance vectors before training an embedding on top of them. This approach preserves the efficiency advantages of the dual-encoder model in comparison to the cross-encoder and enhances the performance based on previous test results for dual-encoder models. Unlike previous work, such as AnnCUR, which also utilizes the concept of support items, this paper generalizes the embedding format, achieves superior test accuracy, and additionally explores the selection of support items.

### Strengths
1. An innovative method to enhance the performance of the dual-encoder while preserving its efficiency.
2. A generalization of AnnCUR’s approach to using support items, accompanied by proofs of the method’s expressiveness.
3. A comprehensive study examining the impact of various choices of support items.
4. A clear description of the method and experiments conducted.

### Weaknesses
1. I am concerned that the experiments conducted on the author's method may only be effective in scenarios such as "entity linking," or similar straightforward datasets characterized by a clear clustering structure based on entities. Is it feasible to apply the author's method to different types of datasets, such as "question-answer datasets"? Specifically, the method's reliance on support items that are semantically close might not translate well to tasks where the relationship between query and answer is more complex or abstract, lacking the clear entity-based clustering. For instance, in question-answering, the relevant information might be scattered across multiple documents or require complex reasoning, making the selection of effective support items challenging.
2. While the author's method does extend the capabilities of AnnCUR, the performance improvement shown in the table from AnnCUR+KMeans to RBE+KMeans is somewhat modest, with an increase of less than 2 percent in most columns except for the first one. This raises a question about the practical significance of the improvement, especially considering the added complexity of the RBE method. The marginal gains might not justify the additional computational overhead and implementation effort, particularly if the baseline AnnCUR+KMeans is already performing reasonably well.
3. Although efficiency is a noted advantage of dual-encoder based methods, employing a large set of support items can also lead to substantial computational complexity. Would it be possible to conduct a comparison of efficiency between the author's method, dual-encoder, and cross-encoder, along with a comparison of their respective accuracies? I believe that such a comparison of efficiency is crucial. The analysis should not only focus on the inference time, but also consider the training time and the memory footprint of the proposed method, especially when dealing with a large number of support items.

### Questions
1. At the conclusion of page 6, I found myself confused about the necessity for concatenating R(SI, q) with F(R(SI, q), θ). What is the rationale behind not solely utilizing the second term? How does this tie into your previous statement regarding the examination of whether such vector transformations enhance the quality of predictions?
2. Regarding Theorem 1, is there any limitation on the sizes of SQ and SI? The guarantee of expressivity may become insignificant if SQ or SI encompasses the entire dataset.

### Summary
This paper is in the retrieval-and-rank setting where, in practice, there are usually a low-cost retrieve stage to get a subset of good items, followed by a reranking stage to use complicated method for fine-grained ranking. The paper proposes to build embedding for query and item based on the later reranking stage, and leverage that for the first retrieval stage. There are theories proved to justify the soundness, followed by some experiment results showing the effectiveness of the proposed method.

### Strengths
I believe 5-10 years ago, even embedding based KNN is considered slow and is not used in the retrieval stage. Instead people use locality Hashing or approximate KNN. Now there are fundamental advancement in terms of embedding based KNN acceleration, and this paper's topic becomes very important. Given we need to do a sophisticated reranking, is it possible to use embedding to approximate. This will largely help with the performance of the recommendation or information retrieval task. In addition to that, the theory is sound in the paper. One extension could be about the estimation of the dimension needed for a tolerance \epsilon, but that will bring in a lot of difficulties. The writing before section 4 is also informative and clear. Overall I believe it's a good paper.

### Weaknesses
How to make the work practical seems to be the number one weakness. Though it's proved that such decomposition exists, finding those embedding mapping for Q and I can be very difficult. I'm looking for a more rigorous way to do that. For example, how to set the right dimension and have the confidence that the dimension is good enough the meet the approximation error \epsilon. How to set the right \epsilon and knowing it's small enough to ensure the retrieval quality is better than existing method e.g. from a set of embedding learned just for the retrieval stage.

In addition, I don't think "relevance" matters much in the context of the paper. Rewriting the paper into the standard retrieve-and-rank language would help. The problem is essentially how to improve the coarse retrieve stage by leveraging the rank stage model. The latter doesn't have to be a relevance model, but rather any fine-grained reranking model. The paper mentioned some examples like QA, which also doesn't fall into the relevance setting. One of the most popular use cases is to concatenate Q and I for transformer-based model to handle, and it's also not necessarily a relevance model.

In the experiment part, the latency or other system related metrics should be reported as well. The number of items retrieved could be tuned based on the retrieval stage quality as well as the system constraint. Directly comparing the proposed embedding with other baselines may not be helpful. They can easily be used to retrieve different number of items before reranking. Given the two-stage setting is mainly for computational cost concern (otherwise one can just use the reranking model for all Q-I pairs), the computation/system metrics are worth checking and reporting.

The writing in section 4 seems much worse compared to the previous sections. There are details or intuitions lacking (potentially due to page limit). Also adding multi-modal datasets e.g. video-language retrieval could help strengthen the paper.

### Summary
This paper proposes a novel approach to ML-based query matching: instead of the classical "fast-and-cheap-retrieval followed by high-quality re-ranking," the authors propose leveraging the more expensive re-ranking model to create relevance-based embeddings. This approach describes each query by its relevance wrt a set of support elements, and the authors investigate several strategies for selecting these support items and show empirically that such a strategy leads to significant improvements.

### Strengths
The problem tackled in this paper (i.e., efficient relevant retrieval) has strategic practical applications, from Information Retrieval to Recommender Systems to Question Answering. 
 
The approach introduced in this paper appears to be original: while building on pre-existing work [Yadav et al 2022] [Morozov & Babenko, 2019], the authors introduce an original, principled, non-random way to identify the support elements for the computation of the Relevance-Based Embeddings (RBE). Their experiments show that the novel approach outperforms previous work in this field. 

The paper is reasonably well-written and organized, which makes is fairly easy to follow.

### Weaknesses
The paper can be most improved by clarifying and beefing up the Empirical Section:
- the 7 datasets that you are using are extremely small in size (the largest has only 104K items)
- related to the issue above, please explain whether (and how) your approach can scale to 10 B items (i.e., up to 5 orders of magnitude)
- you should add as additional datasets at least one large-size Question Answering domain; this would show that (i) your approach can scale, and (ii) your approach also applies to one of the most-studied problems of the last few decades

OTHER COMMENTS:
- to increase the readability of Table 2, please color-code the top-1/2/3 results (eg, Red, Green, Blue)
- in the caption of Table 4, please specify what metric do the numbers represent (like you din in Table 2, 3, and 5)
- your last paragraph of the intro is very weak. Please beef-it up and quantify your statements with an intuitive summary of your main empirical results
- you should take 3-4 sentences to intuitively explain Figure 1. In the current draft, you (wrongfully) refer to it as "Fig 3.1" , and you do not offer any narrative explaining (the intuition behind)MLP it.
- in the intro, to make the paper easier to follow by non-specialist readers, it would be nice to add 3-4 sentences to discuss the intuition behind dual-/cross- encoders and the types of features that each of them can use (and why)
- please add a reference to the page 1 statement "the cross-encoder ones are generally more powerful"
- before using an acronym for the first time, please use the full-name (eg, on top of page 2, with the use of "MLP")
- a few language issues:
   - p 1: "straightforward search is unacceptable" --> "brute-force/exhaustive search is not feasible"
   - p 2: "exchange of complexity for quality" --> "trading-off complexity for quality"
   - p 5: "films" --> "movies"
   - p 8: "with the exception of one dataset" --> "with the exception of one dataset (Military)"
   - multiple places: "real" --> "real-world"
