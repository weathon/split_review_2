## Abstract
Multi-source learning is a machine learning approach that involves training on data from multiple sources. Applied domains such as healthcare and finance have been increasingly using multi-source learning to improve model performance. However, datasets collected from different sources can be non-identically distributed, leading to degradation in model performance. Most existing methods for assessing dataset similarity are limited by being dataset or task-specific. They propose similarity metrics that are either unbounded and dependent on dataset dimension and scale, or require model-training.  Moreover, these metrics can only be calculated by exchanging data across sources, which can be a privacy concern in domains such as healthcare and finance. To address these challenges, we propose a novel bounded metric for assessing dataset similarity. Our metric exhibits several desirable properties: it is dataset-agnostic, considers label information, and requires no model training. First, we establish a theoretical connection between our metric and the learning process. Next, we extensively evaluate our metric on a range of real-world datasets and demonstrate that our cost metric assigns scores that align with how these data were collected. Further, we show a robust and interpretable relationship between our metric and multi-source learning performance. Finally, we provide a privacy-preserving method to calculate our metric. Our metric can provide valuable insights for deep learning practitioners using multi-source datasets.

### Summary
The paper proposes a method to calculate dataset similarity which is model agnostic and does not requires any model training. The similarity score can help guide model training with multiple data sources. The paper provide theoretical intuition on the method and presents empirical evidence showing the correlation between the score and utility of model that is trained on multiple datasets.

### Strengths
The similarity metric seems to be easy to compute and can be helpful for practitioners who want to train models with multiple data sources.

### Weaknesses
1. I'm a bit confused about the relation between data similarity and model utility. Intuitively I think the model utility should be improved the most when we add a dataset that is either too similar (e.g. apparently adding the same dataset would not help at all) or too different (e.g. if we invert all labels, the model might become garbage). But the paper seems to suggest that datasets should be as similar as possible, e.g. in the empirical evaluation Fig 1, and theoretical insights ("When the cosine similarity between x1 and x2 is close to zero, it implies a negligible change in w, leading to minimal improvement in loss"). This is a bit counter-intuitive to me.

2. I think some important concepts and settings need to be explained in more details (which might help resolve my confusions in (1) as well).
a). What is μ and Σ in the algorithm? I guess they are some Gaussian parameters but I don't understand what distribution we're talking about here. (And I presume the "u" in (5) is meant to be "μ"?) In general the intuition of the algorithm is not quite clear to me. I think it might be helpful if the authors can demonstrate a few similarity values for some simple cases, e.g. when D1 and D2 are the same, when one is a subset of the other, or when they're fresh samples drawn from the same distribution etc.
b). In the experiments, how is the data partitioned to form datasets with different level of similarities? I think it's important to examine whether these artificially created datasets reflect the real life scenario where slightly different datasets might be owned by different institutions who want to jointly train model.

### Summary
This paper studies the multi-source learning setting where different datasets may be non-identically-distributed. This paper improves on prior work by proposing a metric that satisfies many useful properties simultaneously: being bounded, being applicable to supervised learning (via accounting for the label distribution) and not requiring model training. The metric is based on optimal transport, cosine similarity, and hellinger distance. Experimental evaluation focuses on showing that this metric correlates with model performance as data is made more non-iid and with gradient diversity. This work also shows how to compute metrics inn SMPC setting.

### Strengths
This work has several strengths.

First, this metric is the first to achieve many desired quantities simultaneously. Though this work does so by using techniques already studied in machine learning (e.g., cosine distance, hellinger distance), it does combine these in a new way that leads to this benefit.

Second, this work is mostly clear and well written. For example, algorithm 1 clearly shows the cost metric and how it is computed in various settings. The notation is clear and easy to follow. There is also sufficient description of how to interpret the metric (e.g., how values of > 0.5 induce negative learning).

Third, there is sufficient related works and background. This makes it easy to understand the key contributions and placement in the literature, as well as interpret/understand the results.

Fourth, there are many experiments, including synthetic and real datasets covering many different cases (regression, multi-class image classification, etc.). The full details are also included enabling reproducibility. The results show a correlation between the metric and the desired quantity being measured: learning performance under varying degrees of non-iid datasets.

### Weaknesses
The first weakness is that this work claims privacy-preserving computation as a main contribution. However, this contribution is not clear, lacks any significant treatment of the techniques used in the main-text, and, is also missing important analysis. On clearness, this work claims to enable "privacy-preserving" computation many times early in the paper (abstract, fourth main contribution, to name two). This is vague. Does this mean DP, SMPC, or something else? This only becomes clear on the fourth page of the paper when the work first mentions SMPC. Importantly, though, this SMPC contribution is rather limited. On treatment and analysis, it does not include computation analysis, a security proof, and, appears to only use SMPC for the features (and not labels) as observed in Algorithm 1. This conflates the true security guarantees with what is provided as the work claims to provide a "privacy-preserving method for the metric". Further, this work also claims to provide a method that introduces no error, but the linked proof is actually a background (supplement S.1).

The second weaknesses is the empirical performance of the metric. Though there is certainly a correlation, this correlation appears to not be too strong in that it only well separates settings of IID ( where the metric is around 0.1 or lower) to those of heavily non-iid (where the metric is 0.3 or higher). In between this, there is large variation where the metric does not well correlate and has high variance in results across datasets. That being said, this result may be useful in itself, and so, this weakness is not major.

Third, there is lacking exploration with respect to non-iid learning approaches. The result that these approaches can impact utility on iid settings is interesting, however, this work also seems to show that these non-iid approaches often perform worse even in noniid settings. This is counter to their design and requires more exploration. Is there a reason that this is occurring?

### Summary
This paper developed a metric to quantify the similarity between two datasets. To obtain the metric, the first step is computing cosine similarity between pairs of data samples, added by Hellinger distance between the same pair of labels. Then, we obtain the distance between the two datasets by applying optimal transport over the cosine and Hellinger distances.

### Strengths
This paper studies a foundational problem in machine learning and may have a broad impact on many areas.

### Weaknesses
1. The paper first constructs a metric between a pair of data samples using cosine similarity and Hellinger distance. However, the Hellinger distance is not well motivated. What's the key advantage of the Hellinger distance over the Wasserstein distance?
2. The theoretical insights (Section 6) need improvements. The authors consider a scenario where "any pair of vectors drawn from two random and independent datasets". Such a scenario may not be representative enough because two different datasets may have overlaps. Also, the Hellinger distance is not discussed in the theoretical analysis.
3. I do not believe " estimating gradients similarity without model training" is a feature of the proposed approach. Deriving a bound of gradient similarity using data similarity is straightforward for a Lipschitz function. In this sense, any metric quantifying data similarity can estimate gradient similarity.
