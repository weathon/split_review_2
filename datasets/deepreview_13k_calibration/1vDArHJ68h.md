## Abstract
Current model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL) agents struggle with long-term dependencies. This limits their ability to effectively solve tasks involving extended time gaps between actions and outcomes, or tasks demanding the recalling of distant observations to inform current actions. To improve temporal coherence, we integrate a new family of state space models (SSMs) in world models of MBRL agents to present a new method, Recall to Imagine (R2I). This integration aims to enhance both long-term memory and long-horizon credit assignment. Through a diverse set of illustrative tasks, we systematically demonstrate that \newertext{R2I not only establishes a new state-of-the-art for challenging memory and credit assignment RL tasks, such as BSuite and POPGym, but also showcases superhuman performance in the complex memory domain of Memory Maze.} At the same time, it upholds comparable performance in classic RL tasks, such as Atari and DMC, suggesting the generality of our method. We also show that R2I is faster than the state-of-the-art MBRL method, DreamerV3, resulting in faster wall-time convergence.

4: You are confident in your assessment, but not absolutely certain. It is unlikely, but not impossible, that you did not understand some parts of the submission or that you are unfamiliar with some pieces of related work.

### Summary
This paper introduces a new Model-based RL algorithm Recall to Imagine (R2I) that upgrades DreamerV3 by non-trivially incorporating S4 networks in substitutions of the RSSMs that have been commonly used since PlaNet. The paper provides abundant evidence to support the main claim that R2I outperforms DreamerV3 and is significantly more computationally efficient

### Strengths
While employing S4 as an alternative to RSSMs was a natural step to come, I think the authors do a very good work here. The paper is very well presented and easy to follow. Authors do a very detailed theoretical analysis of the approach, building up intuition and making it very easy to follow. It is remarkable that they even include in-depth discussions on why they discarded alternative features when designing their algorithm, which should be a more common practice. The empirical analysis is also extensive and provides solid ground with the numerous ablations and the varied array of benchmarks where the R2I vs Dreamer comparison is drawn. R2I proves to be significantly faster to train while being a better performer, specially in challenging long-term dependencies

I believe that this paper will be very relevant for the ICLR community.

### Weaknesses
My biggest concern is the lack of an explicit literature review/ related work section, which I would suggest to include in the appendix. Specifically, I believe that it is of special relevance to include a more in-depth comparison between R2I and S4WM -currently briefly mentioned in the conclusions- since both combine DreamerV3 with SSMs.

Also, I noticed there are no mentions about making the code available. Thus, it would be specially benefitting for reproducibility if authors include a summary of the alg in pseudocode at the appendix.

-- After Rebuttal --

Authors addressed very well all my concerns, the paper now presents clearly its differences with respect prior work and with a well documented code reproducibility should be easy to reproduce. I believe this will be a very relevant work for the RL community

### Questions
Correctly addressing the two points above is what can change the most my opinion. Additionally, there are a couple of minor things I noticed:
* Appendix N Figure 14, the second plot is missing the expected error
* Section 3.1 line 4 where x_t is "a" hidden state and f_θ is a sequence model with "a"  SSM

### Summary
This work proposes Recall to Imagine (R2I), a Model-Based Reinforcement Learning (MBRL) agent that integrates the Dreamer framework with State Space Models (SSMs), in order to alleviate the well-known challenges of long-term dependencies regarding memory and credit assignment. This integration works by replacing the GRU-based representation model with the SSM, which enables parallel predictions and improves the capabilities for capturing long-term dependencies. The paper presents a rich empirical analysis in a variety of memory environments, achieving state-of-the-art results in them while incurring a small drop in performance in the standard benchmarks. Furthermore, the paper provides an extensive ablation analysis of diverse design choices and hyperparameters in this integration.

### Strengths
- The paper addresses the problem of long-term dependencies for World Models, which is an issue for RNNs and Transformers on handling sequences in representational models. Therefore, it is very relevant to the community. 

    - Furthermore, employing SSMs to replace the aforementioned backbones for learning temporal dependencies is sound and well-motivated.

- The proposed architecture establishes new state-of-the-art performance for several tasks in the considered environments (BSuite, POPGym, and Memory Maze), with a noticeable improvement in computational efficiency, as shown in Figure 2.

- The work brings extensive and insightful ablation studies in many design decisions in the R2I architecture. These are presented as a systematic evaluation in Appendices M to P and helps understanding how the proposed method works.

### Weaknesses
 - Despite the conducted ablation in Appendix O, the question on why the different input variations work differently across environments still remains open. And the raised hypothesis on “feature instability” sounds vague and not properly backed up by a solid argument. It would be great to provide a better understanding of this challenge to give more clarity on how the method works, but I understand this is a difficult open problem that demands a careful investigation.

- The work adopts SSMs to address the challenge of handling long-term dependencies in RL (memory and credit assignment). Nevertheless, it does not motivate the employment of Dreamer (or, more generally, Model-Based RL). I think it is important to describe and motivate why Dreamer was used instead of Model-Free RL, as it is not clear why MBRL would be better than MFRL for these memory tasks (unless there is another motivation besides asymptotic performance, such as sample efficiency).

    - In the same line, Figure 4 brings some “memory-augmented” Model-Free baselines, but it lacks “PPO + SSMs”. This baseline would definitely clarify my concern. If there is no constraint in the sample budget, it is possible (perhaps expected) that the MFRL agent would perform better.

- In Section 4.3, the claim of “not sacrificing generality” is questionable. There is a small drop in performance. For instance, in Appendix J (DMC-proprio), DreamerV3 is (at least) slightly better in 6 tasks.  In Appendix K (DMC-Vision), 8 environments. In Appendix L (Atari), 10 environments. I suggest rephrasing the claim to account what is observed in the Appendices.

- The work from Deng et.al [1], proposing S4WM, looks very similar to the proposed one. Indeed, both works propose replacing the RSSM with SSMs with the same motivation: improving memory capabilities. The work on S4WM was publicly released approximately 2.5 months before this submission, which can be seen as concurrent work. Nevertheless, I believe the work is almost overlooked by the proposed paper, which has a small citation in Section 5. Given the similarity, it would be crucial to provide a more detailed comparison contrasting both works, in terms of methodology and evaluation, perhaps in the Introduction or in a separate Appendix.

**Minor Concerns**

- In Appendix H, task Autoencode: the episode length for the Hard task is 156. Is that right? I believe it is supposed to be 256.

### Questions
- In Appendix G (BSuite environment), is there any hypothesis on why sometimes harder environments (longer memory steps) present better performance than easier ones? For instance, R2I’s performance on 31 memory steps is better than 15 memory steps. Similarly, the performance in 81 memory steps seems better (or more stable) than 41 memory steps.










===================== **POST-REBUTTAL** ==================================

Dear authors,

Thanks for putting so much effort on addressing my concerns. I believe they led to substantial improvements in an already good work, so I am raising my scores towards acceptance.

Specifically:

- I appreciate the efforts on formulating hypotheses on why the different input variations work differently across environments. I believe the raised hypotheses are valid and potential venues for future work. As I mentioned before, this seems to be a difficult problem that requires careful investigation. It would be interesting to bring this rebuttal discussion into the paper, as I believe this could also be an important question for other readers. This is also valid to the point related to Appendix G.

- I also would like to thank you for adding the new PPO + SSMs baseline. Turns out to be very different from what I expected, and given the discussion on Appendix T, I think it should require careful tuning to work with PPO (which is, indeed, a very sensible algorithm). But this is an argument in favor of the proposed method and perhaps another open question to be addressed (i.e., how to make SSM to work with PPO)

- Thanks for addressing the tone of the claim in Section 4.3 and providing more evidence regarding it. I agree that given the diversity of environments, it is hard to ensure that all of them will attain the same performance, and the new wording also better reflects the presented results.

- Lastly, the Appendix Q is great. I think this was one common concern from many reviewers and it was well addressed with many details. For sure the strongest reason to increase the scores.

### Summary
This paper introduces state space models (SSM), in particular S4, into world models in the framework of model-based RL to improve its long-term memory and long-horizon credit assignment, as well as computational efficiency. Specifically, RSSM in Dreamer is replaced with SSM (S4), resulting in the proposed R2I agents. Design decisions to do so are carefully chosen, and empirical studies demonstrate improved performance in memory-demanding domains, including POPGym, bsuite, and Memory Maze.

### Strengths
1. Improved MBRL performance with S4-based world models has been validated in memory-demanding domains.
2. Careful designs of S4-based world models, including non-recurrent representation model and SSM computational modeling.
3. Extensive experiments in a number of domains.
4. Well written with sufficient experimental details.

### Weaknesses
1. Limited contribution. It is notable that there already exists a S4-based world model, namely S4WM [1]. Despite minor design choices, the major difference of this paper is that it conducts MBRL experiments while S4WM only conducts world model learning (e.g. imagination and reward prediction). However, in my humble opinion, it is not surprising that improvements in long-term memory can lead to improved MBRL performance in memory-demanding domains.
2. Three kinds of actor and critic inputs are introduced, namely, output state, hidden state and full state, which results in a critical design choice to be tuned for each domain. Although the authors provide some takeaways to select between them, it is not always true. For instance, output state policy is utilized in memory-demanding environments, Bsuite, while hidden state policy is used in non-memory environments, DMC. This introduces an element of manual tuning based on environment characteristics, which detracts from the method's generality and ease of use.
3. The authors claim that R2I does not sacrifice generality for improved memory capabilities. However, there is a clear trend in Figure 6, that R2I performs worse than Dreamer in standard RL tasks. This suggests a trade-off between memory performance and general task performance, which contradicts the claim of no sacrifice in generality. A more rigorous statistical analysis is needed to support the claim of comparable performance on standard RL tasks.
4. Some inaccurate statements. For example, the authors say R2I's 'objective differs from ELBO in three ways', but to my knowledge, these three points are all borrowed from DreamerV3 but without explicitly being mentioned in the text.

### Questions
The authors should properly resolve my concerns mentioned in the weakness part.

There are also some minor questions:

1. Dreamer is compared in Memory Maze tasks. Does this Dreamer baseline include the TBTT technique proposed by Pasukonis et al., which improves the memory of RSSM?
2. Why not include Transformer-based world models as baselines? Transformers are also widely believed to well model long-horizon dependencies.
