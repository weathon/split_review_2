## Abstract
Normal-form games (NFGs) are the fundamental model of {\em strategic interaction}. We study their representation using neural networks. We describe the inherent equivariance of NFGs --- any permutation of strategies describes an equivalent game --- as well as the challenges this poses for representation learning.} architecture that leverages this equivariance, leading to state-of-the-art performance in a range of game-theoretic tasks including equilibrium-solving, deviation gain estimation and ranking, with a common approach to NFG representation. We show that the resulting model is interpretable and versatile, paving the way towards deep learning systems capable of game-theoretic reasoning when interacting with humans and with each other.

### Summary
The paper proposes an action-payoff encoder architecture for normal-form games (NFGs), which can be used to predict the payoffs, and maximal deviation of a player. The main contribution of this work is NfgTransformer, which is an action-payoff encoder that leverages the permutation-invariance of transformer architectures. The proposed architecture reportedly outperforms baselines in various game-theoretic toy examples.

### Strengths
# Strengths
- The empirical results of the proposed architecture outperforms the baselines in several toy benchmarks.

### Weaknesses
# Weakness
- [Presentation]
    - It is hard to parse the main goal of this work at the first glance; the main contribution of this work is a game encoder architecture that exhibits a baked-in equivariance (which is a direct consequence of transformer architecture)
    - I think it would have been much better if the authors emphasized why we need such a game encoder, and why it is important; for example, the authors state “For practical applications such as ranking in Go and Chess, it is infeasible to evaluate all pairs of players yet we may wish to make predictions about the game based on incomplete information from a subset of the matchups.” In Sec. 1 — more concrete examples would help the readers to understand the motivation of this work. 
    - In Sec. 1, the authors vaguely describe the main contribution of this work as: 
        - “… we consider the problem of bringing game-theoretic reasoning to deep learning systems and, conversely, using deep learning techniques to solve challenges in game theory.” 
        - “… NFGs are canonical descriptions of strategic interaction between players that allows one to ask a variety of questions.”
        - But none of the descriptions clearly states that the actual contribution lies in an encoder architecture that encodes action & payoffs.
    - Hard to understand the illustration of the proposed architecture in Fig. 1 and Fig.2
        - The illustration and caption are not self-contained; readers need to resort to Sec. 4 to actually grasp the implementation 
        - What is the difference between light colors and bold colors in Fig.1 ?
        - It is hard to parse the meaning of the annotations attached to the tokens in Fig. 1; for example, in “Payoffs” of Fig. 1, different lengths are identically annotated as “T” 
    - Some of internal links are broken
        - Pointers to Fig. 5
        - Pointers to Proposition 3.2
        - Pointer to Sec. 5.1.
        - Pointers to Sec 4.4
        - Some links to the references
- [Technical Novelty]
    - If I understood correctly, it seems like the equivariance of NfgTransformer is a direct consequence of transformer architecture, and therefore, hard to consider it as a novel technical contribution. The core idea of using self-attention and cross-attention to achieve permutation invariance is not new, and the application to NFGs, while interesting, does not seem to introduce significant technical novelty.
- [Experiment]
    - The games presented in the experiments are rather toy-ish — given that the main contribution of this work lies in an empirical architecture, I think the efficiency of the proposed architecture should be validated on a real-world games, e.g., Go and Chess, which the authors listed as possible practical applications in Sec. 1. The current experiments do not sufficiently demonstrate the practical utility of the proposed approach, especially in comparison to existing methods for solving or approximating solutions in real-world games.

### Questions
From my understanding, the "equivariance" property of NfgTransformer architecture is a direct consequence of transformer architecture itself -- which is OK, but hard to be considered as a significant technical contribution; it would be appreciated if the authors could clarify this point.

### Confidence
3: You are fairly confident in your assessment. It is possible that you did not understand some parts of the submission or that you are unfamiliar with some pieces of related work. Math/other details were not carefully checked.

### Summary
The submission proposes a transformer architecture for learning normal-form games. They evaluate this architecture on a variety of game-related tasks, including solving for Nash equilibria and predicting deviation payoffs.

### Strengths
Regarding originality, I don't know of any paper that has done what the submission seems to be doing.

### Weaknesses
### First sentence

I'm going to start off by discussing the first sentence of the introduction:

> A number of celebrated results in artificial intelligence (AI) have appealed to game-theoretic principles during training, evaluation and ranking (Silver et al., 2016; Lanctot et al., 2017; Vinyals et al., 2019; Omidshafiei et al., 2019; Liu et al., 2022b; Perolat et al., 2022).

The way this sentence is written leaves the reader with the impression that the citations are examples of celebrated results that have appealed to game-theoretic principles. Let's go through them and examine whether this claim is true. I agree that Silver et al. (2016) is a celebrated result. However, it is not clear to me that it uses any game-theoretic principles during training (it uses supervised learning + self-play) or evaluation/ranking (it uses elo rankings). Lanctot et al. (2017) is not a result at all -- it is a paper that advocates for combining double oracle and deep RL. Vinyals et al. (2019), Omidshafiei et al. (2019), Liu et al. (2022b), Perolat et al. (2022) all use some level of game-theoretic justification, but none live up to the very high standard implied by the term "celebrated". One also cannot help but notice that all six of the cited papers are DeepMind papers. While it is certainly the case that DeepMind has made important contributions to RL in games (and perhaps more so than any other group), citing only DeepMind papers here is completely unjustifiable. Arguably, the two most significant sets of successes that directly appeal to game-theoretic principles are those concerning poker (DeepStack/Libratus/Pluribus/ReBeL) and No-Press Diplomacy (Diplodocus). That the submission choses to cite DeepMind papers as opposed to more-relevant non-DeepMind papers to support their claim gives the impression that it is attempting to push a narrative rather than give an honest perspective (or, alternatively, that the submission is simply uninformed). One might argue here that I am being too pedantic about a somewhat boilerplate sentence in the introduction that is not closely related to the submission's contributions. But I think it is important that the submission not mislead the reader.

### Motivation of paper

After reading the introduction, I am not quite sure I fully grasp the problem that the submission is trying to solve. The submission abstractly states "We consider the problem of bringing game-theoretic reasoning to deep learning systems and, conversely, using deep learning techniques to solve challenges in game theory" but does not immediately clarify why would would want bring game-theoretic reasoning to deep learning systems or what challenges the submission is going to solve in game theory. It further states "In its most basic form, strategic interactions between players are formulated as NFGs where players simultaneously select actions and receive payoffs subject to the joint action. Strategic interactions are therefore presented as payoff tensors, where values to each player are tabulated under every joint action. This tabular view of strategic interactions presents its own challenges to representation learning." Under the presumption that doing representation learning on a normal form game is important, I agree there are some representation learning-related challenges, but the submission hasn't really explained why we would want to be doing this in the first place. The submission then lists some game-theory related questions "Examples of such enquiries permeate different communities within game theory: given sets of actions, what would be
an equilibrium strategy (Greenwald et al., 2003; Marris et al., 2022; Duan et al., 2023a;b)? How does the efficiency of the system degrade due to individual selfishness (Koutsoupias & Papadimitriou,1999)? How might we cluster actions considering transitivity and strategy cycles (Czarnecki et al., 2020)? Given outcomes for some joint actions, can one predict payoffs for the others (Balduzzi et al., 2018; Bertrand et al., 2023; Vadori & Savani, 2023)? To what extent can we reduce the dimensionality of a class of NFGs (Marris et al., 2023)?" This gives the reader the impression that these are some of the questions the submission is interested in. But the big question of *Why we need to learn a representation of the game to do this* remains unaddressed -- it is unclear to the why problems such as "what would be an equilibrium strategy" ought not to be addressed from a normal-form representation. The submission proceeds to list desiderata for a unified representation for solving these tasks.

---

### Description of methodology

The submission refers the reader to Figure 1 to understand the architecture that they're proposing, but I find the figure not very easy to grok. What does it mean when two arrows point at the same block?

The submission describes the architecture in Section 4, but I could not figure out what the architecture was being trained to do. I also still do not understand what the downstream use case of this architecture is.

---

### Experiments

In Section 5.1.1, the submission says this "For equilibrium solving, we optimise variants of the NfgTransformer to minimise the NE GAP
() = maxp p() directly." How is the submission performing this optimization? How are we recovering a NE strategy from the action embeddings? These questions are central to the paper, but seem to be unanswered in the text. Furthermore, why should we want to solve NFGs with this architecture instead of using a classical method? Without discussing this question, the reader is left wondering why they should care about these experiments.

In Section 5.1.2, the submission says this "We optimise a NfgTransformer network to regress towards the maximum deviation-gain () for every joint pure-strategy (deterministic) , using a per joint-action decoder architecture (Figure 2)." Again, it is totally not obvious how the submission is doing this based on the text in the paper. Furthermore, the submission again has no discussion about why we should want to use an architecture instead of a classical method for this task (which in this case just amounts to matrix multiplications).

Section 5.2 studies a kind of payoff table completion task. Here it seems reasonable that one might actually want to use an architecture of the kind the submission describes. However, the submission still neglects to disclose how the the architecture was trained.

### questions:
 What's a regular isomorphism as opposed to strong isomorphism in the context of games?

---

Overall, I think the submission needs to be re-written to make it more clear what problem it is trying to solve and how it is training its architecture.

### Summary
This paper considers the permutation equivariance in normal-form games (NFGs) in terms of player action and players. The authors claim that there is inherent equivariance in NFGs – “any permutation of strategies describes an equivalent game.” Then they design an NfgTransformer to leverage this equivariance. They conduct comprehensive experiments show their method significantly outperformes strong baselines in a range of game-theoretic applications.

### Strengths
This paper proposes to discover the "inherent symmetry" in game theoretical problems using equivariant neural networks. This idea is impressive, timely, and promising.

The authors design an NfgTransformer to meet their aim. I find using transformer reasonable.

They also conducted experiments covering a wide range of cases.

### Weaknesses
My concerns are as follows:

- I am worried about the claim that permutation equivariance is "inherent" in normal-form games either in terms of action or player. This is not obvious to me. Please prove this. Also, such permutation equivariance is a quite strong assumption, and leads to a significantly restrictive application domain.

- It is not clear to what extent the proposed NfgTransformer is different from a vanilla one which has naturally been permutation equivariant. The authors did not clearly present the architecture of NfgTransformer - I could not validate the novelty in terms of model design.

- The authors did not give any theoretical guarantee - whether the proposed method secure the desired permutation equivariance, whether the method can reach the desired Nash equilibrium, how fast would the algorithm converge, whether the generalisability of the proposed method (as a learning algorithm) is satisfiable, whether the proposed method has any theoretical advances, etc. Before answering this question, I was quite hesitant about the proposed algorithm.

- I appreciate the empirical results. However, game theory has a very wide range of applications - I do not think experiments in a few applications could justify an algorithm which is claimed to have advances in general cases.

### Questions

### Summary
In this paper, the authors aim to learn the representations of each action of every player in normal-form games. They propose a transformer-based architecture called NfgTransformer, which takes the payoffs and zero-initialized action representations as input and outputs the action embeddings. These output embeddings can be used for many downstream tasks.

In experiments, authors verify the effectiveness of NfgTransformer in Nash equilibrium solving under full-observed payoffs, and in payoff prediction when some payoffs are unobserved. Furthermore, they also conduct case studies of attention weights in small bimatrix games to demonstrate the interpretability of NfgTransformer.

### Strengths
1. The paper introduces a novel task: learning game representations. The acquired embeddings have the potential to enhance numerous downstream applications, making them particularly valuable in empirical game theory.
2. The attention-based architecture offers a degree of interpretability, and I found the case studies presented in Figure 5 to be particularly insightful.
3. NfgTransformer exhibits scalability as its parameters remain independent of the number of actions

### Weaknesses
The presentation can be further improved:

(a) The description of the three attention mechanisms in Section 4.2 is too brief. I believe it would be beneficial to introduce more mathematical expressions.

(b) Also, in Section 4.2, I find the name of the first attention mechanism to be misleading. I would suggest using "joint-action-to-player self-attention" rather than the original "player-to-coplayer self-attention."

(c) I'm having difficulty discerning the results presented in Figure 3. Perhaps using a table would be clearer than the loss curves.

### Questions
1. At the end of Section 4.4, you mentioned, "During training, invalid joint-actions are simply masked out from the set of values..." How are these invalid joint-actions masked out? Is this achieved by reducing the corresponding pre-softmax scores significantly?
2. In Section 5.2, how are the instances of DISC games generated? How do you train your model?
