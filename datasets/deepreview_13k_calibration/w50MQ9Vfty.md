## Abstract
Interference is ubiquitous when conducting causal experiments over networks. Except for certain network structures, causal inference on the network in the presence of interference is difficult due to the entanglement between the treatment assignments and the interference levels. In this article, we conduct causal inference under interference on an observed, sparse but connected network, and we propose a novel design of experiments based on an independent set. Compared to conventional designs, the independent-set design focuses on an independent subset of data and controls their interference exposures through the assignments to the rest (auxiliary set).
    We provide a lower bound on the size of the independent set from a greedy algorithm , and justify the theoretical performance of estimators under the proposed design. 
    Our approach is capable of estimating both spillover effects and treatment effects. We justify its superiority over conventional methods and illustrate the empirical performance through simulations.

### Summary
The paper tries to find a lower bound on the random algorithm to find independent sets in Erdos-Reyni random graph. The paper claims that this independent set is of the order of the size of all nodes in the random graph. They further go on to use this result to estimate the bias and variance for direct effects and spillover effects related to their specific problem setup. They seem to further verify these results through computer simulations of an Erdos-Reyni graph. The results seem interesting to me. Specifically, I like Theorem 1 and based on my prior experience with Erdos-Reyni graphs, the results of this theorem seem to be intuitively correct. However, unfortunately I did not put the effort to follow the proofs in the paper in detail so I cannot independently verify their claims.

### Strengths
If the claim in Theorem 1 is correct that is an interesting result. Intuitively that result makes sense to me. However, I did not completely verify the proofs. 

The paper presentation is good and readable.

### Weaknesses
I am not sure about the validity of assumptions used in the paper. Specifically assumptions 1 and 2. I would like to see more reasoning from the side of the authors on why these assumptions make sense. Any motivating examples could help the reader on these assumptions. 

In equation 1, why is interference from neighbors simply summed up without any gains? Could it be the case that the interference from different neighbors can have a different effect on the results and we need to put more emphasis on some interference while putting less emphasis on other types of interference? 

I suggest the authors to emphasis more in the paper that these results are derived for an Erdos-Reyni random graph setup and not necessarily any network. For instance, I did not see any mention of that in their abstract. The wording throughout the paper needs to be changed to reflect that these results are derived for random graphs. 

 I would like the authors to specify in more detail that which part of their results is coming from different sources. For instance, Can the authors mention their contribution over Karwa & Airoldi (2018) in more detail?

### Summary
This paper proposes to partition a sparse but connected (causal) graph into independent set and auxiliary set. Using this method of partition, treatment can be designed to estimate direct and spillover effects for causal inference tasks. Theoretical guarantees on bias/variance of the estimators were given together with simulation results.

### Strengths
1.	The problem definition is clear with good illustration to explain the concept of independent set and auxiliary set.
2.	Theoretical results are provided with good descriptions of the assumptions and limitations.

### Weaknesses
1. The main weakness in this paper is the lack of a clear comparison to related works both theoretically and numerically. For example, how does the new theoretical guarantees improve over previous works? Otherwise, the analysis looks like an application of linear regression estimator. 
2. One contribution the paper claimed is using fewer assumptions for this model, it would be better to describe this more clearly. For example, what assumptions can be removed compared to previous works?
3. The results rely on the greedy algorithm 1 to have a decent performance. Theorem 1 only gives the lower bound on ER graph which seems to limit the application of this framework.

### Questions
1.	The simulation results are comparing only to completely randomized design. Is it possible to compare with other designs cited in the introduction and Table 1? 
2.	There are some typos, for example, in section 4.3 and 4.3.2, it is referring to section 2.3 and 2.3.2 which does not exist. (Should be 3.3 and 3.3.2?)

### Summary
The paper proposes experimental designs using the independent set approach to estimate both direct and spillover effects for general networks. Both theoretical justification and experimental results are provided to demonstrate advantages over competing designs.

### Strengths
Many interference designs focus on estimating the total effect, whereas the literature focusing on designs to measure the spillover effect specifically is more limited. This is an important problem and the paper proposes optimal designs that are flexible and also show strong theoretical and experimental results.

The proposed designs are novel and simple to implement.

### Weaknesses
The experimentation section could use more polish/clarity, and possibly some additional exploration (see questions below). In particular, there are inconsistencies in the displayed results and limitations due to the greedy algorithm, as well as assumption 2, could be better addressed in the experiments.

Experimentation Questions:
- Inconsistency: Why does Figure 2 use n=60 whereas Table 2 uses n={100,200,400}?
- Why is Graph Cluster omitted from Figure 2?
- Graph Cluster is not mentioned in the Section 5 introduction, what cluster design is used?
- Is there a reason some designs mentioned in Section 2 (ego-clusters, randomized saturation) appear to be omitted?
- Given the discussion in Section 4.2, how do results vary for more varied p/s specifications for ER random graphs?
- How robust are the results to the size of the independent set?
- What is the $\rho$ chosen for the IS design in section 5.2? Is it the usual IS setting from Karwa and Airoldi where $\rho = 0$?

Minor nomenclature question: The direct effect should be $\tau_{i}^{(d)}(0)$ and $\tau_{i}^{(d)}(\rho)$ represents the total effect in a partial spillover situation, correct?

How reasonable is Assumption 2 given the greedy algorithm to construct $V_I$ has no concern for representativeness?

### Summary
Interference is a common problem in experimental designs that biases estimation of treatment effects. This paper attempts to correct for interference by designing an experiment on a subset of the data that consists of non-interfering units. Given an interference network this paper provides an algorithm for treating units for various parameter goals. The paper provides a comparison on the sample efficiency of the method related to other methods and provides bias and variance computations.

### Strengths
- The paper provides a novel algorithm for treating units to minimize the effects of interference and maximizing sample efficiency for specific graph classes.
- It is also good that the paper provides an optimization framework that can be used for computation of various causal parameters. This is something that is often missing in interference papers.
- Theoretical analysis provides proof of unbiasedness and computation of estimator variance showcasing theoretical proof of method.
- While the theoretical section relies on some stringent assumptions, i.e. G \perp Y, the algorithm itself is relatively assumption free aside from a requirement of sparsity which is often true in practice

### Weaknesses
It is difficult to assess the contribution of the paper because the idea of designing experiments on non-interfering units has been well studied in previous works -- this is documented in the paper's related works. This paper attempts to design a more robust methodology towards this idea but relies on knowledge of the underlying network G. In practice this is never known and the paper does not consider the case of a misspecified G.

The theoretical results are good but they rely on stringent assumptions (although possibly weaker than other works). In particular it seems that the sample efficiency results are specific to the case of an erdos-renyi graph. Furthermore, the methodology rules out complete graphs and in general requires a degree of sparsity in the underlying graph. Since G is given or estimated this could be enforced but possibly unpalatable in some cases. Furthermore, as with other approaches to interference using partitioning algorithm there is a trade off with statistical power.

### Questions
- How does this method work when G is misspecified? 
- It would be good to see how this could be applied in a practical example with different underlying graphs
- How does optimizing over treatments effect the randomization assumption? Could this effect the internal validity of the study if randomization is weakened (i.e. in the vein of Bugni, Canay, and Shaikh 2017) moreover could there be distributional differences between the independent set and aux sets?
- Since treatment effects can only be computed on the independent set how does this impact possible external validity of the study?
