## Abstract
Human beings can make adaptive decisions in a preparatory manner, i.e., by making preparations in advance, which offers significant advantages in scenarios where both online and offline experiences are expensive and limited. Meanwhile, current reinforcement learning methods commonly rely on numerous environment interactions but hardly obtain generalizable policies. In this paper, we introduce the idea of \textit{rehearsal} into policy optimization, where the agent plans for all possible outcomes in mind and acts adaptively according to actual responses from the environment. To effectively rehearse, we propose ReDM, an algorithm that generates a diverse and eligible set of dynamics models and then rehearse the policy via adaptive training on the generated model set. Rehearsal enables the policy to make decision plans for various hypothetical dynamics and to naturally generalize to previously unseen environments. Our experimental results demonstrate that ReDM is capable of learning a valid policy solely through rehearsal, even with \emph{zero} interaction data. We further extend ReDM to scenarios where limited or mismatched interaction data is available, and our experimental results reveal that ReDM produces high-performing policies compared to other offline RL baselines.

### Summary
Human beings can make adaptive decisions in a preparatory manner, i.e., by making preparations in advance, which offers significant advantages in scenarios where both online and offline experiences are expensive and limited. Meanwhile, current reinforcement learning methods commonly rely on numerous environment interactions but hardly obtain generalizable policies. In this paper, the authors introduce the idea of *rehearsal* into policy optimization, where the agent plans for all possible outcomes in mind and acts adaptively according to actual responses from the environment. To effectively rehearse, they propose ReDM, an algorithm that generates a diverse and eligible set of dynamics models and then rehearse the policy via adaptive training on the generated model set. Rehearsal enables the policy to make decision plans for various hypothetical dynamics and to natually generalize to previously unseen environments. Their experimental results demonstrate that ReDM is capable of learning a valid policy solely through rehearsal, even with zero interaction data. Besides, they further extend ReDM to scenarios where limited or mismatched interaction data is available. The provided empirical results reveal that ReDM produces high-performing policies compared with other offline RL baselines.

### Strengths
1. The problem of policy rehearsing in offline reinforcement learning is interesting and challenging as an academic topic.
2. The description to the problem modeling and the methods is clear and generally easy-understanding.
3. The proposed method is well motivated by comprehensive preliminary theoretical analysis.
4. The experiment analysis is in-depth and insightful, which helps the readers bettere understand the effectiveness and underlying mechanism of the propose methods.

### Weaknesses
1. The environments used in the experiments are still limited. I encourage to supplement more environments to demonstrate the applicability of your proposed method is possible. Otherwise, we may argue if the solution can only be effective on some specific kinds of tasks. Specifically, the current experiments are limited to relatively low-dimensional MuJoCo tasks. It is unclear how the method would scale to more complex environments with higher dimensional state and action spaces, where the hypothesis space for dynamics models is significantly larger. The paper should include experiments on more diverse and challenging environments to demonstrate the general applicability of the proposed method.
2. Considering the proposed method needs to train the new dynamics models and meta-policy simultaneously, the complexity of this method and the training stability/convegence are encouraged to be clarified and analyzed. The paper should provide a more detailed analysis of the computational complexity of the proposed method, including the number of parameters, training time, and memory requirements. Furthermore, the paper should discuss the convergence properties of the alternating training procedure for the dynamics models and meta-policy. It is important to analyze whether the training process is stable and converges to a good solution, or if it is prone to oscillations or divergence.
3. The assumed accessibility to the task reward function and initial state distribution is often unrealistic in the real applications. The paper assumes that the reward function and initial state distribution are known, which is a strong assumption that may not hold in many real-world scenarios. In practice, the reward function may be unknown or only partially known, and the initial state distribution may be difficult to estimate. The paper should discuss the limitations of this assumption and explore alternative approaches that do not rely on this assumption.

### Questions
1. I am curious if totally no interaction data, how can the generated dynamics model approximates the real dynamics in the target environment. It seems there lacks enough grounding points to support this potential. Does there exist the probability that the generated dynamics models are far from the dynamics in the target environment? I hope to see more analysis on this during the rebuttal.
2. The D4RL benchmark in your experiments is all Mujoco tasks with low input dimensions. Could you please consider incorporating some more high-dimensional task, in which the hypothesis space is too large to narrow down?
3. In the paper, you claim that the interaction data is only used to narrow down the hypothesis space. But could you please consider how to utilize these interaction data in a more direct way to better facilitate the policy learning as the complement to the purely dynamics model learning, like finetuning the learned meta policy? Besides, I cannot agree the statement that the biasedness in the interaction data will somehow hinder the policy optimization in traditional offline RL methods. If such pre-collected trajectories are expert ones or near-optimal ones, such *biasedness* can actually help avoid some low-value and dangerous states.
4. Considering your method encourages the diversity in the model learning part, some learned dynamics models may be unreasonable though the meta policy can still achieve high returns via planning in such models, like violating the physics laws or economics laws. And I can hardly expect the *eligibility* part in your method can help alleviate this 'short-path' issue. More explanations and discussions are encouaged during the rebuttal phase.

### Summary
The paper proposes a method for offline model-based reinforcement learning. The idea is to generate a set of candidate dynamics models and learn an adaptive policy that optimizes the original reward on this candidate set. If the true dynamics are in the distribution of the candidate set, the adaptive policy should perform well on the true task. The central problem lies in generating a candidate set of dynamics models. The authors propose optimizing over dynamics models with RL using a reward that incentivizes (1) diversity among the set and (2) the tendency for random trajectories to achieve high reward. The method alternates between optimizing for a new dynamics model to add to the set and optimizing for a new adaptive policy given the current set. When interaction data from the true task is available, it is used to regularize the optimization over dynamics models. Experiments show the method can work with no interaction data on low-dimensional continuous control tasks (inverted pendulum, mountain car, acrobot). On two D4RL tasks (hopper, half-cheetah) with a small amount of random interaction data, the method outperforms prior offline model-free and model-based RL methods.

### Strengths
The method is similar to MAPLE but replaces the dynamics model generation process with a more directed procedure (RL on a custom reward vs learning an ensemble of models). The reward used in the dynamics model generation process is well motivated by formal analysis of error bounds. The different components of the method are analyzed/ablated.

### Weaknesses
My main concern is the limited applicability of this method beyond low-dimensional benchmark tasks due to some significant assumptions. The method assumes access to a query-able reward/termination function and the initial state distribution. Though more importantly, the method assumes that the dynamics can be easily parameterized and optimized over with RL. Specifically, the dynamics model is parameterized as a neural network and optimized using a policy gradient method, which may be unstable or inefficient for complex dynamics. Additionally, the method assumes that random plans through the candidate dynamics models will achieve some non-zero reward (to optimize the dynamics models for the eligibility reward). This assumption is particularly problematic as the random policy used to evaluate the dynamics model may not explore the state space effectively, leading to an inaccurate assessment of the model's quality. These assumptions makes the method difficult to apply (if not impossible) in sparse-reward or high-dimensional (e.g image-based) environments. In principle these issues could be solved by providing the method with enough interaction data to learn a good dynamics model initialization. However, then prior offline model-based or model-free methods might also work well. Additionally, this still wouldn't make the method applicable to sparse reward problems. 

Another concern is the limited scope of the experiments relative to prior work. The evaluations on InvertedPendulum, MountainCar, and Acrobot are good for analyzing the method, however for the comparison to prior work, experiments are only shown for HalfCheetah and Hopper. It would be good to additionally include at least Walker2d. Additionally, the experiments with interaction data only test random interaction data and relatively small amounts of data (200 and 5000 transitions). While it is understandable that this is the setting where the proposed method would excel, it would be good to also show comparison to prior work with interaction data of varying optimality and amounts (including the full D4RL datsets). 

There is no discussion of MAPLE in the related work section. MAPLE is very related (just a different model generation process) so the similarities and differences should be addressed here. It would also be good to include a brief mention of meta-learning in the related work as the proposed method uses similar concepts when optimizing for the adaptive policy.

Smaller comments:
- Algorithm 1 does not say a lot about the method. It could be replaced by algorithms 5/6 from the appendix. 
- Figure 1 should use a more descriptive x-axis label like "Tasks".
- Figure 3 needs a more descriptive caption that explains what "model loss" means here.
- The locations of Figure 2 and 3 should be switched.

### Questions
- The explanation of the optimal policy gap is confusing. Specifically this sentence: "This discrepancy highlights the candidate model set’s capability to derive a proficient policy in the model itself." Does "model" here mean the true dynamics?
- "we conjecture that a diversified dynamics model set will correspond to a smaller ϵa since recognizing the dynamics is much easier" It's not clear to me why a more diverse candidate model would lower the adaptation cost. Could you explain this?
- In Figure 6, what is the shown performance relative to? Is this the performance of the policy at each iteration in the model at that iteration minus the performance of the policy at that iteration in the ground truth model?
- Figure 7: Are these results averaged over Hopper and HalfCheetah and averaged over each gravity level?

### Summary
This paper presents a pretty interesting idea called rehearsal, which is able to **initialize or warm up a generalizable policy with zero interaction data or limited mismatched offline data**. Concretely, the proposed method, *ReDM*, takes as input a reward function and a termination function and generates a set of transition functions or models. Imaginary trajectories can thus be generated by rolling out these transition models and used to warm up the policy. As some of the models may produce data close to the target environment dynamics, the policy warmed up with these data can have a good initialization when deployed to the target environment, which is helpful for subsequent fine-tuning. Additionally, the method can be modified for offline-RL settings, allowing it to learn a robust and generalizable policy even with a small amount of offline data mismatched with target environment dynamics. 

The method is motivated theoretically and contains lots of analysis like performance bound, laying foundations for future study in this new direction. Besides, the experiments on the standard gym and D4RL environment empirically prove the effectiveness of the method for both online and offline policy learning.

### Strengths
1. The idea is novel unlike traditional model-based RL, this new idea suggests learning a bunch of transition models from reward function and termination functions, exempting the need for interaction data. 
2. In terms of soundness, it proves empirically and theoretically that the transition models learned in this way can help warm up the policy and improve its performance when deployed in environments with diverse transition dynamics.

### Weaknesses
1. The paper writing is not attractive. In my perspective, the main paper contains too much tedious content regarding the theoretical analysis and lacks an explanation for the rehearsal framework. My suggestion would be to move some theoretical content to the appendix and include at least one figure to explain the procedures of this new rehearsal framework and what it can achieve or why we need it. People don't care about the theoretical stuff until they are attracted by the idea and want to dive into it. Thus I suggest making some figures to explain the idea or the method.
2. No standard deviation is included for experiments in Table 1. Also, there is no error bar in Figure 7. 
3. What is the $D_{TV}$ should be explained in the main paper. It is strongly related to your main theorem but without definition.
4. What is relative performance? Is it calculated through minus the baseline performance?
5. The axis *Number of models* in Figure 3 should be [0, 10, 20, 30, 40], right?

### Questions
1. How about replacing the random model for calculating the eligible reward with a human-crafted planner? It is supposed to be helpful for improving the performance as well. I guess this can be a good direction for exploration and to make this method more practical. A simple rule-based planner is also as easily accessible as a reward function in most practical settings like robotics. 
2. In the zero interaction data setting, the method indeed works well in three simple gym environments. I wonder if the method still works well in the more complex Mujoco environment without any pre-collected interaction data. I am curious about its performance on high-dimensional control tasks.

### Summary
This work considers training an agent without online interaction or abundant offline data but only with the reward function of the target environment. Borrowing the idea of rehearsal from the cognitive mechanism, this work proposes policy rehearsal. In detail, this work hopes to train an array of models to imitate the target model. Theoretical analyses indicate that the target environment performance gap between the policy trained in these imitated models and the optimal policy can be bounded by three terms, which are further summarized as diversity and eligibility. Based on these two criteria, this work proposes two corresponding reward functions for training imitated models and then uses these models to train the policy. Also, the proposed ReDM can easily combined with offline datasets. Extensive results show the effectiveness of ReDM.

### Strengths
- The ideas about the setting are novel and important, minimizing interaction with the environment as much as possible is an important problem in the RL community. Also, introducing rehearsal into RL is novel and enlightening.

- The writing of Sec 3.2 is clear and solid, I have roughly read all the proofs, which are written quite clearly.

- The proposed ReDM utilizes two novel terms for learning an imitated model, which is interesting and helpful.

Currently, my evaluation of this paper is really Boardline. If authors can address my concerns in Weaknesses and Questions, or point out what I have misunderstood, I'd like to update my scores accordingly. Also, I will keep active in the following discussion stage.

### Weaknesses
 - The connection between diversity and controlling $\epsilon_e, \epsilon_a$ is unclear. For example, if all environments are the same, i.e., there is no diversity, it is obvious that $\epsilon_a=0$ is minimal. There also needs more explanation about why $\epsilon_e$ can be controlled via diversity.

- Based on the previous points, one of my major concerns is why the proposed methods can help optimize the gap calculated in Thm 3.3. The authors have summarized the three errors in Thm 3.3 as diversity and eligibility, which indeed provides insights for analyzing this problem. But I think a more direct connection, like whether the objective in Sec 3.3 can be proven to directly control the three errors in Thm 3.3, will make the analyses more solid.

- In experiments, providing the results directly trained in the target environments as the reference will better show the results.

- Lack of some related works, like utilizing model-based methods for improving generalization [1-3], and finding diverse skills for unsupervised RL [4-6] as this work hopes to find diverse models.

### Questions
- In my opinion, the considered setting is that the agent can only get the reward function of the target task but has no knowledge about the dynamic of the target task. Is it right? Given the offline data, it is understandable that the agent can learn the dynamic to some degree. But without an offline dataset, it seems that there is no idea for the agent to learn the dynamic of the target task. 

- Based on the previous question, I'm confused about the setting of Experiment 4.1 " ReDM With no Interaction Data". As there are no data about the environment and the agent can not interact with the environment, how does the agent to learn about the environment?

- As Unsupervised RL considers training an agent in the environment without reward, in my opinion, the setting in this work is like training an agent and models in the environment with reward but without dynamic. As the dynamic of the target environment will vary a lot, whether finetuning the agent (as well as the model) in the target environment with few steps will be more reasonable?

- About $r_e$ for Eligibility. The proposed method is to randomly sample N trajectories and estimate the biggest return. Is this inefficient as the state space and action space are continuous in experiments? Also, what is the choice of N in experiments?

- I'm curious about the performance of ReDM in the D4RL setting (Sec. 4.3) but without any Interaction Data.
