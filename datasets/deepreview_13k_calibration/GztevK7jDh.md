## Abstract
The introduction of subtasks holds the promise of promoting coordination in scenarios without communication. Instead of manually defined subtasks, recent studies attempt to decompose the overall task and allocate subtasks to agents automatically, but it remains unclear how to acquire a set of proficient subtask representations. In essence, the subtasks serve as auxiliary signals that assist agents in deducing the broader context from limited observations. To embed maximal information into subtask representations, we propose to first learn a vector quantization variational autoencoder which takes individual observations of agents as inputs and reconstructs the global state based on their assigned subtasks as latent variables. Next, the informative representations can be readily integrated into various classic multi-agent reinforcement learning frameworks to facilitate insightful decisions of agents. Experiments on StarCraft II micro-war challenges and Google Research Football have demonstrated that our method learns reasonable and informative subtask representations, which facilitate the decision-making of agents and significantly improve the overall performance.

### Confidence
3: You are fairly confident in your assessment. It is possible that you did not understand some parts of the submission or that you are unfamiliar with some pieces of related work. Math/other details were not carefully checked.

### Summary
The method presents a way to divide a task into sub-tasks using latent variable approach inspired by VQ-VAE, in which the learnt latent variables are used to reconstruct the global state. The learnt sub-task representations show a better decision making among agents and improves performance over different multi-agent tasks.

### Strengths
1. The document is well written and the motivation and discussion are clear.
2. The ablation studies address important questions about the method and are useful, especially the ablation on the number of sub-tasks.
3. The approach of using latent variables for sub-tasks is interesting direction for future work.

### Weaknesses
1. The method depends on finding the right number of sub-tasks K.

### Questions
1. Is it possible to study how entangled the latent representations and sub-tasks are? Do authors see a way in which disentanglement could help here?
2. How much tuning is needed and how difficult is it to find the right sub-task representation size for each method?

### Summary
In this paper, the authors propose to Learn Subtask representations via Vector Quantization (LSVQ) for cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning. The authors first design a novel subtask learner to reconstruct the global state through discrete subtask representations. And then, the subtask learner is integrated with other classic MARL frameworks to allocate subtasks to each agent. Experiments on SMAC and GRF have demonstrated the superior performance.

### Strengths
+ The paper is well-organized and well-written.
+ The proposed method can be easily integrated into various classic multi-agent reinforcement learning frameworks

### Weaknesses
 + The reviewer is concerned about the novelty of this paper. It seems that HSL(Heterogeneous Skill Learning) [1] shares the similar idea of this paper. A discussion on the difference between these two works should be added.

  [1] Liu, Yuntao, et al. "Heterogeneous Skill Learning for Multi-agent Tasks." *Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems* 35 (2022): 37011-37023.

+ The proposed method should be integrated into more advanced algorithms in MARL, such as MAPPO, HAPPO and MAT. More experiments should be conducted to strengthen the quality of this paper.

+ The performance on SMAC is saturated and the authors are suggested to supplement experimental results on SMAC v2.

+ To compare LSVQ-QMIX with QMIX, the scale of the Q network in QMIX is enlarged to achieve a comparable parameter count with that of LSVQ-QMIX. In the reviewer's opinion, the scale of the LSVQ-QMIX ought to be shrinked rather than enlarging the scale of QMIX.

+ In Figure 10, the results of LSVQ-QMIX against other baselines on GRF scenarios are not satisfactory compared with LDSA. Reasons for performance degradation should be analyzed and provided.

+ In the context of decentralization, how to assign subtasks to a specific agent is not only related to the observations, but also related to the overall situation. For example, there exist two identical agents which can both do task A and task B. Under the settings of decentralization, the two agents will do the same task, while we want them to do these two tasks, respectively.

### Summary
The paper focuses on subtask learning for cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL). A variational autoencoder variant is employed to reconstruct the global state from individual observations. The latent encoder vector is discretized via vector quantization before being used by the decoder for reconstruction. The learned latent vectors are used to generate individual policies for all agents belonging to a subtask, using hypernetworks. The approach, called Learn Subtask representations via Vector Quantization (LSVQ), can be integrated into any MARL framework. It is evaluated in a variety of settings in SMAC, particle environments, and Google Research Football and compared with state-of-the-art MARL approaches.

### Strengths
The paper proposes an interesting approach to cooperative MARL.

The paper is well-written and easy to understand. I also like the illustrations in Figures 1 and 2 that make the approach better understandable.

### Weaknesses
 **Novelty**

While the approach seems somewhat novel to me, I am missing a related work section that discusses conceptual differences to other works that encode observations with alternative techniques, e.g., attention, or dynamically group agents for value decomposition such as (in addition to all the works briefly listed in the introduction):

[1] S. Iqbal et al., “Actor-Attention-Critic for Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning”, ICML 2019

[2] T. Phan et al., “VAST: Value Function Factorization with Variable Agent Sub-Teams”, NeurIPS 2021

[3] M. Wen et al., "Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning is A Sequence Modeling Problem", NeurIPS 2022

**Soundness**

In contrast to stated in the paper, general Dec-POMDPs have **stochastic** observations [4,5] and are therefore sampled from a distribution instead of being projected via a deterministic function. The benchmark domains used in the paper are all special cases with deterministic observations (and even initial states) thus do not reflect the general characteristics of a general Dec-POMDP [5].

[4] F. Oliehoek et al., "A Concise Introduction to Decentralized POMDPs", 2016

[5] X. Lyu et al., "A Deeper Understanding of State-Based Critics in Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning", AAAI 2022

According to [4], the global state cannot be reconstructed from observations alone. However, in Dec-MDPs (a special case of Dec-POMDP), the reconstruction is possible. Thus, I am not sure about the general validity of the proposed approach.

**Significance and Clarity**

The x-axes vary for different scenarios in Figures 3, 4, and 6 (either 2 million steps or 5 million), which is somewhat confusing. I wonder how the plots would look like, if the plots with only 2 million steps were run until 5 million steps as there could be a chance that the baselines outperform LSVQ in the long run.

In the maps `5m_vs_6m`, `MMM2`, and `27m_vs_30m`, QMIX performs worse than reported in the original introduction of the benchmark [7]. Furthermore, since the original SMAC authors consider SMAC to be outdated themselves [8], I suggest to evaluate on the newer SMACv2, which exhibits more stochasticity and better aligns with the general Dec-POMDP setting.

[8] B. Ellis et al., "SMACv2: An Improved Benchmark for Cooperative Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning", 2022

**Minor**

- Some plots only show red and green lines. This is bad for colorblind readers who cannot distinguish between those lines. I suggest to change one of these colors to blue.

### Summary
Automatic subtask decomposition and assignment have a great potential to improve the learning performance and efficiency for multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL), which is also quite challenging to solve. This paper makes some effort in this direction, but the algorithm design relies on strong assumptions and lacks novelty compared with previous works. The performance improvements on standard benchmarks are limited. Thus, I suggest a rejection.

### Strengths
(a) This paper proposes an algorithm direction for targeting a challenging but fruitful research area: automatic subtask decomposition and assignment in MARL.

(b) The proposed definition of subtasks is very insightful.

### Weaknesses
(a) Multiple related works on MARL are included for comparison in Section 1, but the intuition behind the proposed algorithm is still not very clear.

(b) The definition of subtasks is a little restricted, since it requires that each agent is assigned with only one subtask.

(c) Assumption 1 is strong, as the information contained in the current state only may not support effective subtask assignment, given that subtask execution usually requires multiple time steps. The approximation in Eq. (3) further assumes that each agent can determines its own subtask based on its local observation, which is not rational since effective subtask assignment requires global knowledge.

(d) The novelty in algorithm design is a little limited, by introducing a subtask learner in QMIX. The subtask learner design is based on VQ-VAE, and the hypernetwork idea has also been adopted in QMIX.

(e) QMIX itself has some drawbacks as it assumes that the global Q-value grows monotonically with individual ones. Following works, like QDPP and Weighted QMIX, have explicitly pointed out this issue and improved upon QMIX.

### Questions
(a)  Could you give more explanation on the statement from Section 1: "Nevertheless, these approaches aim to build differentiated subtask representations but neglect the information that ought to be incorporated within the subtask."?

(b) It would be better to include discussion and comparisons with related works on multi-agent skill (a.k.a., option) discovery.

(c) Could you explain why $q(z|o_a)$ is designed to be deterministic rather than a distribution on all subtasks? 

(d) The results reported in the original paper of LDSA are clearly better than the ones shown in this paper, e.g. results on "5m_6m" and "3s5z_3s6z".
