## Abstract
Recently, the expressive power of GNNs has been analyzed based on their ability to determine if two given graphs are isomorphic using the WL-test. However, previous analyses only establish the expressiveness of GNNs for graph-level tasks from a global perspective. In this paper, we analyze the expressive power of GNNs in terms of Graph Reconstructability, which aims to examine whether the topological information of graphs can be recovered from a local (node-level) perspective. We answer this question by analyzing how the output node embeddings extracted from GNNs may maintain important information for reconstructing the input graph structure. Moreover, we generalize GNNs in the form of Graph Reconstructable Neural Network (GRNN) and explore Nearly Orthogonal Random Features (NORF) to retain graph reconstructability. Experimental results demonstrate that GRNN outperforms representative baselines in reconstructability and efficiency.

### Summary
While the expressive power of GNNs for graph level tasks have been identified using WL-test, the paper suggests a new perspective on the expressive power of GNNs in terms of Graph Reconstructability. To be specific, Graph Reconstructability aims to test whether the topological information of graph can be recovered from a node-level. This is done by using a output node embedding from a GNN, whether it contains information for reconstructing the input graph structure.

### Strengths
1. The paper is well written and easy to follow.
2. The paper suggests a new measurement for the expressivity of GNNs in node-level, being novel, as far as I know.
3. The theoretical analysis is well written, structured, and proofs are provided in detail at the appendix.

### Weaknesses
1. It is not easy to directly interpret the experiment results, such as having no bolding for best results. Also to see the effectiveness of NORF, maybe adding an increase/decrease of performance compared to the IF(Identity Features) would be intuitive for readers to understand.
2. The purpose of using a new measurement for the expressivity of GNNs was to maintain the topological information of the whole graph in a node embedding. However, the authors have placed link prediction experiments in the main paper, while placing node classification experiments in the appendix. The performance and meaningfulness of node classification experiments seems to be bigger, it would have been better to place node classification experiments in the section 6 experiments of the main paper.

### Questions
1. The paper suggests a new line of research for the expressivity of GNNs, replacing the WL-test. If a node embedding from a GNN has a high graph reconstructability, i.e., topological information of graph well maintained in node representation, doesn’t this also lead to a more expressive graph level representation? (Since most graph level representation is obtained by pooling all the nodes in the graph)

### Summary
**TLDR**: The paper assesses the expressivity of GNNs based on their ability to reconstruct the input graph from the learned node embeddings.

The paper proposes to assess the expressive power of graph neural networks through their ability to reconstruct the original graph topology from the learned node embeddings. The presented theoretical results show that GCN and GIN are able to reconstruct the graph topology from the node embeddings if provided with node identity features, while only GIN is able to reconstruct the graph topology when provided with contextual features (i.e., label information and noise). Motivated by the large required size of the embedding dimension for successful graph reconstruction based on identity features, the paper introduces nearly orthogonal random features (NORF) and graph reconstructable networks (GRNN), which allow for a smaller embedding dimension. Experiments on synthetic graphs and on the real-world datasets Pubmed, Actor and DBLP show that GRNNs are suitable for link prediction and community detection.

### Strengths
* The question whether the graph topology can be reconstructed from learned node embeddings appears to be novel in the context of GNNs.
* The paper provides novel theoretical results on the ability of GIN and GCN to reconstruct graphs based on the learned node embeddings.
* GRNN outperforms all baseline methods in community detection and link prediction tasks.

### Weaknesses
 **Novelty and related work**: While the theoretical results for GCN and GIN as well as the proposed GRNN and NORF seem novel, there is little mention of or comparison to related work about reconstructing the graph topology from embeddings [1, 2]. Specifically, the paper does not adequately discuss how its approach relates to methods that learn node embeddings with the explicit goal of preserving graph structure, such as those based on matrix factorization or random walks. On a similar note, there is no mention of subgraph GNNs or the concept of graph reconstruction (i.e., reconstructing a graph from its subgraphs) [3]. A more comprehensive discussion of the contribution and its placement in the current literature would be helpful in assessing its novelty and impact.

**Theoretical results**: The theoretical analysis would benefit from more rigorous/formal definitions, in particular when introducing novel concepts. Definition 1 defines graph reconstructability as "the ability of a model to predict the input adjacency matrix from the node features". One possible interpretation of this definition would be to have a machine learning model which learns to predict the adjacency matrix of a graph from (raw) node features (which, according to my current understanding of the paper, is not what graph reconstructability means). Proposition 6 and 7: Here it would be helpful to formalize the natural language statements. Regarding the proofs presented in the appendix, I had a difficult time understanding some of the notation (e.g., $E$, please refer to the questions for more details). Overall, I was not able to verify some of the theoretical results due to imprecise statements (Proposition 6, last two sentences in proof: "Note that the value of inner prodcut between two nodes indicating the Jaccard similarity, the portion of the common neighborhood over the total neighborhood since the inner product of two none without any shared neighborhood should zero. The proposition follows".). The use of the term 'Jaccard similarity' is also imprecise here, as the inner product of embeddings does not directly correspond to the Jaccard index of node neighborhoods.

**Experiments**: "By combining NORF and contextual features (which would be naturally used in applications), our GRNN achieved the best performance among baselines." For Table 1, this is only true for the Actor dataset. In general, the results of the baseline methods (GCN, GIN, GAT, SGC) seem comparable to GRNN. Furthermore, the experimental section lacks a detailed explanation of how the baselines are tuned, making it difficult to assess the significance of the reported improvements. Minor remark: The plots are very small and therefore difficult to read.

**Clarity and writing**: The writing could be improved, sometimes there are grammar/language errors and imprecise statements:

* "[...] show that the message-passing GNNs are no more powerful than the 1-WL test, i.e. distinguishing whether two graphs are isomorphic" -> e.g. "in distinguishing whether..." if not it is easy to misunderstand that 1-WL is able to distinguish all non-isomorphic graphs
* "[...] our proof is also held [...]" -> our proof also holds
* works -> work
* extended for -> extended to
* "not provable to" -> this sounds off, maybe, e.g., "provably distinguishes" or even just "can distinguish"
* "affliction matrix" -> affiliation matrix?
* Pudmed -> Pubmed

### Questions
* Proposition 1: Is the inequality on the inner products of linked/unlinked nodes an assumption/part of the definition?
* Appendix A.3 uses notation which stems from Definition 6 in [4]. I have consulted [4] but could not find the definition, could you point me to the specific page?
* Using identity features means that we loose permutation invariance; what about NORFs?
* A promising extension of the current theoretical results would be to investigate which graph structural properties we can reconstruct based on the computed node embeddings, even if we cannot reconstruct the entire node adjacency. E.g., can we count the number of paths, cycles or cliques? This might be particularly interesting in the context of social networks. 
* Can you explain the experimental setup for Fig. 1 in more detail? What is $\epsilon$ in Fig. 1b? What node features (IF, CF, NORF) are used in Fig. 1b-c?

### Summary
This paper studies the power of graph neural networks from the perspective of graph reconstructability that evaluates whether the input graph topology can be recovered from the learnt node embeddings. Different node initializations and GNN architectures are studied.  Then this paper proposes GRNNs to improve the reconstructability by initializing node features with NORFS (Nearly Orthogonal Random Feature) that reduces the complexity of identity features and enhances the effectiveness for disassortative graphs.

### Strengths
I think that the reconstructability of GNNs is an interesting problem in the context. The theoretical results in the paper show that the orthogonality of identity features can preserve the topological information of the input graph under GIN and GCN, and then the  GRNNs framework with NORFS is introduced to address the limitations of identity features such as the complexity and the dependency on graph homophily. Basically, it is easy to follow and the research is well oriented.

### Weaknesses
Overall, I think the contribution of the paper is kind of incremental. Through the experimental results align with the theoretical results and show that the proposed method can help to improve the reconstructability, some necessary discussions and evaluations are missed, which makes it hard to evaluate the benefits of improving the reconstructability of GNNs in the graph representation learning. Specifically,

1. For the graph-level tasks, the relationship of the graph reconstructability and expressivity of GNNs is not discussed nor evaluated. It has been shown that positional encoding (including identity features) can improve the expressivity of GNNs beyond 1-WL. However, this paper fails to provide further theoretical results of reconstructability and expressivity in GNNs, and no experiments empirically evaluates GRNNs against the state-of-the-art GNNs in graph prediction tasks. Hence, it is not straightforward how GNNs will benefit from improving the graph reconstructability in graph-level predictions. At least, I recommend to do more graph prediction experiments to compare GRNNs with other SOTA expressive GNN models. 

2. For the link-level tasks like link prediction. the current experiments are not sound due to the lack of necessary benchmark datasets and benchmarks. I recommend to implement additional experiments on well-adopted OGB dataset [1] such as ogbl-ppa, ogbl-collab, ogbl-ddi, and compare GRNNs against GCN/GIN with recent strong labeling tricks including Double Radius Node Labeling (DRNL) in SEAL and Distance Encoding (DE) [2]. DE is a valid labeling trick which is permutation equivariant, while DRNL helps to learn structural link representations with a node-most-expressive GNN. Similarly, the community detection task should also add at least one more benchmark dataset.

3. Label features and NORFs essentially break node symmetries, which makes the graph reconstructability problem trivial.

### Questions
The configurations of baseline models in link prediction and community detection are missed. For instance, [1] shows that SEAL can achieve a competitive results when using a GCN and the DRNL labeling trick, with an additional subgraph-level readout SortPooling. Then, how do CommDGI and SEAL implemented in this paper.

### Summary
The paper studies the expressive power of GNNs from a new perspective termed as graph reconstructability. The aim of the authors is to examine whether the topological information of graphs can be recovered from node embeddings. Two feature initialization schemes are analyzed: one is identity features and the other is contextual features. The authors further propose Graph Reconstructable Neural Network (GRNN) with Nearly Orthogonal Random Features (NORF) to improve graph reconstructability.

### Strengths
This paper studies the expressive power of GNNs from the new perspective of graph reconstructability. This topic has some significance in the theoretical studies of GNNs. The proposed approach is also different from existing works. Nonetheless, I have concerns with the quality of the paper (see more detailed comments in the section "Weakness").

### Weaknesses
The notion of graph reconstructability discussed in this paper is very different from graph reconstruction and graph properties in graph theory. Basically, the key idea of recovering a graph in this paper is based on encoding node and edge information, while the other graph topological information/properties (such as cycles, cliques, paths, etc.) are not relevant. In other words, if we assign each node with a unique identity, and then store the identity of a node along with the identities of its neighboring nodes (i.e., edges incident to each node) into its node feature, then a graph can always be represented (or say reconstructed if using the term of this paper) from node features. This is kind of a neural version of representing a graph using adjacency lists. However, this doesn't mean that GNNs with such node features are powerful for representing/learning graph topological information (e.g., cycles, cliques, etc.) that are useful for graph-related tasks. Furthermore, adding such node identities and embedding into node features would lead to the loss of permutation invariance, which is an important property of GNNs when learning structures. For example, two isomorphic graphs where their nodes are assigned with different identity features would have different node representations and become non-isomorphic. Thus, the way of analyzing GNNs in terms of graph reconstructability proposed in the paper does not contribute much to the theoretical analysis of expressiveness of GNNs.

Generally, the motivation of this work is unclear and misleading. The ability of encoding structural information like adjacency lists of a graph is different from the representational ability of GNNs that can extract useful structural properties for learning. Also, since the input graph is already given and available for analysis, why is it important to encode some additional identity/contextual features (which also cause additional computational cost) into node embeddings to reconstruct the input graph again? Particularly, on one hand, the cost of adding these feature initialization schemes is high; on the other hand, the addition of these feature initialization schemes cannot preserve the permutation invariant property.

The paper also has some technical issues. More specific comments are included in the next section for questions.

The clarity of the paper also needs improvement. Some statements are not self-contained. For example, the affliction matrix in Proposition 7 is not defined.

### Questions
1. For Proposition 1, the only if part is unclear. Why is the condition on the inner product of the embeddings of linked and non-linked node pairs the only way to ensure that a model is graph reconstructable?

2. What are $\tau_l$ and $\tau_u$ in the proofs of Proposition 2 and Proposition 3? Why is "-1" omitted in $\tau_l(D_i − 1)$?

3. For the definition of context features, why are they defined in terms of labels? Do you assume that label information of every node is available both in training and testing? Also, for the sentence "the contextual features include both signal (label information) and noise..." on Page 5, does signal in this paper refer to label information?

4. For the paragraph under Proposition 5, the authors mention "By contrast, GIN exploits $\epsilon$ to preserve the central node’s identity, ...". What does "the central node's identity" mean in terms of contextual features discussed here? 

5. The reason why GIN can approximate the 1-WL test is not only due to an irrational number $\epsilon^{(k)}$, but also the injectivity of the sum aggregation function. The proposed GRNN adds $w_j$ before each $\mathbf{h}_j$. This changed form cannot preserve the injectivity of node features in the aggregation any more. Does this matter for GRNN?

6. For the sentence "It is not feasible to distinguish the model capability in the real-world graph by GRR because each dataset contains one instance and thus only returns 1 or 0", what does this mean?
