## Abstract
Temporal difference (TD) learning is a popular method for reinforcement learning (RL). In this paper, we study federated TD learning with linear function approximation, where multiple agents collaboratively perform policy evaluation via TD learning, while interacting with heterogeneous environments and using heterogeneous computation configurations. We devise a Heterogeneous Federated TD (HFTD) algorithm which iteratively aggregates agents' local stochastic gradients for TD learning. The HFTD algorithm involves two major novel elements: 1) it aims to find the optimal value function model for the mixture environment averaged over agents' heterogeneous environments, using local stochastic gradients of agent's mean squared projected Bellman errors (MSPBEs) for their respective environments; 2) it allows agents to perform difference numbers of local iterations for TD learning. We analyze the finite-time convergence performance of the HFTD algorithm for the settings of I.I.D. sampling and Markovian sampling by characterizing bounds on the convergence error. Our results show that the HFTD algorithm can asymptotically converge to the optimal model, which is the first such result in existing works on federated RL (to our best knowledge). The HFTD algorithm also achieves sample complexity of $O\left( {\frac{1}{\varepsilon }\log \frac{1}{\varepsilon }} \right)$ and linear convergence speedup, which match the results of existing TD algorithms.

### Summary
This paper studies the federated RL problem, and designs a HFTD algorithm for federated TD learning with linear function approximation under environment heterogeneity and computation heterogeneity. It is shown that the HFTD algorithm can asymptotically converge to the optimal value function model achieving linear speedup in convergence. Numerical validations are provided.

### Strengths
+ A federated RL setting with heterogeneous environments and computations. 
+ A heterogeneous federated TD learning algorithm.
+ Non-asymptotic convergence analysis.

### Weaknesses
 - The presentation of the paper can be improved with a lot of grammar issues and inaccurate statements (see Questions below for details).  For example, there shall be citations for the statement "Hence, inspired by FL, federated reinforcement learning (FRL) has been proposed as a promising approach which allows agents to collectively learn the policy without sharing raw data samples." In the paper, only one citation on federated RL is provided (Wang et al. arXiv 2023). It is difficult to claim that FRL has been a "promising" approach. Overall, I am not convinced by merging the FL setup with RL. If every agent faces heterogeneous MDPs, what is the goal of the FRL? 
- The algorithm is a combination of the FL and TD learning algorithm; and the analysis also follows mostly from existing literature.

### Questions
1) There are quite a lot typos/grammar issues; See e.g., "each agents in FRL collects" "none of these works have shown" “design a federated TD algorithm that asymptotically converge to” “how much is the sample complexity of this algorithm? ” "We provide numeral results"
2) The paper claims that using federated multiple agents to collaboratively evaluate the policy can accelerate the convergence achieving linear speedup. It would be great if numerical results can be provided to demonstrate this linear speedup under heterogenous settings.

### Summary
The paper provided a Heterogeneous Federated TD algorithm for finding the optimal value function model for the mixture environments. They presented a sample complexity for both the I.I.D and Markovian sampling.

### Strengths
This paper provides a clear and comprehensive investigation into the ongoing challenges of enhancing the sample efficiency of RL agents using federated learning methods in diverse environments.

### Weaknesses
The paper has a lot of flaws in analysis.

-  In the abstract, the authors assert that the HFTD achieves linear speedup. Yet, the sample complexity is expressed as $O\left(\frac{1}{\epsilon} \log \frac{1}{\epsilon}\right)$, which doesn't scale with the number of agents $N$. This reveals an inconsistency between the theoretical analysis and the assertions made in the main text.

- The average mean gradient $\bar{g}(\theta)$ doesn't equal to the gradient of Eq(6). This discrepancy arises because $\bar{A}$ is nonsymmetric, whereas a true gradient should be such that the hessian is symmetric. Although Eq. (6) defines the objective of the HFTD algorithm as minimizing the MSPBE, the algorithm actually converges to $\theta^*$, which satisfies the average mean gradient $\bar{g}\left(\theta^*\right)=0$. Hence, $\theta^*$ does not denote the MSPBE's minimum.  As such, HFTD failed in finding the optimal value of the MSPBE.

- The paper's main body contains multiple conflicting statements. The abstract mentions a mixed environment as the average of $N$
heterogeneous environments. However, in Sec 4, it's conveyed that this environment is randomly drawn from the heterogeneous environments. These descriptions are contradictory.

- The authors didn't provide a fair comparison between the results of their paper and those of existing works. In table (1), the objective of Wang (2023) was to find the optimal value function of $i$-th agent, which more focused on the personalization. However, in this paper, the objective function is to find the optimal value function of all $N$ environments, which was in the average sense. If the authors changed the optimality to $i$-th agent's optimal value function,  their methods still cannot converge exactly without the gradient heterogeneity in Assumption 2.

- The bound was quite loose and coarse. The standard convergence result in FL supervised learning [1] is $O(\frac{1}{NTK})$. However, this paper only gave a result of $O(\frac{1}{T}})$, which can not be scaled by $N$ and $K$.

### Questions
* What is the dependence on the conditional number $\lambda$ in your sample complexity results? Does this match the existing results in the centralized TD setting [2]?

* What is the dependence on the mixing time for the Markovian sampling in your sample complexity results? Does this match the existing results in the centralized TD setting [2]?

* As mentioned before, $\theta^*$ satisfying $\bar{g}\left(\theta^*\right)=0$ can only find the optimal value function corresponding to the mixture environment, which was a weighted average of $N$ heterogenous environments in Lemma 3. Why should we consider to find this $\theta^*$? What is the motivation of finding $\theta^*$? Because  $\theta^*$ may not equal to the average value function across all agents.

* What is the motivation of doing federation? From the results, the sample complexity can not be scaled by $N$? What's the incentive and benefit for each agent to join the federation?

### Summary
This paper addresses the problem of federated reinforcement learning in the presence of environmental heterogeneity, where agents operate in diverse environments characterized by the same state and action spaces but distinct transition dynamics and reward functions. The authors derive perturbation bounds on the TD fixed points, which quantify the deviation of the fixed points based on the heterogeneity in the agents' MDPs. To establish the analysis results, the authors explore the properties of the virtual MDP, a concept introduced by the existing work on federated reinforcement learning with environmental heterogeneity. The paper's contributions include the development of a federated version of the TD algorithm tailored for this particular setup and the analysis results suggesting that under the assumption that all specified conditions are met, the study reveals that the linear convergence speedups are achievable with linearly parameterized models in a low-heterogeneity regime, which corresponds to scenarios approaching the homogenous case.

### Strengths
This paper offers a well-written and comprehensible exploration of the open challenge of improving the sample efficiency of RL agents by employing federated learning techniques with agents operating in heterogeneous environments. One of the key contributions of this paper is the investigation of the approximation error in federated learning as a function of environmental heterogeneity, which is then used to develop a federated version of the TD algorithm specifically tailored for the considered scenario. This algorithm leverages the advantages of federated learning to facilitate knowledge exchange and collaboration among the agents, improving the overall learning process. The result is significant, although I did not assess the correctness of all the proofs.

### Weaknesses
1. The simulations were conducted on the platform: GridWorld. Expanding simulations to more complex or diverse environments could provide a more comprehensive understanding of the algorithm's performance in practice.
2. While the authors verified theoretical results in a small-scale problem in a tabular form, it might be valuable to test on larger-scale problems or non-tabular formulations.
3. A deeper exploration of the algorithm's limitations or challenges, especially in real-world scenarios, might add depth to the research.

### Questions
Would a real-world setting disrupt the assumptions required for analysis and negatively impact performance?
