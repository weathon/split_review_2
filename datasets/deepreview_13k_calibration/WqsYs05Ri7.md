- Decision: Reject
- Avg Score: 5.20
- Scores: 6, 6, 5, 6, 3

## Abstract
Model explanations can be valuable for interpreting and debugging predictive models.
    We study a specific kind called Concept Explanations, where the goal is to interpret a model using human-understandable concepts.
    Although popular for their easy interpretation, concept explanations are known to be noisy. 
    We begin our work by identifying various sources of uncertainty in the estimation pipeline that lead to such noise. 
    We then propose an uncertainty-aware Bayesian estimation method to address these issues, which readily improved the quality of explanations. 
    We demonstrate with theoretical analysis and empirical evaluation that explanations computed by our method are robust to train-time choices while also being label-efficient.     
    Further, our method proved capable of recovering relevant concepts amongst a bank of thousands, in an evaluation with real-datasets and off-the-shelf models, demonstrating its scalability.
    We believe the improved quality of uncertainty-aware concept explanations make them a strong candidate for more reliable model interpretation.

3: You are fairly confident in your assessment. It is possible that you did not understand some parts of the submission or that you are unfamiliar with some pieces of related work. Math/other details were not carefully checked.

### Summary
The authors propose a technique (U-ACE) for estimating concept relevance that is robust to misspecification of the concept set.  At a high level, their algorithm 1) estimates noise in concept activations, 2) takes it into account when estimating the concept-label weight matrix, 3) applies a sparsification step.  The paper also looks at the difference between this technique and a simpler linear fit in the context of linear models.  U-ACE is compared to other concept-based explainers (and concept-based models) on a variety of tasks.

### Strengths
**Originality**: The idea of incorporating concept uncertainty in CBEs is, to the best of my knowledge, novel.  It is however well aligned with recent work in CBMs (as mentioned in the related work).  The specific technique used here seems also to be novel.

**Quality**: The approach itself is well motivated.  Admittedly, I did not check the mathematical derivations.  The general idea is however sensible.  The research questions are well aligned with the key message.  The choice of competitors is also good.  The results seem to indicate that U-ACE is more robust to issues like vocabulary misspecification and data shift, which is good.

**Clarity**:  English is mostly good and the text is generally readable.

**Significance**: CBEs and CBMs are a pretty hot topic, and this paper touches on a number of very relevant aspects.  Uncertainty is definitely one element that is (at least in part) dismissed in the current literature, yet it is important for trustworthiness/faithfulness of explanations.

### Weaknesses
 **Clarity**:  The text is definitely too dense in parts (especially Section 3).  Some paragraphs feel rushed and would enjoy a rewrite.  There are also some typos (I mentioned a few below).

**Significance**: [Q1] My understanding is that the implementation of m(x) and s(x) is model specific -- that is, the equation explain how to derive these quantities for image-text multimodal systems.  So, while the general setup is model-agnostic, the specific algorithm is likely not.

Minor issues
----

- p 2: There is a typo in the equation of v_k in page 2 (it should read \mathcal{D}^{k}_c).

- p 2: "a class of algorithms propose to train"

- p 3: "recall that K is number of concepts and L the number of labels" -> $K$, $L$.  Also in p 5.

- p 3: It wouldn't hurt to clarify the steps in the mathematical derivation.  Also, why is s(x) being averaged over?  Why can't it be used as-is?  If $\beta$ is the inverse variance of noise in observations, why is it being optimized?  Section 3 should be unpacked to facilitate understanding.  Right now it is unnecessarily opaque.

- p 6: "This baseline is used in the past"

- p 6, plots: "Fration"

- p 8: "since model-to-be-explained"

- p 8: "We note that U-ACE generated explanations are more convincing over O-CBM or Y-CBM."

### Questions
Q1.  As I mentioned in the weakness section, I am under the impression the implementation is model specific.  Could you please confirm this?  If so, how should m(x) and s(x) be estimated for other models?

I am willing to increase my score provided the authors clarify this point.

### Summary
This paper observes that the lack of uncertainty estimation as part of models that integrated concepts is problematic. It then proposes learn a confidence interval for the concept scores that are learnt in traditional post-hoc concept bottleneck models. Overall, the scheme estimates concept activations along with a confidence interval for that particular activation. You then learn a linear predictor on top of the concept activation, however, the formulation here constrains the linear predictor to satisfy some particular properties. They then compare this uncertainty aware estimator to other post-hoc CBMs on a variety of synthetic and real-world datasets to demonstrate its favorable properties.

### Strengths
Overall, this work points out some challenges with current CBMs. Here is an overview of the key strengths of this paper.

- **Incomplete Concept Set, Concept Difficulty, and Shift**: This paper identifies two challenges, that are often true in practice that undermine the effective of standard concept activations. The paper then proposes a method to address this challenges. The core insight is that error interval allow us to know whether to trust the concept activations of the model. If the interval is large then caution needs to be taken.

- **Assessment in a Setting with Ground-Truth**: A big challenge with post-hoc interpretations is that it can be difficult to know when the method used to perform the post-hoc interpretation is reliable. In their experiments, the authors design a setting where the ground-truth is known, and  use it to assess their formulation along with several other baselines.

### Weaknesses
Overall, I think this paper has a nice formulation, but I was confused about certain aspects of the work. I detail them below. 

- **Why focus on the post-hoc CBM setting?**: I understand the justification that it is difficult to get annotations for all of the training set. This is true and a known limitation, but I think the authors missed a chance to at least demonstrate the importance of the uncertainty estimation part of their work. Right now, I think the authors choose the model difficult setting, the post-hoc CBM. One way to show the effectiveness of this scheme is to first demonstrate in the setting where you have all training set annotations. Although I understand that when you use a small concept set to convert a black-box to CBM model, the challenges of dataset shift and incomplete concept set are exacerbated. For me, it would have been easier to digest the method independent of post-hoc CBMs. This is more of a suggestion. 

- **Implications in Section 3**: Here the authors make a series of implications to arrive at distribution of weight vectors. I don't see how that holds clearly, especially the second implication. Why does a high probability bound on the dot product of the weight and noise imply that? What is the distributional assumption on the noise? Also, can the authors explain how they arrive at eqn 1? It looks like a gaussian identity, but I want to clarify. 

- **Sparsifying the weights**: Instead of picking the threshold by hand, why can't the authors impose a lasso penalty here as is done for the simple baseline?

- **Section 3.1 is confusing**: Until here, there was nothing about multimodal functions/CLIP in the paper. But all of a sudden, it is incorporated to compute the mean and error function. I think you could do away with the CLIP discussion in that section and just call CLIP/Multimodal function an embedding function. Based on that description, I still don't understand how the mean and errors are computed. Proposition 1 discusses this, but why is this? It seems like this section adopts the notation of  Oikarinen et al. (2023). I would've thought that the procedure here can give an error estimate for any generic function that of the input to the concept activation? Is there a way to abstract away the specific form of the concept activation of Oikarinen et al. (2023) in this formulation? Stated differently, what is $\vec{m}(x)$, and $\vec{s}(x)$ for a standard CBM?

- **The problem with CLIP**: The formulation here ties in with CLIP intimately. It is clear that if you want to use something like this for say proteins, sequences, or other modalities, then CLIP will not help you. You'd want the equivalent of CLIP for the domain you are working with.

### Summary
This paper proposes a method for estimating concept importance in models in an uncertainty-aware manner. The method builds upon existing work on representation space registration between CLIP models and other deep learning models, providing an approach for unsupervised concept detection. A predefined set of concepts is given, then this approach estimates latent space directions for each concept using a probe set (special dataset), which can be used to compute a concept-activation score for each concept using a given image as well as an uncertainty estimate for that concept-activation score. Once the concept scores and their uncertainties are estimated, a sparse linear model is fit to the data (predicting actual model outputs from class activation scores as inputs) with a prior that encourages the linear model to be robust to concept noise. Experiments assess the ability of the method to avoid attributing importance to unused features, attribute importance in proportion to a concept’s ground-truth known importance, and lastly to produce concept attributions that are close to those from a linear model fit to a model using human concept data (predicting model outputs from human concept annotations over images).

### Strengths
- Very Important: The paper addresses two clear and important problems with current concept attribution methods: (1) the need for supervised data in concept estimation and (2) that current methods generally do not include uncertainty estimates for concept vectors (more on uncertainity of concept attributions later).
- Important: The paper carries out a number of experiments that support the method’s ability to pick up on important concepts to model predictions. Beyond simulations with ground-truth concept importance, the method also achieves a better fit against a pseudo-ground-truth “simple” model with access to ground truth annotations when run over a more realistic vision model on real image scenes, relative to methods like TCAV.

### Weaknesses
 - Very Important: This paper attempts to address two topics at once, and its novelty is severely undercut by existing work in both directions. At least, I say it attempts to address two topics because that is how it is pitched and evaluated, although the technical novelty of the paper is to incorporate uncertainty into concept estimation (and it only uses existing approaches to *unsupervised* concept estimation). Anyway, the paper comes on the heels of a number of works on unsupervised concept detection, including https://openreview.net/pdf?id=iOlYmD1PtC8, https://arxiv.org/pdf/2304.09707.pdf, and https://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.08600.pdf. I believe all of these works appeared within the last six months, so they are concurrent work. However, perhaps more importantly, the unsupervised concept detection in this paper uses strictly existing methods based on CLIP, so there is not novelty on the supervision side. On the concept estimation side, there is older work on the subject, e.g. this 2021 paper https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2021/file/4e246a381baf2ce038b3b0f82c7d6fb4-Paper.pdf, in addition to the concurrent 2023 citation in the submission (Probabilistic Concept Bottleneck Models. The 2021 Slack et al paper focuses on linear feature attribution wrt input features rather than concept vectors, but rest of the subject is the same and this paper also introduces a Bayesian model for handling uncertainty in the attribution. Or if this problem setting is not too similar to the one in this paper, what is the difficulty in uncertainty for the vector v_k in Sec. 3.1, which is the concept vector, using any number of standard uncertainty measurements (whether frequentist or Bayesian)?
- Very Important: Core details of the paper are not clear. How is s(x) computed? What is sin(x)? I know *cos*(.) is defined, but the italicized *sin*(.) is never defined? I don’t take it to literally be the sine function. This is the centerpiece of uncertainty estimation, and I really could not tell where the uncertainty was supposed to come from.
- Important: The prior for the regression model is not well motivated. First, since the regression weights are filtered with a threshold for zeroing small weights, it’s clear that a spike-and-slab prior or another sparsity-encouraging prior would have been more appropriate. But the paper aims to encourage weights to be orthogonal to a noise vector. What is this noise vector? It’s a *mean confidence interval vector* judging by Fig. 1 which shows activations as m(x) +/- s(x). This implies that the weights are supposed to be orthogonal to the upper bound of a per-data-point confidence interval, averaged across the data. Maybe I’m misunderstanding something, but at the moment, I have no idea why this would be a good prior for the model.
- Important: Fair comparison with baselines: How was Y-CBM tuned, and what exactly is the final different with U-ACE? Is it just the prior? Is the technical contribution here mainly the prior? How would an L1 or another sparsity inducing prior affect Y-CBM performance in Table 1?
- Of some importance: It doesn’t make sense to ask what the importance of green is when there are no green images in the probe set (Fig3 middle) or what the importance of red is when the images are all green. Just because CLIP registration enables one to ask this question does not make it meaningful, and a practicioner should notice that their probe set contains no example of green before trying to estimate the importance of green. The same applies for the “fruit” example. The quality of concept estimation is heavily bottlenecked by probe set quality, as noted in this paper, but it has to be the practitioner’s responsibility at some point to check the quality and diversity of the probe set before trying to estimate concept importance for concepts that do not appear at all in the set.

### Questions
- If the method uses the last hidden layer, isn’t the method basically replacing the final hidden state with an estimated concept feature vector and replacing the final linear layer with a learned linear layer that tries to approximate the original model’s outputs? This is odd because if the concept vectors are directions in the model latent space, then one would think that a concept attribution explanation is explainable merely by computing the projection of the model’s linear layer with the concept vector, and there is no need to recreate a feature vector m(x) for each datapoint (which uses the learned concept vector v only in small part) and learn a new linear model to estimate concept importance.
- So what is the source of uncertainty that U-ACE accounts for? Data uncertainty? Model uncertainty for the deep learned model? If it’s data uncertainity, why can’t TCAV be equipped with a simple data uncertainty measurement? If the TCAV concept attribution score is a binary proportion, then a binomial probability confidence interval would be very easy to use for it, and much more intuitive than s(x).
- “Simple estimates explanation using concept annotations and therefore its explanation must
be the closest to the ground-truth” — What would the ground-truth look like for the experiment in 4.3?
- typo: UNCERTAINITY
- typo: while other methods the importance
- “Since the co-occurrence probability of U with car class goes from 1, 0.5 to 0, we expect the importance score of U should change from positive to negative as we move right”  — It doesn’t change to negative in the graph, although it does get lower

### Summary
This paper identifies that concept explanation methods are unstable along both concepts choice and dataset choice. The papers discusses how this instability is due to improper noise modeling. To overcome these issues, they propose an uncertainty aware concept explanation method. Through both theoretical and empirical analysis they generally find the concept explanations lead to more stable concept based explanations.

### Strengths
- The idea is quite interesting. Concept based explanations are generally known to suffer from key issues related to instability. These issues sometimes affect their use more generally, and this paper does a good job of identifying / offering a potential solution. 
- The results concerning increasing concept set vs. introduced noise are quite interesting + methods discussed in 3.1 to help overcome these issues are quite compelling
- The experimental results in 4.2 as irrelevant concepts are added are also quite interesting and indicate the usefulness of the method to overcome noise in concepts -- I think this could be quite a useful method to help overcome these issues.

### Weaknesses
 - In general, the most significant weakness of this paper was presentation and clarity. The results are quite interesting and relevant to work on concept based explanations. Nevertheless, the paper was quite hard to follow in places and could do with a bit of work to more clearly express the main takeaways and experimental evaluations. In the current form, the paper is quite hard to follow.
- The presentation of the experimental results could be improved. In 4.1, the "Unreliability due to misspecified concept set" subsection feels a bit odd in the flow of the paper, because it serves as a pointer to the appendix, perhaps it would be better if this is incorporated into another paragraph to keep the flow of the paper clearer.

### Questions
- Could you contextualize the significant of proposition 3? It understandable that its important this is the case (namely, that near zero importance scores occur), but I would be interested to understand whether this is expected to be the case or not with other concept explanation baselines?
