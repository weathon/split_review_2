## Abstract
While backpropagation (BP) is the mainstream approach for gradient computation in neural network training, its heavy reliance on the chain rule of differentiation constrains the designing flexibility of network architecture and training pipelines. We avoid the recursive computation in BP and develop a unified likelihood ratio (ULR) method for gradient estimation with just one forward propagation. Not only can ULR be extended to train a wide variety of neural network architectures, but the computation flow in BP can also be rearranged by ULR for better device adaptation. Moreover, we propose several variance reduction techniques to further accelerate the training process. Our experiments offer numerical results across diverse aspects, including various neural network training scenarios, computation flow rearrangement, and fine-tuning of pre-trained models. All findings demonstrate that ULR effectively enhances the flexibility of neural network training by permitting localized module training without compromising the global objective and significantly boosts the network robustness.

### Summary
This paper presents a unified framework for training neural networks with likelihood ratio estimation methods.
Likelihood ratio estimation has the benefit of avoiding backpropagation for gradient computation, thus leveraging the backward lock.
Such optimization methods are thus amenable to greater parallelization, as gradient computation for different modules can be performed independently of each other given the final loss evaluation.
The authors combine two variance reduction techniques to make the technique practical.
The proposed method is evaluated on a diverse set of experiments covering various deep learning applications.
The ablation studies cover most of the critical components of the proposed method.
The paper may lack some discussion about the practical limitations but is overall well-written, with some sparse exceptions, and the research is well-conducted.

### Strengths
1) The paper is dense, with all the details needed to implement the proposed method. In particular, gradient estimators for the parameters of ubiquitous neural architecture components are provided.
2) The proposed framework offers large flexibility with respect to the practical implementation, e.g. for model parallelism.
3) The proposed set of experiments covers a diverse range of applications in deep learning. The ablation study in the main body covers important aspects of the proposed method, such as the type of perturbation, as well as the practical relevance of the variance reduction techniques employed. Many additional experiments are provided in the appendix.

### Weaknesses
1) I don't understand theorem 1. It seems that the function $g^l$ is implicitly defined in the proof. But I don't understand if this translates into a condition on $f^l$ in the hypothesis of the theorem, and if so, why the condition does not directly involve $f^l$. The function $g$ is not a component of the gradient estimator, so I don't understand why it is present in the hypothesis. Also, the variable $\xi$ seems to represent $z^l$ (or ($z^{l+1}$) and I'm not sure what this condition implies.
2) Does the star in equation (3) represent a convolution or a term-by-term product?
3) The set of experiments chosen are a bit simple. While it is, for example, promising to produce good classification accuracy for MNIST and CIFAR10, the question of scaling these methods to larger models or more complex datasets is not being discussed. The experiments do not explore the trade-offs between the number of perturbed layers and the accuracy of the gradient estimation. This is a crucial point since the method's appeal lies in its potential for parallelization, which would be greatly influenced by the number of independent gradient computations that can be performed simultaneously. A more comprehensive analysis of this trade-off is needed to fully assess the practical scalability of the method.
4) [Minor comments] "Since these methods change the classical training paradigm or even give up the
gradient information. Many algorithmic or hardware technologies developed based on BP by predecessors cannot be fully leveraged, making such approaches computationally unfriendly." this might have been a single sentence.

### Questions
1) I may have missed it, but it's not clear from the text whether all parameters should be perturbed independently. It seems that it would help to have a better correlation between the noises and the loss, but this does not seem to be the case in the experiments.
Is there a middle ground between only perturbing the logits of the last layer, all layers, or all neurons independently?
2) Could the authors provide some hints on the current practical limit of the method with respect to model size and dataset?
For example, does this method scale for a resnet18 or resnet50 on CIFAR10 or ImageNet?
3) [Minor question] "LR has almost no constraints on the model, including differentiability or traceability, enabling explorations of network architectures." --> Could you explain how it enables explorations of network architectures?

### Summary
This paper proposes a unified likelihood ratio (ULR) method to avoid the recursive computation of backpropagation. By imposing noise to input data in forward propagation, ULR can approximate the gradient independently for each layer in backpropagation. The authors show how ULR can be applied to architectures such as DNNs, CNNs, RNNs, GNNs, and SNNs, and also introduce techniques to reduce the variance of ULR. The proposed method not only performs comparably to backpropagation, but is also more efficient than backpropagation in some highly recursive computationally demanding tasks.

### Strengths

The proposed method not only performs comparably to backpropagation, but is also more efficient than backpropagation in some highly recursive computationally demanding tasks.

### Weaknesses
Due to layer-wise noise injection, which is one of the proposed variance reduction techniques, ULR has a forward propagation cost that is proportional to the number of layers. When applied to deep networks with many layers (ResNet-152, BERT-large, etc.), it may have a high computational cost compared to backpropagation. The NNs used in the experiments have a small number of layers (ResNet-5, VGG-8), which does not address this concern. Specifically, the computational overhead of performing multiple forward passes with perturbed inputs for each layer, especially in very deep networks, could negate the benefits of avoiding backpropagation. Furthermore, the paper does not provide a clear analysis of how the magnitude of the injected noise affects the accuracy of the gradient approximation, and whether this noise level needs to be tuned for different layers or network architectures. This lack of analysis raises concerns about the practical applicability of ULR in scenarios where optimal noise parameters are not known beforehand.

### Questions
Why did you plot the experiments in Figures 7 and 11 separately for each layer? What observations can we make there?

### Summary
This work proposes the Unified Likelihood Ratio (ULR) a method that allows for more efficient neural network optimization. ULR is based on the old idea of zero-order optimization with likelihood ratio, reinterpreted in way that allows for optimising neural networks while avoiding back propagation, either entirely or some parts of it. By adding noise to either the activations or the weights, with the likelihood ratio method one only needs the loss (which can even be non-differentiable) evaluated at the noisy inputs in order to obtain a gradient for the terms that contributed to the noisy input (instead of the gradient of the loss itself with respect to the noisy input). The authors discuss how this idea generalises to various architectures, while also discussing three specific techniques that reduce the variance of the gradient estimates, which is very important for the practical success of a zero-order method. The authors evaluate ULR on several tasks and architectures while also performing an ablation study on their proposed variance reduction techniques and the impact of the perturbations on various points in the network.

### Strengths
- Simple method that works well in practice and tackles the practically relevant problem of efficient neural network optimization, especially given the recent successes of large models. The framework is quite general and the computation graph rearrangement via ULR is especially interesting.
- The experiments are quite diverse and informative.
- The paper is generally well-written.
- The variance reduction techniques highlighted, although quite standard, seem to help quite a bit in practice

### Weaknesses
 - The work has a misleading claim; the authors argue that one forward pass is enough however in practice multiple forward passes are used in order to estimate the gradient (to reduce variance / antithetic variables). I would suggest that the authors rephrase the claim appropriately. 
- The extension of LR to various network architectures is straightforward and not particularly novel.
- As far as I understand, the variance reduction techniques discussed at 3.3 seem to not be applied on the baselines, e.g., ES, so it is unclear where to attribute the gap in performance
- The architectures and settings are a bit toy; it would be interesting to see how ULR performs on much larger architectures (e.g., ResNet50 and Imagenet or GPT-2 on a reasonably sized text dataset)

### Questions
I find the overall paper interesting, especially the computation graph rearrangement part. Having said that, ULR seems to also be a combination of existing ideas and techniques, so it is not entirely novel. However, given the relatively good results, I am leaning towards acceptance. My questions and suggestions are the following

- Before section 3.2, the authors discuss about adaptive perturbations by optimising the noise, however, as far as I understand, this is not used anywhere in the paper. How is the performance with adaptive noise?
- On the RNN side, it seems that the authors add noise on each step, which can compound over time. Why is this strategy preferred compared to, e.g., just adding noise to the weights and evaluating the entire sequence on these noised weights (e.g., as done for convolutional layers). 
- I would suggest the authors to incorporate the variance reduction techniques to ES as well, in order to better highlight what the delta with ULR is. 
- At Figure 6, it is unclear what are the BP and ULR metrics. 
- At Figure 7 what is the reference BP gradient compared against? The true gradient of the noised loss (i.e., the one that includes the noise from ULR) or the gradient of loss without any noise (which is the one we care about)? 
- At the discussion of Figure 5 and Demo 1, the authors argue that the ULR can skip the calculation in late layers, however, this is not entirely true as ULR still needs the forward pass through those layers to compute the loss value. 
- Finally, the accuracy of the base BP model on CIFAR 10 is kind of small; do the authors use data augmentations?

### Summary
This paper proposes a unified likelihood ratio (ULR) method that extends the existing likelihood ratio (LR) method to deal with neural network models other than MLPs, including CNNs, RNNs, GNNs, and SNNs. ULR injects noise into the output of each layer, which they call a logit, to estimate the gradient of parameters in the layer instead of using the usual back-propagation (BP), which is theoretically justified by the push-out technique proposed in the LR paper.
Several techniques are proposed to reduce the variance of gradient estimation by noise injection, such as layer-wise injection, antithetic variables, and quasi-Monte Carlo.
Experimental results suggest that ULR allows the training of (relatively shallow) neural networks whose performance is comparable to the model trained with BP.
In addition, models trained with ULR are shown to be more robust to inputs corrupted by adversarial or natural noise.

### Strengths
- The existing LR method is extended to deal with various NN architectures, including CNNs, RNNs, GNNs, and SNNs.
- Variance reduction methods are proposed and empirically shown to be effective.
- Experiments are performed on CNNs, RNNs, GNNs, and SNNs where ULR is compared to BP.

### Weaknesses
 - It is difficult, at least for me, to follow the technical details of the proposed ULR for the following reasons:
    - In Section 3.1, several expectations ($\mathbb{E}$) appear to explain the proposed method. But I could not understand in which variables and distributions these expectations are defined. For example, it is unclear if $\mathbb{E}$ is over the noise distribution, the data distribution, or both. The lack of clarity makes it hard to grasp the core mechanism of the proposed method.
    - Conditional expectations such as $\mathbb{E}[\mathcal{L}(x^L)|\xi, x^l]$ are also difficult to understand exactly. It is not clear what $\xi$ represents, and how it relates to the noise injected at layer $l$. The notation is not sufficiently defined to follow the derivation.
    - What is $J_{\theta^l}$ in Eq.(2), which is not defined in the manuscript? Is it the Jacobian of $x^{l+1}$ with respect to $\theta^l$, or the Jacobian of the original output $\varphi^l(x^l;\theta^l)$ with respect to $\theta^l$? The distinction is crucial, but the manuscript does not clarify this point.
- In experiments, ULR is only applied to relatively shallow NNs, such as ResNet-5 or VGG-8. This raises concerns about the scalability of the method to deeper networks, which are more common in practical applications. The paper does not provide sufficient evidence that ULR can be effectively applied to more complex architectures.

- As in the title of the paper, it is claimed that ULR requires only one forward computation to estimate the gradient. However, following Algorithm 1 in the paper, it seems to me that ULR requires additional multiple forward computations with respect to $z^l$, whose size is specified in the appendix as ranging from 50 to 800, to compute the loss values. If this is true, I wonder if ULR really reduces the computational effort compared to BP.

- In section 3.1, it is suggested to optimize the noise distribution parameter. But it seems a bit strange to me to optimize the noise distribution with respect to the loss value. Instead, I think the noise distribution should be optimized to improve the gradient estimation.

- In Figure 4, does ULR-WL for ResNet-5 mean the hybrid model explained in Section 4.3? What about the details of ULR-WL for VGG-8? The description of the experimental setup is not detailed enough to reproduce the results.

- In page 4: $b \in \mathbb{R}^{c_\text{out}}$ -> $b^O \in \mathbb{R}^{c_\text{out}}$. It is unclear if $b$ and $b^O$ represent the same parameter, and if not, what their relationship is.
