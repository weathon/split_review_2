## Abstract
The identifiability of latent variable models has received increasing attention due to its relevance in interpretability and out-of-distribution generalisation. In this work, we study the identifiability of Switching Dynamical Systems, taking an initial step toward extending identifiability analysis to sequential latent variable models. We first prove the identifiability of Markov Switching Models, which commonly serve as the prior distribution for the continuous latent variables in Switching Dynamical Systems. We present identification conditions for first-order Markov dependency structures, whose transition distribution is parametrised via non-linear Gaussians. We then establish the identifiability of the latent variables and non-linear mappings in Switching Dynamical Systems up to affine transformations, by leveraging identifiability analysis techniques from identifiable deep latent variable models. We finally develop estimation algorithms for identifiable Switching Dynamical Systems. Throughout empirical studies, we demonstrate the practicality of identifiable Switching Dynamical Systems for segmenting high-dimensional time series such as videos, and showcase the use of identifiable Markov Switching Models for regime-dependent causal discovery in climate data.

### Summary
This paper provides identifiability theorems for general dynamical systems with nonlinear transitions and emission functions. This is done first by showing identifiability for Markov Switching Models and then for Switching Dynamical Systems. Variational inference algorithms are presented for learning and posterior inference.

### Strengths
The presentation is good and the paper reads well with nice explanations in many places.

It is in general important work to study and expand our understanding of identifiability in these models. Here the identifiability is shown for a general class of MSMs and SDSs which is a nice result. In particular, the identifiability does not assume independence of the latent components unlike like the works in the nonlinear ICA area.

It is also nice to see experiments, albeit somewhat limited (see below), on real data despite the theoretical focus of the paper.

### Weaknesses
1) **The identifiability approach/results follow quite directly from previous works with some results already known previously** -- one could have assumed the results here to be already implied based on earlier works: the approach for proving MSM using mixtures model presentation is well known from the general work in [1] (which could be cited). While this specific class of models covered in this work is not explicitly mentioned, the results therein could be seen as already implying the identifiability of this type of models -- more explicit acknowledgement that this approach has been taken before would probably be sufficient (for the MSM results). The identifiabiltiy of SDSs with nonlinear activation function is just an application of the Kivva paper on this specific model class. Further identifiability of SDSs (in nonlinear ICA form) has actually already been established -- below point covers this more.

2) **There are lacking citations and incorrect interpretations of previous works** -- if these are acknowledged appropriately the contributions of this paper would appear less significant. Most importantly, this paper claims that previous works have not considered identifiability in nonlinear dynamical systems with nonlinear emission function: specifically the authors state that "In contrast, Hälvä et al. (2021) assumes linear SDSs," -- this is not correct,  their identifiability results do not appear to make any such assumptions (based on my reading of their Theorems 1 and 2); their practical algorithm does seem to assume that but that has nothing to do with the identifiability. Identifiability of SDSs is thus achieved in their work. For identifiability of models with autoregressive transitions, see also [2], and the IIA-HMM model particularly -- I don't see this paper mentioned and discussed even though it has some similarity. In terms of estimation algorithm, the seminal work of [3] is not mentioned -- you need to at least explain why their work does not apply here or why the current approach is superior.

3) **The identifiability results are weaker than acknowledged. or at least not sufficiently discussed** By directly relying on the result of Kivva to prove the identifiability of the nonlinear emission function / latent components, the results unfortunately inherit its weaknesses. 1) The identifiability requires one to know the family of the noise distribution which is a cumbersome assumption (but see Q2 below). 2) The results relies on piecewise linear emission function and is therefore less general than many other works that allow e.g. almost any injective $f(x)$ -- consider for instance what happens in your case if $f(x)$ is a Gaussian Process. 3) As far as I understand, that while there is no assumption of independence here (c.f. nonlinear ICA), the results are also clearly weaker i.e. for latent vector $\mathbf{z}$ your results give essentially $f(\mathbf{z}) = Af'(\mathbf{z'}) + b$ -- contrast this to nonlinear ICA where one would identify the individual coordinates as per $z_i = h(z_i')$ for some invertible $h$ -- please correct if I have misunderstood. 

4) ** Experimental evaluation lacking in places**: The evaluation of the models on the salsa data seems very qualitative and much more rigorous evaluation would be preferred with some quantitative evaluation metrics.(Q3 below)

misc.:
- "p(z) is identifiable up to affine transformations" -- This is imprecise language, explain whether you mean parameter identificaiton or identification of z or what.
- Definition 2.1 define what $B$ is
- grammar: "The generative model consider in this work" 
- Equation (4) and elswhere you use $p_a$ but earlier $p_{\theta}$, please explain more clearly what the subscript $a$ means
- Figure 2 is poor quality -- please provide a better quality figure
- "Hälvä et al. (2021) introduces time-dependence between sources via linear SDSs" , this appears to be incorrect as mentioned above (this mistake is in two places in the paper)

### Questions
Q1: What is the justification for you estimation algorithm in light of the existence of the work [3] (see reference above) including benefits, disadvantages?

Q2: Why do use the results of Khemakhem, Kivva that assumes that we know the noise terms distribution? Why do you not instead apply e.g. the results from Halva et al (2021), Theorem 1, that allows any arbitrary noise distribution?

Q3: Why is it not possible to apply a more quantitative performance metric in the salsa experiment -?

### Summary
This work proposes an identifiability results of switching dynamical systems. The results are a direct extension of Kivva et al. (2022). The main idea is to show that the distribution under the switch dynamic system can be represented through finite mixture distributes which are indeed identifiable.

### Strengths
- The identifiability results of switching dynamical systems are proposed.

### Weaknesses
 - Does the number of states need to be specified as prior information?
- Whether the number of states is identifiable and how to select it practically.
- It would be better if there has a simple example to show the identifiability of the model in theory.
- Moreover, the definition of the identifiability in this work should be stated clearly.

### Summary
This work focuses on the identifiability of Markov Switching Models and extended it to Switching Dynamical Systems. The authors presented identification conditions for first-order Markov models that uses non-linear Gaussian transitions. They proved the identifiability of Switching Dynamical Systems up to affine transformations. They also developed corresponding estimation algorithms. The proposed method was demonstrated by empirical studies on time series such as videos and climate data.

### Strengths
Conditions in which first-order MSMs with non-linear Gaussian transitions are identifiable up to permutations. 

Analysis of identifiability conditions for non-parametric first-order MSMs.

Conditions for SDSs identifiability up to affine transformations of the latent variables and non-linear emission.

Discovery of time-dependent causal structures in time-series.

### Weaknesses
The conditions of identifiability such as invertibility are strong and thus less nontrivial, and would limit the practicality.

The empirical studies lack demonstration of identifiability or the benefits of identifiability.

### Questions
Could the authors discuss how useful the identifiability would be in practice, especially for those latent variables? I'm not questioning the contribution. I have seen papers talking about the identifiability subject to certain transformations, but few showcase it in their examples.

The index $a$ and $s$ seem exchangeable. What's the difference?

The study's findings are empirically verified with synthetic experiments and suggest practical applications for causal discovery and time series segmentation in real and synthetic data.

### Introduction

- Your definition of causal identifiability is wrong. You say: "In causal inference (Peters et al., 2017), identifiability refers to whether the underlying causal structure can be correctly pinpointed from infinite observational data." - that is not at all what identifiability means in causal inference. It means whether or not an intervention e.g. $P(Y \mid do(X=x))$ can be computed only from knowledge of the observational distribution $P(V)$ where $V$ is the set of all variables in the causal model, and the causal diagram $\mathcal{G}$. What you are referring to has more to do with _causal discovery_ which is the process of learning the true DAG from the observational data.

### Background

- Is it important that $K < +\infty$?
- It may help readability if you use different symbols, rather than $\theta$ for everything, for the different densities.

### Theoretical considerations

- This section may be better called 'Methods'. The current heading is a bit ambiguous - theoretical considerations of what?
- I do not understand, what does $\{1,\ldots, K^T\} \rightarrow \{1,\ldots,K\}^T$ mean?
- What are these mild measure-theoretic considerations? What does 'mild' mean in this context?
- You are interchangeably using | and \mid in your densities, pick one.
- Typo: 'indentifiability' under definition 3.2

### Related work

- Again, your definition of causal identifiability does not mean what you say it does.

### Experiments

- I am confused. In section 6.2 you are using the correct term 'causal discovery' and you are using the idea correctly as well, so why are you referring to the structure learning with 'identifiability' hitherto?

### Conclusion

- Same here; _causal discovery_ is being used rather than identifiability.
