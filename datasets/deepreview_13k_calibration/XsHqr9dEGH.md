## Abstract
Recent work by \citet{power2022grokking} highlighted a surprising ``grokking'' phenomenon in learning arithmetic tasks: a neural net first ``memorizes'' the training set, resulting in perfect training accuracy but near-random test accuracy, and after training for sufficiently longer, it suddenly transitions to perfect test accuracy. This paper studies the grokking phenomenon in theoretical setups and shows that it can be induced by a dichotomy of early and late phase implicit biases. Specifically, when training homogeneous neural nets with large initialization and small weight decay on both classification and regression tasks, we prove that the training process gets trapped at a solution corresponding to a kernel predictor for a long time, and then a very sharp transition to min-norm/max-margin predictors occurs, leading to a dramatic change in test accuracy. %Even in the absence of weight decay, we show that grokking can still happen when the late phase implicit bias is driven by other regularization mechanisms, such as implicit margin maximization or sharpness reduction.

### Summary
This paper studies grokking theoretically in homogeneous neural networks with large initialization scale and small weight decay. It shows that in both classification and regression settings, there are early and late implicit biases. Particularly, it shows that in the early phase the model corresponds to a kernel model and later it can escape it. It suggests that grokking happens when the solution given by the early implicit bias generalizes poorly while the solution given by the late bias generalizes well. It is also shown that the converse phenomenon can happen which they call misgrokking. 

As an example, the paper focuses on a simple diagonal linear neural net for classification and shows that the early and late bias resp. correspond to minimization of L2 and L1 margin. They also identify these biases for a matrix completion model. 

The paper further provides experiments showing that grokking can happen even in the absence of weight decay.

### Strengths
- The paper is quite rigorous and provides a provable instance of grokking for simple models. Furthermore, it attributes grokking to a transition from the kernel to the rich regime. 
- The paper does the analyses for both classification and regression settings, further it shows the possibility of misgrokking. 
- Empirically, it's shown that grokking can happen without weight decay but more slowly.

### Weaknesses
 - There is very limited discussion on the possible extensions and limitations of this model. Moreover, results are in the case that the initialization scale goes to infinity which doesn't show (at least immediately) if these observations can be observed in the more common settings. 
- Additional experiments can clarify other potential limitations of the analysis (e.g., gradient flow).

See the questions for more details.

### Questions
- Q1. What are the limitations of the analysis done in this paper? Ignoring the proof difficulties, do you think the change of implicit biases can be observed and explain grokking in more common settings?
- Q2. What would be the effects of stochasticity in GD (SGD) and large step size (distancing from gradient flow)?
- Q3. Can you further explain Remark 3.11?
- Q4. Can you further explain the learning rate and time scaling for Figure 2? (E.g., the $\log(t)$ has often very large values.)
- Q5. Is there any proof provided for Theorem 4.1? 
- Q6. Can you further clarify why proving $ \|\frac 1\alpha
 \exp(\lambda t) \theta(t) - \overline{\theta}_{\mathrm{init}} \| \leq \epsilon$   for all $t \leq \min \{\frac{1}{\lambda} \log \alpha + \cdots + \Delta T, T_m \} $ would imply $T_m \geq \frac 1 \lambda \log \alpha + \cdots + \Delta T$ in proofs of Lemma A.5 and B.2?
- Q7. What is $q(\theta)$ in Appendix A.2? Also $r_i$'s?

## Minor Questions/Remarks
- Q8. In Figure 1, what is the norm presented? (Whether it's L1/L2 and if it's for $w$ or $u,v$?)
- Q9. I think the analyses require the data to be linearly separable for the classification setting? (Also, the model should be able to interpolate in the regression setting.) Although these assumptions are reasonable for overparametrized model, it would be beneficial if they were stated more clearly in the main text. 
- Q10. In the paragraph before Corollary 3.5, isn't the kernel feature $(2x, -2x)$?
- R1. In the paragraph of Empirical Validation: Grokking, it would be nice if some references for $O(d)$ and $O(k\log d)$ sample complexities were provided. Further, if some references/theoretical results for poor generalization of L2 margin are provided, it would complete the theoretical part of grokking for classification.

### Summary
The paper studies an empirical phenomenon called "Grokking" where-in neural networks can display delayed generalization under certain conditions. The paper puts forth the hypothesis that the observed memorization and eventual transition to generalization can be attributed to the optimization occurring two different inductive biases that are separated by a transition at a certain time (step). The paper studies training of neural network under large initialization and weight decay and suggests that for the first block of time the training occurs in a "kernel regime" before transitioning to "rich regime". The paper studies behavior under classification and regression settings using diagonal linear networks as a concrete example

### Strengths
- The paper attempts to explain "Grokking" using analytical tools. As an empirical researcher, I found this to be a good reminder that theory can shed light on even perplexing phenomena ``Grokking''
- The paper implicitly summarizes the various conditions under which ``Grokking'' has been observed and reported in practice
- The paper's hypothesis of two separate indicative biases separated by transition at a certain time makes intuitive sense
- The paper empirically constructs examples that empirically  demonstrate both Grokking and mis-Grokking by manipulating the inductive biases while creating datasets

### Weaknesses
The biggest concern that I have is that I do not quite see the core claim os "sharp transition in test accuracy" being supported by any of the analysis made in the paper. The paper states theorems in the main paper that show that two different inductive biases are at work and provide corollaries for diagonal linear networks. However, I do not see any statements, analysis or proofs in the main paper for generalization risks (or make generalization guarantees).

Without the above, the best one can conclude is that the models can fit the training data and reach perfect training accuracy eventually but this line of work has already been done by Moroshko et. al (Moroshko). I may have missed something obvious so I look forward to the rebuttal to improve my understanding of the paper

However, at this point, I am afraid I can't really support accepting this paper.

### Questions
- In Section 3.1.3 on page 5 of the draft, the paper claims that implicit biases imply transition in test accuracy. As noted in the weakness, this is not supported by any analysis (bounds etc). 
- No empirical results are provided that helps the reader crystallize their understanding of the work in terms of when the transition might occur in practice. Can the authors add more examples in text with datasets commonly used in ``Grokking'' literature?
- One point that the paper makes is about identifying a transition time from memorization to generalization and attributes it to different inductive biases. This is not true when weight decay = 0 which is a case handled that the paper talks about as well. This suggestion weakens about the importance of the first phase as it may not even be necessary to understand ``Grokking''

### Summary
The authors seek to explain the phenomenon of grokking highlighted by Power, Burda, Edwards, Babuschkin, and Misra in arXiv 2201.02177, focusing on a theoretical analysis, and paying special attention to sharpness of the transition from memorisation to generalisation.  The central thesis in this paper, which is summarised in its title, is that grokking occurs due to different implicit biases in early and late training.  Several theoretical results in support of this are proved for training by gradient flow homogeneous neural networks with large initialisations and small weight decay, for classification as well as regression tasks.  The pattern is that general theorems are proved first, and then corollaries are derived that explain grokking in specific settings, such as classification using diagonal linear networks, or low-rank symmetric matrix completion.  In the final section, the authors consider other scenarios where grokking occurs; they provide numerical experiments without weight decay for learning modular addition using two-layer ReLU networks, and they show how theoretical results from Li, Wang, and Arora in ICLR 2021 confirm grokking when training two-layer diagonal linear networks by label noise SGD with a sufficiently small learning rate.

### Strengths
The paper seems to be a first one to succeed in proving rigorously that grokking occurs in relatively general settings, and in showing interesting upper bounds on the length of the transition from memorisation to generalisation.

The explanation of grokking in terms of different implicit biases in early and late phases of training is elegant, and the restrictions to homogeneous neural networks, large initialisation, small weight decay, and gradient flow are reasonable and motivated by the previous empirical work of Liu, Michaud, and Tegmark in ICLR 2023.  Moreover, the versatility of the explanation in terms of the implicit biases is demonstrated by the identification of "misgrokking" in this paper, a dual phenomenon in which the test accuracy transitions from very high to very low late in the training.

Grokking and misgrokking as indicated by the theory are verified by numerical experiments for classification using two-layer diagonal linear networks.

Full proofs of the theoretical results are provided in the appendix.  The biggest and most novel are those of Theorems 3.3 and 3.7, which show that the small weight decay does not spoil the kernel regime and its implicit bias early in the training for long enough so that a relatively short transitional phase follows.

### Weaknesses
The paper comes across as dense and can be difficult to read. One reason is that a number of settings for theory and experiments are considered. Another is that the statements of many of the theoretical results are relatively complex, with several quantifications and subtle details, and often without much explanation. A minor comment is that I think that writing "for all" or "for every" is clearer than "for any".

The theoretical results about grokking for regression tasks, and in particular for overparameterised matrix completion, are not illustrated experimentally.

The conclusion of the paper (Section 5) does not seem to indicate any directions for future work.

In the first sentence in "Our Contributions", it is claimed that homogeneous networks allow the ReLU activation, however homogeneity is then assumed together with $\mathcal{C}^2$-smoothness (in Assumption 3.1), which I believe disallows the ReLU activation due to its non-differentiability at 0?

Code was not submitted with the paper, only the appendix with proofs.  Are you able to supplement the paper with code, so that readers are able to reproduce your numerical experiments?

What is the purpose of the section on sharpness reduction with label noise (Section 4.2), since it mostly consists of statements of results from the paper of Li, Wang, and Arora in ICLR 2021, i.e. it does not seem to contain much new material?
