## Abstract
\vspace{-5pt}
Unsupervised pre-training strategies have proven to be highly effective in natural language processing and computer vision.
Likewise,
unsupervised reinforcement learning (RL) holds the promise of discovering a variety of potentially useful behaviors
that can accelerate the learning of a wide array of downstream tasks.
Previous unsupervised RL approaches have mainly focused on pure exploration and mutual information skill learning.
However, despite the previous attempts, making unsupervised RL truly scalable still remains a major open challenge:
pure exploration approaches might struggle in complex environments with large state spaces, where covering every possible transition is infeasible,
and mutual information skill learning approaches might completely fail to explore the environment due to the lack of incentives.
To make unsupervised RL scalable to complex, high-dimensional environments,
we propose a novel unsupervised RL objective, which we call \textbf{Metric-Aware Abstraction} (\textbf{METRA}).
Our main idea is, instead of directly covering the entire state space, to only cover a compact latent space $\gZ$
that is \emph{metrically} connected to the state space $\gS$ by temporal distances. %
By learning to move in every direction in the latent space,
METRA obtains a tractable set of diverse behaviors that approximately cover the state space,
being scalable to high-dimensional environments.
Through our experiments in five locomotion and manipulation environments,
we demonstrate that METRA can discover a variety of useful behaviors even in complex, pixel-based environments,
being the \textbf{first} unsupervised RL method that discovers diverse locomotion behaviors in pixel-based Quadruped and Humanoid.

### Summary
This paper introduces a novel unsupervised RL objective called Metric-Aware Abstraction (METRA). The objective is to only learn to explore on a compact latent space which is metrically connected to the state space by temporal distances. The learned skills on this latent space are scalable to a variety of downstream control tasks. METRA is the first unsupervised RL method that demonstrates the discovery of diverse locomotion behaviors in pixel-based tasks.

### Strengths
- The empirical study of this paper is very sound and solid. The paper evaluates the method on various control tasks, including locomotion and manipulation tasks. Besides, the paper aims to address the unsupervised RL problem on visual-based tasks, which are much more challenging in the area. The paper also compare the results to multiple previous works, showing the significant improvement on skill discovery.

- The methodology part is very organized. The authors aim to maximize state converage under a specific metrics, which should be scalable to pixel-based tasks. Then temporal distance makes sense and is easy to be turned to an constrainted optimization problem.

- The paper is very well-written. The background in Section 2 and 3 clearly shows the motivation of this work and the connections to the previous methods. The method and empirical study both illustrate many details and the source code is linked, which make this work easy to understand and follow.

### Weaknesses
 - The paper can be more impactful and solid if the method is deployed on the real world tasks, like locomotion control on a real robot. Besides, as the authors have already listed in Appendix A, the method can be combined to more recent RL works.

 - In Figure 8, the LEXA and DIAYN totally failed to handle most of the tasks (especially DIAYN). Is this because the skill discovery process has already failed or the learned skills is useless on downstream tasks?

- DIAYN, DADS, and other previous works only consider state space tasks, so the objectives of them are not able to train the visual encoder. But the METRA objective is much more suitable to learn a visual representation. Can the authors analyze more on the advantage of the proposed method on the visual representation learning? If the vision encoders of all baselines are the same (a pretrained network), will the experiment results change?

- Similar to the last question, will the proposed method still outperform if we only consider state-based tasks? Does the advantage come from visual learning?

- In Figure 7, some methods are very unstable on the Kitchen tasks (variance of different seeds is large). Can the authors give any reason?

### Summary
The paper presents a novel unsupervised reinforcement learning (RL) method, Metric-Aware Abstraction (METRA), which aims to make unsupervised RL scalable to complex, high-dimensional environments. The authors propose a new unsupervised RL objective that encourages an agent to explore its environment and learn a breadth of potentially useful behaviors without any supervision. The key idea is to cover a compact latent space that is metrically connected to the state space by temporal distances, instead of directly covering the state space. The authors demonstrate that METRA can discover a variety of useful behaviors in complex environments, outperforming previous unsupervised RL methods.

I have read the response and the authors address my concerns. I have raised my rating to accept.

### Strengths
1. The paper introduces a novel unsupervised RL objective, METRA, which is a significant contribution to the field. The idea of using temporal distances as a metric for the latent space is innovative and provides a new perspective on unsupervised RL.
2. The paper is technically sound, and the proposed method is well-motivated and clearly explained. The authors provide a thorough theoretical analysis of their method, including a connection to principal component analysis (PCA).
3. The paper is well-written and organized. The authors do a good job of explaining the motivation behind their method, the details of the method itself, and the experimental setup.

### Weaknesses
1. While the paper presents results on a variety of environments, it would be beneficial to see how METRA performs on more complex environments such as Atari[1] or Google Research Football[2]. This would provide a more comprehensive evaluation of the method's scalability and effectiveness. Specifically, the current MuJoCo environments, while useful for initial validation, do not fully capture the challenges of high-dimensional state and action spaces, nor the sparse reward structures often encountered in more complex tasks. The inclusion of environments with pixel-based inputs, like Atari, would be particularly valuable to assess the robustness of the method to perceptual aliasing and high-dimensional observations.
2. The paper could benefit from a comparison with more diversity RL baselines, such as RSPO[3] and DGPO[4]. This would provide a more complete picture of how METRA compares to other state-of-the-art methods in the field. Furthermore, a more detailed analysis of the specific strengths and weaknesses of METRA compared to these baselines would be beneficial. For instance, it would be useful to understand if METRA excels in environments with specific characteristics (e.g., sparse rewards, high-dimensional state spaces) where other methods might struggle.

### Questions
1. How does METRA handle environments with non-stationary dynamics or environments where the temporal distance between states can change over time?
2. How does the dimensionality of the latent space affect the performance of METRA? Is there a trade-off between the dimensionality of the latent space and the complexity of the behaviors that can be learned?

3: You are fairly confident in your assessment. It is possible that you did not understand some parts of the submission or that you are unfamiliar with some pieces of related work. Math/other details were not carefully checked.

### Summary
This work proposes a novel objective for learning diverse skills in unsupervised skill discovery. In particular, this objective can enforce good policy coverage and is scalable to high-dimensional environments. The authors theoretically analyze the learning process of the Wasserstein dependency measure, and the analysis is accompanied by convincing experiments. The experiments and theoretical analysis show the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

### Strengths
1. This paper is well-structured. The authors first analyze the common limitations of existing unsupervised RL approaches and then provide solid theoretical and empirical evidence to show why and how the proposed method works, making this paper understandable.

2. Experiments are well-described and highly reproducible. Experiments have good coverage. The selection of baselines and environments is reasonable and convincing.

### Weaknesses
There are no significant weaknesses in this paper. The theoretical explanations of why choosing WDM as the objective might be a little complicated for readers lacking corresponding background. Some explicit examples or pictures may help.

### Questions
1. Does METRA have the potential to be applied to environments with temporal dependencies (NetHack, MineDojo, ...)?

2. If we apply METRA to a traditional RL setting with external rewards, how would the discovered skills help in finding task-specific policies?

### Summary
This work introduces an innovative algorithm designed to discover approximate state-covering behaviors in a task-agnostic manner for reinforcement learning agents. Building upon existing skill-learning techniques that use the mutual information between skills and states to learn distinguishable and state-covering skills, this work introduces a modification to the objective. The modification involves constraining the latent space of the skills to prioritize temporally compact representations. This novel approach ensures that the skills are estimated within a manifold preserving the temporal properties of the state space, allowing for maximization of spread-out trajectories over time. The incorporation of a metric, specifically temporal distance, grounds the latent space to be compact, distinguishing it from previous metric-agnostic alternatives relying solely on mutual information. The study employs a "Wasserstein variant" of the mutual information objective, adeptly modified to facilitate tractable optimization and online learning. One of the key advantages of pre-training RL agents using this objective lies in its scalability, enabling the learning of a compact skill space even from high-dimensional observations, such as images, where prior methods faced challenges in scalability. Moreover, when training a hierarchical controller to employ these learned skills, METRA demonstrates superior downstream task performance in previously unsolved benchmarks. In essence, the paper makes a significant contribution by introducing an effective new algorithm and strengthens its credibility by providing essential theoretical underpinnings for its design.

### Strengths
This work builds upon an extensive body of research focused on skill discovery and learning, leveraging variants of mutual information to guide the pre-training process. This work tackles a limitation inherent in the existing MI objective, which is metric-agnostic, and hence does not directly incentivize skills to maximize an explicit metric for state coverage. The proposed modification facilitates the operation of skills within a temporally compact space, wherein the maximization of diversity aligns with the adoption of state-covering behaviors. The incorporation of a well-defined theoretical formulation enhances the paper's credibility, providing a strong foundation for the proposed objective.

The key contribution of the proposed algorithm is its scalability, particularly when dealing with high-dimensional observations - an ongoing challenge in the broader field of reinforcement learning. By addressing this limitation, the paper contributes significantly to the unsupervised RL domain. This work presents the development of an algorithm that stands as a substantial and impactful contribution to the field of unsupervised RL, and that is clearly theoretically justified.

### Weaknesses
One weakness of the paper is the absence of a comparative analysis of the proposed algorithm's performance in alternative benchmarks, especially those where purely exploratory algorithms like RND have demonstrated exceptional results (e.g., in Atari). Specifically, METRA's performance remains unclear in settings such as discrete control or, more significantly, in stochastic environments. An important aspect that is missing is a demonstration of how the temporally compact space learned by METRA enables reward-free pre-training in these challenging scenarios. Addressing these points would significantly enhance the paper's impact, making it a more substantial and comprehensive contribution to the field.

The paper iteratively simplifies the proposed objective to enable tractable optimization. However, it remains unclear if these modifications impact the performance of the algorithm. An ablation study of these could also provide insightful details of the proposed objective. (e.g. if training with the formulation that requires N rollouts for each latent, would the obtained skills be more diverse?)

### Questions
The temporal distance is a very natural choice for a distance metric for reinforcement learning. However, are there any other metrics that are promising for their applications to the reinforcement learning setting in the METRA framework? Were these considered for this work?

METRA forces the latent variables to maintain linear relationships in the latent space. Although this allows for non-linear policies in the state space, can the latter limit the diversity of the learned skills in other challenging environments? (e.g. stochastic, multi-agent). Could METRA be modified to model non-linear skills even in the latent space?
