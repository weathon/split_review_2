## Abstract
A proficient summarization model should exhibit both flexibility -- the capacity to handle a range of in-domain summarization tasks, and adaptability -- the competence to acquire new knowledge and adjust to unseen out-of-domain tasks. Unlike large language models (LLMs) that achieve this through parameter scaling, we propose a more parameter-efficient approach in this study. Our motivation rests on the principle that while the general summarization ability to capture salient information can be shared across different tasks, the domain-specific summarization abilities need to be distinct and tailored. Concretely, we propose MoeSumm, a Mixture-of-Expert Summarization architecture, which utilizes a main expert for gaining the general summarization capability and deputy experts that selectively collaborate to meet specific summarization task requirements. We further propose a max-margin loss to stimulate the separation of these abilities. Our model's distinct separation of general and domain-specific summarization abilities grants it with notable flexibility and adaptability, all while maintaining parameter efficiency. MoeSumm achieves flexibility by managing summarization across multiple domains with a single model, utilizing a shared main expert and selected deputy experts. It exhibits adaptability by tailoring deputy experts to cater to out-of-domain few-shot and zero-shot scenarios. Experimental results on 11 datasets show the superiority of our model compared with recent baselines and LLMs. We also provide statistical and visual evidence of the distinct separation of the two abilities in MoeSumm.

### Summary
In the quest for a summarization model that balances flexibility and adaptability without the extensive parameter scaling characteristic of large language models (LLMs), this paper introduces MoeSumm, a Mixture-of-Expert Summarization architecture. The model is premised on the notion that while a core summarization competence is universally applicable across tasks, domain-specific nuances require tailored expertise. MoeSumm is structured with a central 'main expert' responsible for general summarization, complemented by 'deputy experts' that are invoked for task-specific challenges. To enhance the model’s capability for domain differentiation, a max-margin loss is employed, encouraging a clearer separation between general and specialized summarization skills.

### Strengths
The idea of using a core network (main expert) for the generalizability of the summarization and multiple experts for different domain is clear and reasonable. The proposed max-margin loss also ensures that the model does not overly rely on the main expert. Extensive experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms the baselines in three settings, i.e., in-domain, out-of-domain, and zero-shot.

### Weaknesses
1. The major weakness is that the baselines used in this paper is relatively weak, i.e., BART (Lewis et al., 2020). It is suggested to compare with the state-of-the-art approaches, e.g., [A,B], to show this paper actually improves the state-of-the-art models. For example, in [B], the performance on Reddit100 is 34.24 in terms of R1, whereas the result in this paper is 25.57. Although this result may relate to the training strategy, it is suggested to align the setting for a fair comparison.
2. The efficiency is not the superiority of the paper since many paper with few-shot setting directly tune the models. MoE models are usually good in the performance but worse in the efficiency, similar with the ensemble methods.
3. The contribution is relatively minor. It is suggested to try some alternative designs for justifying the proposed approach.

### Questions
The titles in the paper and system are different, i.e., "Enhancing Parameter Efficiency in Summarization via Expertise Separation" and "Flexible and Adaptable Summarization via Expertise Separation". It is suggested to select one and revise the paper accordingly.

### Summary
This paper introduces MoeSumm, a mixture-of-experts approach to summarization that consists of a main expert model (arguably capturing general summarization skills) and "deputy experts", smaller domain-specific models. One key idea is to introduce max-margin loss term to jointly train the experts. Using diverse summarization benchmarks, the paper shows that MoeSumm outperforms a BART baseline in different in-domain and out-of-domain settings.

### Strengths
The paper addresses a relevant problem of parameter-efficient summarization using a novel method, and provide extensive experiments using automatic metrics and human evaluation showing the advantages of the approach. Ablation studies for key design decisions such as the max-margin loss term are also presented.

### Weaknesses
The proposed method presents some scaling challenges, which are partially discussed in Appendix A.7, stating that number of expert model parameters scale with the number of experts and datasets. Furthermore, there is a concatenation of parameters and activations in equations 6 and 7, which would result in more parameters. Consequently, when using experts, the concatenation of features makes MoeSumm a larger model than the BART-indiv baseline, which could explain the advantage of MoeSumm in the in-domain setting. Thus, it would be very informative to have a table with actual parameter count for each setting, especially during training (frequently the most important bottleneck).

Previous work that approaches parameter-efficient summarization by separating domain-specific concerns is not compared. FactorSum (Fonseca et al., 2022) also uses a BART backbone to capture general importance and uses a separate optimization procedure for domain-specific factors such as summary conciseness. It achieves superior performance (measured by ROUGE) than MoeSumm on arXiv and PubMed using less parameters (BART-base). In contrast, MoeSumm explores a wider range of domain-adaptation settings. 

While I appreciate the analysis of dataset features in Section 5.2, item 3, more detailed analysis of the weight of each feature would be informative. Especially with respect to *summary length*, which are known to heavily affect ROUGE (Sun et al., 2019).

### Questions
- Why do you think the zero-shot performance of MoeSumm is significantly better than BART-mix on some datasets (arXiv, MultiNews) but not others (Gigaword, Billsum)?

- Are differences of human evaluation scores (Table 2) statistically significant? 

- What are the parameter counts for each model variant during training/inference? (see weakness comment above)

### Summary
The paper addresses a narrow application of text summarization using the MoE method, in which the design is to have a 2-level hierarchy of application-specific deputy experts and  multi-mapped neural-network-style multi-purpose main experts. Using this design makes the method outperform other baselines including the canonical MoE in all datasets chosen, using traditional and adaptation evaluation settings. The experiments are conducted with 3 domain datasets. The authors also offer some insightful ablation studies concerning the design. Code is attached to the submission for reproducibility and the authors promise to release upon camera version.

### Strengths
- The paper has a good motivation with intuition design 
- The paper is written well with strong and positive results 
- Insightful analysis about the main components (architecture vs. max-margin loss) and other such as how deputies are separated/aligned to respective datasets
- Comprehensive and helpful appendices
- Provided code.

### Weaknesses
 - Allocating each deputy to a single dataset doesn’t sound too practical and scalable as the number of datasets increases. One can question that if many datasets are similar, why are we not sharing similar deputies to many applications that are similar/related to each other? 
- Although the authors offer explanations to Equations 8 and 9, it’s not totally clear about the design of the nonlinear function chosen in Equation 9. Why not offer ablation studies for choices of functions and constants involved? 
- Also regarding the loss: I personally think one explanation for the max-margin loss is to battle with the imbalance, at the same time train the deputy to “spread-out” and learn all diverse data being fed. As a result, my hypothesis is with the current design, the imbalance loss from, say Gshard (and other methods could be used too in the RELATED WORK point below). Would be nice to study the ablations at some point. 

- RELATED WORK: seems lack of many relevant work especially when it comes to imbalance issues: 
  - Gshard 
  - BASE layers: Simplifying training of large, sparse models.
  - Hash layers for large sparse models.
  - Mixture-of-experts with expert choice routing.
  - I suggest maybe should also see some updated related work including some from this year in new preprints such as in “Task-Based MoE for Multitask Multilingual Machine Translation”, in which the motivation is somewhat similar but the implementation seems more practical and scalable than the method in this paper (see weaknesses for more explanation on this). 


- Human evaluation probably needs further clarification and only 3 of them do not seem convincing enough. Also, how were their employments made (see ethics section as well), and why only PhD students were chosen? 
- BertScore is a decent choice, but I suggest since you already used GPT3.5, that you could use GPT3.5 or 4 to do the comparison as well, by having an instruction and ask the model to compare different models based on, e.g. 3 criteria in Table 2, then summarize the results. I think for now that would offer a very convincing evaluation.

### Questions
- In Table3, “MoESumm w/o DI”, how did you construct the max-margin loss without DI information?

### Summary
This work proposes a Mixture-of-Expert summarization architecture to address the summarization task. This approach utilizes a main expert for gaining the general summarization capability and deputy experts that selectively collaborate to meet specific summarization task requirements. Also, they propose a max-margin loss to distinguish the roles of the different experts. Experimental results show that this approach brings substantial improvements over strong baselines in both in-domain and out-of-domain scenarios across several widely-used benchmark datasets.

### Strengths
1. This paper is well-organized and easy to follow. Figures and tables are clearly presented. Sufficient references are discussed in related work.
2. The proposed approach is simple and easy to understand. Extensive experiments and analyses have been performed to confirm the effectiveness of this method. Specifically, this method performs well in both in-domain and out-of-domain scenarios.
3. Codes are provided in supplementary materials to ensure reproducibility.

### Weaknesses
1.  **Limited Baselines**: some important baselines are omitted in the experiments. For example, [1] also used mixture-of-expert structure for abstractive summarization, but this work does not compare with it. Specifically, the paper should have included a comparison with the re-ranking approach used in [1], as it is a relevant method for improving summarization quality. The lack of this comparison makes it difficult to assess the true novelty and effectiveness of the proposed method.
2.  As this paper mentions the proposed method is **parameter-efficient**, experiments should include more than one base model to confirm this, otherwise we are not sure if this method only works on BART. For example, this paper can add PEGASUS as [1] used. The parameter efficiency claim needs to be substantiated by demonstrating the method's effectiveness across different model architectures, not just different sizes of the same architecture. Without this, the claim of parameter efficiency is not fully supported.
