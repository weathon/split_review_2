## Abstract
Large language models(LLMs) exhibit capabilities beyond expectations in various NLP tasks.
Since the inference of LLM consumes huge resources, optimizing the inference process of LLM
is of great significance to promote the application of LLM.
In the text generation process, caching the key-value embeddings (KV cache) for subsequent
generation process is a basic optimization method.
However, huge size of the KV cache limits the inference batch size.
Compressing the space occupied by the cached key-value embeddings  can enlarge the batch 
size of LLM inference to improve throughput.
Besides, based on the analysis of the usage mode of the KV cache, we find compressing
the KV cache to ternary digits can not only compress the space occupied by the KV cache,
but also greatly reduce the required multiplication operation in the attention block.
Combined with the numerical features of the KV cache, we propose KVTQ, a method which
compresses the KV cache to hardware efficient ternary digits.
We validate our KVTQ method on different series of LLMs and
get the conclusion that the KVTQ method which compresses the KV cache to 
ultra-low bits can still preserve the model quality.

### Summary
This paper proposed to use ternary quantization, KVTQ, on the KV cache in large language model inference to compress the memory space and improve the attention computation efficiency. KVTQ uses a group of ternary digits of different quantization steps to express the KV cache to help alleviate the accuracy degradation of multiple channels. The experiments show that the proposed KVTQ can outperform 4-bit KV cache quantization.

### Summary
The paper introduces a method to compress the KV-cache into ternary, effectively reducing both storage and computational costs. Specifically, regarding computational costs, the ternary KV-cache eliminates the need for reweighting, converting multiplications into addition and subtraction operations. The work uses experimental statistics to guide the ternarization process.

### Strengths
1.	Ternarization indeed results in a reduction in storage and computational costs.

2.	Experimental findings play an instructive role in quantization. The paper discovers that it's preferable to allocate more bits to K due to its larger numerical rang.

### Weaknesses
1. The paper's description of the actual quantization method might lead to misleading. The term "ternary" suggests that K and V are genuinely ternary with values {-1, 0, +1}. However, the paper assigns "multiple channels" to each value with varying steps. This essentially equates to a higher quantization bit count. As the paper states, “we use 4 channels of ternary digits for the key embeddings and 3 channels of ternary digits for the value embeddings.” This means K is 4-bit quantized, and V is 3-bit quantized? This crucial point lacks adequate discussion and might mislead readers. The use of multiple channels effectively increases the representational capacity beyond a true ternary system, and the paper does not adequately address the implications of this design choice on both memory footprint and computational efficiency. The reader is left to wonder if the claimed benefits of ternary quantization are actually realized given this implementation.

2. The quantization method utilized is dynamic, meaning the quantization step must be dynamically determined. This approach may not be hardware-friendly. To determine a single max and min value requires scanning the entire tensor. For larger tensors, this method could introduce significant latency. The paper does not provide any analysis of the overhead associated with this dynamic quantization process, particularly in the context of large language model inference where latency is a critical concern. The computational cost of finding the min and max values for each tensor, and the subsequent quantization step calculation, is not quantified, making it difficult to assess the practical impact of this design choice.

3. The ternary compensation algorithm employed originates from ABC-Net and is not original. The paper does not sufficiently detail how the specific application of this compensation algorithm to the KV-cache differs from its original use in ABC-Net, nor does it provide a justification for why this particular algorithm was chosen over other potential compensation methods. A more thorough explanation of the algorithm's adaptation and its suitability for this specific use case is needed.

4. The paper lacks experimental details. While there were experiments on PPL, the motivation of “reducing storage and computational costs” is not reflected in the experiments. It remains unproven whether ternary quantization is GPU-friendly. Likewise, there's no evidence provided to demonstrate if dynamic quantization will introduce substantial latency. The experiments should include metrics that directly measure the computational cost, such as FLOPs or inference time, and memory usage, to validate the claims of reduced computational and storage costs. The absence of these metrics makes it difficult to evaluate the practical effectiveness of the proposed method.

### Questions
1.	Can you provide clarity on the choice of using "ternary" in your terminology when the actual quantization might suggest higher bit counts?
2.	How do you address the potential hardware inefficiencies of the dynamic quantization method, especially with larger tensors?
3.	Since the ternary compensation algorithm is taken from ABC-Net, how is your quantization method different from it?
4.	You should provide more experiments that can showcase the effectiveness of your method in terms of computational and storage savings. For example, how much decoding latency can be reduced?

### Summary
This paper examines KV cache compression algorithms, specifically focusing on ternary representation. The ternary format streamlines computations by eliminating the need for a dequantization step and primarily utilizing addition and subtraction operations. The authors explore distinct quantization sensitivities for 'K' and 'V', each quantized with varying bit numbers. The study evaluates the LLaMA and OPT models and delves into the sparsity arising from the ternary representation.

### Strengths
- The authors provide detailed results concerning the quantization of K and V bits. By monitoring the range of K and V values across various LLaMA and OPT models, the authors validate the rationale for allocating distinct quantization bits to K and V.

- The paper highlights the unique computational advantages of ternary representation. Contrary to recent weight-only quantizations, ternary representation simplifies computations to mainly additions and subtractions.

- The study showcases sparsity across different channels, illustrating the potential computational savings from '0' weights in ternary quantization.

- The presented quantization techniques and computational approaches are clear and uncomplicated.

### Weaknesses
 - While ternary computations can simplify attention-related calculations, the authors haven't quantified the reduction in latency or the number of FLOPs saved by their method.

- Given that ternary representation uses 2 bits to represent -1, 0, or +1, its memory footprint might surpass binary-based quantization. A comparison of memory usage between previous quantization methods and the proposed approach is essential.

- The correlation between sparsity and computational reduction doesn't directly equate to reduced latency or improved throughput. Instead of merely highlighting channel sparsity, tangible hardware benefits should be assessed.

- What is the net effect on inference? The paper would benefit from a thorough estimation or actual measurement results.

### Summary
This paper proposes a novel fine-grained dynamic quantization method, named KVTQ, for compressing the Key-Value cache of LLMs into hardware-efficient ternary digits. The authors highlight that, unlike traditional weights-only quantization, which requires dequantization for each use, their method eliminates the need for dequantization and allows matrix multiplication to be efficiently conducted using simple addition and subtraction. They claim to be the first to demonstrate that compressing the KV cache to ternary digits can be achieved with negligible impact on perplexity.

### Strengths
The motivation behind employing KVTQ (Key-Value Token Quantization) is clearly articulated and easy to grasp. The paper is well-written, with a logical flow that makes it easy to follow the core concept. However, I must admit that my expertise may not fully equip me to assess the technical novelty in this particular field.

From what I understand, a key aspect of KVTQ is its ability to avoid additional dequantization steps. Instead, it can directly replace dequantization and subsequent matrix multiplication with a summation operation. This approach seems to have practical implications, particularly in reducing computational complexity.

The empirical results demonstrate a significant reduction in perplexity across various sizes of OPT/LLama models, which is noteworthy given that many expensive operations are bypassed. This aspect of KVTQ seems to be a valuable contribution, potentially leading to more efficient processing in relevant applications. However, a deeper technical analysis might be necessary to fully appreciate the novelty and implications of this approach.

### Weaknesses
I confess that my understanding of quantization isn't particularly deep, which somewhat hinders my ability to fully grasp the implications of the results shown in Tables 3 and 4. 
However, I think the paper falls short in providing comprehensive information on the practical aspects of implementing KVTQ. Details like the physical size of the Key-Value (KV) cache when KVTQ is in use, as well as the memory overhead and latency during forward passes, are missing. These details are crucial for understanding not just the theoretical benefits of KVTQ, but also its real-world applicability and efficiency.

### Summary
This paper proposes a dynamic quantization technique to reduce the computational cost and required memory for storing K/V cache on GPU. The authors propose a quantization method that symmetrically quantizes the KV cache into ternary digits (-1, 0, 1), thereby obviating the need for a dequantization stage, which is required in conventional methods.  The experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of their quantization technique, showcasing lower perplexity compared to alternative methods and a reduction in computational workload.

### Strengths
The authors present pioneering research by demonstrating that KV caches can be quantized into ternary digits with minimal impact on perplexity. This innovative approach not only eliminates the need for a dequantization stage but also offers the benefits of reduced GPU memory usage and computational complexity.

### Weaknesses
 - The authors present statistics regarding the maximum and minimum values of the KV cache in each layer, but do not delve into the distribution of data within each KV cache. While data distribution may be less relevant when quantizing data into n-bit integers, this paper opts for ternary digit quantization. Consider a key embedding to follow a normal distribution with the distance between the average and maximum value being 3 times the standard deviation (Max = $\mu + 3\sigma$). According to the authors' equation ($X_q = \lceil \frac{X}{\Delta} \rfloor, \Delta = \text{max}(|X|)$), approximately 86.6% of the numbers will be quantized to zero ($P(-1.5<\frac{x-\mu}{\sigma}<1.5)$). Such a substantial portion of key embeddings being quantized to zero might suggest sparsity in attention scores. Hence, it would be more persuasive if the authors compared their work against models employing sparse attention, as opposed to traditional attention mechanisms.

- The claim that quantizing to ternary digits reduces the number of multiplications and additions should be validated through runtime measurements, particularly when considering that LLM inference is primarily constrained by memory bandwidth and latency. It would be also advisable for the authors to measure runtime performance compared to other works, such as TRT-LLM. Additionally, as the authors propose a dynamic quantization approach, it is implied that the KV cache should still be stored in its original precision (e.g., FP32) and quantized before calculating attention scores. In contrast, TRT-LLM, one of the baseline models, employs static quantization, eliminating the need for repetitive quantization, and allows for lower precision storage in CPU/GPU memory. Consequently, the authors should address the potential overhead in terms of memory usage and quantization latency.

- There are also some minor suggestions:
  - Many sentences begin with conjunctions such as "And" and "So." To maintain formality, it is recommended to avoid starting sentences with conjunctions.

  - A minor typographical error is present in Section 1, line 2 ("konw" should be corrected to "known"). Moreover, the terms "Experiment setup/result" should be revised to "Experimental setup/result" for clarity and consistency.

### Questions
- Would the utilization of a sparse attention method yield superior results compared to KVTQ in terms of perplexity, runtime, and memory usage?
- Could you provide insights into the performance enhancements achieved with KVTQ when compared to other baseline methods, particularly in terms of runtime and memory usage?
