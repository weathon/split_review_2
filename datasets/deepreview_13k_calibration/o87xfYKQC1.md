## Abstract
This paper introduces a novel mathematical property applicable to diverse images, referred to as FINOLA (First-Order Norm+Linear Autoregressive). FINOLA represents each image in the latent space as a first-order autoregressive process, in which each regression step simply applies a shared linear model on the normalized value of its immediate neighbor. This intriguing property reveals a mathematical invariance that transcends individual images. Expanding from image grids to continuous coordinates, we unveil the presence of two underlying partial differential equations. We validate the FINOLA property from two distinct angles: image reconstruction and self-supervised learning. Firstly, we demonstrate the ability of FINOLA to auto-regress up to a 256$\times$256 feature map (the same resolution to the image) from a single vector placed at the center, successfully reconstructing the original image by only using three 3$\times$3 convolution layers as decoder. Secondly, we leverage FINOLA for self-supervised learning by employing a simple masked prediction approach. Encoding a single unmasked quadrant block, we autoregressively predict the surrounding masked region. Remarkably, this pre-trained representation proves highly effective in image classification and object detection tasks, even when integrated into lightweight networks, all without the need for extensive fine-tuning. The code will be made publicly available.

### Summary
This paper is proposing First-Order Norm+Linear Autoregressive (FINOLA). The proposed method is a new type of autoregressive model that can be used for self-supervised representation learning. The comprehensive experiments show that FINOLA has relatively small parameters but can contain enough information for image reconstruction. The authors also show that FINOLA can be used as a feature extractor for the downstream task.

### Strengths
- Reasonable and understandable writing.
- technically novel.
- Comprehensive experiments.

### Weaknesses
 - Justifications for the novel design choice (but seems heuristic) compared to the regular AR model.
    - Predefined assignments in Block-wise Masked FINOLA
    - Predicting three points in Block-wise Masked FINOLA
    - Why first order?
- Lack of interpretation of the derived PDE.
- Some parts are unclear (please see the Questions below)

### questions:
 1. (page 2) The authors argued that “the coefficient matrices $A$ and $B$ capture the relationship between each position“. How do the coefficient matrices directly know the spatial relationship? They do not take any of the spatial information. I believe there are some pieces of missing information:
    1. coefficient matrices $A$ and $B$ capture channel-wise relationship.
    2. The pattern and correlation encoded in the channel are related to the positional information. 
    3. the coefficient matrices $A$ and $B$ (indirectly) capture the relationship between each position.
Maybe it is trivial for some readers but it is not for me.

2. There are some of the questions about PDE.
    1. (page 4) “They represent a theoretical extension of FINOLA from a discrete grid to continuous coordinates.“ This is not intuitive to me. As far as I understand, the proposed method in this paper is also using the discrete grid. Assuming that the extension to continuous coordinates is to get a better theoretical understanding, what is the insight and take away from the fact that Eq. 1 becomes the formulation of PDE in Eq. 4?
    2. (page 4) “Establishing their theoretical validity poses a substantial challenge.”  What is the substantial challenge?
3. The specific method of the block-wise Masked FINOLA is unclear. For example, if we see the Corner case, let’s say an input coordinate is (3,2) and it is used for predicting {(11,10), (11,2), (3,10)}. I guess for obtaining (11,2), for instance, the function $\phi^8(z(3,2))$ is applied, which means (4,2) is predicted first and it is used as an input for predicting (5,2) and so forth. My question is, considering that we already have a ground truth within (0,2),(1,2) …, (7,2), why not use the ground truth information?
4. How is the Gaussian curvature related to capturing semantics? Could you add more detailed descriptions of how it is computed?
5. (Table 4 (a)) Even though Stable Diffusion is a Generative Model, I believe it should have better PSNR than FINOLA for the image reconstruction task. How did you implement the image reconstruction task for Stable Diffusion?
6. How fast is the parallel implementation (Fig. 3) compared to the regular AR setting?
7. Is this method fast enough to use as a feature extractor for the downstream task?

### Summary
This paper proposed an auto-regression model in latent feature space using norm-linear transform to regress the features in high-resolution from a global feature. The proposed norm-linear transform is simple to regress features, and can be decoded with lightweight network to generate the reconstructed image. The proposed model can also be applied as a pre-training method, having good generalization ability to recognition and object detection.

### Strengths
1.  The auto-regression for generating features in high-resolution in feature space is an interesting idea, and the proposed regression model is simple. The regression model in feature space can be seen as a discretized PDE. 

2. The proposed model can be taken as a self-supervised leaning approach based on mask region prediction. The sufficient experiments show that it can achieve good pretraining results for recognition and detection.

### Weaknesses
1.  There are previous regression-based generative models (e.g., refer to related works) in feature space, and what are the major difference and advantage of this approach compared with these models? Is it possible to compare with them for the generation quality and computational speed?

2. Are the matrix A and B shared for all different images and pixels in the feature space? If it is, why learned constant A, and B can deduce good feature regression?

3. The paper states that this work does not aim to achieve SoTA results, however, comparisons with SoTA regression models or other variants, e.g., using nonlinear regression instead of linear transform, should be able to better give insights to audience.

4. The regression model should gradually regression dense feature maps? How about the computational overhead/speed for training and inference using this model?

5. What is the meaning of the mathematical invariance in this paper for the proposed model?

### Summary
This paper introduces a novel framework FINOLA (First-Order Norm+Linear Autoregressive) for image representation with powerful autoregressive capabilities. First, image is firstly encoded into a single vector q. Then, FINOLA automatically regresses from the vector q placed in the center to the feature map through two partial differential equations. Experiments show that this pre-trained representation excels in various downstream tasks, including image classification and object detection, without the need for extensive fine-tuning.

### Strengths
1. The proposed method sounds interesting and novel. Its structure is simple but it shows powerful representation ability in spatial representation.
2. This paper provides a new perspective to describe the intrinsic relationship of image feature maps through partial differential equations. This may have some implications for simplifying neural networks.
3. Expensive experiments prove the effectiveness of this method, especially in image classification and object detection tasks.

### Weaknesses
1. The author mentioned "this intriguing property reveals a mathematical invariance". What does invariance refer to should be further explained. Specifically, it is unclear what aspects of the feature map are invariant and under what transformations this invariance holds. For example, does this invariance hold across different image classes, or is it specific to individual images? A more precise definition of the mathematical invariance is needed.
2. The author mentioned "providing insights into the underlying mathematical principles" more than once, but did not provide an in-depth explanation or comparison. It is recommended to provide more details. The paper lacks a rigorous mathematical analysis of the partial differential equations (PDEs) and their solutions. For example, how does the choice of the matrices A and B affect the properties of the learned feature maps? A more detailed discussion of the mathematical properties of the PDEs and their implications for image representation is needed.
3. When validating the norm+linear approach, the authors repeated q by W × H times. In the original setting, the authors learned two matrices A and B, with more parameters. Thus, the comparison seems a bit unfair. The comparison lacks a proper ablation study. It is unclear whether the performance gain is due to the norm+linear approach or simply the increased number of parameters. A more controlled comparison is needed, perhaps by comparing with a model that has a similar number of parameters but does not use the norm+linear approach.
4. In comparable performance with Stable Diffusion, the input of the paper method is an image of the same size as the output, while the input of stable diffusion is a lower resolution image. The tasks of the two are different, so it may not be appropriate to compare them together. The comparison with Stable Diffusion is not well-justified. The paper does not clearly define the specific task that is being compared. It is important to compare the proposed method with other methods that perform the same task, such as image autoencoders.

### Summary
This paper presents a First-Order Norm+Linear Autoregression method (called FINOLA) which represents each image in the latent space as a first-order autoregressive process. Then, the authors validate the FINOLA property from on image reconstruction and self-supervised learning. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

### Strengths
This paper represents each image in the latent space as a first-order autoregressive process, and conducts experiments on image reconstruction and self-supervised learning to validate the method.

### Weaknesses
Some details of the figures and the method are not clear. The experiment section can be improved.

Some details of the figures are not clear. For example, what do red and blue arrows in z(x, y) mean? How do they affect the reconstruction? Does a single vector q mean the feature of the whole image or the specific pixel? In the figure, the a high frequency in the reconstruction loss.

How to calculate the mean $\mu_z$ and the standard deviation $\sigma_z$? In Eqn. (1), how to initialize the matrix A and B? What are the constraints of the matrix A and B?

The authors mainly compare VQGAN (Esser et al. (2021)) and stable diffusion (Rombach et al. (2021)) in image reconstruction. It would be better to compare recent image reconstruction methods. In addition, could you compare convolutional U-Net for image reconstruction?

In Table 4 (a), using PSNR to compare VQGAN and Stable Diffusion is not convincing because these methods are generative methods. It would be better to use LPIPS and FID.
