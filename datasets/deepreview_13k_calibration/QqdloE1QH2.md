## Abstract
Autoformalization is the task of translating natural language materials into machine-verifiable formalisations.
Progress in autoformalization research is hindered by the lack of a sizeable dataset consisting of informal-formal pairs expressing the same essence.
Existing methods tend to circumvent this challenge by
manually curating small corpora or using few-shot learning with large language models. 
But these methods suffer from data scarcity and formal language acquisition difficulty. 
In this work, we create \mma, a large, flexible, multilingual, and multi-domain dataset of informal-formal pairs, by using a language model to translate in the reverse direction, that is, from formal mathematical statements into corresponding informal ones.  
Experiments show that language models fine-tuned on \mma produce $16-18\%$ of statements acceptable with minimal corrections on the \texttt{miniF2F} and \texttt{ProofNet} benchmarks, up from $0\%$ with the base model.
We demonstrate that fine-tuning on multilingual formal data results in more capable autoformalization models even when deployed on monolingual tasks.

### Summary
Summary
This study centers on the autoformalization of natural language into machine-verifiable formalizations, employing a back-translation approach with GPT-4 to convert formal mathematical statements into their informal counterparts. Utilizing this newly constructed dataset, the authors further fine-tune various language models, achieving an acceptable output—with minimal adjustments needed—on 16-18% of statements when benchmarked against miniF2F and ProofNet.

### Strengths
Strengths

The Multilingual Mathematical Autoformalization (MMA) dataset was ingeniously synthesized using GPT-4, resulting in a substantial collection of 332,000 informal-formal pairings across multiple formal languages.
With its multilingual and multidomain composition, the dataset notably exceeds the size of the largest existing datasets in the field.
The research showcases improved outcomes when compared against established baselines.

### Weaknesses
Weaknesses

The integrity of the MMA dataset warrants further examination, as it was entirely auto-generated via GPT-4, potentially leading to mismatched cases. The paper would benefit from an expanded discussion on the discrepancies and the inclusion of findings from human evaluation.
The paper's innovative contribution seems incremental, largely relying on the automated capabilities of GPT-4 for dataset generation, which suggests a limited technical advancement.

### Summary
The work introduces an automated dataset for mathematical formalization, composed of informal-formal pairings. This dataset was generated using a reverse translation approach on two formal corpora, utilizing the large language model (LLM). Experimental results from two benchmark tests (100 examples) supports the enhancements achieved through fine-tuning on this synthesized dataset. A notable discovery from the study is that fine-tuning on a multilingual (formal language) dataset can also yield benefits for a monolingual (formal language) benchmark.

### Strengths
* This work is the first effort in distilling mathematical formalization from the LLM, a contribution given the notable scarcity of parallel datasets of mathematical formalization.

* Both the generated dataset and the fine-tuned model will be made publicly available for further research and development.

### Weaknesses
 * The evaluation could benefit from further enhancement. Currently, a sample size of only 50 examples from the benchmark is used, which may not provide sufficiently convincing results due to potential statistical limitations. Specifically, the use of only 50 examples per benchmark (representing a mere 10% of the total dataset) introduces a significant risk of bias and may not accurately reflect the model's performance across the entire spectrum of the dataset. This limited sample size could lead to an overestimation or underestimation of the model's true capabilities, making it difficult to generalize the findings to the broader mathematical formalization domain.

* As the author also mentioned, the synthesized datasets could be noisy. It would be beneficial to also include GPT4 in your comparative analysis for formalization quality. This would offer deeper insights into the noise levels within the generated datasets, i.e., how noisy it could be. Furthermore, a more rigorous analysis of the types of errors present in the synthesized dataset would be beneficial. For instance, are the errors primarily due to incorrect translations of mathematical symbols, logical inconsistencies, or a lack of contextual understanding? A detailed error analysis would help in understanding the limitations of the dataset and guide future improvements.

* The term ‘language’ or ‘lingual’ as used throughout the paper, especially in the section of introduction, could potentially lead to confusion, although it is understandable with careful reading. The interchangeable use of 'language' to refer to both natural languages and formal languages can be ambiguous. It would be beneficial to explicitly clarify the distinction between these two types of languages when introducing the concept of mathematical formalization, perhaps by using terms like 'natural language' and 'formal mathematical language' consistently throughout the paper.

### Questions
* Considering that the total number of examples required for complete testing is approximately **eight times** the number of the sampled 50 examples used in the evaluation, I would appreciate more information about the overall effort required to execute the complete testing process.

### Summary
This paper describes the creation of a parallel dataset for informal natural-language mathematical statements and their formal counterparts in two proof-assistant languages. The dataset, the largest of its kind, is creating using the technique of back-translation. The paper then uses this dataset to fine-tune a LLM on the task of formalizing natural-language statements, which improves its performance a lot (compared to 0%).

### Strengths
This is an important problem, and the dataset will be helpful for many others working in this area. The dataset is the largest of its kind by far.

In the introduction, the fact that the dataset covers multiple formal languages does not necessarily sound like a selling point to me, until you point out that training a model on multiple formal languages helps. I think this is a strong point that could be emphasized more (if I understand it correctly, see below under Questions).

### Weaknesses
I feel that the word "Multilingual" is confusing because it sounds like it works on multiple natural languages. However, I admit that "multi-formal-language" is awkward.

The data is automatically generated by back-translation ("informalization"). This is good because informalization appears to be an easier task than formalization and because it's more important for the target (formal language) side of the data to be high quality. However, it also does mean that the source (natural language) side of the data might not be correct or might not be as realistic as it could be. As the authors note, "the resulting MMA dataset is not perfect: Rather than the ground truth, informalisations in MMA should be treated as noisy approximations of it."

### Questions
It's possible that I misunderstood the claim that training on mixed-language data helps. I did not understand the sentence "We emphasise that the jointly fine-tuned model has seen 3/4 Isabelle and 1/4 Lean4 tokens of the monolingual models, and conclude that fine-tuning with multiple formal languages is much more data-efficient than with single-formal-language autoformalization data" (p.6). The jointly fine-tuned model has a greater total amount of data, right? How many steps are in an epoch? By 40000 steps, has the jointly fine-tuned model seen more examples than the Lean4-only and Isabelle-only models?

### Summary
This work translates formal problem descriptions into informal descriptions in natural language with GPT-4, and demonstrates on two standard benchmarks that the collected data is helpful to improve autoformalization.

### Strengths
Significant improvement of the performance on autoformalization.

### Weaknesses
The scope and novelty is limited.
This paper can be viewed as a back-translation version of Fu et al. (ICML 2023; see below for reference details).
The proposed method is generic, but only evaluated on the narrow domain of autoformalization.
