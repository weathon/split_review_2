## Abstract
\vspace{-0.10in}
Numerous explainability methods have been proposed to shed light on the inner workings of \gnns.
 Despite the inclusion of empirical evaluations in all the proposed algorithms, the interrogative aspects of these evaluations lack diversity. As a result, various facets of explainability pertaining to \gnns, such as \rev{a comparative analysis of counterfactual reasoners}, their stability to variational factors such as different \gnn architectures,  noise, stochasticity in non-convex loss surfaces, feasibility amidst domain constraints, and so forth, have yet to be formally investigated. Motivated by this need, we present a benchmarking study on perturbation-based explainability methods for \gnns, aiming to systematically evaluate and compare a wide range of explainability techniques. Among the key findings of our study, we identify the Pareto-optimal methods that exhibit superior efficacy and stability in the presence of noise. Nonetheless, our study reveals that all algorithms are affected by stability issues when faced with noisy data. Furthermore, we have established that the current generation of counterfactual explainers often fails to provide feasible recourses due to violations of topological constraints encoded by domain-specific considerations.
 Overall, this benchmarking study empowers stakeholders in the field of \gnns with a comprehensive understanding of the state-of-the-art explainability methods, potential research problems for further enhancement, and the implications of their application in real-world scenarios.

### Summary
The authors applied a benchmark evaluation to measure various GNN explainers' performances. A brief review of GNN explainer classification is introduced, then seven perturbation-based factual explainers and four perturbation-based counterfactual explainers are selected to conduct the benchmark test. Stability, necessity, reproducibility, feasibility, and comparative analysis are chosen to be evaluation criteria.  Size, fidelity, and accuracy are regarded as metrics. Finally, after the empirical evaluation, the authors provided some insights and directions expected to lead researchers enhance the overall quality and interpretability of GNNs.

### Strengths
1) A comprehensive introduction about how GNN explainers work and how GNN explainers are classified is provided.  Clear Figure 1 demonstrates research interest of the paper.
2) Various perturbation-based GNN explainers are selected to evaluate their performances, increasing the soundness of conclusions. The selected explainers are published from 2003 to 2022, covering the development of GNN explainers for decades.Multiple runs were conducted to deal with randomness.
3) Detailed appendix proves the rigor of experiments.  Comparative analysis is conducted to reveal some kay outcomes' features.  Many clear figures demonstrate the reasonability of conclusion.

### Weaknesses
1) Lack of creativity and significance: The authors conducted an evaluation to measure many explainers' performances, but did not come up with a novel solution to overcome the discovered challenges.  Also, the conclusions are not insightful enough with further analysis. Based on this reason, it is hard to regard this paper as a research paper.
2) Poor layout: The layout of words and tables is too dense, such as Table 1, 4, 5, and 8. Numbers inside table are too small and hard to read.

### Questions
Authors may want to try to offer some new solutions to the discovered limitations of existing GNN explainers. Finding out these limitations is just a start of a research work. For instance, the feasibility concerns about counterfactual explainations appear due to the deviations in topological distribution. Authors can keep working in this direction and find out some methods to improve feasibility.

### Summary
This work presents a benchmark for perturbation-based GNN explanation methods. Within the benchmark, this work provides a comprehensive comparison between both the factual and counter-factual explanation methods. This work conducts the comparison on various datasets, including 10 graph classification and 3 node classification ones. The experiments compare 7 GNN explanation methods in terms of the size of the perturbation, the sufficiency (percentage of the subgraphs that yield the same results as using full graph), and accuracy (the percentage of correct explanation). The results give a relative comparison among the seven methods. Furthermore, this work conducts a comparison of the methods regarding the stability with regard to noise injected into the underlying graph, different seeds of training explanation models, and variations in model architectures. Lastly, this work also provides an open-sourced codebase, making the benchmark accessible for public use.

### Strengths
- This work provides an extensive evaluation of perturbation-based GNN explanation methods in terms of both performance and stability. The comprehensive results give a quantitative comparison of existing explanation methods. 
- Besides performance, this work also considers the stabilities of GNN explanation methods. This provides a new aspect for evaluating GNN explanation algorithms. 
- This work provides an online repository of the proposed benchmark, making the evaluations accessible for a broader range of users.

### Weaknesses
 - The conclusions from the empirical comparison are not clear. It would be better to summarize the conclusions from the empirical comparison and provide conceptual insights, such as how would the results guide the future design of GNN explanation methods. 
- Discussion of the existing works needs more structure. Current discussion of the related works are based on the summary for each method. It would be better to provide more structures of the current works, such as what methods the existing ones share in common. 
- Details of the empirical studies need to be further elaborated. Please see Questions.

### Questions
- It would be better to clearly define how the sufficiency score is computed. 
- Do the authors have any explanation for why the RCExplainer and the GNNExplainer have the highest sufficiency scores? It would be helpful to provide a more structured and conceptual comparison between the explanation methods. 
- What is the definition and scale of the noise shown in Figure 3?

### Summary
This paper comprehensively studies the existing methods of explaining GNN predictors, including factual explainers and counterfactual explainers. The investigation is carried out in terms of stability, necessity/reproducibility, and feasibility for counterfactual explainers. And some conclusion of these investigations is obtained by extensive empirical evaluations.

### Strengths
This paper investigates a critical problem of GNN predictors, that is the explainability pertaining to GNNs. Specifically, the counterfactual explanation is an important and meaningful explainer, which is worthy of studying. This paper fulfills the vacancy of the research on benchmarking it. The empirical evaluation is extensive and comprehensive. Therefore, the resulting conclusions from the experiments are solid and reliable.

### Weaknesses
I believe there is some space for improvement in the paper's presentation. I suggest some important metrics, such as necessity and reproducibility can be expressed in mathematical equations. This can bring convenience for readers to understand the concepts.

The notations of A(G_s) in Equation 1 should be A(G').
In definition 2, the prediction of the perturbated graph is defined to be different from the counterpart of the original graph. I think this is valid for binary classification. For multi-classification problems, the counterfactual reasoning should be associated with a pre-assigned label.
The definitions of fidelity, necessity, and reproducibility seem to be vague. The fidelity in section 4 (under figure 2) is not clear, "some works have used the term fidelity instead of sufficiency" has no citations. The authors do not clearly give the definition of necessity and reproducibility and only give the intuition of these metrics (e.g. measures if ). This makes it difficult to figure out the metrics.
The measurement of feasibility which is defined as the number of connected graphs is somehow one-sided. Are there other measurements that can characterize the topological properties? And the relationship between defining the similarity with the topological properties of the test dataset and the feasibility measurement should be discussed and justified.

### Strengths
1、This paper provides a detailed and comprehensive description of the existing explainers for GNNs and compares different explanation methods in a clear way.

### Weaknesses
1、Whether adversarially adding the number of edges has an impact on the sufficiency of the factual explainers leading to different experimental results in Figure 2 or Table 4
2、Most experimental results do not seem to provide explanations about the experimental phenomena and comparisons of the advantages and disadvantages of different explanation methods. For example, why the stability of CF^2 has dropped significantly on the IMDB-B and AIDS datasets in Fig. 3.
3、For the experimental results of stability against topological noise, why are the GEM and SubgraphX not used.
4、There are differences between different factual explainers on different datasets. Is there a benchmark to select a proper explainers in practice.
