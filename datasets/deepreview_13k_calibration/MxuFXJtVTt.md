## Abstract
The Private Aggregation of Teacher Ensembles (PATE) framework is a versatile approach to privacy-preserving machine learning. In PATE, teacher models that are not privacy-preserving are trained on distinct portions of sensitive data. Privacy-preserving knowledge transfer to a student model is then facilitated by privately aggregating teachers' predictions on new examples. 
 Employing PATE with generative auto-regressive models presents both challenges and opportunities. These models excel in open ended \emph{diverse} (aka hot) tasks with multiple valid responses. Moreover, the knowledge of models is often encapsulated in the response distribution itself and preserving this diversity is critical for fluid and effective knowledge transfer from teachers to student. In all prior designs, higher diversity resulted in lower teacher agreement and thus -- a tradeoff between diversity and privacy. Prior works with PATE thus focused on non-diverse settings or limiting diversity to improve utility.
   We propose \emph{hot PATE}, a design tailored for the diverse setting. In hot PATE, each teacher model produces a response distribution that can be highly diverse. We mathematically model the notion of \emph{preserving diversity} and propose an aggregation method, \emph{coordinated ensembles}, that preserves privacy and transfers diversity with \emph{no penalty} to privacy or efficiency. We demonstrate empirically the benefits of hot PATE for in-context learning via prompts and potential to unleash more of the capabilities of generative models.

### Summary
The paper presents an extension of PATE, called HOT PATE, designed for generative AI models and tasks that require "diverse" responses. 
The authors adapt the original PATE methodology to the generative model domain, where multiple valid responses exist, and differential privacy must be preserved.

### Strengths
1. The paper introduces an original concept by extending PATE to generative models.
2. I appreciated the discussion around the conflict between diversity and privacy.
3. The simplicity of the approach is a plus.

### Weaknesses
1. A critical weakness is the limited scope of the experimental evaluation. The evaluation is reported on a single experiments with only 5 outputs. This might not adequately reflect the framework’s performance with truly open-ended queries. The lack of diverse and complex scenarios makes it difficult to assess the robustness of the proposed method. For example, the evaluation does not consider different types of generative tasks, such as text summarization or image generation, which could reveal potential limitations.
2. The proposed solution’s scalability might be impractical for more complex (and realistic) tasks. The paper does not provide a detailed analysis of the computational resources required for larger models or datasets. The quadratic increase in the number of yield queries with the number of teachers, as mentioned in the paper, raises concerns about the feasibility of the approach for real-world applications. The paper lacks an in-depth discussion of the memory and time complexity of the proposed algorithm, which is crucial for assessing its practical viability.
3. The generalizability of the empirical results is questionable due to the specificity of the demonstration. The paper's reliance on a single, narrow example makes it difficult to determine whether the observed performance gains are specific to that particular scenario or if they can be expected in other contexts. The lack of experiments with different datasets and model architectures limits the conclusions that can be drawn from the empirical results. The paper should include a more extensive evaluation with a variety of tasks and datasets to demonstrate the general applicability of the proposed approach.
4. The paper lacks a clear guideline for balancing privacy trade-offs in various contexts. The paper does not provide a detailed analysis of how the privacy parameter epsilon affects the utility of the generated outputs. It is unclear how practitioners should choose an appropriate value for epsilon in different scenarios, and what the implications of this choice are for the quality and diversity of the generated content. The paper should provide a more comprehensive discussion of the privacy-utility trade-offs and offer practical guidance for selecting appropriate privacy parameters.

### Questions
1. Can the authors elaborate on the framework's expected performance with fully open-ended queries and the plans for more comprehensive empirical evaluations?
2. What measures are in place to ensure the quality of outputs in more complex (and hopefully actual open-ended) scenarios, and how is output quality measured?
3. Can you also comment on the framework scalability and its impact on privacy?

### Summary
This paper proposes the "hot PATE" which is an extension of the Private Aggregation of Teacher Ensembles (PATE) framework. Traditional PATE is primarily used for classification tasks with definitive ground-truth labels, which suffers limitations when applied to more open-ended, diverse tasks characteristic of generative AI models like large language models (LLMs). Hot PATE aims to address these challenges by enabling each teacher model to contribute a response distribution to preserve both privacy and the diversity of responses. This paper evaluates the hot PATE by conducting empirical demonstrations using the OpenAI GPT3.5 interface.

### Strengths
1. This paper presents an innovative extension of the PATE framework, enabling privacy-preserving learning in generative AI tasks. 
2. This paper provides a thorough theoretical analysis of the hot PATE framework.

### Weaknesses
1. This paper is not well-written and is difficult to follow. 
2. This paper does not include empirical validation of the student model's performance.
3. This paper does not mention related work, leaving it unclear whether there are other baseline works for comparison.
4. This paper does not provide sufficient detail about the methodologies used, especially regarding the implementation of the hot PATE framework and the experimental setup.

### Questions
1. What is w_j and how is it computed? Could the authors make this clearer?
2. Why are the experiments limited to only OpenAI GPT-3.5, and therefore, to only the top 5 tokens?
3. What is considered as private information in this paper?
4. What does the student model represent in the hot PATE framework?

### Summary
This paper proposes a modification/extension to the PATE framework, termed "hot PATE". Rather than relying solely on the noisy argmax, as in the traditional PATE method, hot PATE aggregates the distributions of teacher outputs. The key assertion is that by aggregating distributions, the diversity of responses is better preserved, which should enhance learning. Experiments have been conducted within the prompt learning paradigm

### Strengths
- The idea of increasing the information of the teacher aggregation beyond just the argmax seems both valid and intuitive.

### Weaknesses
 - This submission reads more like a draft and doesn't seem ready for review. I found challenges in understanding some parts due to the clarity and quality of the writing.  Although I've attempted to interpret the content sentence by sentence, a significant portion of the text remains confusing and ambiguous (see examples below). In its current state, I believe the submission needs more work to meet the (writing) standards expected for an ICLR paper.

- The scope and contribution of this submission seems not clearly stated. Initially, the paper appears to claim a general extension of the PATE framework, but the method and experiment sections mainly focus on prompt learning. A clearer definition of the scope is needed for an accurate evaluation of the submission. Furthermore, since the distillation formulation (which aggregates distributions as this submission intends to do) was briefly discussed in the original PATE paper [1] (Appendix B.1), it's crucial to articulate the novelty and insights of this work in comparison to that prior research.

- Diversity and privacy appear to be conflicting in that DP requires that the output token is supported
by sufficiently many teachers, a “reporting threshold” that depends on the privacy parameter values.

- Therefore, low probability across many teachers is something we care to transfer whereas high
probability in few teachers, the “bad case” for privacy, is also not something we need to transfer.

- A tokens j that broadly has a low probability q will appear, sometimes, with very high
frequency cj that does not depend on q. What does depend on q is the probability of this event. This allows it to pass through a high “privacy threshold.”

- Some "minor" points regarding Definition 1:
  - Missing left-bracket for $f(p^{(i)})_{i\in[n]})$  
  - The notation $j\in V$ might not be rigorous. Perhaps $j$ should denote the *index* for words in $V$.
  - Why is the dependence on $\tau$ completely not reflected in the example shown on page 4

### Questions
- Recommendations for improvement include a possible rewriting of the work to enhance its readability. Specifically, it might be helpful to check the consistent and proper use of hyphens and to verify the correct application of \citet and \citep. Some sentences could benefit from rephrasing for clarity. Below are a few examples from the submission that need further clarification:

### Summary
The work proposes Hot PATE. It is the first time for me that it is really difficult to directly point out what the main contributions of this work are. The work claims that the standard PATE does not consider the diversity of responses among the teachers. In the proposed Hot PATE, the knowledge of the teacher is assumed to be captured by the diversity of responses. This approach proposes to use a temperature
parameter in the softmax to control the diversity of responses. The work is showcased on discrete prompts.

### Strengths
N/A

### Weaknesses
1. The paper builds directly on the recent work by Duan et al. 2023 [1] and proposes a very limited extension. 
Moreover, it incorrectly states the method from the previous work [1]. Namely, this submission states that [1] "it requires a source of unlabeled non-private training examples to facilitate the knowledge transfer to the student". It is incorrect, [1] in Table 2 studies two settings, (IID Transfer) when the public dataset is from the same and (OOD Transfer) different distribution than the private training data. Moreover, [1] selects which tokens are taken into account as labels and is flexible in the selection of these tokens for the labels. 
2. The main contribution is not related to the prompts. "The aggregation method should preserve privacy but to facilitate the knowledge transfer from teachers to the student, should critically also preserve the diversity of the teacher distributions. Our primary technical challenge was to formalize this requirement and design an aggregation method with a good privacy utility tradeoff." If this is the main contribution the hot PATE can be used for any task, not only for the discrete prompts. 
3. It is not true that PATE was used only for the classification tasks. The submission claims: "Until now, PATE has primarily been explored with classification-like tasks, where each example possesses a ground-truth label, and knowledge is transferred to the student by labeling random examples." Many follow-ups for PATE consider, e.g., image generation: G-PATE https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper/2021/hash/171ae1bbb81475eb96287dd78565b38b-Abstract.html [2]
