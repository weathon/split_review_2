## Abstract
Generative models hold the promise of significantly expediting the materials design process when compared to traditional human-guided or rule-based methodologies. However, effectively generating high-quality periodic structures of materials on limited but diverse datasets remains an ongoing challenge. Here we propose a novel approach for periodic structure generation which fully respect the intrinsic symmetries, periodicity, and invariances of the structure space. Namely, we utilize differentiable, physics-based, structural descriptors which can describe periodic systems and satisfy the necessary invariances, in conjunction with a denoising diffusion model which generates new materials within this descriptor or representation space. Reconstruction is then performed on these representations using gradient-based optimization to recover the corresponding Cartesian positions of the crystal structure. This approach differs significantly from current methods by generating materials in the representation space, rather than in the Cartesian space, which is made possible using an efficient reconstruction algorithm. Consequently, known issues with respecting periodic boundaries and translational and rotational invariances during generation can be avoided, and the model training process can be greatly simplified. We show this approach is able to provide competitive performance on established benchmarks compared to current state-of-the-art methods.

### Summary
This work proposes StructRepDiff, a novel diffusion-based model for 3D periodic material generation. StructRepDiff uses a denoising diffusion model to generate periodic materials in the form of symmetry-invariant representations, including compsition representation, lattice parameters, and embedded atom density representations. Atom coordinates are obtained by searching coordinates that best match the generated embedded atom density representations with gradient descent. Experiments show that StructRepDiff performs well in reconstruction and random generation of periodic materials.

### Strengths
- **Originality**: Several novel ideas are proposed by this work, including generating materials in the form of symmetry-invariant representations and searching atom coordinates to match embedded atom density representations.  
- **Quality**: Generally, the key points of the proposed method are clearly described, and the proof that the used material representations are invariant to rotation, translation, and periodic transformations is given in the appendix. Experiments on benchmark datasets show the proposed model achieves good performance in periodic material generation.  
- **Clarity**: The writing of this paper is clear, well-organized and easy-to-follow.  
- **Significance**: The proposed model is useful for novel material design in a broad range of real-world applications.

### Weaknesses
 - It is not clear how the number of atoms $n$ is obtained from $C_{comp}$ as $C_{comp}$ is normalized by $n$. It is possible that materials with different $n$ may have the same $C_{comp}$. For instance, in $C_{comp}$ of materials with only carbon atoms, only the item for carbon atom is 1 while all other items are zeros, but there may exist different number of atoms $n$ in a unit cell. Authors are encouraged to clarify how $n$ is obtained. Specifically, the material representation dimension is described as $2N_e+|\mathbb{A}|+7$, which should be $2N_e+|\mathbb{A}|+8$ if including the total number of atoms. This needs to be explicitly stated in Section 4.1.
- There lack many significant details in the presentation of obtaining coordinates from embedded atom density representations in Section 4.3. Authors are recommended to clarify the following details: (1) What is the formula of loss function $L$? Is it based on fractional coordinates or Cartesian coordinates? (2) What are the gradient descent algorithm, step size, max_initializations, max_hops, and max_iterations used in experiments? (3) What are general range of the loss function values when optimization ends? It would be better to report the mean final loss function values averaged over all generated materials.
- Table 1 needs  improvements. The column "Dataset" should be removed. Italic font type should not be used to the "P" under "RMSE" to keep consistency. Also, in Section 5 and Table 1, the method name "Cond-DFC-VAE" is mistakenly written as "Cond-DFC" for many times. These should be corrected.
- Property optimization is important in real-world problems because real-world applications usually require to generate materials with some target chemical properties. However, it remains unknown how to do property optimization with the proposed model. Authors are encouraged to discuss how to property optimization with StructRepDiff, and explain whether the failure of achieving invertible mapping between material representations and atom coordinates has negative impacts on property optimization. A more in-depth discussion is needed here.
- In the fourth line of Section 4.3, authors inappropriately cites their own work as "following from our earlier work (Fung et al., 2022)". This leaks the identities of authors and seems to violate the anonymous policies of ICLR.

### Questions
In addition to embedded atom density representations, are there any other ways for 3D structure representations? Authors are encouraged to give some alternative examples for embedded atom density representations.

### Summary
The work proposes a generative modeling of materials structures. It first encodes the structure into a symmetry-preserving representation and then trains a generative model on this representation, thereby bypassing the problem of respecting a set of symmetries (euclidean + permutation), as has to be done in direct generation. It then measures the performance on an existing benchmarks of crystal materials structures.

### Strengths
The idea of dealing with symmetries by learning in a controllable deterministic invariant space is nice (albeit not novel, see below). The paper clearly outlines the main ideas. The implementation seems well done.

### Weaknesses
It seems pretty clear this paper is far from finished. There's an idea, there's some early results, but this really just needs more work. It's impossible to tell at this stage if this idea work (it may, we just cannot tell).

In particular, there are two key weaknesses

- The evaluations are not very meaningful. The paper sets out to improve materials discovery through generative modeling. The goal of materials discovery is to find materials that are a) novel, b) thermodynamically stable, c) have interesting properties. The paper addresses only point a), and only to some extent. There isn't a single DFT calculation run to see if any of these materials would be stable? The word "stable" isn't even mentioned. That means it may be that all of these predicted structures could never exist in nature. Similarly, there's zero addressing of whether these (potentially unstable) materials have useful properties. Without addressing this, it's just impossible to assess if this is a good idea or not. 

- The paper would benefit from discussing the relationship to Uhrin 2021, "Through the eyes of a descriptor: Constructing complete, invertible descriptions of atomic environments"  https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.09319.pdf -- which describes many of the core ideas discussed here.

### Summary
In this manuscript, the authors explore a methodology for generating periodic materials by combining representation embedding with a diffusion model. Their approach involves the initial projection of the original material structure into a representation space that integrates the Embedded Atom Density (EAD), composition, and lattice representations. Subsequently, a noise and denoising diffusion process is applied to the embedded representation, and the material structure is reconstructed from this representation.

### Strengths
- Generating periodic materials while preserving their structures is essential for accurately capturing and reconstructing the material's structural properties. The authors address this challenge by integrating representation embedding and the diffusion process. The way is straightforward and powerful.

- The manuscript provides a comprehensive description of the model algorithms and experimental methods, ensuring a clear understanding of their model's computations.

### Weaknesses
 - In the sections of Introduction and Related Works, the generation methods are discussed in terms of representation-based generation and direct material generation. However, when the authors describe the baseline models in the Results section, the two categories are not explicitly mentioned, leading to ambiguity regarding the categorization of these models. It appears that the authors exclusively compared their methods with those of direct material generation. This raises questions about the extent to which the current representation embedding solely contributes to the improvement and to what extent the diffusion process is necessary for their proposed methodology. Specifically, without a baseline that uses the same representation but a different generative model, it's difficult to isolate the impact of the diffusion process itself. The lack of comparison to representation-based generative models makes it unclear if the improvements are due to the representation or the diffusion process.


- I’m not familiar with the datasets the authors used, but I wonder how the test (or validation) data is divided from the training data. For example, the authors evaluate the PCA distribution analysis using the “training” data in Figure 5 according to the main text (page 7), which should be analyzed using the test data. It is unclear if the test set is truly held out, and if the PCA analysis is performed on data that was not used to train the model. This raises concerns about the validity of the PCA analysis and the generalizability of the results.


- The authors mention “significant increase” and “significantly better” in the results section (page 7). Are these based on some statistical tests? If so, the authors should describe the details. Without statistical tests, it's hard to know if the reported improvements are statistically significant or just due to random chance. The lack of statistical rigor undermines the claims of significant improvement.


- Figure 1’s terminologies are not consistent in the 4.1. The descriptions of Cell, Comp, and Structure would be better matched with those in the main text, at least in the caption of Figure 1. Besides, when the authors explain Section 4.1, referring to Figure 1 would be easier to understand. The inconsistency between the figure and the text makes it harder to follow the methodology.


- At first, I thought that the hyperparameter of training was not described in the manuscript. Later, I learned it’s described in Appendix 3.4.4. Including a reference to Appendix 3.4.4 in the main text would help readers’ understanding. The lack of clear reference to the appendix makes it harder to understand the experimental setup.


- The reference of algo. 2 on page 5 should be algo. 1.


- The source code is not available in the supplementary material. Sharing the code will contribute to future development in the field.

### Questions
- Let me confirm that the component distribution of generated and original samples in Figure 5 is computed from the same PCA loadings and these axes are directly comparable. I wonder why the PCA distribution of generated samples (Figure 5 left in particular) is more diverse than the original distribution. 

- Could the authors explain more why the RMSE results are not improved much compared to those of the Match Rate?

### Summary
This paper aims at building a tool for generating periodic materials (molecules represented by atom types, their coordinates, and the lattice structure). The key idea of the paper is to perform diffusion-based generative modeling on a tailored representation space. The representation space is a result of concatenation of a physically meaningful representation, i.e., Embedded Atom Density (EAD), with explicit information extractable from the coordinate based representation, i.e., composition and lattice parameters. A key step in generating molecules with explicit representations (atom coordinates) is the reconstruction from the proposed representation space. The paper mentions that this is the first use of latents (in contrast to coordinate-based representations) for generating periodic materials. The benefit of the proposed method is that the generated molecules are invariant to different transforms. The results show acceptable performance in terms of reconstruction step as well as generation metrics, such as validity.

### Strengths
- The paper seems to be original in the scope of problem definition. Although the question of molecular generation is currently being widely studied, the paper positions itself around periodic materials. From the Related Work section, it seems that this area has not received enough attention. In terms of methodology, the paper relies considerably on prior work for generation, representation, and reconstruction steps.

### Weaknesses
 - The technical contribution, while considerable, is not deep enough for a venue like ICLR. Although there is nothing wrong with combining existing methods, for this kind of contributions one expects a set of deeper insights or surprisingly better results than state of the art.

- The paper could have been better exposed. For example, it is not clear if the proposed concatenated representation is the idea of this paper or not. I assume it is, but have not seen the paper mention it explicitly. In general, mentioning an explicit list of contributions is recommended. Another example is the reconstruction procedure (section 4.3). While it is a significant part of the proposed method, it is only later in the results section that we understand this step is done through back-propagation using automatic differentiation of an analytical function.

- The paper tries to evaluate its proposed representation in the context of generation. This is Ok. But if the concatenated representation is the key, the focus of evaluation should have been that part. For example, an extensive evaluation of different invariances especially the permutation invariance.

- It is true that running density functional theory might be time consuming, but I think this is necessary for the evaluation. Obviously, the evaluation results based only on surrogate models cannot be judged clearly.

### Questions
- What is the motivation behind min-, max-pooling of the EAD representation? Is this known or the paper proposes it? 

- Is Table 1 a fair evaluation? That means, do the competing methods in the table have a dedicated component for the reconstruction phase (like the method of Fung et al. which the paper relies on)? 

- Table 1: For generating this table, have the valid molecules first been separated for all methods? Or only for a few of them? If only for a few of them, which ones?

5: You are absolutely certain about your assessment. You are very familiar with the related work and checked the math/other details carefully.

### Summary
The paper described an experimental approach to represent crystal structures with a further aim to guarantee their reconstruction from a given representation.

### Strengths
The authors should be highly praised for studying important real objects such as solid crystalline materials. 

The paper is generally well-written and contains enough details that helped understand the difficulties.

Figure 1 is especially nice and clearly implies that the required representation (obtained by the first arrow) should be proved to be invertible and realizable (so that any new representation can be realized by a crystal structure) before further stages make sense.

### Weaknesses
The word "problem" appears only once (in section 5 on results), though a rigorous and explicit problem statement might have helped the authors to understand the obstacles.

Quote: "The last piece of information needed to fully describe a material structure
M is the lattice parameters L in R^6. Here, we use L directly as the lattice representation"

Comment: This conventional lattice representation (three cell edges and three angles between them) is not invariant because any lattice can be generated by infinitely many different cell bases, for example, the basis (1,0),(n,1) for any integer non-zero n generates the same square lattice.

If we need a complete and invariant description of a periodic crystal, crystallographers solved this problem nearly 100 years ago by using Niggli's reduced cell of a lattice and then recording all atoms in so-called standard settings, see the book "TYPIX standardized data and crystal chemical characterization of inorganic structure types" by Parthé et al, which actually applies to all periodic crystals, not only inorganic. 

However, all these standardizations have become obsolete in the new world of big and noisy data because the underlying lattice (not even a unit cell) of any periodic crystal is discontinuous under almost any perturbation, which is obvious already in dimension 1.

For example, the set Z of all integers is nearly identical to a periodic sequence with points 0, 1+ep_1, ..., m+ep_m in the unit cell [0,m+1] for any small ep_1,...,ep_m close to 0, though their minimal periods (or unit cells) 1 and m+1 are arbitrarily different. 

This discontinuity was reported for experimental crystals already in 1965, see Lawton SL, Jacobson RA. The reduced cell and its crystallographic applications. Ames Lab., Iowa State Univ. of Science and Tech. 

A more recent example from Materials Project shows two nearly identical crystals whose unit cells differ by a factor of (approximately) 2
https://next-gen.materialsproject.org/materials/mp-568619
https://next-gen.materialsproject.org/materials/mp-568656

Theorem 13 in Widdowson et al (MATCH 2022) proved that any cell (not only Niggli's) reduction is discontinuous hence using a cell basis is hopeless.

Moreover, atoms in any material always vibrate above absolute zero temperature, so their positions continuously change. As a result, any crystal structure with fixed atomic coordinates in a database is only a single snapshot of a potentially dynamic object, especially for proteins whose structures are also determined often by crystallization. 

Quote: "Invariance to permutation: Given the representation R = [Rstr,Ccomp,L], we can permute the atoms within the crystal to obtain an updated representation".

Comment: since a periodic crystal contains infinitely many points, the updated representation will be infinite. Even if only m atoms in a minimal cell are permuted, the representation blows up by the exponential factor of m!, which is also impractical.

Since the paper used PCA in Figure 5, the authors might be interested in learning that any dimensionality reduction is either discontinuous (makes close point distant) or projects an unbounded domain to a single point (loses an infinite amount of data), see the proof in Landweber et al "On Fiber Diameters of Continuous Maps", the American Mathematical Monthly, v.123 (2016), p.392-397.
 
Quote: "there is no single existing representation that fulfills all three of the conditions mentioned above".

Comment: there are at least two stronger representations that practically fulfill all three conditions and two more important practical requirements of polynomial-time computability and Lipschitz continuity under small perturbations of atoms, see isosets in Anosova et al (DGMM 2021, extended in arxiv:2205.15298) and Pointwise Distance Distributions in Widdowson et al (NeurIPS 2022, extended in arxiv:2108.04798).

In conclusion, the proposed invariants don't satisfy the practical requirements that were fulfilled by the simpler, stronger, and faster invariants.

### Questions
How many terms appear in the external sum of formula (2) in appendix A.2?

Does a manually chosen cutoff radius (in appendix A.2) make any invariant incomplete because perturbing atoms can scale up a unit cell to a size larger than any fixed radius?

What is RMSE used for comparing an original and reconstructed structures, and does this RMSE satisfy the metric axioms (en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metric_space)? If the first axiom fails, distance 0 doesn't guarantee that structures are equivalent. If the triangle inequality fails, the paper by Rass et al (arxiv:2211.03674 ) proves that the popular clustering algorithms such as k-means and DBSCAN can output any predetermined clusters.

How many hidden parameters and CPU hours were used for producing the experimental results?

Did the authors know about the classical results in crystallography cited above, starting from Niggli (1927), Lawton (1965), and Parthe (1987)?
