## Abstract
Image editing using a pretrained StyleGAN generator has emerged as a powerful paradigm for facial editing, providing disentangled controls over age, expression, illumination, etc. However, the approach cannot be directly adopted for video manipulations. We hypothesize that the main missing ingredient is the lack of fine-grained and disentangled control over face location, face pose, and local facial expressions. In this work, we demonstrate that such a fine-grained control is indeed achievable using pretrained StyleGAN by working across multiple (latent) spaces (namely, the positional space, the W+ space, and the S space)
and combining the optimization results across the multiple spaces. Building on this enabling component, we introduce \name that takes a target image and driving video(s) to reenact the local and global locations and expressions from the driving video in the identity of the target image. 
We evaluate the effectiveness of our method over multiple challenging scenarios and demonstrate clear improvements over alternative approaches. %The project code will be released upon acceptance.

### Summary
Editing images with a pre-trained generative model has been extensively explored. However, when it comes to applying controllable generation to video editing, several challenges arise. The authors of the paper claim that the main obstacle is the lack of precise control over face location, pose, and local expressions. They illustrate that utilizing a pre-trained StyleGAN enables the achievement of fine-grained control by concurrently traversing multiple latent spaces (positional, W+, and S spaces) and combining the results of optimization. Consequently, the authors introduce Video2StyleGAN, a method that employs a target image and driving video(s) to reproduce local and global facial features from the driving video onto the identity of the target image, generating a high-resolution video. Extensive experiments have shown the effectiveness of the approach in difficult scenarios.

### Strengths
- The novel utilization of the invariance property of StyleGAN3 is noteworthy.
- Upon checking the supplementary material, extensive experiments have demonstrated the applicability of the approach.
- Despite requiring optimization, the speed appears to be sufficiently fast (1.5 frames/sec).
- The hierarchical design of each component allows for controllability over different properties, which are also well-described.
- The approach achieves competitive results with previous methodologies.

### Weaknesses
 - At first glance, Figure 2 appears unclear; enhancing its clarity would improve the presentation of your methodology.
- Unfortunately, the approach still requires some fine-tuning/optimization. Have you considered any approaches to minimize the need for optimization?

### Questions
- Extending the approach to latent diffusion models and observing the results, as mentioned in the limitations section, would be intriguing. How do you plan to identify counterparts to these properties in GANs within diffusion models?
- I'm curious about your strategy for determining the use of 3-7 layers. Could you elaborate on how you arrived at this decision and, if possible, share relevant results?
- You noted that optimization on w is specifically applied to the first 8 layers. Could you provide more details on the reasoning behind this choice?

### Summary
This paper explores the use of a pre-trained StyleGAN generator for image editing, particularly focusing on facial manipulation. While StyleGAN has proven effective for controlling various facial attributes like age and expression in images, the researchers identified limitations when applying it to video editing. The key challenge appears to be the need for precise and disentangled control over factors such as face location, pose, and local facial expressions. To address this, the researchers propose a novel approach that involves working across multiple latent spaces, including positional, W+, and S spaces, and combining optimization results. They introduce Video2StyleGAN, a method capable of reenacting the local and global features, expressions, and locations from a driving video onto a target image's identity. The outcome is the generation of high-quality videos at an impressive 10242 resolution without requiring specific training on video data.

### Strengths
The simultaneous working across multiple latent spaces, as described in the approach, represents an innovative and promising direction in the field of image and video editing.

### Weaknesses
1.	The motivation is unfounded, as StyleHEAT and other methods using StyleGAN naturally support videos.
2.	MEAD is primarily an emotion-focused dataset, making it unsuitable as an experimental dataset for reenactment. The authors should conduct a fair comparison on more datasets and with more recent methods.
3.	The  generated results have limitations, including low mouth shape precision, low facial expression control accuracy, and the ability to control only frontal poses.

### Questions
1.	Could you provide more explanation and evidence for the motivation?
2.	Why not evaluate on a dataset that is typically used in reenactment?
3.	Why not compare with recent SOTAS, e.g. StyleHEAT?
4.	Can you provide results of pose driving along different axes?
5.	Why do the teeth in the supplementary material videos appear to have significant artifacts?

### Summary
The paper presents a method for human portrait video generation and manipulation using StyleGAN3 for a target character image using source videos. They encode global (pose) and local (expressions) variations to manipulate a pre-trained SG3's W and S feature spaces, respectively and SG3's Fourier features for better pose control. As a result, co-diving where pose from one video and expressions from another video can be combined thanks to the proposed disentanglement. Several results and comparisons are presented.

### Strengths
- The overall strength of the work is hierarchical framework that enables local (facial semantic) and global pose control. 
- The paper is generally written well and provides several comparisons against SOTA, where compared image-to-image the method outperforms several SOTA methods wrt to identify preservation and image reconstruction metrics.

### Weaknesses
 - The main limitation of the work is inconsistent local facial deformations. S-space expression deformations seem to perturb the space spatially inconsistently. Is this an artifact of SG3 or the method? Would you have the same artifact with SG2?
- According to the user study conduced (Appendix N), the results of motion/expressions were accepted ~50% of the time. I am not sure if this a strong indicator of success.
- Only a single method ablation (baseline +  Local Facial Feature Encoding) is provided. There is no discussion as to why this ablation was conduced. Thus, the method analysis seems incomplete.

### Questions
- While transferring the expressions from source video, do you normalize the images to remove pose (say using landmarks), s.t. only expression gets transferred? It may help with non-physical facial features?
- Can the authors consider a method similar to Pick-a-Pic, Kirstain et al. '23 to understand if temporal consistency of facial features is better accepted for the current method over SOTA?
- Please add a result where only pose change takes place in target video, to help understand if local deformations such as non-physical nose shape change still occurs?

### Summary
The paper proposes Video2Style, a framework focusing on fine-grained human face reenactment. Video2Style digs details like poses,  locations and expressions from driving (or co-driving) video and applies them into the reference videos. The method shows better detail and identity preservation over the previous baselines.

### Strengths
Motivation & general ides: 
- The paper chooses to explore the fine-grained video manipulation without any 3D information, which seems to be an interesting and meaningful direction.

Method:
- The paper shows some interesting insights into the latent space of StyleGAN3. For example, $W$ space for local variations and $S$ space for global variation. 

Results:
- Video2Style shows good control over pose transformation, details (like eyes and mouths), and it produces high-resolution videos.

### Weaknesses
Motivation & general ideas:
- The paper claims that a good video manipulation can be achieved by using a fine-grained control over the transformations and facial expressions, but mainly focuses on the reenactment for human faces. The word "video manipulation" is a little ambiguous and not well defined. I would suggest the authors come up with a proper scope of the paper with something related to reenactment.

Method:
- In Section 3.3.2, what is a "masked $W+$ space"? Why does it relate to pose matching and identity preservation. 
- In Section 3.3.3, it is known that [BiSeNet](https://github.com/zllrunning/face-parsing.PyTorch) sometimes cannot produce fine-grained masks. Will upsampling these masks with bilinear kernel bring more errors? 
- The purpose of using a co-driving  (CD)  video is confusing. What does it do? It is not explained in the paper. 

Experiments & results:
- From the results, the texture sticking artifact is very obvious even with a StyleGAN3 generator. Why would this happen given that StyleGAN3 claims it is able to produce anti-aliasing results? I notice that after "+Modified Baseline" (see the boundary of the hair, Ablation of Building Blocks, supplementary website), the texture sticking becomes obvious. Does it relate to this step? And what is the configuration of the StyleGAN3 generator used in the paper? 
- With a comparison with previous methods, Video2Style seems to bring some background changes in many examples in the supplementary material. Is there a way to mitigate this artifact?


Writing & presentation:
- The presentation of the paper needs to be improved from my perspective, given the complexity of the proposed method. For example, it is hard to understand Video2StyleGAN pipeline from Figure 2. To be specific, it would be better if the authors could include some figures/examples to demonstrate what each block is doing so that Figure 2 can becomes clearer. Moving some examples from the supplementary material to the main paper seems to be better. 
- Also in 3.3.2, the second sentence goes "We observe that applying this change stretches the face area and the eyes, however,
the mouth and nose positions remain unchanged making the output face unrealistic". From the supplementary video "Global Pose Encoding", it is hard to see this artifact from Restyle projection or naive method. The positions of the nose and mouth do change, which makes it hard to see if the proposed method is working or not.

### Questions
- In the supplementary website, in "Ablation of Building Blocks" video, what is the "Modified Baseline"?
- Why do you choose StyleGAN3 as your generator if the results presented in the paper still have some texture sticking artifacts? Will use a StyleGAN2 generator better since it is known for better a disentanglement for different semantics in practice?
