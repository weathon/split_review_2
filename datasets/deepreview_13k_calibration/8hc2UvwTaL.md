## Abstract
Preserving individual privacy while enabling collaborative data sharing is crucial for organizations. Synthetic data generation is one solution, producing artificial data that mirrors the statistical properties of private data. While numerous techniques have been devised under
    differential privacy, they predominantly assume data is centralized. However, data is often distributed across multiple clients in a federated manner.
    In this work, we initiate the study of federated synthetic tabular data generation. Building upon a SOTA central method known as AIM, we present \textit{DistAIM} and \textit{FLAIM}. We first show that it is straightforward to distribute AIM, extending a recent approach based on secure multi-party computation which necessitates additional overhead, making it less suited to federated scenarios. We then demonstrate that naively federating AIM can lead to substantial degradation in utility under the presence of heterogeneity. To mitigate both issues, we propose an augmented FLAIM approach that maintains a private proxy of heterogeneity. We simulate our methods across a range of benchmark datasets under different degrees of heterogeneity and show we can improve utility while reducing overhead.

### Summary
This paper considers the problem of federated differentially private (DP) synthetic data generation (SDG). They start from the state of the art method AIM for DP SDG in the central model and consider multiple ways of distributing it. Firstly they consider a version of it implemented in secure multi-party computation (SMC), though they allow only a fraction of the data holders to be present at each step, introducing some extra error compared to using AIM. They then try to remove most of the heavy SMC by switching to a method based on federated learning, which introduces some more error from heterogeneity in the dataset. They then largely mitigate this new error using a private estimate of the heterogeneity to improve client choices.

They also provide an experimental section that shows that they do indeed get accuracy improvements from the parts of the algorithm designed to improve accuracy on various datasets.

### Strengths
The paper is clear and well written.
The results all seem reasonable and correct.
The privacy guarantees are rigorous.

### Weaknesses
The biggest question mark here is whether DP-SDG isgoing to be the practical answer in any situation, though this seems worth exploring anyway.



### Questions
Is the utility of the generated data actually good enough to make this a practical solution for any application?

### Summary
This paper proposes a Federated Learning-based synthetic data generation method called FLAIM, a variation of the AIM algorithm, where data is distributed across multiple clients. The objective is to maintain individual privacy while collaboratively facilitating data sharing. FLAIM modifies AIM to handle heterogeneity and reduces overhead compared to traditional Secure Multi-party Computation (SMC) techniques. The proposed approach is evaluated on benchmark datasets and compared to other state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating improved utility while reducing overhead. This paper offers valuable insights into the challenges and solutions related to SDGs in a federated setting. The FLAIM algorithm proposed in the paper shows the potential to create effective synthetic data while maintaining privacy. The empirical study emphasizes the significance of considering heterogeneity in Federated Learning and the trade-offs between privacy and utility performance.

### Strengths
1) This paper suggests a new method for generating synthetic data in a Federated Learning setting while addressing the challenges of heterogeneity in federated settings.

2) After conducting a comprehensive assessment of the FLAIM technique on standard datasets, the authors compared its performance with other cutting-edge techniques. The results showed that the FLAIM method offers better efficiency with reduced overhead.

### Weaknesses
1) It remains a challenge to determine whether the FLAIM method would retain its efficiency when applied to real-world datasets that display more intricate structures and distributions, as its performance has been evaluated solely on benchmark datasets.

2) Although the paper compares the FLAIM method to other advanced methods, it does not give a complete comparison to all the related methods in the literature.

### Summary
This paper studies differentially private data synthesis in the horizontal federated learning setting. The authors identify the key challenge of this problem is the data heterogeneity. In this paper, the authors propose two variants of the central AIM algorithm, DistAIM and FLAIM. Compared with DistAIM, the FLAIM is expected to rely on a more light-weight secure aggregation algorithm. The authors show the proposed algorithm can outperform the naive implementation of AIM in a federated learning setting.

### Strengths
1. The authors identify the challenges in differentially private data synthesis with heterogeneous local data in the federated learning setting.
2. The authors propose two different algorithms for solving the challenge of differentially private data synthesis with heterogeneous data.
3. The proposed FLAIM solution on how to handle the heterogeneity in marginal selection is novel.

### Weaknesses
 * Some key elements of the algorithm are not clearly motivated or explained, leaving the effectiveness of the algorithm unjustified.
* Although it is acceptable that the DP data synthesis paper cannot provide a theoretical guarantee, some counter-intuitive phenomena in the experiments are not clearly explained.
* The writing needs to be improved.
  - Speaking at the paper structure level, while the core idea of the paper should be relatively straightforward, the paper's organization may introduce extra difficulties for readers to catch those ideas. Especially while the DistAIM and the proposed FLAIM are in the same section, it is not clear whether DistAIM is used as a motivation for FLAIM or serves as other purposes. 
  - As for the notation level, the paper user both $u(q; D)$ and $u(D; q)$ for the EM utility score. In the algorithm, $\sigma_i$ (in line 14) may not be clearly defined (not sure whether it is used with $\sigma_t$ interchangeably).


### Questions
1. Why does the local client still need to "estimate the new local model via PGM"? This step looks strange because the local models are not aggregated globally, but it may affect the query selection and measurement in the following local rounds, making it unclear what local measurement error will be aggregated to the server.
2. What is the $\tilde{N}$ and $\sigma_i$ in line 14 of Algorithm 1?
3. Is there any theoretical performance guarantee for the algorithm?
4. Why is secure aggregation not applicable to the DistAIM?
5. What assumption of trust between participants and compute servers is relaxed when switching from DistAIM to FLAIM? How much overhead is reduced because of cryptographic protocol changes? 
6. Why does AugFlaim (non-private) have worse performance than AugFlaim (private)? Does it mean too accurate heterogeneity information hurts the algorithm's performance? 
7. Why there is no AugFlaim (non-private) results in Figure 2f?
