## Abstract
Zero-shot inference is a powerful paradigm that enables the use of large pretrained models for downstream classification tasks without further training. However, these models are vulnerable to inherited biases that can impact their performance. The traditional solution is fine-tuning, but this undermines the key advantage of pretrained models, which is their ability to be used out-of-the-box. We propose RoboShot, a method that improves the robustness of pretrained model embeddings in a fully zero-shot fashion. First, we use language models (LMs) to obtain useful insights from task descriptions. These insights are embedded and used to remove harmful and boost useful components in embeddings---without any supervision. Theoretically, we provide a simple and tractable model for biases in zero-shot embeddings and give a result characterizing under what conditions our approach can boost performance. Empirically, we evaluate RoboShot on nine image and NLP classification tasks and show an average improvement of 15.98% over several zero-shot baselines. Additionally, we demonstrate that RoboShot is compatible with a variety of pretrained and language models and propose a way to further boost performance with a zero-shot adaptation variant.

### Summary
The authors propose ROBOSHOT, a method for improving the robustness of pretrained models in zero-shot settings. It uses language models to obtain insights from task descriptions and uses these insights to remove harmful components and boost useful ones in model embeddings without any supervision.

The method is evaluated on nine image and NLP classification tasks and shows an average improvement of 15.98% over several zero-shot baselines. It is compatible with various pretrained and large language models and can further boost performance with a zero-shot label-free adaptation variant where there are a large number of unlabeled examples.

### Strengths
- The proposed ROBOSHOT method is an interesting novel approach that improves the robustness of zero-shot models against harmful concepts without the manual identification of harmful concepts. It leverages insights obtained from large language models to refine embeddings, and address inherited biases.  I also find the theoretical arguments interesting  which characterizes the conditions under which ROBOSHOT can outperform existing methods in zero shot learning.

- The  paper presents a well-structured and rigorous experimental evaluation across various datasets and model architectures.

- The paper is written in a clear and accessible manner, I like the detailed explanations of the ROBOSHOT algorithm, the theoretical framework, and the evaluation methodology.

- ROBOSHOT consistently outperforms several zero-shot baselines on multiple datasets. Having a powerful zero-shot learning method can address many real-life image classification tasks where labels are hard to come by.

### Weaknesses
 - No large scale datasets like imagenet

- The benchmarks are limited to zero shot classification which is an easy task compared to zero-shot semantic segmentation and instance segmentation where this method could struggle.

- I don't see this work as actual zero shot because the pretrained model has so much information about the classes present in the chosen datasets. This work would be more impactful if the experiments were conducted on rare classes to test whether this method generalizes well.  ChatGPT has been trained on the internet, so this work is far from zero shot learning unless we include classes that are least likely to be seen by ChatGPT.

5: You are absolutely certain about your assessment. You are very familiar with the related work and checked the math/other details carefully.

### Summary
The paper proposes to improve zeroshot performance of various foundation models by trying to segregate the representations into 3 set of orthonormal basis— harmful,helpful and benign vectors. Using a language model, the authors try to identify the set of harmful and helpful basis, and then try to remove/boost those basis accordingly. Overall, the problem is well motivated and gives good results. The method section however needs some efforts in writing to clarify some of the intricacies of the proposed approach.

### Strengths
- The overall motivation and idea of the paper is quite novel with interesting applications across various foundational models like CLIP and LLM.
- The empirical results also are quite strong.

### Weaknesses
 - $X_{proj}$ has not been defined in LFA section.
- The authors should clarify how the basis vectors ($z$) are identified in the experiments, as the decomposition of insight vectors is based on that.
- I understand that the proposed approach is poised to give major gains in class imbalance settings or well known setting with spurious features. However, I encourage the authors to also provide results in standard classification tasks like imagenet using CLIP. I fear that in many standard tasks, removing these spurious features might hurt as well. However, one can always choose to not remove these. 
- Do the authors have any insights or ablations as to how many insight vectors ($m$) is needed. I couldn’t see those details.

### Summary
The work tackles a very interesting and impactful topic, namely the improvement of zero-shot models without any additional labelled data, training or manual intervention. This goal is accomplished by leveraging existing pretrained Language Models (LMs) to infer positive and negative insigths from the task description, using their embeddings to obtain helpful, harmful and neutral subspaces and finally editing the representations to remove the harmful components while boosting the helpful ones. The paper then presents a theoretical analysis to characterize the conditions under which the framework allows correcting a wrong prediction. Finally, the framework is evaluated in a wide set of experiments, showcasing its benefits on worst-group accuracy when plugged on top of a varied set of baselines.

### Strengths
### Originality

- The paper proposes novel methodology to improve the robustness of zero-shot models such as CLIP without fine-tuning or using extra data.

### Quality

- The simplicity of the debiasing techniques makes it a cheap solution that can be easily employed by any practitioner.
- Accepting the assumptions, the theoretical analysis makes intuitive sense.

### Clarity

- The paper makes for a pleasing read: it is well written, easy to read and mostly clear.
- The framework is clearly explained in detail with a straightforward formalization and algorithmic outline, making it easy to reproduce. Source code is also provided.

### Significance

- The method is employed on a varied set of baselines (CLIP ViT-B-32, CLIP ViT-L-14, ALIGN, AltCLIP for zero-shot image classification and BERT and ADA for zero-shot text classification) assessing its general applicability
- The experimental evidence covers multiple datasets, namely Waterbirds, CelebA, PACS, VLCS and CXR14 for zs image classification and CivilComments, HateXplain, Amazon and Gender Bias for zs text classification. The datasets cover different domains.

### Weaknesses
 - The assumption of concept embeddings being orthonormal doesn’t seem well motivated; do we expect the concept embedding of ‘waterbird’ to be orthogonal to ‘water’? I find the experiment in Appendix F.5 to be inconclusive due to the simplicity of the considered concepts, and I can’t immediately understand why the average of the images having a higher cosine similarity should give any insight on the decomposition of the space in harmful, helpful and neutral subspaces.
    - Unfortunately, the overall motivation and analysis seems to lay on this assumption, making it a core criticity of the work.
- The 15.98% improvement claim in the abstract actually regards the increase in Worst Group accuracy and not the overall improvement which is probably not positive, I find it should be stated clearly to avoid misleading the reader.
- The qualitative assessment does not really immediately convey the effect of increasing $u^k$. Some quantitative metrics would help, e.g. class separability measure such as the ratio of the inter-class distance to the average intra-class distance $\frac{d_{\text{inter}}}{\frac{1}{2} (d_{\text{intra}{C_1}} + d{\text{intra}_{C_2}})}$
- From the presentation perspective, the captions could be improved. Figure 1 could use a textual description to clarify what’s going on in the image, e.g. how does it go from having two projected embeddings and a single one in the right part.  Analogously, the caption of Figure 2 doesn’t state what are $Y_0$ and $Y_1$
- The framework fails in several cases to maintain the average accuracy of the baseline, being therefore only advisable when worst group accuracy is the metric of interest. Is this realistic? It would be nice to have a method that fell back to the standard setting when the approach proves to be detrimental.

### Questions
Table 1

- why does the model perform so much worse on Waterbirds except that for CLIP-B?

Figure 2

- what are Y_0 and Y_1? I guess they are some sort of class prototypes, but where are they defined?

### Summary
This paper proposed a zero-shot method to improve the robustness of pre-trained model embeddings. The key idea is to leverage insights obtained from language models based on task descriptions. After extracting the insights, they use the insights to modify the image embeddings, removing harmful components and enhancing useful ones, without any supervision. To achieve this goal, the method encourages invariant representation (to spurious features) by projecting the pre-trained model embeddings onto the subspace orthogonal to the subspace spanned by spurious feature descriptions. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed method improves multi-modal and language model zero-shot performance.

### Strengths
- **Novel and useful setting:** The setting of improving the robustness of pretrained model embeddings with task description is novel. RoboShot offers a unique approach that preserves the out-of-the-box usability of pretrained models, which is a key advantage.

- **Extensive experiments and analyses:** The authors demonstrated the efficacy of the proposed method and setting with extensive experiments and analyses, in terms of both datasets and settings.

- The paper is well-written.

### Weaknesses
The robustification relies on the insights provided by language models. However, if the language model does not identify the potential failure cases of the model, the method cannot remedy it. For instance, if the LM does not propose background as a spurious feature, can the method still mitigate such spurious correlation? This dependence on language model insights introduces a critical vulnerability: the method's effectiveness is directly tied to the language model's ability to anticipate failure modes, which is not guaranteed. If the language model fails to identify a crucial spurious correlation, such as texture or lighting conditions, the proposed method will be unable to address it, potentially leaving the model vulnerable to these biases. This limitation is particularly concerning in complex real-world scenarios where spurious correlations can be subtle and difficult to articulate.
