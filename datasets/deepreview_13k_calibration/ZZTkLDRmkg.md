## Abstract
Elliptic partial differential equations (PDEs)  are a major class of time-independent PDEs that play a key role in many scientific and engineering domains such as fluid dynamics, plasma physics, and solid mechanics. Recently, neural operators have emerged as a promising technique to solve elliptic PDEs more efficiently by directly mapping the input to solutions. However, existing networks typically cannot handle complex
geometries and inhomogeneous boundary values  present in the real world. Here we introduce \underline{\textbf{B}}oundary-\underline{\textbf{E}}mbedded \underline{\textbf{N}}eural \underline{\textbf{O}}perators (\proj), a novel neural operator architecture that embeds the complex geometries and inhomogeneous boundary values into the solving of elliptic PDEs. Inspired by classical Green's function, \proj consists of two branches of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for interior source term and boundary values, respectively. Furthermore, a Transformer encoder maps the global boundary geometry into a latent vector which influences each message passing layer of the GNNs. We test our model extensively in elliptic PDEs with various boundary conditions. We show that all existing baseline methods fail to learn the solution operator. In contrast, our model, endowed with boundary-embedded architecture, outperforms state-of-the-art neural operators and strong baselines by an average of 60.96\%.git}}.

### Summary
The paper presents a modified neural operator for solving elliptic PDEs where in the boundary conditions are independently encoded as part of the architecture. The basic idea relies on constructing two GNN based operators for the interior source and the boundary values respectively and further encoding the boundary geometry using a Transformer. The approach is tested on a dataset of geometries with homogenous and inhomogenous boundary conditions.

### Strengths
1. Overall the paper is well written and the details are clear and concise.

2. The method appears to generalize to a variety of boundary conditions that competing methods have trouble solving.

3, The experimental and ablation results are exhaustive and show the effect of each design choice.

### Weaknesses
1. The grid sizes for the domain are quite small (32x32, 64x64) when compared with FNO. I would like to see if the approach generalizes to larger and more practical grid sizes as well. This is especially important given the sequence length constraints that come with using transformers.

2. It would also be useful to get some additional information about training and inference times for BENO and baselines.

### Summary
The existing models for operator learning have struggled to handle complex domains and boundary conditions effectively. To address this challenge, this paper introduces the Boundary-Embedded Neural Operators (BENO) model. BENO focuses on elliptic partial differential equations (PDEs) and employs separate graph neural networks for learning the source term inside the domain and the boundary values at the boundaries. It leverages message passing and transformers to learn the solution operator. Experimental results demonstrate that BENO offers more accurate predictions for areas with diverse boundaries compared to existing models.

### Post-rebuttal
I apologize for the delay in my response. Thank you for addressing most of my inquiries and concerns despite the limited time. I appreciate the swift inclusion of various experiments, which has alleviated my concerns. I hope that my questions and suggestions contribute to making the paper even better.

However, I still have reservations about the generalization of this method. As observed in the current experiments, the domain handled is limited to rectangles with cut corners. I remain skeptical about its applicability to smoother circles or more complex domains, as I originally inquired. Instead of conducting experiments on similar domains, it would be beneficial to showcase its performance on entirely different shapes and more intricate domains. Although the authors mentioned this as future work in their response, it seems that further exploration in this direction is warranted. 

Therefore, based on my personal opinion, I will revise my score to a maximum of 5 points. I greatly appreciate your kind and diligent responses to my review.

### Strengths
The issue raised in the paper, where existing neural operator models struggle to handle complex domains and challenging boundary conditions, is indeed a significant problem that needs to be addressed. Many existing neural operator models often disregard PDEs and neglect boundary conditions when working with data. Furthermore, the problem posed in the paper is crucial in this field since operator learning is typically performed in straightforward domains. Moreover, the idea of using triangulation to locally partition complex domains is a promising approach to tackling these challenges.

### Weaknesses
However, the paper's focus on elliptic PDEs seems somewhat restrictive, especially considering that it primarily deals with the simplest case of the Poisson equation with Dirichlet boundary conditions. This might give the impression that the novelty of the paper is somewhat limited.

For example, can the proposed BENO method be applied to Poisson equations with Neumann boundary conditions or mixed Robin boundary conditions? The current model design appears to be tailored to the Dirichlet boundary conditions, which might be considered quite restrictive. To truly highlight the advantages of this approach, it would be beneficial to demonstrate its applicability to a wider range of PDEs, including parametric PDEs such as convection-diffusion equations or nonlinear Burgers' equations. Moreover, exploring its applicability to time-dependent parabolic PDEs could lead to a more generalized operator learning model.

In this context, the paper experimentally investigates a single type of operator, the one between (f, g) and the solution u. However, it's intriguing to consider whether other types of solution operators could also be learned (for instance, as seen in the FNO paper with Darcy flow, where the coefficient could be an input to the operator, or the initial condition of PDE can be an input).

Furthermore, the experiments in complex domains appear to be limited to similar, complex domains, such as the "5 different corner elliptic dataset." It would be interesting to explore whether the BENO method can be extended and applied to different scenarios, such as domains with circular holes in the center of a square or corners at non-right angles (or more simple, circle domain as in (Lotzsch et al., 2022)). By conducting experiments in more diverse domains and presenting results in a variety of scenarios, the paper could better showcase the novelty and versatility of the BENO method.

Therefore, it would be beneficial to generalize the limitations of BENO, as described in this paper. For instance, in terms of boundary conditions, there are relevant discussions in [1], and graph-based methods have addressed complex domains and a variety of equations and boundary conditions, as seen in [2] and [3], which leveraged Finite Element Method (FEM). Referencing these works might provide valuable insights.

Furthermore, there is some curiosity regarding whether the results of the baseline methods were adequately compared. It appears from Appendix F that the internal and boundary grids for the baseline methods are distinguished using one-hot encoding. It's worth considering if this method provides the fairest basis for comparison. As mentioned in the paper, FNO suggests the use of Fourier continuation for different boundary conditions and domains ('Non-uniform and Non-periodic Geometry' part in [4]). Therefore, it raises the question of whether the paper's approach is indeed the best for addressing complex scenarios. Additionally, there is a model for operator learning called DeepONet [5], which can be applied directly to challenging boundary conditions and complex domains. It would be interesting to know whether the paper conducted a comparison with this model.

### Questions
* In the paper, it is mentioned that other methods overfit in challenging boundary conditions, but a more explicit explanation of what this means would be helpful. Are there graphs or figures that can demonstrate this concept?

* It would be beneficial to provide a clearer explanation of what the red and orange parts in Figure 1 represent. What does the red part signify, and what about the orange part? How do they differ?

* Regarding Table 1, as mentioned in the Strengths section, is it impossible for FNO to handle 5.? Is it also impossible for GKN to handle 5.? Is there no prior research in the field of operator learning models that can handle 5.?

* In the Problem Setup (2. Problem Setup), it is not clear whether BENO can be applied to 3D or higher-dimensional domains. While the use of graph neural networks suggests that it might be possible, further explanation would be helpful.

* In the context of 3.1 Motivation, where branch1 is interpreted as the interior and branch2 as the exterior from a Green function perspective, it's important to know whether the output of Branch1 precisely reaches 0 at the boundary and whether the output of Branch2 reaches exactly "g" at the boundary. Is this a process of approximating "g," or is the model capable of obtaining the exact boundary values of "g"?

* In Section 3.2, a more detailed explanation of the definition of $\mathcal{E}_{kn}$ would be appreciated. Furthermore, the part around this section involving attributes is somewhat challenging to comprehend in written form. It might be a good idea to exclude this part if it ultimately relates to the explanation in Section 3.3.2.

* Are dx, dy, and dc in Section 3.3.1 uniquely determined for each node? Also, why is dc necessary?

* On page 5, is "B" ultimately equal to "B^1"? It would be beneficial to provide a more detailed explanation of where "t" changes and what its range is.

* The definition of MAE for Table 2 is present in the appendix but not in the main text.

* In Section 4.3.2, the explanation of training at 32x32 and testing at 64x64, is this capability attributed to BENO's use of graph neural networks, or are there other features enabling this super-resolution? A more detailed explanation would be appreciated.

* In Appendix K, when looking at Figure 6, it appears that the results for "Ours" are different from other solution profiles, forming square blocks with discontinuities. What is the reason or cause behind this phenomenon?

### Summary
The paper proposed a novel neural operator for elliptic equations, particularly Poisson equations with Dirichlet boundary conditions in 2D domain, that has better flexibility to the geometry transformation of the problem domain.

The neural operator named BENO has several advantages over previous methods. No previous method can have train/test space grid independence, evaluation at on observed spatial locations, free-form spatial domain for boundary shape, inhomogeneous boundary condition values, at the same time.

### Strengths
**Originality:** The paper has deliberately designed a neural operator for PDE with Dirichlet boundary conditions on free-form geometry domains. 

**Quality:** The paper has extensively benchmarked BENO with many existing NOs, and BENO shows great advantages.

**Clarity:** The paper is well organized and clear presented.

**Significance:** To have NO be able to deal with Dirichlet boundary conditions on domains of complex geometry is very important to the community, which can greatly improve the flexibility of NO and the range of scenario where NO can be useful.

### Weaknesses
The paper only deal with Poisson equations with Dirichlet boundary conditions, which limits the effect on convincing readers that BENO is superior than baselines.

How about more general elliptic equations?

### Summary
The paper presents a method that involves conditioning a Message Passing Neural Network (MPNN) with boundary conditions to predict solutions for the Poisson equation. The approach involves training a model to learn the representation of input boundary conditions using a Transformer encoder. Subsequently, this representation is integrated into two message-passing neural networks, which work together to predict the solution. The model can condition the networks with boundaries of different shapes and values.

### Strengths
- The paper tackles the interesting problem of conditioning neural networks with varying boundary conditions and offers a reasonable solution for encoding both the boundary condition and its shape. 
- The paper is relatively well-written, providing comprehensive details on the model and the experiments. I appreciate the attention to aligning prior information given to different baselines.

### Weaknesses
 - Several modeling choices require further clarification through ablation studies:
  - It remains unclear to what extent the separation of the model into two terms is necessary without further empirical proof. Notably, both Branch 1 and Branch 2 share an identical architecture, differing only in their input, which comprises the forcing term and the boundary condition. Specifically, the justification for having two identical MPNN architectures, differing only in their input (one with zeroed boundary conditions and the other with zeroed forcing terms), is not sufficiently motivated. The paper should provide a more detailed explanation of why this specific decomposition is beneficial, rather than simply stating it is conjectured to capture different influences.
  - As illustrated in Figure 1, it seems that the encoding of boundary conditions is achieved using a shared transformer, while the forcing term employs two distinct MPNNs. Is this particular choice of architecture a necessary one? The use of a Transformer for boundary encoding and MPNNs for the forcing term is not well-justified. The authors should explore using a consistent architecture, such as MPNNs, for both boundary and forcing term encoding to determine if the Transformer is indeed necessary for boundary representation. The rationale behind this architectural asymmetry is not clear and requires further investigation.
- Despite the acknowledged disadvantages of concatenating the boundary conditions alongside the other inputs, it is indeed surprising to see the catastrophic failure of recent advances, such as MP-PDE, as illustrated, especially in Figure 5. The authors have mentioned that the learning rate and the weight decay factor are fixed for all experiments through grid search, but it remains unclear with which model these hyperparameters are searched for. Furthermore, aligning optimization hyperparameters across all architectures may benefit certain models but harm the performance of others, and this aspect should be considered. Therefore, more justification should be issued to prove that other baselines do not work at all to support more concretely the claim of a performance gain. The hyperparameter tuning process needs to be more transparent. It is crucial to specify which model was used for the grid search and to acknowledge that the chosen hyperparameters might not be optimal for all architectures. The authors should also explore architecture-specific hyperparameter tuning to ensure a fair comparison.
- From the visualization, it appears that there are visible artifacts aligned with boundaries. These artifacts may be introduced by including $(dx_i, dy_i)$ in the node embedding. This raises questions about the necessity of incorporating $(dx_i, dy_i)$, as the Transform already appears to serve in learning a representation of the boundary shape. The inclusion of $(dx_i, dy_i)$ in the node embedding seems redundant, given that the Transformer is already tasked with learning boundary shape representations. The paper should investigate the impact of removing these features to determine if they are indeed necessary or if they are contributing to the observed artifacts.

### Questions
- What motivates the use of different implementations for encoding the boundary condition (with Transformer) and the forcing term (with MPNNs)? Even if the goal is to learn a global representation for the boundary condition, couldn't MPNN achieve the same objective?
- How are the 'distances to boundary $(dx_i, dy_i)$' defined? It appears to be more like an offset w.r.t the closest point on the boundary. If there are multiple closest points, how is the choice made?
