## Abstract
\vspace*{-0.2cm}
Teams that have trained large Transformer-based models have reported training instabilities at large scale that did not appear when training with the same hyperparameters at smaller scales.
Although the causes of such instabilities are of scientific interest, the amount of resources required to reproduce them has made investigation difficult.
In this work, we seek ways to reproduce and study training stability and instability at smaller scales.
First, we focus on two sources of training instability described in previous work: the growth of logits in attention layers (Dehghani et al., 2023) and divergence of the output logits from the log probabilities (Chowdhery et al., 2022).
By measuring the relationship between learning rate and loss across scales, we show that these instabilities also appear in small models when training at high learning rates, and that mitigations previously employed at large scales are equally effective in this regime.
This prompts us to investigate the extent to which other known optimizer and model interventions influence the sensitivity of the final loss to changes in the learning rate.
To this end, we study methods such as warm-up, weight decay, and the $\mu$Param (Yang et al., 2022),
and combine techniques to train small models that achieve similar losses across orders of magnitude of learning rate variation.
Finally, to conclude our exploration we study two cases where instabilities can be predicted before they emerge by examining the scaling behavior of model activation and gradient norms.

### Summary
In this work, the authors examine sources of training instabilities in transformer models through a detailed experimental study.
They motivate their study with the fact that instabilities observed in large transformer models are difficult to study and mitigate because of the large computational costs of these runs.
They therefore examine these and show that they can be reproduced in smaller models, which can be trained faster and can be used to design mitigations for the instabilities which will hopefully translate to larger architectures.
In particular, they focus on two instabilities observed in practice, namely the the growth of logits in attention layers, and the divergence of output logits.
They show that increasing the learning rate at training time can reproduce these instabilities for smaller models.
Further, they show that commonly used mitigation approaches, such as qk-layernorm and z-regularisation can help with instabilities induced by large learning rates, and also examine the effect of a range of other optimiser and model interventions to the sensitivity of the training procedure on the learning rate.
A range of ablation studies across learning rates, interventions and model size yield a number of practical insights on training stability.

### Strengths
Overall, I think the experimental work in this paper was well executed and carefully controlled.
The strengths of the paper, in my view, include a number of useful findings and insights, as well as the overall high quality of the ablations and the paper itself:

__Reproducing instabilities on small models:__
The authors successfully reproduce training instabilities on smaller transformers, by increasing the learning rate.
They show that as model size increases (e.g. figure 1 and figure 6), training instabilities occur at smaller learning rates.
Furthermore, the authors show that two existing instabilities that are observed in large transformers (i.e. the growth of logits in attention layers and the divergence of output logits) can be reproduced in smaller models.
This is convincing evidence that the authors' findings on interventions made on smaller models are likely to translate to larger ones, since the mechanism of the instabilities is common across different scales.
In addition, pointing out this relationship is interesting and also potentially useful towards the development of large transformer models, as it provides strong evidence for adjusting the learning rate as a function of model size.


__Verifying the effectiveness of qk-layernorm and z-regularisation:__
The authors showed that using qk-layernorm (figure 1) and/or z-regularisation (figure 2) significantly helps mitigate instabilities, reducing sensitivity to the learning rate across a range of model sizes, and increases the range of stable learning rates.
This suggests that qk-layernorm and z-regularisation are good candidates for mitigating instabilities in small models, and likely also sufficient for mitigating these effects in large transformers as well.


__Extrapolating instabilities:__
The authors demonstrate that the hyperparameter regimes which result in instabilities can be predicted by looking at the maximum attention logits from other runs.
In particular, in figure 6, they show that for a model with no qk-layernorm, both the value of the maximum attention logit as well as the occurrence of an instability can be predicted by extrapolating from smaller runs and different learning rates.

__Overall thoroughness of ablations:__
I found that the ablations performed in this work were very thorough and supported the claims made in the main text very well.
The documentation of the various parameter settings used in the experiments are also clearly documented.

__Motivation and clarity:__
Overall, I also found the paper to be well motivated and clear, and the figures to be insightful and informative.

### Weaknesses
 I did not find significant flaws in the paper, I thought that two possible weakness are the following:

__Absence of concrete rules of thumb:__
One weaker point in the paper is that it does not provide concrete rules of thumb for setting the relevant hyperparameters of transformer models and their training loops.
Specifically, I think that the paper goes a long way reproducing instabilities and performing detailed ablations, but does not provide concrete advice (i.e. general recipes) for hyperparameter settings.
Given the thoroughness of the ablations, this is a relatively minor point.
However, I think that a short discussion of how a practitioner could use the insights in this paper to fix training instabilities and extract better model performance (by utilising smaller scale runs), would be useful.

__Limitation to C4 data:__
To my understanding, all experiments in this work involve the C4 dataset, which is textual.
While it is most likely that the authors' findings generalise to other datasets, it is not fully clear that the scalings shown in this paper would be encountered in other data modalities.
However, I appreciate that performing experiments on additional data modalities would be a large overhead in effort, and the current findings to be convincing enough.

### Questions
- __Figure 1:__
The caption says "LR sensitivity measures the expected deviation from optimal."
What do the authors mean by "optimal" in this context?
Is the meaning of "optimal" coming from the discussion in section 2.2?
Some clarification on this in the main text would be good.

- __Introduction comment:__
"One interesting finding is that scaling depth increases LR sensitivity at a faster rate than scaling width."
One factor at play with this finding may be the fact that in standard initialisation schemes, changing the width of the network affects the initialisation scale of the weights, whereas increasing the depth does not.
As a result, it is reasonable to expect that changing the width does not impact stability as much as depth, because the change in width is somewhat accounted for by the adaptive initialisation.
Can the authors comment on why this occurs?

- __Point on phrasing:__
In section 3.3 the authors write "We now examine whether it is possible to predict the logit growth instability before it occurs."
I think this phrasing is a little ambiguous because it may be interpreted as predicting whether a logit growth instability will occur in an ongoing run, based on the data collected in the current run.
By contrast, to my understanding, the authors are using previous runs with different hyperparameters, to determine whether a particular hyperparameter setting will cause an instability or not.
I think stating this more clearly in the main text would be beneficial.

- __Effect of different optimisers:__
To my understanding, all experiments in this paper use AdamW.
Can the authors comment on whether they expect their findings to extend to other commonly used optimisers?

### Summary
This article studies optimization instabilities observed in the training of large transformer-based models. The central contribution is the reproduction and analysis as small scale of instabilities that were previously observed on large-scale models. This allows to study the stability of those models without needing the large computing power required for large-scale training.

Two central kind of instabilities are studied by the authors: the growth of logic in attention layers, and the divergence of output logits of the model. In both cases, it is experimentally shown that those instability can be reproduced on small models when using a large learning rate, and that the mitigation techniques that were developed for large models are equally effective in this context. The core tool used for this analysis is introduced to be the measure of the sensibility of the model performance to the learning rate used for the optimization, and the experimental results show that those mitigations tend to reduce that sensibility, stabilizing the training.

The authors finally extend their analysis to study the impact of several other interventions that have been proposed, such as the parameterization of the trainable weights, the integration of weight decay in the optimizer, the scaling of the model size and the use of warm-up periods.

### Strengths
This is an extensive and detailed experimental study of the stability of transformer models with regard to the training learning rate and the various mitigation methods that have been considered.

The experimental setup is described with abundance of details, the conducted experiments are well motivated and presented, and the analysis tools (as the LR sensibility) allows a synthetic and clear summary of the impact of the parameters & methods evaluated.

I believe this article has the potential to provide a wealth of useful information and heuristics for practitioners working with such models.

### Weaknesses
While I am not extremely familiar with the large-transformer-models community, I am under the impression that the pool of persons effectively concerned by this work is very small. As the authors note, training such large models is very computationally expensive, and currently only very few groups have the means to train such models.

As a result, I wonder if this subject might be in practice rather niche, in terms of how much of the community could actually use it. This concern is further amplified by the fact that the paper focuses on reproducing instabilities observed in large models on smaller scale models, which raises questions about the ecological validity of the findings. Specifically, it's unclear if the instabilities observed in small models are truly representative of the complex dynamics at play in large-scale training, or if they are merely artifacts of the reduced model size and computational scale. The paper does not provide a thorough analysis of the correlation between the instabilities observed in small and large models, which is a crucial point for the practical relevance of the proposed methodology.

### Questions
I don't have more questions.

### Summary
An experimental paper. The authors' main point seems to be about the attention and output logits in transformer yielding instabilities. This may be a valid point, although it is not very how to mitigate this problem, and it is hard to be completely convinced that this is *the* reason for instability of large transformers. That being said, some of the experiments are valuable and help us a little bit to understand some issues that may arise in the training of transformers. There is an emphasis on considering the learning rate size. 

The suggested experimental evidence supporting this claim is "val loss vs learning rate" curves. However, (1) there is no surprise in training divergence when lr becomes too large, and (2) I do not see any experimental evidence that divergence is indeed caused by the considered instabilities and not by something else.

The paper also studies how "learning rate sensitivity" is affected by certain design choices. Learning rate sensitivity is defined as the average of "excess val loss" over learning rate range. However, the choice of particularly this metric does not seem well-motivated. Do authors use uniform distribution over lr? If yes, why not uniform over log(lr)? Why not simply use maximal stable lr?

One insight which seems useful is that default eps=1e-8 in AdamW might appear too large and cause updates to vanish.

### Strengths
Understanding stability of transformer training is an important problem. The hypothesis that instabilities may be related to attention logits is not without interest. The numerical experiments seem to be very carefully made, and overall they bring some value. I thank the authors for the clarifications.

### Weaknesses
The structure of the paper is a little weird (the conclusion is very short and contains no useful information, the discussion of existing results is just put at the end without much being done from it, the main points seem to be made in the figures. ). The way the logits in the attention mechanism pose problem is not made super clear or intuitive (obviously, it's a little hard to prove something, but at least some intuition would be appreciated). For instance, we learn that high enough learning rate will pose problem at some point, but that's the kind of things that is not surprising. Does this validate the whole hypothesis?
Note: the concerns have been addressed.

### Questions
Are we really sure that the reason for large transformers not training well is logit divergence? What are other possible problems? What do we learn in the end from your analysis? Is it clear that such problems don't arise in other architectures?

4: You are confident in your assessment, but not absolutely certain. It is unlikely, but not impossible, that you did not understand some parts of the submission or that you are unfamiliar with some pieces of related work.

### Summary
The paper studies instabilities of transformers on a smaller scale. Specifically, the authors performs ablation experiments over learning rates of small transformers, and finds that techniques that are known to improve stability for large transformers also improve the stability of small transformers when using high learning rate. Among other things, the authors show 1) that qk normalization enables higher LR, 2) that the z-loss enables higher LR 3) LR warmup makes the model less LR sensitive, 4) Independently parametrizing WD and LR makes the model less LR sensitive, 5) model LR sensitivity grows faster with depth than width.

### Strengths
Large scale transformers are expensive, important and suffer from instabilities. Providing a small-scale proxy model is impactful.

The paper is well written and the experiments are cleanly described. 

The observations on independent weight decay and the scaling of the gradient RMS are relatively novel.

### Weaknesses
A significant part of the paper is dedicated to replicating observations made in large transformers to small transformers. The utility of this is a little unclear. While it demonstrates that a small model with high LR could serve as a proxy for a larger model, it doesn’t demonstrate any new insights regarding large models. It would be more impactful if the authors would make previously unknown observations at a small scale, and then show that they hold at a larger scale.

Section 3.3 reads a little anecdotal to me. A more systematic study would be better.

### Questions
Should LR sensitivity be normalized somehow? The optimal loss scales with model size, so the delta in eval loss between models of different scales are not really comparable.

Will the code be open sourced?
