## Abstract
Semantic identifier (ID) is an important concept in information retrieval that aims to preserve the semantics of objects such as documents and items inside their IDs. 
Previous studies typically adopt a two-stage pipeline to learn semantic IDs by first procuring embeddings using off-the-shelf text encoders and then deriving IDs based on the embeddings.
However, each step introduces potential information loss, and there is usually an inherent mismatch between the distribution of embeddings within the latent space produced by text encoders and the anticipated distribution required for semantic indexing.
It is non-trivial to design a method that can learn the document’s semantic representations and its hierarchical structure simultaneously, given that semantic IDs are discrete and sequentially structured, and the semantic supervision is deficient.
In this paper, we introduce \Ours, a self-supervised framework to learn semantic IDs with a generative language model.
We tackle the challenge of sequential discrete ID by introducing a semantic indexer capable of generating neural sequential discrete representations with progressive training and contrastive learning.
In response to the semantic supervision deficiency, we propose to train the model with a self-supervised document reconstruction objective.
We show the high quality of the learned IDs and demonstrate their effectiveness on three tasks including recommendation, product search, and document retrieval on five datasets from various domains.

### Summary
This paper formulates the problem of learning semantic IDs by simultaneously capturing the document's semantic representations and its hierarchical structure. It introduces an innovative self-supervised approach designed to acquire semantic IDs directly from the input document using a generative language model. Experimental results on five datasets from various domains demonstrate that the proposed method consistently outperforms competitive baselines by a significant margin.

### Strengths
1. This paper presents the "LMINDEXER" approach as a solution to the challenges inherent in generating semantic IDs from textual data. The approach is carefully crafted to capture both the semantic representations and hierarchical structure of documents simultaneously.

2. The paper demonstrates the effectiveness of the LMINDEXER approach through empirical evidence gathered from experiments on three distinct downstream tasks, utilizing data from diverse domains.

3. The paper exhibits a well-organized structure and offers an easily digestible reading experience.

### Weaknesses
1. While this paper presents an approach termed LMINDEXER, it's important to note that the novelty of the method is somewhat limited. Additionally, the paper lacks a comprehensive discussion of related work, including notable prior efforts that have explored the use of encoders for text encoding and decoders for reconstruction in the context of information retrieval. Several works, such as [1], [2], and [3], have examined similar techniques and deserve acknowledgment for their contributions to the field.

2. In the context of document retrieval, it would be beneficial to broaden the comparison to include more generative retrieval baselines. For instance, evaluating how the LMINDEXER approach compares to FM-index-based SEAL or other recent generative retrieval methods would provide a more comprehensive understanding of its performance. Focusing solely on comparisons with DSI, which may be considered a relatively weaker baseline, might not offer a complete picture of the method's capabilities.

3. While the proposed self-supervised approach has the potential to address the "new document problem" by automatically acquiring semantic IDs, it would be valuable to see experimental results that explicitly address this issue. Incorporating experiments that involve adding new documents to the model and assessing its adaptability and performance in such scenarios would provide a more robust evaluation.

4. An important consideration when using automatically generated semantic IDs is the possibility of duplication. It is crucial to include a discussion or explanation of how the LMINDEXER approach handles or mitigates this potential issue. A detailed exploration of the approach's robustness in preventing or addressing duplication would enhance the paper's completeness and practicality.

### Questions
1. The authors should consider expanding their related work section to include the most recent developments in generative Information Retrieval (IR) techniques. Additionally, they should include a comparative analysis of these recent works alongside the proposed LMINDEXER method in the experimental section. This would provide a more comprehensive overview of how LMINDEXER stacks up against the state-of-the-art in generative IR.

2. It is essential for the authors to address the issue of handling new documents within the LMIndexer framework. The paper should discuss how this framework manages the addition of new documents, what mechanisms or strategies are employed, and the performance of the LMIndexer approach in comparison to baseline methods when confronted with this "new document" scenario. This analysis would help assess the adaptability and robustness of the approach.

3. To ensure that distinct semantic IDs are assigned to different documents, the paper should provide detailed explanations and discussions regarding the mechanisms and safeguards in place within the LMIndexer framework. Experimental results or case studies showcasing how the system maintains distinct semantic IDs for various documents would add substantial value to the paper, reinforcing its practicality and effectiveness in preventing semantic ID duplication.

3: You are fairly confident in your assessment. It is possible that you did not understand some parts of the submission or that you are unfamiliar with some pieces of related work. Math/other details were not carefully checked.

### Summary
The authors propose LMIndexer, a self-supervised method to learn the semantic IDs of documents using sequence-to-sequence models. A semantic ID of a document is a sequence of integers that are indexes/row numbers of a codebook embedding matrix. Three loss functions are designed and used to train the sequence-to-sequence model: a reconstruction loss, a contrastive loss, and a commitment loss. The proposed method is evaluated on three downstream tasks: sequential recommendation, product search, and document retrieval. The results show good improvement over some SOTA methods.

### Strengths
-	The proposed method formulates the semantic ID learning problem as a sequence-to-sequence learning method, which is novel according to related work discussed in the paper.
-	Technical challenges are described clearly.
-	SOTA techniques are used in the proposed framework.
-	The experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms some SOTA methods in the three downstream tasks.

### Weaknesses
 - The paper says that the proposed method "learns the document’s discrete semantic embeddings and its hierarchical structure simultaneously". But it is not clear what the authors mean by the hierarchical structure of a document, how the proposed method is guaranteed to learn such a structure, and whether the proposed method actually learns such a structure. 

- The size of the semantic ID (T) is set to less than or equal to 3 in the experiments, which is surprisingly small. Figure 5 shows the performance increases with T. Why not trying bigger T values? Would an ID with length 3 be informative enough?

-   How should the codebook size be determined? It seems that only three sizes are tried in the experiments. How does the size of the codebook affect the performance?	

-  The performance metric used in ID quantitative study, AMI (in Table 1), is not defined or explained. 

-   Not clear what the word clouds picture (Figure 3) is trying to show? The text explaining it is confusing. What do you mean by “two semantic ID prefixes”? Are the two prefixes from the same generated ID or two different IDs? 

-   It would be better if authors provided other performance metrics such as latency for the retrieval in comparison with baselines.

-  The authors mentioned the model could be fine-tuned on downstream tasks such as retrieval or recommendation tasks. Fine-tuning would change the model weights and then the previously generated semantic IDs would be changed as well, which may affect the ground-truth ID used in fine-tuning. Does it cause any problem?

### Summary
Discrete semantic IDs are useful in information retrieval tasks. They are often learned by performing some sort of hierarchical clustering over off-the-shelf item representations which is not ideal as they may not be aligned with the downstream task. This paper presents an approach to learn discrete semantic IDs of items in a self-supervised manner. The proposed approach uses a transformer decoder architecture which encodes the item description and decodes it into semantic IDs which is further coupled with a small transformer model that consumes these semantic IDs, item description and tries to perform MLM task. The paper also describes and suggests ways to circumvent the challenges encountered while learning these semantic IDs.

### Strengths
- The paper is in general well-written and easy to follow
- The approach is novel for learning semantic IDs in information retrieval, and the optimization challenges in such learning problems is highlighted

### Weaknesses
My major concerns with the paper are the weak evaluation and baselines, and overall the training seems to need a lot of bells and whistles to succeed.
- DPR dual encoder is not a strong baseline; DPR is almost 10% behind SOTA dual-encoder approaches on standard benchmarks
- Baselines in section 4.2 are weak since they are using an off-the-shelf text encoder and hence have no knowledge about the task; a very simple baseline that could be tried here is to train a dual-encoder model on this corpus and then cluster the embeddings

### Questions
- The learned semantic ID lengths seem to be very small (1-3), is this because of training instability when scaling to larger ID lengths? Do the other generative baselines also use the same ID lengths?  
- Why not use the full MS-Marco dataset instead of the 1M sampled one?
- How does the performance gets affected when using a more powerful reconstructor? perhaps an ablation on the number of layers in the reconstructor might be helpful here
- Is the contrastive loss $\mathcal{L}_{\text{contrastive}}$ computed over all documents?
