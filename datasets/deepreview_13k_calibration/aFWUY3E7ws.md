## Abstract
With the continuous advancement of neural network methodologies, time series prediction has attracted substantial interest over the past decades. Nonetheless, the interpretability of neural networks is insufficient and the utilization of deep learning techniques for prediction necessitates significant computational expenditures, rendering its application arduous in numerous scenarios. In order to tackle this challenge, an interpretable sparse system identification method which does not require a time-consuming training through back-propagation is proposed in this study. This method integrates advantages from both knowledge-based and data-driven approaches, and constructs dictionary functions by leveraging Fourier basis and taking into account both the long-term trends and the short-term fluctuations behind data. By using the $l_1$ norm for sparse optimization, prediction results can be gained with an explicit sparse expression function and an extremely high accuracy. The performance evaluation of the proposed method is conducted on comprehensive benchmark datasets, including ETT, Exchange, and ILI. Results reveal that our proposed method attains a significant overall improvement of more than 20\% in accordance with the most recent state-of-the-art deep learning methodologies. Additionally, our method demonstrates the efficient training capability on only CPUs. Therefore, this study may shed some light onto the realm of time series reconstruction and prediction.

### Summary
The paper presents  Global-Local Identification and Prediction (GLIP), a new approach for long-term time-series prediction based on sparse system identification. The proposed approach utilizes discrete Fourier transformation in global identification and local prediction and the experiments show significant improvement over the baselines, in particular in long-horizon prediction.

### Strengths
Strengths:
- Novel approach for long-term time-series prediction
- Very promising results showing significant improvement over the state of the art
- The method performs particularly well for longer horizons, with the higher improvement compared to baselines on the longer horizons

### Weaknesses
I found the description of the method very hard to follow with many details either missing or unclear.
- Section 3.1.1:
	* while the section describes a Discrete Fourier Transformation (DFT) on X, it is not clear where in this section the resulting A,f are used.
	* it is not clear what T/T* are or how are they computed? Is \Theta_g includes exactly three items or multiple sin/cos waves? (this question also applied to Section 3.1.2)
	* "from the univariate predictions with the test set" - should probably be the training set?
	* X^*_g is not really used in Eq. (3), different from the text. Also, not clear what order of expressions were considered.
- Section 3.2: it is not clear to me if this is part of the model/training or a description of how to validate the model's performance (e.g., the paper mentioned it is used to "evaluate" or "conduct an assessment")?
- Overall, I think the paper would significantly benefit from a pseudo-code describing training and inference procedures.

One significant weakness is related to interpretability. The paper positions the proposed approach as an interpretable approach (including the title of the paper and in the motivation described in the abstract). However, the paper presents no results on interpretability in the paper and there is only a short description that says that the parameters are "amenable to interpretation". To make strong claims regarding the interpretability of the proposed approach, some results are needed (i.e., what are these parameters, are they weights associated with interpretable features, how many are there, etc). Some example(s) for the interpretability of results would be very useful as well.

Experiments:
- Datasets: the number of datasets used in the paper seems significantly smaller compared to comparable works. For example, in [2] and [3], other datasets such as weather, electricity, and traffic were included.
- Global prediction is presented as an advantage of the proposed approach, but without any baseline, it is very hard to judge whether the results we observe are good (e.g., in Exchange and ILI where the predicted patterns deviate from the ground truth). It would be useful to include some time-series forecasting baseline so that we can get a sense of how well the proposed approach is doing by comparison.
- Reproducibility: missing details as described above (e.g., the construction of \theta_g). In addition, the chosen values for the hyper-parameters (e.g., \alpha, \beta) are not described (as well as the procedure of tuning them).

Literature: the work should probably mention other models that have focused on basis expansion, such as N-BEATS [1].

Minor issues:
- Section 3: " in the testing set for global prediction" -> should be training set?
- page 6: "prediction. we aim" -> "prediction. We aim"

### Summary
The paper proposes a time series forecasting approach based on sparse identification of global, storage, and local basis functions.
In contrast to the recent transformer-based advances, this approach runs on CPU and is computationally highly competitive to other models. It also outperforms other Transformer-based methods by a large margin.

Overall, it integrates knowledge about the challenges in time series forecasting (concretely, incorporating global and local aspects of time series datasets). This is further highlighted by additional design decisions like extracting local basis functions, through a prediction-data weighted input time series to mitigate outliers and data-variations. 
An ablation study stresses the importance of each of the designed components and justifies each aspect of the complex model design (Fig 1).

In my opinion and after reading the method and appendix carefully, I see this as an excellent paper that demonstrates how to obtain state-of-the-art results in an orthogonal way to mainstream Transformer deep-learning approaches recently proposed.

While the overall presentation is complete, well justified, and technically sound, the language seems over complicated at places and could/should be revised. For instance, the sentence 
> "The parameters Ξ, procured through the sparse identification process, exhibit the capacity to signify the intensity of latent cycles and the magnitude of inter-variable influences. By virtue of these parameters, a more profound comprehension of the model can be attained. "

could be rewritten in simpler (and more understandable) English by

> "The parameters Ξ indicate the cycles and magnitudes between variables, which can be used directly to interpret the model."

Similarly, pointing to individual panels in Figure 1 while describing the method would also greatly support the understanding of the method.
The current version describes the process in text and just references the figure as a whole.

### Strengths
* strong state-of-the-art performance across different forecasting benchmarks
* strong computational efficiency (without GPUs)
* extensive ablation study to justify each of the (many) components in the approach

### Weaknesses
 * complex language makes the text more arduous to understand than necessary
* no details on hyperparameter tuning provided in the appendix.

### Questions
* what do the authors mean exactly with "reasonable" in their statement: code is available upon **reasonable** request? Will the source code be published on GitHub? If not, what is the motivation behind not providing the code open source?
* eq 3: how many higher-order polynomials ($X^2$, $X^3$, etc) were integrated in the global features?
* Can the authors please provide a detailed description of how the hyperparameters were obtained? The appendix/SI does not provide any information in this regard. Were they manually set or obtained by random search? What was the training/validation/evaluation split? How long did the hyperparameter tuning process take? How sensitive is the overall model to the choice of parameters? Were one set of hyperparameter set for every dataset or were some identical hyperparameters used across all benchmark datasets? This information is not in the current appendix!

### Summary
The work proposes Global-Local Identification and Prediction (GLIP) for time series forecasting. The proposed method moves away from deep learning (often transformer-based) methods, instead utilising lightweight approaches that can be run on a CPU (system identification and Fourier transformation). This has the further advantage of making training time (mostly) independent of the prediction horizon. In an evaluation over four datasets, GLIP shows improved performance for both MSE and MAE compared to seven other methods.

### Strengths
The proposed method is a strong combination of global prediction (forecasting the entire time series) with local information (rolling batches). As shown in Figure 2, the method is able to weight global/local information when most appropriate. Results compared to baselines in Table 1 are strong across all output lengths and datasets. This is especially impressive given the speed of the method ("seconds to minutes").

### Weaknesses
 **Clarity**  
C1. Inline citations are not in brackets, which sometimes makes the text hard to follow.  
C2. Acronyms are often not defined.  
C3. There are some typos throughout the work.  

**Quality**  
Q1. Percentage improvement is only given for MSE. Additional analysis of percentage improvement for MAE would be helpful (potentially in the appendix).   
Q2. I have a small concern regarding data leakage from the test set. I believe the test batch information is only used for local prediction (constructing the storage basis), but in Figure 1 there is an arrow going from the test batch back into the global prediction (predicted length). Could the authors please verify that there is no data leakage that would affect the global prediction/overall results.

### Questions
1. How are values for $\alpha$ and $\beta$ selected? The work explains the what high/low values mean and when they should be chosen, but how were they determined in practice?   
2. Section 4.1.3 gives a vague measure of "seconds to minutes" for running the experiments. Are the authors able to provide concrete training/inference times for GLIP, and compare this to the same for the baselines?
