## Abstract
Link prediction, a fundamental task on graphs, has proven indispensable in various applications, e.g., friend recommendation, protein analysis, and drug interaction prediction. However, since datasets span a multitude of domains, they could have distinct underlying mechanisms of link formation. Evidence in existing literature underscores the absence of a universally best algorithm suitable for all datasets. In this paper, we endeavor to explore principles of link prediction across diverse datasets from a data-centric perspective. We recognize three fundamental factors critical to link prediction: local structural proximity, global structural proximity, and feature proximity. We then unearth relationships among those factors where (i) global structural proximity only shows effectiveness when local structural proximity is deficient. (ii) The incompatibility can be found between feature and structural proximity. Such incompatibility leads to GNNs for Link Prediction (GNN4LP) consistently underperforming on edges where the feature proximity factor dominates. Inspired by these new insights from a data perspective, we offer practical instruction for GNN4LP model design and guidelines for selecting appropriate benchmark datasets for more comprehensive evaluations.

### Confidence
3: You are fairly confident in your assessment. It is possible that you did not understand some parts of the submission or that you are unfamiliar with some pieces of related work. Math/other details were not carefully checked.

### Summary
This paper studies the reasons why GNNs largely fail to deliver on the task conventionally called "link prediction", which is the task of recovering, rather than "predicting", missing links in a graph, from a data-oriented perspective. It suggests than the task of link recovery depends on three factors, namely the local structral proxmimity of nodes, their global structural proximity, and their feature proximity, and examines how these three factors interrelate. The core finding of the study is that conventional GNNs for link prediction fail when the feature proximity factor becomes dominant. Given these insights, the paper offers advice on how one could select data for selecting benchmark data to evaluation GNNs for link recovery.

### Strengths
Drawing from previous work, the paper suggests and reconfirms the importance of three key factors underlying the task of link recovery and proposes a latent space model that effectively embeds nodes in a D-dimensional space, which is used to analyze the relationships among the proposed data factors, revealing an underlying tension between feature proximity and local structural proximity, in other words, the fact that co-occurrence of both high feature similarity and high local structural similarity rarely happens. This is an interesting empirical finding.

### Weaknesses
The core finding of the paper is the features should also be taken in consideration. This finding has been known to the community, especially when it comes to using embeddings for link recovery. The proposed latent space model looks suspiciously similar to a node embedding used for link recover. As such, it calls for comparison with state-of-the-art works on embeddings for that purpose, which examine pretty much the same issues as this paper. Such a comparison or even discussion of the relationship and underlying novelty is missing.

### Questions
Is the proposed latent space different from a node embedding, and if so, why?

### Summary
This paper explores the principles of link prediction in graphs from a data-centric perspective. It identifies three critical factors for link prediction: local structural proximity, global structural proximity, and feature proximity. The paper reveals relationships among these factors and highlights an incompatibility between feature proximity and local structural proximity. This insight has implications for the performance of Graph Neural Networks for Link Prediction (GNN4LP) models. The study offers practical guidance for model design and benchmark dataset selection in the field of link prediction.

### Strengths
1.  The paper takes a unique data-centric approach to the problem of link prediction, shifting the focus from model design to understanding the underlying data factors. This perspective is essential for providing valuable insights into the link prediction task and guiding future research.
2.  The paper identifies and empirically validates three critical factors for link prediction: local structural proximity, global structural proximity, and feature proximity. This systematic analysis enhances our understanding of what influences link formation in graphs, contributing to a more comprehensive approach to link prediction.
3. The revelation of an incompatibility between feature proximity and local structural proximity in link prediction is a significant finding. It highlights a vulnerability in existing GNN4LP models and suggests that certain links, primarily driven by feature similarity, may be challenging to predict accurately. This insight provides researchers with a new perspective on model limitations and opportunities for improvement.

### Weaknesses
1. The paper introduces a latent space model for link prediction and provides theoretical guarantees for the identified data factors. Nonetheless, why to use such model is still so clear and motivated
2. Instead of hit metric, mrr is also very important for link prediction. It could be better if there is additional analysis on MRR
3. The work somehow shows correlation with the network evolution. Can you add some detailed discussion with the network evolution especially the dynamic case?

### Summary
This is a benchmark paper on link prediction. The authors experiment comprehensively and come to some interesting obervations. In the first part, the authors analyze the data perspective from three heuristics (1)Local structural proximity(LSP) (2)Global structural proximity(GSP) (3) Feature proximity(FP). Two natural questions are studied: how much does each help and whether they have overlappings. Then the authors introduce a latent space model and then theoretically demonstrate that the model reflects the effectiveness of LSP, GSP, and FP factors.  Then, based on the undetstandings of the heuristic groups, the authors provide practical guidelines from model and data perspective.

### Strengths
1. The writing is easy to follow and the paper presentation is clear
2. The overall motivation is clear and the work is comprehensive. Both experiments and analysis look good.

### Weaknesses
I'd thank the authors to elaborate more on my questions below.

1. What is the role of heterophily when calculating Feature proximity? Moreover, could you give an example in homophilic graph that FP and LSP are conflictive or FP and GSP are conflictive. I am asking this because I feel the conflict comes from the different link forming mechanism where FP is just not appropriate.
2. I am not quite sure but I think NeurIPS D&B track and TMLR might be more appropriate venues.

### Summary
The paper analyzes link prediction across diverse datasets from a data-centric perspective. Specifically, it considers that a link can be generated through Local structural proximity (LSP), Global structural proximity (GSP), and Feature proximity (FP). The experiments show discrepancies in the top-ranked edges according to the selected features. The paper suddenly changes to the proposition of a model based on feature proximity, latent node pairwise distance, and some hyperparameters. The paper supports this model claiming that node pairs with a large number of common neighbors tend to have low feature proximity and vice versa, and that this phenomenon is given once the network has been already formed over time. Finally, the paper suggests considering the feature space and structural space by different models and combining them at the end.

### Strengths
The paper shows a very significant result and contribution, that LSP, GSP, and FP should be considered differently when they are used for link prediction. More details about this conclusion are given, and it will be important to clearly define the time in this conclusion. As it is mentioned in the paper, the claim is based on a given network, that has already made several connections among them. 

The proposition of the new theoretical model is interesting but not so novel. I mean, while the combination of LSP, GSP, and FP has been largely considered, the novelty is the inclusion of these characteristics in a different factor (more important to FP when nodes have a large distance and vice versa).

### Weaknesses
Readability. As it is stated in the submission instructions "reviewers are not required to read the appendix". In this case, I did not read the appendix. For this reason, I could understand specific details from the paper. While I understand the main idea, there are details, such as the parameter r that I could not understand. Unfortunately, the paper uses the appendix to explain very important parts of the paper; for example: "Limitation, broader impact, and future works are in Appendix G, H, and I". So, if you can not reduce and contain the paper to 9 pages, I suggest you submit the paper to a journal, instead of a conference. Note, I usually read the appendices of the paper. They usually have important proof and complementary results, but in this case, it is being used as a main part of the paper. 

The details of the theoretical models are not explained in the main paper. There are several details without any type of information, for example, the parameter r. It seems then rather than a parameter, r is a hyperparameter, but no details about this are given in the main paper. I have similar issues with the \beta parameter/hyperparameter, which is described as a feature proximity parameter, but no details about its calculation or suggestion are given. 

I understand the main idea of the theoretical model and its importance in the paper, but this is not used in the experiment section of the main paper.

### Questions
Can you make the paper readable by itself using 9 pages in length?
Thanks for changing the paper.
