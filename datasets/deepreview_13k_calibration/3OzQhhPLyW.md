# Meta-Value Learning: a General Framework for Learning with Learning Awareness

- Decision: Reject
- Avg Score: 5.17

## Abstract
Gradient-based learning in multi-agent systems is difficult because the gradient derives from a first-order model which does not account for the interaction between agents' learning processes.
LOLA \citep{foerster2018learning} accounts for this by differentiating through one step of optimization.
We propose to judge joint policies by their long-term prospects
as measured by the meta-value,
a discounted sum over the returns of future optimization iterates.
We apply a form of $Q$-learning to the meta-game of optimization,
in a way that avoids the need to explicitly represent the continuous action space of policy updates.
The resulting method, MeVa, is consistent and far-sighted.
We analyze the behavior of our method on a toy game
and compare to prior work on repeated matrix games.

### Rating Number

### Confidence
5: You are absolutely certain about your assessment. You are very familiar with the related work and checked the math/other details carefully.

### Summary
I was asked to give a last minute review. I understand the authors will not have a chance to respond, which is not ideal; I hope to mostly bring up points that are touched on by existing reviews.

The authors introduce MeVa, a method which is a consistent and far-sighted method for opponent-shaping. MeVa works by applying Q-learning/DDPG-like method to the meta-game.

### Strengths
Originality:

- Q-Learning-based methods have not been applied to the meta-game in opponent-shaping scenarios.

Quality:

- The experiments are thorough.

Clarity:

- The paper is clearly written

Significance:

- Opponent shaping is becoming increasingly important as more real-world AI systems are deployed

### Weaknesses
1. Scalability: The main weakness of MeVa is its scalability, particularly when learning in environments with more agents. The method may struggle to handle large parameter vectors and complex multi-agent interaction when more agents are involved. This is a significant concern as many real-world MARL problems involve numerous agents, and the computational cost of calculating meta-values could become prohibitive. The paper does not provide a clear analysis of the computational complexity with respect to the number of agents, which makes it difficult to assess the practical applicability of the method in large-scale scenarios.

2. Writing in the methodology section: This section can be improved by using similar notations from previous works, such as LOLA, Meta-PG and Meta-MAPG. It will make it consistency in notation and easy to follow. The current notation makes it difficult to directly compare MeVa with existing methods, hindering the understanding of its novelty and advantages. Specifically, the meta-MDP formulation should be more clearly defined, including the state space, action space, transition function, and reward function, using standard notations from the MARL literature.

3. Algorithm 1 is hard to follow. It would be great to add more explanations. The algorithm lacks a clear description of how the meta-value is updated, and the practical implementation details are not sufficiently explained. For example, the specific optimization techniques used for updating the value function are not mentioned, which makes it difficult to reproduce the results.

### Questions
- Appendix D raises an interesting point; however, I'm surprised it makes a difference for Matching Pennies. Since M-MAML only defines an initialization and from there performs NL, I can't imagine what initializations would allow you to outperform a uniformly-sampled one on average. I would assume there is some symmetry in the meta-game policies (much like there is a symmetry in the underlying game) [NOTE: I am not using symmetry the same way here as the authors do in the paper. I am merely stating that there exists a one-to-one mapping]. I'm curious what initializations M-MAML learns.

### Summary
The paper proposes Meta-Value Learning (MeVa), a general framework for learning with learning opponent awareness in MARL. MeVa uses a meta-value method to account for longer-term behaviours of opponents and does not require policy gradients. It is consistent and far-sighted, avoiding the need to explicitly represent the continuous action space of policy updates. Many evaluations are conducted on various games, including the Logistic Game, Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma, Iterated Matching Pennies, and the Chicken Game, demonstrating MeVa's effectiveness in opponent shaping and cooperation for MARL. The method shows its merit in achieving cooperation where self-interest warrants it, without being exploitable by other self-interested agents.

### Strengths
**Originality:**

MeVa is a novel method based on meta learning for dynamic opponent modelling in MARL. Unlike previous methods, MeVa is consistent, meaning it does not assume its opponent is naive and is aware of its own learning process. MeVa is far-sighted, i.e., it looks more than one step ahead through a discounted sum formulation, which allows it to account for longer-term and higher-order interactions.

**Quality:**

Overall, MeVa is a high-quality method. It extends previous LOLA and other methods with value learning, which is based on value learning and does not require policy gradients anywhere. MeVa can be applied to optimization problems with a single objective.

**Clarity:**

Overall, the writing is good. It introduces comprehensive background and related works, which is easy for readers to follow. 

**Significance:**

MeVa brings new insights into the MARL community, including its consistency on learning the full dynamics of the other agents, far-sightedness, value learning and implicit Q-function.

### Weaknesses
 * **Theoretical Guarantees**: Although the method leverages the concept of looking ahead, given its use of meta-value, I believe there should be some theoretical analysis regarding its convergence and computational complexity, etc. However, I did not find such discussions in the paper. Specifically, the paper lacks a rigorous analysis of how the extrapolated meta-value approximation affects convergence properties. It would be beneficial to see a proof, or at least a discussion, of whether the proposed method converges to a stationary point, or a local optimum, in the meta-game. Furthermore, the computational complexity of calculating the extrapolated meta-value, especially with the use of $U(x)$ approximation, should be analyzed. This is crucial for understanding the scalability of the method to more complex games.
* **Experiments**: The experiments primarily compare against baseline methods that are not specifically designed for meta scenarios. I believe it would be more informative to design experiments comparing with other meta-specific methods beyond M-FOS, such as Meta-PG, meta-MAPG. The current experimental setup does not fully demonstrate the advantages of MeVa over other meta-learning algorithms. It would be beneficial to see comparisons against methods that explicitly model the opponent's learning process, as this is a key aspect of meta-games. Furthermore, the experiments could be improved by including a wider range of meta-game scenarios, beyond the simple matrix games, to better assess the generalizability of the proposed method.
* **Reproducibility**: The source code is not submitted, making reproducibility uncertain.
* **The targeted scenarios are somewhat restrictive**:
    * The scope of the approach seems somewhat limited. As it's currently tailored for two-player zero-sum meta-games, it might be challenging to expand to tasks with more complex state and action spaces. The paper does not provide a clear explanation of how the method would scale to games with larger state and action spaces, or how it would handle continuous action spaces. This limitation should be addressed.
    * The paper assumes that one can observe the strategy parameters of the opponent. This assumption might be difficult to uphold in real-world tasks. The paper does not discuss the implications of this assumption or how the method would perform if the opponent's strategy parameters are not directly observable, or are only partially observable.

### Questions
Q1: In page 3,  authors mentioned that “nevertheless there is always a gap where each player assumes it looks one step further ahead than their opponent”. Could you please explain why there is a gap in LOLA?

Q2: Why is Equation (3) a better surrogate?

### Summary
The paper proposes the MeVa method designed for two-player zero-sum meta-games. By extending the concept and form of "looking ahead" methods, and incorporating a discounted sum over returns, it allows for an extrapolated approximation of the meta-value. Additionally, from a practical standpoint, MeVa employs $U(x)$ to approximate the extrapolated value, which helps avoid the detachment from reality often encountered with bootstrapped value functions. Experimentally, the study analyzes the method's behavior on a toy game and makes comparisons to previous work on repeated matrix games.

### Strengths
* **Novelty**: This work innovatively extends the concept and form of "looking ahead" methods, while introducing a discounted sum over returns. This allows for an extrapolated approximation of the meta-value, sidestepping the need for approximating the gradient of the policy.
* **Presentations**: The paper presents its viewpoints and theoretical discussions in a lucid and straightforward manner, making it easy for readers to grasp its underlying premise and theoretical implications.
* **Experimental Analysis**: The study compares MeVa with methods like LOLA, HOLA, and COLA. In the meta-games, MeVa demonstrates superior performance.
* The paper fairly analyzes the limitations and prospects of the proposed method.

### Weaknesses
 - The paper makes a few statements that are vague and which can be true, but require more specificity. Please see the detailed comments.
- Experimental evaluation seems limited from my point of view, but perhaps this is typical for multi-agent work? The policy spaces are small, and even in these small problems the authors allude to computational concerns for head-to-head results between M-FOS and meta-values. I would also like to see error bars on the performance. Overall, I consider this a weakness, but less so than the first weakness which is the primary factor in my decision.

- Section 1: (Clarity around Proposed improvements to LOLA): You state that your approach is self-consistent and explain that it "does not assume the opponent is naive and that it is aware of its own learning as well". I find this point unclear and/or redundant.

  In my understanding, the first claim is that the policy convergence of your algorithm does not depend on the opponent following a particular algorithm (specifically, an algorithm that is not learning aware). This is interesting, but can be stated more clearly.

  I think the second claim is that your algorithm is aware of its own learning process. But this is also true of LOLA to a first-order approximation, correct?.

  The second contribution states that other approaches to estimating the meta-value using extrapolation using naive learning. Again, the framing around naive vs non-naive learning is confusing and it may help to state explicitly what this means earlier than section 2.1 if it is a focal point of section 1.

- Section 1 (Clarity around Extrapolation): You refer to the term "extrapolation" but do not define it and I do not think it is common terminology. I assume extrapolation refers to the policy being followed in the bootstrapping step, but I am not sure.


- Section 2.2: You introduce LOLA and a few variants before introducing the proposed algorithm. There seems to be more than a few connections between those previous approaches and the meta-value function approach, and I think the paper would benefit from circling back and relating the proposed algorithm to previous work. The results section, for example, only shows the performance benefit of the proposed approach without a clear demonstration of why or how the extended predictions provided by the value function are beneficial.

- Section 2.3 (M-FOS Description): Contrasting the description of M-FOS here with the earlier one, I do not see how M-FOS can be simultaneously "solving the inconsistency" and "not learning, but acting with learning awareness". If the value function does solve the inconsistency then learning an arbitrary meta-policy from this value function should be seen as "learning with learning awareness" rather than merely acting.

- Section 3 (In place of implicit gradients) At the end of section 3 you remark that once the meta-value function is trained, you can substitute the gradient of the approximation with the implicit gradient of the real meta-value funciton. What is not obvious to me is where the gradient of the implicit meta-value function was used i nthe first place.


- Section 4.1 "This variant is more strongly grounded in the game and helps avoid the detachment from reality that plagues bootstrapped value functions"
  Related to my last point, I do not see the proposed advantage. I do not know what it means for something to be more grounded in a game, nor how this reformulation achieves that.

- Section 4.3 (Exploration): I understand that there is a balance between too much noise for learning and too little noise for exploration. The proposed approach, flipping the sign of the final layer, and the accompanying explanation does not make sense to me. Of course perturbing the output layer would change the behavior of the inner policy, but this seems like a very crude source of noise in comparison to the conventional approach of small gaussian noise added to all parameters.

  I am also confused as to why there are interleaved perturbed and unperturbed rollouts. If the unperturbed rollouts are used to update V, then does that mean the exploration procedure is closer to "exploring starts"

- Section 3 and 4 (Overall): This would all be much clearer if you outlined what exactly is the meta-MDP for the meta-value function. It seems to be not episodic, is that correct?


### Questions
* As previously mentioned, within the MeVa framework, is it possible to analyze the algorithm's convergence properties?
* Please include benchmark experiments for Meta-PG and Meta-MAPG to provide a more comprehensive comparison.
* In two-player zero-sum games, might some baseline methods that compute equilibria also be included in the comparison experiments?

### Summary
This paper proposes an algorithm that allow agents to model learning processes in the extended future with a value function. This generalizes previous work, namely LOLA, which only models the myopic one-step ahead learning dynamics.
It is pointed out that there are previous works, and other generalizations of LOLA, that also learn meta-value functions.
Unlike other attempts at genearlizing LOLA, the claim is that this algorithm is "self-consistent" meaning that "the algorithm does not assume the opponent is naive and it is aware of its own learning process as well".
Results are shown on logistic and matrix games, showing that meta values outperform LOLA uniformly across the 4 environments and that meta-values tend to be competitive with M-FOS.
Unfortunately, head-to-head results between meta-values and M-FOS are not presented due to computational restrictions.

# Decision

While I like several things about this paper and find the proposed algorithm promising, I think the paper has too many issues to warrant acceptance. I am not sure whether these can be adequately addressed in a rebuttal, but I am tentatively rating the paper below the acceptance threshold.

### Strengths
- An overall interesting idea that applies important ideas from meta-learning, single-agent reinforcement learning and multi-agent RL. It is also well motivated by the successes of LOLA and other algorithms that they build on. And the theoretical foundations, while not formally rigorous, are convincing.

### Weaknesses
The biggest worry with the method is the reliance on the REINFORCE algorithm. The sample complexity required in order to perform this method may be incredibly high once scaled to sufficiently difficult action and state spaces. Though the authors make a note of the limit of this method in terms of learning with neural networks and suggest a direction to help scale their method in the future. This is also a general worry about the LOLA-based works. My question is, does the improvements in the paper lead LOLA-based methods closer to scaling to a feasible solution? If so, how?

Another question is how can this method scale beyond two-player multi-agent settings to general multi-agent scenarios. Even an understanding of how this methodology works in three-player games would be quite an interesting topic.

The results appear to show that M-FOS and MeVa are equivalent in performance. I am confused as to what the takeaway here is. Is it that the performance of MeVa is able to do this without the policy gradient? Why not use the policy gradient as those methods are more scalable?

### Questions

# Minor Comments
- Section 2: You should explicitly state that you are studying two-player differentiable games in the first sentence for clarity.

- Section 4.1 (Bellman Equation for U): It would be good to show more details how you arrived at this bellman equation as it was not immediately obvious to me (Expanding V(x + \alpha \nabla V(x)) and substiuting U(x) within the recurison). I also do not see why this would make any difference in learning the value function, as something similar can be done in a single agent RL setting. It is not clear what advantage the correction formulation provides.

### Summary
The paper considers the task of opponent modeling in general sum games. The paper attempts to introduce a LOLA-based method that is able to judge policies over a longer horizon than one-step. The paper introduces a value-based method for a meta-game of optimization. This allows the method to avoid directly modeling the policy space updates for each player. Prior art in LOLA assumes that the opponent is a naive learner and uses a one-step lookahead. The paper implements a self-consistent version of LOLA that relaxes these assumptions. The paper evaluates on small matrix games and a logistic game in order to show how the method may help in scenarios similar to that which LOLA was evaluated in.

### Strengths
Opponent modeling is an important domain of multi-agent learning. There is much potential for opponent modeling iff the community is able to create a scalable method. The idea of any LOLA-based paper is to relax some of the assumptions that restrict its scalability. The paper attempts to make a more scalable method through the use of a value-based method that does not rely on policy updates. However, the evaluation is restricted to simple domains.

### Weaknesses
 * **Variance in Iterates:** My main concern is the variance in iterates of the optimization process. Using a correction-based formulation leads MeVa to estimate $\bar{\nabla} f(x)$ using REINFORCE which is known to have high variance in the policy gradient. Specifically, it is essential that the gradient of the iterates is consistent. It would be helpful if the authors can highlight any practical considerations to mitigate high variance in the gradients. Authors could also provide standard deviations of different trials for Tables 2 and 3 in order to evaluate the effect of noisy gradients (if any).
* **Ablations:** Appendix F provides a range of ablations for design considerations utilized in MeVa. However, an important comparison would be to assess the importance of the meta-value function formulation itself. Authors should compare the surrogate formulation of Eq. 6 with the naive infinitely discounted sum of Eq. 5. Similarly, the choice of a sophisticated exploration strategy, which is Gaussian noise, could be evaluated by comparing it with standard exploration schedules used for TD learning such as $\epsilon$-greedy exploration or action noise. Current ablations only enable/disable exploration which do not reason about the choice of schemes and their importance.
* **Related Work:** The paper cites relevant works from multi-agent learning and opponent awareness literature. However, their organization within the paper could be improved. Authors could organize recent literature in a dedicated related works section or discuss the improvements of MeVa over prior methods (as done for LOLA in Introduction).

### Questions
“We argue that this throws out the baby with the bathwater” Language like this typically is more confusing than helpful. Consider either explaining the metaphor in the context of the paper or removing this line.

### Summary
Recent works in multi-agent learning focus on reasoning about inter-agent interactions. One such algorithm is Learning with Opponent Learning Awareness (LOLA), which looks ahead utilizing gradient descent. The work builds on the LOLA framework by casting the problem as a meta-game of optimization. Meta-Value Learning (MeVa) learns a meta-value function (expected discounted return over future iterates) and applies a form of Q-learning to evade representing the continuous action space. The inner loop corresponds to collecting a policy optimization trajectory using gradient descent on iterates of the meta-value. The outer loop corresponds to learning the meta-value function by minimizing the TD error. MeVa incorporates design considerations such as empirical corrections in Bellman updates, variable discounting and gaussian noise as exploration. Results in a logistic game and repeated matrix games demonstrate improvements over LOLA agents.

### Strengths
* The paper is well-written and positioned within the learning with learning awareness literature.
* Authors have highlighted relevant design considerations and their motivation.

### Weaknesses
* **Variance in Iterates:** My main concern is the variance in iterates of the optimization process. Using a correction-based formulation leads MeVa to estimate $\bar{\nabla} f(x)$ using REINFORCE which is known to have high variance in the policy gradient. Specifically, it is essential that the gradient of the iterates is consistent.

### Questions
* How can the high variance of policy gradients in REINFORCE be tackled? Can you please discuss some practical considerations or the impact of noise on meta-value iterates? Can you please provide standard deviations for head-to-head comparisons in Tables 2 and 3?
* Can you please compare between meta-value function formulations of Eq. 5 and Eq. 6? What is the need for a sophisticated exploration strategy such as Gaussian noise when compared to standard exploration schedules such as $\epsilon$-greedy or action noise?
* Can you please organize the discussion on relevant works in a related works section? Alternatively, can the discussion be moved to a common section discussing the improvements/differences between MeVa and LOLA, HOLA, COLA and other opponent aware algorithms?
