## Abstract
Capitalizing on the intuitive premise that shape characteristics are more robust to perturbations,
we bridge adversarial graph learning with the emerging tools from computational topology, namely, persistent homology representations of graphs.
We introduce the concept of witness complex to adversarial analysis on graphs, which allows us to focus only on the salient shape characteristics of graphs, yielded by the subset of the most essential nodes (i.e., landmarks), with minimal loss of topological information on the whole graph. The remaining nodes are then used as witnesses, governing which higher-order graph substructures are incorporated into the learning process. Armed with the witness mechanism, we design \emph{Witness Graph Topological Layer (WGTL)}, which systematically integrates both local and global topological
graph feature representations, the impact of which is, in turn, automatically controlled by the robust regularized topological loss. Given the attacker's budget, we derive the important stability guarantees of both local and global topology encodings and the associated robust topological loss. We illustrate the versatility and efficiency of WGTL by its integration with five GNNs and three existing non-topological defense mechanisms. Our extensive
experiments across six datasets demonstrate that WGTL boosts the robustness of GNNs across a range of perturbations and against a range of adversarial attacks, leading to relative gains of up to 18\%.

### Summary
Paper proposes to use an approximation to Vietoris Rips complex, the witness complex, with the aim to integrate topological graph features into optimization of GNN, for the purpose of increasing robustness against adversarial attacks. Experiments showing some increase in robustness in several cases are described.

### Strengths
* Persistence diagrams are used to propose a topological defense against adversarial attacks in GNN learning.

* The stability of the proposed pipeline is deduced from the known stability properties of persistence diagrams

### Weaknesses
 * Only one baseline was used for  comparison  in each task. More baseline defense methods involving, in particular, SOTA models, graph attention models and GCN/GNN  with topological regularizers based on standard Vietoris-Rips complexes should be used for comparison. 

* Witness complexes although presenting sometimes some advantages in terms of less number of simplexes , are known to suffer from numerous drawbacks:

   * calculation is known to be heavily dependent on the choice of "landmark" points, bringing the instability. 

   * sensitivity to parameters, the witness complex setup involves the choice of several hyperparameters, such as the number of landmarks or the epsilon in epsilon-net etc

  * computational complexity, the complex is made smaller but the construction of the complex, i.e. the choice of simplices and their witnesses etc,  becomes more computationally expensive

   * lack of functoriality, the relations between results of calculations in different situations are more difficult to establish. 

  The paper mentions some of these concerns, but does not explain really convincingly how to overcome them. 

* In particular, it is not explained how to make the crucial choice  concerning  the number of landmarks for the pipeline to work.

* Also,  it is not clear why the standard vietoris-rips complexes, via  GPU acceleration, could not be used instead, to solve the described defense tasks. 

* The formulations of the theoretical results are not very clearly stated. 

* In the description of the pipelines, in experiment details, in the statements or the proofs of theoretical results, the dimensions of the computed persistence diagrams are not specified. 

* The reported computational complexity of the pipeline is not accurate. For example it does not include the complexity of the geodesic distance on the graph. 


Below are some specific remarks:

page 2 "complementary information" - complementary to what? it is not very clear

page 3 "is asymmetric matrix A" -> a symmetric

page 3 "For unweighted graphs we get" -> For unweighted graphs we set 

page 3 "increasing $\epsilon$ from 1 to" -> increasing $\epsilon$ from 0 to

page 3 "$\mathcal{G}_{\alpha}$, consisting of only paths with length more than $\alpha$"-> only edges with length more than $\alpha$

page 3  with such definition of $\mathcal{G}_{\alpha}$,
 all the inclusions of alpha-indexed subgraphs or complexes in the paper must be reversed :
 for ${\alpha_1}\leq{\alpha_2}$ the inclusion of the corresponding subgraphs goes in the opposite direction. 

page 3 "There are multiple ways to compute simplicial complex"- what is meant by "compute" here? perhaps define or construct ?

page 5 in Component II, what is  $\Theta^{(0)}$ ? 

page 5 in Component II there seems to be a misprint in  $Z^(_{G}0)$

### Summary
The authors propose an adversarial defense strategy for graph neural networks that primarily relies on Persistent Homology (PH) representations of graphs. The key intuition behind the authors' method is to estimate the salient anatomy nodes of graph-structured data, while regarding remaining nodes as witnesses to enhance the robustness of node representations. Building on these concepts, this paper introduces the Witness Graph Topological Layer (WGTL), which takes into account both local and global topological graph features to improve model robustness. The authors validate their method against global and local poisoning attacks on citation graphs using the GCN architecture and demonstrate that their topological layer and regularized topological loss can enhance the robustness of GCN.

### Strengths
- The proposed strategy is intuitive and somewhat straightforward for enhancing robustness on graph neural networks.
- The authors also provide theoretical analysis regarding stability for topology encodings and regularized topological loss against perturbations.
- Overall, the draft is well-written and easy to follow, although there is room for improvement in section organization and figures.
- The improvements in robustness capability appear to be significant when compared to the vanilla GNN.

### Weaknesses
I have major concerns, mostly regarding the experimental evaluation section. I find the current form of the experiments to be lacking in several aspects for the following reasons:
- There is a lack of comparisons with previous non-topological works. While I agree that this work would be the first to utilize persistent homology, previous baseline methods also consider similar information/knowledge, such as neighboring structure or connectivity patterns using other concepts. Simply demonstrating improvements over the vanilla GCN or combining with a single specific baseline may not be entirely convincing. It is crucial to benchmark against methods that explicitly leverage similar structural information, even if they do not use topological concepts directly. For example, methods that use higher-order neighborhood information or those that explicitly model node connectivity patterns should be considered as baselines.
- The entire set of experiments is conducted using GCN. The significant improvement observed in GCN may be attributed to its naive mechanism. Given that the incorporation of a multi-scale receptive field for node representation is already well-explored in the field of graph neural networks, it is highly recommended to conduct experiments on more recent graph neural networks. The current evaluation does not sufficiently demonstrate the generalizability of the proposed method to more sophisticated architectures that already incorporate mechanisms for capturing multi-scale information. It is important to test the method's efficacy on models that have more complex aggregation schemes and potentially different ways of handling neighborhood information, such as Graph Attention Networks or more recent variants of Graph Convolutional Networks.
- Can this method also perform well on heterophilous graphs or molecular graphs? The proposed method has only been validated on homophilous graphs, particularly citation networks. Therefore, it remains uncertain whether this strategy can exhibit versatility when applied to other types of graphs. The evaluation should be extended to datasets with varying degrees of homophily and different graph structures. Molecular graphs, for example, have very different characteristics than citation networks, and it is important to assess the method's performance on such datasets to understand its limitations and potential for broader applicability.

### Questions
Please address the concerns mentioned in the weaknesses section. I also recommend moving the related work section to the beginning. Readers might find it challenging to follow or understand the existing approaches for tackling adversarial attacks on graph neural networks.

### Summary
This work designs Witness Graph Topological Layer (WGTL), which systematically integrates both local and global topological graph feature representations whose impact are in turn automatically controlled by the robust regularized topological loss. Some experiments are conduct to show the effectiveness of the method.

### Strengths
1. The paper is well-written.
2. The idea is supported by a theorectical foundation.
3. The experiments show the improvement against baselines.

### Weaknesses
1. The paper only compared with vanilla GCN. I believe more baselines including some SOTA defense methods should be included. Without this comparison, I lean to a weak reject.
2. The threat model should be moved to the main body of the paper, instead of in the appendix.
