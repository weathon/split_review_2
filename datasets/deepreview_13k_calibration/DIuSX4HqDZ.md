## Abstract
Abductive reasoning is logical reasoning that makes educated guesses to infer the
most likely reasons to explain the observations. However, the abductive logical
reasoning over knowledge graphs (KGs) is underexplored in KG literature. In this
paper, we initially and formally raise the task of abductive logical reasoning over
KGs, which involves inferring the most probable logic hypothesis from the KGs
to explain an observed entity set. Traditional approaches use symbolic methods,
like searching, to tackle the knowledge graph problem. However, the symbolic
methods are unsuitable for this task, because the KGs are naturally incomplete,
and the logical hypotheses can be complex with multiple variables and relations.
To address these issues, we propose a generative approach to create logical expres-
sions based on observations. First, we sample hypothesis-observation pairs from
the KG and use supervised training to train a generative model that generates hy-
potheses from observations. Since supervised learning only minimizes structural
differences between generated and reference hypotheses, higher structural similar-
ity does not guarantee a better explanation for observations. To tackle this issue,
we introduce the Reinforcement Learning from the Knowledge Graph (RLF-KG)
method, which minimizes the differences between observations and conclusions
drawn from the generated hypotheses according to the KG. Experimental results
demonstrate that transformer-based generative models can generate logical expla-
nations robustly and efficiently. Moreover, with the assistance of RLF-KG, the
generated hypothesis can provide better explanations for the observations, and the
method of supervised learning with RLF-KG achieves state-of-the-art results on
abductive knowledge graph reasoning on three widely used KGs.

### Summary
In this paper, a data-driven approach is proposed for learning logic hypothesis based on observations and background knowledge from knowledge graphs. The key idea lies in tokenizing the hypotheses and learning the generative model from observations to hypotheses. Furthermore, reinforcement learning is utilized to allow training under the reward function about whether the observations can indeed be inferred from the learned hypotheses. Experimental results on benchmark datasets verify the effectiveness of the proposed method.

### Strengths
- The paper studies a very meaningful problem: learning logical hypotheses from knowledge graphs.

- The paper proposes some interesting ideas, such as tokenizing of the logical hypotheses, as well as the design of the reward function in reinforcement learning.

- The experimental results show that the proposed method indeed works.

### Weaknesses
 - In my view, the term of abductive  reasoning is incorrectly used. The process of obtaining hypothesis based on observations and background knowledge is called induction. Abductive reasoning further requires to obtain groundings for variables in the hypothesis. 

- The paper misses citation to researches on inductive logic programming (ILP), which is closely related to the problem studied in the paper. An ILP task involves learning logic programs based on logic observations and background knowledge, which is more general than reasoning on knowledge graphs. Furthermore, the term abductive learning has also be proposed before in the ILP area [1]. Related citations should be included and discussed in the paper.

- The experimental results are only quantitative. It would nicer to illustrate some qualitative examples on what kinds of hypotheses can be learned by the proposed method. For example, it would be useful to illustrate whether the proposed approach can learn lengthy hypotheses with significant complexity.

### Questions
- On the bottom of Page 3, it is said that the logic clauses contains only three operations $\cup, \cap, \neg$. Does this mean that the paper only considers a limited subset of first-order logic? (e.g. propositional logic). Even though this would be enough for knowledge graphs, which can only represent relational information, clarifying the scope of learning is still necessary.

### Confidence
2: You are willing to defend your assessment, but it is quite likely that you did not understand the central parts of the submission or that you are unfamiliar with some pieces of related work. Math/other details were not carefully checked.

### Summary
This paper approaches the problem of abductive rule generation by proposing a supervised sequence-to-sequence model which is then fine-tuned via RL.

The goal of the paper is to, given entities, produce logical forms that describe those entities. In particular, the logical hypotheses are executed on a knowledge graph. The resulting entities are compared via Jaccard similarity to the original observations. The hypotheses themselves can be evaluated against ground-truth hypotheses using SMATCH.

The method is evaluated on 3 existing knowledge graphs. The results show that RLF-KG consistently outperforms the supervised baseline in all settings. Additionally, the proposed generation-based approach is much faster at inference than search-based methods, while having similar entity accuracy but better structural similarity to the ground truth logical forms.

### Strengths
The approach proposed for abductive reasoning is reasonable and was demonstrated experimentally to be accurate and fast.
The task and approach seem original, and the writing is relatively clear.
However, I am not certain about its significance.

### Weaknesses
The paper proposes the task of abductive logical reasoning and claims it is under-studied, but I am not convinced the task is important.
This could be improved by linking to applications, or by showing that abductive logical reasoning is a weakness in popular reasoning methods such as those that use large language models.

### Questions
1. I found quite a few typos and grammatical errors, but those did not hamper my understanding of the paper.
2. Can you move the results of the search baseline to the main table, table 3?

### Summary
This paper focuses on abductive reasoning with KGs and proposes a generative approach using supervised training to create logical expressions based on observations.   It further improves explanations by minimizing differences between observations and conclusions.      Experimental results show transformer-based models generate robust and efficient logical explanations, achieving state-of-the-art results on abductive reasoning with KGs.

### Strengths
This article provides an analysis of the difficulties associated with abductive reasoning in knowledge graphs (KGs) and proposes a generation-based approach to address these challenges. The overall structure of the article is well-organized, and the ideas are presented clearly. Additionally, the experimental findings are objective and cover a wide range of aspects.

### Weaknesses
1. This article lacks a clear formalization of the explanation for abductive reasoning. Specifically, while the paper describes generating logical expressions, it does not explicitly define what constitutes a valid or complete explanation within the context of abductive reasoning on KGs. The notion of an 'explanation' needs to be more rigorously defined, including the properties it should satisfy (e.g., minimality, relevance, or logical consistency with the KG).
2. The motivation for using reinforcement learning algorithms is questionable. While the authors mention that supervised training does not guarantee closeness to the observation, the specific limitations of the supervised approach and the necessity of reinforcement learning are not thoroughly justified. It is unclear why a simple fine-tuning approach or other optimization techniques could not achieve similar results. The choice of PPO over other RL methods is also not well-explained, especially given the complexities of applying RL to sequence generation tasks.
3. See Questions.

### Questions
1. Are the Encoder-Decoder and Decoder-only models used in the experimental section both based on the fundamental transformer architecture?    Does the author consider the substitution of more powerful backbone models?
2. The effectiveness of the PPO algorithm is not experimentally demonstrated in this paper.     In the context of the "abductive reasoning for KG" task, please explain why the PPO algorithm was chosen over other alternatives or how it specifically provides advantages.
3.  What are the reference models in Fig. 4? Why the method needs it?

### Summary
This paper explores an important problem of abductive logical reasoning  (ALR) over Knowledge Graphs (KG), discusses a practical approach to implementing ALR over KGs, and compares different possible implementations of the proposed approach to each other.  ALR over KG is defined as inferring the most probable logic hypothesis from the KGs to explain an observed entity set, and a generative approach is presented for creating logical expressions based on entity set observations.  Algorithms are presented for (1) sampling hypothesis-observation pairs from a KG under the open-world assumption and (2) implementing reinforcement training from KG feedback.  Additional transformation algorithms (token-to-graph and graph-to-token) that assist in the sampling process are presented.  The authors demonstrate the relative effectiveness of each sub-component of their overall method on three well know datasets.

### Strengths
Originality: The authors take on an important problem in knowledge graph reasoning, namely the abduction of plausible rules that could result in an observation set if applied to the KG.  A reasonable baseline algorithm is described and implemented for providing such a capability.  

Quality:  All aspects of the paper appear to be technically correct, and variations of the method are experimentally explored across three KGs.  Authors documentation on all aspects of the techniques are sufficient for reproducibility.  

Clarity:  The main effort of the work exceptionally well described, providing good motivation, clear examples of what is being sought, how the algorithms work, and the various experiments performed.

Significance:  This is exploration is a valuable contribution to the literature.

### Weaknesses
Originality: The paper could benefit from a more precise statement of their objective problem, which would then allow for a clearer discussion of how the current effort contrasts with past and future work.

Quality: The objective of the approach is not precisely defined, so it is difficult to discern whether or not any particular intent was achieved.  No future research was discussed.

Clarity: covered by the first two items in this section.

Significance:  I feel that this is valuable, but could be more impactfully significant with a more precise framing of this approach and alternate formulations of abduction.

### Questions
1.  The paper criticizes previous approaches without quantitatively comparing them to the current method.  While this may be computationally infeasible on the graphs chosen here, do you have such results you could include -- even if only on very small graphs that highlight and justify your statements?

2. There are many possible formal definitions for abduction, and you choose two slightly different versions in your discussion (one in the abstract, and one in Section 2).  Can you provide a precise statement of what you mean by abduction, rather than proceed by analogy?  For instance, the last paragraph of section 2 mentions "best explanation" without providing a quotative definition of best.   Can you connect such precision to your actual implementation?  For instance a precise definition might be made to which your algorithm is an approximation, or a precise definition might be supplied for which your algorithm is an exact solution.

### Summary
This paper introduces the task of abductive logical knowledge graph reasoning. It proposes a generation-based method to address knowledge graph incompleteness and reasoning efficiency by generating logical hypotheses. The paper demonstrates the effectiveness of their proposed reinforcement learning from knowledge graphs (RLF-KG) to enhance the hypothesis generation model by leveraging feedback from knowledge graphs. The paper also discusses the tokenization of hypotheses and the use of reinforcement learning to optimize the hypothesis generation model. Overall, the paper aims to utilize information from knowledge graphs to find complex structured hypotheses that explain observations.

### Strengths
- The research shows that the generation-based method consistently outperforms the search-based method on three different datasets.
- The method addresses the complexity of logical hypotheses by using a generation-based approach. This allows for the exploration of complex structured hypotheses that can explain the observations, going beyond simple correlations or patterns.
- The method takes into account the incompleteness of the knowledge graph, which is a common challenge in reasoning tasks. By generating logical hypotheses, the method can fill in the gaps and provide explanations for the given observations.

### Weaknesses
 - It is inappropriate to call this task as "abduction". The task learns a first-order hypothesis that satisfies given groundings, and the generated hypothesis is used for generalising to more unseen groundings. Logical abduction means a grounding-to-grounding hypothesizing, for example, given P(x)->Q(x), observing Q(1), we can abduce P(1). If you want to abduce first-order theories, the you need second-order rules as background knowledge.
- The presentation of this work can be significantly improved. The description of the proposed method is messy. For example, the caption of Figure 4 is "step 3", which is out of blue and makes reader confusing. Furthermore, the illustration of figures and algorithms are also confusing. There's no input and output in algorithms, and what are "models" and "reference models" in Fig. 4?
- Fig. 5 proposes 13 types of first-order hypotheses templates, are they complete for the hypothesis space? Is there any proof to the completeness?
