## Abstract
Now ubiquitous in deep learning is the transformer architecture, which has advanced the state-of-the-art (SOTA) in a variety of disciplines. When employed with a bidirectional attention mask, a special [CLS] token is often appended to the sequence being processed, serving as a summary of the sequence as a whole once processed. While directly useful in many applications, the processed [CLS] embedding loses utility when asked to perform an entity-specific task given a multi-entity sequence - when processing a multi-speaker dialogue, for example, the [CLS] will describe the entire dialogue not a particular utterance. Existing approaches to address this often either involve redundant computation or non-trivial post-processing outside of the transformer. We propose a general, efficient method for deriving entity-specific embeddings \textit{completely within} the transformer architecture, and demonstrate how the approach yields SOTA results in the domains of natural language processing (NLP) and sports analytics (SA), an exciting, relatively unexplored problem space. Furthermore, we propose a novel approach for deep-clustering towards a prescribed distribution in the absence of labels. Previous approaches towards distribution aware clustering required ground-truth labels, which are not always available. In addition to uncovering interesting signal in the domain of sport, we show how our distribution-aware clustering method yields new cluster-based SOTA on the task of long-tail partial-label learning (LT-PLL). Code available upon publication.

### Confidence
2: You are willing to defend your assessment, but it is quite likely that you did not understand the central parts of the submission or that you are unfamiliar with some pieces of related work. Math/other details were not carefully checked.

### Summary
This work focuses on embedding learning, specifically deriving entity-specific embeddings in a multi-entity sequence within transformer architecture models. They address the limitations of the prior art in computing entity-specific embeddings when given a multi-entity sequence within transformer architecture and avoiding additional postprocessing outside transformer and redundant computations. The authors also present a method for distribution-aware clustering in the absence of labels, again addressing the deep clustering challenges of prior art that are dependent on labels. 
The proposed approaches of learning entity-specific representation are applied to sport domain data and have shown improved performance.

### Strengths
+ the paper in incremental in the sense that extends the prior art in computing entity-specific embeddings when given the multi-entity sequence 
+ the paper has also advanced the prior art: Sinkhorn-knopp algorithm for cluster assignments for example to identify clusters of players who impact the game in similar fashion and thereofre, further extend the distribution aware clustering to compute representations in absence of labels 
+ the proposed approach has shown improvements on datasets from sports domains

### Weaknesses
 - the paper is not an easy read and not easy to follow (too dense)
- the presentation of concepts is too scattered and missing a natural flow of reading, with full of abtract concepts and citation to prior art 
- missing illustrations of the motivation and the problem statement  
- the work is incremental and lacks novelty (or limited by the presentation of the paper), extending the transformers

### Summary
The authors propose a general method for deriving entity-specific embeddings completely within the transformer architecture and demonstrate SOTA results in the domains of natural language processing and sports analytics.
The proposed method first identifies the entities and then adds the entity embeddings to the input sequence. The added entity embeddings can only tend to indices in which the corresponding entity participates.
The authors further improve the Sinkhorn Knopp algorithm for clustering.

### Strengths
1. The authors have done a broad experiment and performed better on almost all the datasets.
2. The proposed method is reasonable and can lead to better entity representations. 
3. The ablation study shows that both the entity embedding method and the clustering method can lead to better performance.

### Weaknesses
1. Adding special tokens to get embedding seems trivial. It is one of the common tricks to get the representation of entities with multiple tokens, such as the method in "Empowering Language Models with Knowledge Graph Reasoning for Question Answering".
2. The proposed clustering method and the embedding method seem to be two orthogonal directions. Feel like merging two not-quite-novel methods together.

### Questions
I see InstructERC is based on the much larger Llama2 model (350M vs 7B parms). Is there any experiment based on LLM?

### Summary
The paper introduces a method for deriving entity-specific embeddings, in which an entity can represent a speaker in dialogues or a player in sport analytics. The authors propose a method to automatically identify entities to be derived, in which each entity can interact with input tokens and other entities.  In addition, they propose a deep clustering method for embedding clustering, which modifies “Sinkhorn Knopp algorithm” by adjusting the probability mass of each cluster.

### Strengths
1. The proposed deep clustering method shows good performance in long-tail partial-label learning. 
2. The paper explores sport analytics and long-tail partial label problems, which are both interesting problems.

### Weaknesses
1. The paper's structure and presentation need improvement, with concepts scattered and a lack of formal details. Clarity could be enhanced with a graphical overview. I would also suggest separating preliminaries from related work so that readers can better focus on what they need to learn before the method section. The details of the proposed method such as the formal formula for deriving entity specific embeddings are missing. In addition, there are many typos or unclear sentences which makes the paper hard to understand.
2. The paper introduces two methods (i.e. deriving entity specific embedding and clustering) that are not highly related to each other. The weak connection of the methods makes the paper difficult to understand.  The motivation for clustering may need clarification to avoid the perception of merging two separate papers.
3. The idea of ​​deriving entity-specific embeddings has also been explored when learning personalized embeddings for chatbots. This line of work can be discussed or compared in the paper.

### Summary
Multi-entity sequences are common in the realm of NLP. However, existing approaches towards deriving entity-specific embeddings are typically only able to construct embeddings for a single entity at a time. The paper proposes a general method for deriving entity-specific embeddings from a multi-entity sequence completely within the transformer architecture. The method showcases SOTA performance on emotion recognition in MELD and EmoryNLP datasets, and on player performance projection task. In addition, the paper proposes a novel distribution-aware clustering method in the absence of labels, which attains SOTA performance in long-tail partial-label learning.

### Strengths
- The paper proposes a general method to extract entity-specific embeddings from a multi-entity sequence completely within the transformer architecture.

- The paper proposes a distribution-aware clustering method that achieves SOTA on the task of LT-PLL.

### Weaknesses
 - For the experiments in Sec 5.1, it is unclear whether the baseline model has undergone similar “pre-training” in the target (i.e., REC/sports) domain. This casts doubt on whether the performance gain could be attributed to the “pre-training” on the target domain.

- The introduction of the player performance projection task, given its relative unfamiliarity, necessitates further clarification. It would be better if the authors could provide some examples of the task, especially in relation to the extraction of entity-specific embeddings from multi-entity sequences. Specifically, it's unclear how the model handles variable sequence lengths across different games or players, and how the model accounts for the inherent stochasticity of individual player performance.

- The paper concurrently presents two distinct methodologies: one centered on extracting entity-specific embeddings and the other on a distribution-aware clustering approach. Presenting these two methods in the same paper seems unconventional, as it appears the two approaches are tackling different challenges and are not interdependent. The connection between the two is not clearly established, and the motivation for combining them within a single paper is weak.

### Questions
- In Table 4, while EE+E2E ensembled with the SPCL-CL-ERC outperforms SPCL-CL_ERC, the performance of EE+E2E is lower than SPCL-CL-ERC. It is unclear why the performance of EE+E2E & SPCL-CL-ERC can be used to show that the proposed method achieved SOTA on MELD. Could you elaborate on the ensemble techniques utilized when combining EE+E2E with the SPCL-CL-ERC?
