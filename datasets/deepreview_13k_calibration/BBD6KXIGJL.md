## Abstract
Equivariant message passing neural networks have emerged as the prevailing approach for predicting chemical properties of molecules due to their ability to leverage translation and rotation symmetries, resulting in a strong inductive bias. However, the equivariant operations in each layer can impose excessive constraints on the function form and network flexibility. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel network called the Hybrid Directional Graph Neural Network (HDGNN), which effectively combines strictly equivariant operations with learnable modules. We evaluate the performance of HDGNN on the QM9 dataset and the IS2RE dataset of OC20, demonstrating its state-of-the-art performance on several tasks and competitive performance on others. Our code is anonymously released on https://github.com/ajy112/HDGNN.

### Summary
The paper describes an hybrid approach to equivariant graph neural networks. It is hybrid in the sense that the networks contain operations that are not fully equivariant together with those that are. The motivation is that equivariance could be too strong of a constraint in many applications. Another motivation is that the Clebsch-Gordan tensor product framework is demanding, and one could by a trick one could convert the steerable features to a global basis via the Wigner-D matrices, apply an MLP, than map back via the Wigner-D matrices. The authors achieve strong results on QM9, state of the art on various metrics for the open catalyst challenge, and perform ablation studies to investigate the effect of the breaking full equivariance.

*[update after the firs response I increased my score from 3 to 5]*

*[update after a second round of discussion I raised my score from 5 to 6]*

*[given the final modifications/clarifications I raised my score from 6 to 8, the authors effectively addressed all my initial concerns and I see no reason to reject the paper]*

### Strengths
1. The paper obtains excellent results on various benchmarks
2. The theoretical preliminaries part, and most of the rest of the paper, is well written
3. The paper addresses a relevant topic; it investigating whether the sometimes restrictive inductive bias of equivariance can be relaxed

### Weaknesses
1. A lot of focus is on breaking of equivariance, or relaxing this constraint. There is one element that I find very important which is not discussed however:

When converting the features to a global reference frame via the Wigner-D matrix (Equation 9), the rotation is computed from the direction: "$R_{ij}$ denotes the 3D rotation matrix that transforms  $\vec{r}_{ij}$ to $[0,0,1]$".

However, this is ill-defined as there is one degree of freedom left in the rotation matrix as any $R_{ij} R_{\alpha}$ with $R_{\alpha}$ any rotation around the z-axis results in the same mapping from $\vec{r}_{ij}$ to $[0,0,1]$.

Thus, the equality in equation 9 is not true, and this is an error in the paper. Iis this is a dellibarate error, because you want to break equivariance? Eitherway, it should fixed or commented on.

It seems that this type of trick as seems to be adopted from [Zitnick et al. 2022], although I haven't check if the same type of error is present in that paper. However, working with local reference frames was also presented in [Kofinas et al. 2021]. See section 3.2 for their discussion on the ill-defined rotation. The claim "... was first presented in Zitnick et al" might therefore have to be also updated/nuanced.

[Kofinas et al. 2021] Kofinas, M., Nagaraja, N., & Gavves, E. (2021). Roto-translated local coordinate frames for interacting dynamical systems. Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, 34, 6417-6429.

2. A second weakness of the paper is the complexity of the model (figure 1) with all sorts of interactions and blocks. It is great that excellent results are obtained with the model, but is it really worth the engineering effort? In my opinion, the contribution of great results is greatly diminished if it comes at the cost of such an intricate (over engineered?) network design. Then, what remains is the ablation that shows that relaxing equivariance could be benefficial. This is a message that contains scientific value, in my opinion, however, this point I think is not thoroughly discussed/analyzed.

3. The main innovation of this paper, which is the partial equivariance is not clearly explained, in my opinion. Apart from the error with respect to ill-defined rotation matrix estimation, the explanaition of why one type of processes breaks equivariance and the other doesn't (Eq 11) could be better explained.

4. In general, I think the paper could still benefit form being more precise on the the purpose of all included experiments (what precisely do they test for?)

Detailed comments:
1. In the introduction it is mentioned "While equivariant neural networks exhibit appropriate inductive biases ... leading to inefficient learning of interactions between atoms" I do not agree with (or understand) this claim at all. Precisely these domains require equivariance: it is demanded by the physics. Any operation that is non-equivariant is bound to fail, unless it *learns to be equivariant*. The property of equivariance is either way essential and thus imposing equivariance should improve efficiency in learning. Perhaps the authors mean something like that it might be more efficient to start-off unconstraint and let the network *learn equivariance* (though the task or augmentation). The paper is not clear on this, it is often suggested that one wants to break equivariance because it might not be the right inductive bias. Eitherway, I really do not understand what is meant with the statement, and I think it is wrong. Please give a counter example where the predicted properties do not require equivariance/invariance, or update the sentence.

2. In 2.4, the analysis of expressive power is I think more important than the benchmark results but hidden in the appendix. Could the results be somehow briefly discussed in the main body, instead of an appendix that is not included in the main pdf?

3. Above equiation 6 in the neighborhood definition please use $\mid$ (\mid) to leave some space between the left and right of | . Also equation 6 reads better if you include some white space after the comma. 

4. Please include a discussion or more details on the estimation of $R_{ij}$ from $\vec{r}_{ij}$, as mentioned in my main comments.

5. Above equation 10: "However, the MLP structure introduces non-equivariance" Please explain this. I do not see why it would break equivariance. In other words, if equation 9 were true (if the rotation estimate were to be well-defined), then applying an MLP on $x_i'$ and then rotate it back afterwards would be fine, right? It would only break equivariance because of the ill-defined rotation estimation, but that is separate from the use of an MLP. So I wonder what is the issue here really? Could you explain this?

6. Same sentence continues with "... rotation matrix introduces randomness". Is this because of the free rotation angle, or what is meant here?

7. Equations 10 and 11 could benefit from more explanation. Why this decomposition? What problem does it solve? Is it to split the processing into an equivariant and non-equivariant part, through NN(x_i) or NN(x_i'')? Or what is the idea behind it.

8. In equation 12, what are the $a_{ij}$, and how are they computed?

9. Equations 13 and 14 describe a Fourier based activation function right? Where as "activation function" an MLP is used. I do like this approach but I think the presentation could be simplified a bit.

10. After equation 13: "we concatenate all the elements..." why? It seems very ad-hoc, but perhaps there is a good explanation for doing this. Could you explain why this is done?

11. Next, "Here, we extend the point-wise operation to two points by incorporating both convolution and correlation" What does that mean? Convolution and correlation are one and the same thing, up to a flip of the kernel. This sentence makes no sense to me, please clarify what is meant by it.

12. In related works: "Such structure is limited to capture fine-grained geometric features since the learning weights are only in the radial representation which is a scalar in each filter". *This statement overlooks the fact that also the spherical harmonics are used*. The radial basis, in combination with the spherical harmonic basis makes that the CG operations describe full group convolutions with kernels that can in principle approximate any pattern. They are only limited by the band-limit L. **Saying that the use of the radial scalar is limiting is wrong and misleading because it overlooks the use of Y**. See e.g. for more details on the expresiveness of CG based networks and the band-limit L:

13. "In contrast, our method ... striking a balance between equivariance and expressiveness". Again, I find a critical discussion on this balance missing. *All the addressed tasks demand equivariance*. The discussion should focus therefore on how certain types of equivariant networks limit expresivity. In CG approach this limit is I suppose the band-limit L. In your approach there is no inherent band-limit because of the non-equivariant MLP approach (though I'm not sure how this is proved), but equivariance should be learned somehow. Do I understand this correctly?

14. Below table 1: " This highlights the ability of HDGNN to capture more general physical properties in real world scenarios" I do not see this claim substantiated. The only thing I see from the table is that the method outperforms several others (not always), but this does not imply a better capability to "capture more general physical properties". What are these "more general properties". There are so many differences between your architecture and those in the table. In my interpretation, HDGNN might just be better engineered to solve the task but does not give any more insights than that.

15. What are the ODD average scores between parenthesis in text (GDGNN: 564 vs SCN/Equiformer: 592/613). I cannot find these in the table (sorry if I overlook them somehow)

16. "The QM9 dataset ... susceptible to overfitting" I do not see why this is an issue. Did you indeed observe overfitting in your learning curves? If you want to test these kind of overfitting issues, perhaps the revised rMD17 would be more appropriate. In fact, I think rMD17 might be the best dataset to test your method, because the task in rRMD17 (interatomic potential energy prediction, for a single molecule given different conformations) is purely driven by geometry and should be purely invariant.

17. "In contrast, our approach merges inherent equivariance with learned equivariance," What mechanism induces learned equivariance? This is not discussed in the paper.

18. "While HDGNN has shown superior performance compared to strictly equivariant models" did it? It seems sometimes it does, sometimes it doesn't. The claim should be nuanced.

19. To be honest, I do not follow the paragraphs after tables 3,4. They should be improved in clarity. What research questions are being addressed here? Please be precise on the purpose of all experiments in the paper (what precisely do they test for)

20. On several occasions the paper motivates the equivariance relaxation form the efficiency perspective. But what about actual speed efficiency? I see no comparison in the paper and it would be nice to see if something is gained on that level.

### Summary
– This paper presents a novel approach to an equivariant graph encoder for classification. The goal of the paper is to enhance expressiveness by relaxing the equivariance constraint, following recent success of works including (Dym and Maron 2021). 

– The main issue is that the representation group degree $l$, which gives higher expressive power, leads to increased computation costs in the CG product.

### Strengths
– Investigating an hybrid approach to improve the tradeoff between equivariance and expressive power seems a fruitful direction.

### Weaknesses
– This paper presents a novel approach to an equivariant graph encoder for classification. The goal of the paper is to enhance expressiveness by relaxing the equivariance constraint, following recent success of works including (Dym and Maron 2021).

– The main issue is that the representation group degree $l$, which gives higher expressive power, leads to increased computation costs in the CG product.

– In the abstract you claim to: demonstrating its state-of-the-art performance, however,

– Table 1: Your method does improve the results only in 2 out of 4 metrics.

– Table 2 : Your method improves previous work on 2 out of 11 tasks.

– The performance gains are not consistent across different tasks and metrics, raising questions about the generalizability of the proposed method. The improvements, when present, are often marginal, suggesting that the proposed approach may not offer a substantial advantage over existing methods in many practical scenarios.

### Questions
– Since you are claiming that your architecture: “can enhance the expressive power suffering from the limitations of finite low-degree group representation” should this be also shown in a proposition or theorem, to complement your ablation study?

– Could you expand experiments on other recent GNN benchmarks, follow Equiformer or the other works that you are comparing to.
