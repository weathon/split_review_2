## Abstract
The problem of off-policy evaluation (OPE) in reinforcement learning (RL), which evaluates a given policy using data collected from a different behavior policy, plays an important role in many real-world applications. The OPE under the model of episodic non-stationary finite-horizon Markov decision process (MDP) has been widely studied. However, the general model-free importance sampling (IS) methods suffer from the curse of horizon and dimensionality, while the improved marginal importance sampling (MIS) can only be restrained to the case where the state space $\mathcal{S}$ is sufficiently small. The model-based methods often have limited scope of application. To find a widely-applicable OPE algorithm when $\mathcal{S}$ is continuous and high-dimensional that avoids the curse of horizon and dimensionality, which means the error of the estimator grows exponentially with the number of horizon $H$ and the dimension $d$ of the state space $\mathcal{S}$, we apply the diffusion Schr"odinger bridge generative model to construct a model-based estimator (CDSB estimator). Moreover, we established the statistical rate of the estimation error of the value function with a polynomial rate of $O(H^2\sqrt{d})$, which, to the best of our knowledge, is one of the first theoretical rate results on applying Schr"odinger bridge to reinforcement learning. This breaks the restraint of the complexity of the state space for OPE under MDP with large horizon and can be applied to various real-life decision problems with continuous setting, which is shown in our simulation using our method in continuous, high-dimensional and long-horizon RL environments and its comparison with other existing algorithms.

### Summary
The authors presents the novel model-based off-policy evaluation method based on diffusion Schrodinger bridge generative model. The established statistical rate shows only polynomial dependence on planning horizon, thus improves over classic importance sampling methods. Finally, authors present numerical validation of their method on several continuous RL environments.

### Strengths
- First application of diffusion models to off-policy evaluation problem;
- Theoretical guarantees that avoid the curse of horizon and dimensionality;

### Weaknesses
 - Theoretical contribution is very limited.
    - Assumption 6 in Section 4 is very strong because it requires very good exploration properties of the behavior policy: there should be enough data for any state-action pair to learn the model uniformly for all state-action pairs. This is a significant limitation, as in many practical scenarios, the behavior policy might not sufficiently explore the state-action space, leading to inaccurate score estimations and invalidating the theoretical guarantees. The assumption essentially requires the behavior policy to have support that covers the support of the target policy, which is a strong condition that is often not met in practice.
    - Additionally, it is very unlikely that the estimation error is available for practical implementations since this error defined in terms of integrals with respect to the optimal Schrodinger bridge, and also uniform over all state-action pairs. This makes the theoretical results difficult to translate into practical guidance. The error bound relies on quantities that are not directly computable or estimable from data.
    - Corollary 5 of (Liu et al. 2020) yields that in the case of existence of a good approximation of importance weights (no matter the way of obtaining it), the approximate SIS algorithm also have polynomial dependence in horizon. As a result, the presented method is not the first implementable method that avoids exponential dependence on the horizon.

    - Proof of Theorem 4.1 might be very simplified by using Bellman equations and backward induction. In this case it becomes a very simple corollary of Theorem 4.2.
- Regarding experimental validation, there is a lack of comparison with importance sampling and doubly-robust methods. The absence of these comparisons makes it difficult to assess the practical advantages of the proposed method over well-established baselines. It is crucial to demonstrate that the method provides a clear improvement over existing techniques, not just a different approach.
- Application of diffusion model to RL in general is not novel and there is several method that apply diffusion to offline RL problem, e.g.

### Summary
The authors consider the problem of off policy evaluation. They attempt to learn an estimator for V, the value function, by learning an estimator for the reward function R and the transition kernel T. The former they model as a neural network, while for the latter they resort to a conditional diffusion Schrödinger bridge. The authors ultimately end up with a function T, which is conditioned on the timestep, with which they proceed to model V. They investigate the performance of their algorithm theoretically, and with experiments.

### Strengths
- The authors consider a problem that is both contemporary and valuable
 - The authors provide detailed theoretical analysis of their contribution

### Weaknesses
 - The core methodology presented in the paper is prior art (Chen2021, Chen2023b, Chen2023c)
 - The experimental evaluation is extremely limited
 - The few experimental results that are given do not demonstrate a performant method

 - Can the authors elaborate why the performance of their method is so inconsistent in experiments? A clear trend (as theretical results would suggest) is absent.
 - The core of the contribution seems to be section 3.3, but there are a few elements that are not quite clear
   * Why does the loss need to be masked?
   * What does it mean to add the time to the training parameters? Does this mean time gets gradient updates in every step? This seems like a mistake.
   * Overall, this section could do with a careful rewrite, in particular since this section seems to be the core part of the methodological innovation in the paper
 - Can the authors explain how the integral in (1) is evaluated in practice? While the paper discusses how to achieve the individual factors in the integrand, they do not discuss how they evaluate the integral in practice? Imortance sampling? SMC?
 - While the paper is very rigorous in defining the assumptions of the theoretical analysis (which is a big plus!), it is not clear how feasible each of these is in practice. In particular, do the authors have any means of evaluating whether these requirements are indeed satisfied in their trained estimators?
Small notes:
 - There is a latex typo in eqn 5 "Psi"
 - Is the data in figure 1 identical to that in table 1?
Justification for score:
 Overall I think the experimental evaluation is too limited, and the existing experimental evaluation is not in the authors' favor. I also think there are certain obvious aspects of the experiments that are missing In particular, if theoretical results indicate favorable results with respect to horizon length, I would expect some result that indeed shows this scaling, and how it improves compared to other methods. This would require at least giving the expected horizon length, rather than simply labelling it "infinite". The same is true for action and state space dimension. The authors demonstrate favorable scaling, but no thorough investigation is done to confirm this, or show that other methods do not have this favorable scaling.

### Summary
The paper studies off-policy evaluation in reinforcement learning, specialized to an episodic MDP setting. The method is simple to describe. It employs the conditional diffusion Schrodinger bridge estimator to learn the Markov transition kernel and then computes a model-based policy value estimator based on the estimated transition kernel. The author(s) further established an upper error bound for the policy value estimator. Numerical experiments were further conducted to investigate its finite sample performance.

### Strengths
The merits of the paper can be summarized as follows:

* The paper appears to be the first work in introducing the diffusion Schrödinger bridge generative model to the domain of off-policy evaluation, to my best knowledge.

* The initial sections of the document are presented with great clarity, making them accessible and straightforward for the reader to grasp the core concept.

* Through a series of numerical experiments, the paper successfully demonstrates the superior performance of the proposed method over existing solutions in some of the selected datasets, demonstrating its potential.

### Weaknesses
The paper exhibits several weaknesses that warrant careful consideration and potential revision:

* **Novelty**: The method presented seems to be an amalgamation of the pre-existing condition diffusion Schrödinger bridge estimator, as outlined by Chen et al. (2023), and the model-based off-policy evaluation. However, the paper falls short in articulating the rationale behind this integration. Specifically, it does not sufficiently illuminate the advantages of employing the condition diffusion Schrödinger bridge estimator. Comparatively, in the existing literature, it is a common approach to use a Gaussian dynamics model with parameters defined via deep neural networks for estimating conditional density functions, which has demonstrated faster estimation and inference processes, as well as practical efficiency (see, for example, [Paper 1](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.13239.pdf), [Paper 2](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper/2020/file/f7efa4f864ae9b88d43527f4b14f750f-Paper.pdf), [Paper 3](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.03207.pdf), [Paper 4](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2301.02220.pdf)). Moreover, in the numerical experiments, there are instances where the proposed method results in significantly larger errors compared to Fitted Q-Evaluation (FQE) or model-based (MB) approaches.

*  **Familiarity with Off-Policy Evaluation (OPE) Literature**: The author(s) appears to have a limited understanding of the OPE literature. Certain claims made in the paper might be inaccurate. For example, previous works such as Jiang & Li (2016), Precup et al. (2000), Thomas et al. (2015), and Thomas & Brunskill (2016) actually employed the sequential importance sampling (IS) ratio instead of the marginal importance sampling ratio for OPE. The paper attributes the marginal IS ratio to these works in the second paragraph of the introduction. The correct attribution should be made to Liu et al. (2018) Paper 5, which was the first to propose the use of the marginal importance sampling ratio, with subsequent developments in the DICE-type estimators (e.g.,  https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.11652) and other extensions (e.g., https://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.05850.pdf, https://arxiv.org/pdf/2109.04640.pdf and https://proceedings.mlr.press/v139/shi21d/shi21d.pdf). Additionally, Liu et al. (2018) also explored minimax optimization for computing the marginal IS ratio. Furthermore, it was mentioned on Page 2 that "The idea of using generative model as transition function estimator in RL, to our knowledge, has not been discovered in the literature". However, as commented in my previous comment, there have been several works in using Gaussian generative models for policy learning.

* **Clarity of Sections 3 and 4**: These sections are challenging to follow and would benefit significantly from a simplification of notation and presentation to enhance readability and comprehension.

* **Theoretical Analysis and Coverage Assumption**: The theoretical analysis is missing a discussion on the crucial coverage assumption, which necessitates that the ratio between the behavior and target policy be finite. This assumption is foundational for offline RL. Unfortunately, the paper does not provide assumptions or explanations on this aspect, leaving a gap in the theoretical groundwork.

* **Inadequacy of Numerical Analysis**: The numerical analysis conducted seems insufficient. The paper explores only four benchmark environments with a fixed number of episodes. Additionally, the numerical experiments consider infinite horizons, whereas the paper focuses on fixed episodic settings. Moreover, the proposed estimator demonstrated larger errors in comparison to FQE or MB in two of the environments, questioning its practical effectiveness. To provide a more comprehensive evaluation, it would be beneficial to vary the sample size and offer a thorough comparison across different settings.

Do you need the coverage assumption to guarantee the consistency of the estimated Markov transition kernel?

### Summary
This paper is focused on a new model-based approach to solve OPE. Specifically, it proposes a way to use the diffusion Schrodinger bridge to estimate the probability transition kernel. A theoretical guarantee on the estimation error of the estimated probability transition kernel in total variation distance is provided. Empirical results are also provided for its comparison with existing baselines.

### Strengths
This paper introduces a new perspective for doing RL and OPE with diffusion. This is relevant given the recent popularity of diffusion models. The empirical results are nicely done and a good complement to the theoretical results.

### Weaknesses
This paper introduces a new perspective for doing RL and OPE with diffusion. This is relevant given the recent popularity of diffusion models. The empirical results are nicely done and a good complement to the theoretical results.

This paper seems to focus on the theoretical aspect of the proposed approach, but the theoretical results presented in this paper can be further developed, for example, by accounting for the effect of sample size on the final estimation error instead of assuming the statistical error is bounded by $\epsilon$. 

In addition, Assumption 6 requires the reward function to be well-estimated in the infinity-norm sense, which can be difficult. Normally, the estimation error is bounded in the $\ell_2$-norm sense.

Furthermore, the writing about the algorithm can be made clearer, and there can be more discussion about the implications of Theorem 4.1 and 4.2. Please see the Questions section for details.

### Questions
I have the following questions for the authors:

- I had some trouble understanding how the DSB method described in Section 3.1 is applied to OPE. Section 3.2 is not very clear to me. It'd be nice if the authors could explain what $p_{\mathrm{prior}}$ is in the context of OPE as well as what $p_{\mathrm{obs}}$ is in Algorithm 1? And what is the relationship between $p_{\mathrm{prior}}$ and $p_{\mathrm{obs}}$?

- What is $Q^*$ from Section 3.1 in the context of OPE? Is it the Q-function for some policy? And how exactly do we obtain $p_{\mathrm{data}}$ given $Q^*$ and $p_{\mathrm{prior}}$?

- Could the authors explain how $T$ in the algorithm is chosen in general? 

- Is "for $k$ in $1:K$" in Algorithm 1 a typo and what the authors actually meant is "for $k$ in $1:N$"? 

- Is gradient descent sufficient for minimizing $\tilde{\mathcal{L}}_{SB}(\mathbf{x}_T; \theta)$ with respect to $\theta$? If not, is a local minimizer $\theta$ sufficient for the theoretical results? Similar question for $\phi$.
