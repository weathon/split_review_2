## Abstract
Machine learning models provide alternatives for efficiently recognizing complex patterns from data, but two main concerns in applying them to modeling physical systems stem from their physics-agnostic design and lack of interpretability. This paper mitigates these concerns by encoding the Helmholtz-Hodge decomposition into a Gaussian process model, leading to a versatile framework that simultaneously learns the curl-free and divergence-free components of a dynamical system. Learning a predictive model in this form facilitates the exploitation of symmetry priors. In addition to improving predictive power, these priors link the identified features to comprehensible scientific properties of the system, thus complex responses can be modeled while retaining interpretability. We show that compared to baseline models, our model achieves better predictive performance on several benchmark dynamical systems while allowing accurate estimation of the energy evolution of the systems from noisy and sparse data.

### Summary
This manuscript proposes a Gaussian process regression model that incorporates the Helmholtz-Hodge decomposition and a method for eliminating indeterminacy by incorporating knowledge of symmetry into it as a constraint on the model. Compared to the baseline models, the proposed method has not only improved the predictive performance but also allows for the construction of interpretable models.

### Strengths
The strength of this manuscript lies in the fact that the interpretability of the nonparametric model, Gaussian process regression, was ensured by basing it on the Helmholtz Hodge decomposition, and that compensation was made for the identifiability of the estimated model in order to achieve a physical valid interpretation.

### Weaknesses
A weakness of this manuscript is the lack of discussion of interpretability in the demonstration experiments, despite the authors' claim that the proposed method has a high interpretability.
In addition, when the proposed method is applied to complex phenomena that often require interpretation, the symmetries of the system are often considered to be unknown, and in this case, it is considered to be difficult to achieve identifiability by the proposed method.
This point is also considered to pose difficulties in terms of improving the prediction performance by the proposed method.

### Questions
It would be better to add a demonstration for more complex systems with larger degrees of freedom.
It would be better to describe the concept of applying the proposed method to cases where the symmetry of the system is unknown.

### Summary
In this work, authors present a Gaussian process model that decomposes the dynamics of a dissipative system into the curl-free and divergence-free terms. Further, these terms are learned from the noisy ground truth data. The framework is claimed to have the additional advantage of being interpretable due to the separate learning of the two terms in the dynamics. Empirical studies on damped mass-spring system, damped pendulum, and Chua circuit shows superior performance over the baselines.

### Strengths
The main strengths of the paper are as follows.

S1. Presents a GP-based framework that can inherently handle noisy data. This is in contrast to most of the works in the literature that employs neural-based approaches.

S2. Decomposes the dynamics into curl-free and div-free terms. This allows learning the non-conservative and conservative components of the dynamics separately.

S3. Empirically demonstrates that the presented framework is superior to the baselines on damped spring systems, damped pendulum and Chua circuit.

### Weaknesses
There are several weaknesses for the paper. 

W1. There are several works in the literature which demonstrates how the Lagrangian, (port-)Hamiltonian, and neural ODE based NN frameworks can be used to model dissipative dynamical systems. Authors have not given any mention of such frameworks in the introduction, which provides a feeling that there is no prior work in this area. The reference comes much later when discussing the baselines. This should be clearly included in the introduction. Some relevant works are as follows.

W2. The claim on the interpretability presented in the abstract is not substantiated later on in the empirical experiments or results. It is not clear how the framework is interpretable especially for a system with larger number of degrees of freedom. The separate learning of curl-free and divergence-free terms alone does not guarantee interpretability without further analysis or connection to physical properties.

W3. The experiments performed are on very (very) simple systems such as a damped spring and damped pendulum. The community has moved forward from these experiments. Please see the experiments in the references mentioned against W1. Especially, the experiments on simple one-degree of freedom toy examples are not enough to show the applicability of the approach to any realistic problems. For this some demonstration on larger systems with more degrees of freedom (~50-100) should be conducted. Note that realistic systems can have much higher degrees of freedom.

W4. Baselines are not appropriately chosen. Again, references provided in W1 should be used for baselines. Some of the baselines that can be included are graph neural ODE, Lagrangian and Hamiltonian NN with dissipative terms, Lagrangian and Hamiltonian graph NNs with the dissipative terms to name a few.

### Questions
In continuation to the weaknesses, the following questions/comments need to be addressed.

Q1. The evaluation metrics are important. This should be preferably included in the main manuscript and not the appendix. Moreover, why are other metrics such as energy error, momentum error etc. not included? This allows meaningful interpretation of the error in the learned dynamics. 

Q2. It is not clear what the authors mean by the claim that the framework is interpretable. Do they mean that the dissipative and non-dissipative terms are learned separately? This is not necessarily interpretable. There are interesting works on interpretability. For instance, see:
* Cranmer, M., Sanchez Gonzalez, A., Battaglia, P., Xu, R., Cranmer, K., Spergel, D. and Ho, S., 2020. Discovering symbolic models from deep learning with inductive biases. Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, 33, pp.17429-17442.
* Cranmer, M.D., Xu, R., Battaglia, P. and Ho, S., 2019. Learning symbolic physics with graph networks. arXiv preprint arXiv:1909.05862.

Q3. How does the system perform on more complex systems such as 50-mass spring systems or 5-pendulum systems. GPs are known to have issues with larger input features. Can the present approach be extended to such realistic systems?

Q4. It is not clear how the input features will be employed for the present approach in a multi-degree of freedom system. Specifically, whether the approach is permutation invariant or not is not clear. That is, does the order in which the degrees of freedom are provided as the input matter or not? Authors should clarify.

### Summary
This paper presents a method to learning complex systems. The method has three components: using Helmholtz-Hodge decomposition on the phase plane of the dynamic systems, as influenced by Greydanus et al 2019 (Hamiltonian NN), to decompose system dynamics into curl-free and div-free components; using Gaussian Process as prior to capture those two components separately from the training data; and use Euclidean group to further enforce the symmetries of GP models.

### Strengths
This paper addresses an important problem in dynamics prediction. Inspired by D-HNN (2022), the method is novel, in particular the usage of Euclidean Group to further enforce the symmetries. There is sufficient amount of empirical evidence to back up the claims. The paper contains extensive amount of theoretical work, and is written reasonably well.

### Weaknesses
The experimental results section needs some more clarification, see the questions in the next sections.

The non-uniqueness of HHD is well-known. The authors use it as in section 3.3 to introduce the enforcement of the symmetries of the GP model. However it's unclear that the enforcement of the symmetries can completely eliminate the non-uniqueness of HHD. (My understanding is negative). Although the preservation of symmetries is usually a desirable property to model dynamics systems, either a theoretical guarantee or empirical validation that the non-uniqueness can be addressed or mitigated is highly desirable. 

Real data are never clean. The authors added noise into the training data. But my concern is that the noise magnitude is too small (0.01, only 1% of the data range. I would like to see how well the method behaves when larger magnitude of noise is added, for instance, with std. dev. of 0.01, 0.05, 0.10 and 0.20.

### Questions
1. In Table 1, what are the std. dev. values collected from? My understanding is that random initial values are used in the GP model. Are the randomness of the initial values cause the derivations?

2. I am trying to understand the reported RMSE and VPT in Table 1. For each system, 20 pairs of data are generated for training, where are the testing data generated? In the temporal sense, are the testing data lie in the future of the training data, or the training and testing data pairs are intermingled with respect of time?

### Summary
The paper proposes a dynamical system based on the Helmholtz–Hodge decomposition (HHD) and Gaussian processes (GPs). The authors demonstrate how to learn the dynamic systems in the HHD form where each component is modeled as a GP.

### Strengths
1. The authors propose to decompose the dynamical system as curl-free and divergence-free components and learn the decomposition using GPs. The formulation is interesting and has physically-meaningful interpretation.
2. To address identifiability, the authors incorporate symmetry constraints on the HHD components, and provide theoretical characterizations of the resulting kernels.
3. Empirical results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves improved accuracy in modeling ODEs as well as energy evolution of the systems.

### Weaknesses
1. Computational complexity for the method could be prohibitive for high-dimensional problems where the partial derivatives wrt. the input need to be computed. Specifically, the need to compute gradients with respect to the input for each sample point, and for each dimension of the input, results in a scaling of O(m*n) for the covariance matrix, which then leads to O(m^3n^3) complexity for the Cholesky decomposition. This is a significant drawback compared to standard dynamical systems where low-rank approximations are commonly employed to reduce computational burden, and this is not leveraged in the proposed approach.
2.  As suggested by the authors, the decomposition is not unique due to the unidentifiability of the harmony component. The authors address this issue by imposing symmetry constraints; however, the uniqueness and characteristics of the resulting decomposition are not investigated. While symmetry constraints are a reasonable approach, the paper lacks a rigorous analysis of how these constraints precisely eliminate the non-uniqueness issue, and what are the characteristics of the resulting decomposition. It is not clear if the symmetry constraints are sufficient to guarantee a unique solution for all possible dynamical systems, or what specific properties of the solution are enforced by these constraints.
3. Another concern is the novelty of the approach compared to the multiple kernel learning literature. The proposed method appears to be an instance of learning a combination of two pre-defined kernels. The paper does not sufficiently clarify how the proposed approach differs fundamentally from existing MKL methods, which also learn a combination of kernels. The novelty of the proposed method in the context of existing MKL literature is not well-established.

### Questions
1. What is the computational complexity of the method in terms of the sample size and input dimension?
2. How does the method differ from multiple kernel learning with two given kernels?

### Summary
The authors propose to learn from dynamical data by considering the Helmholtz-Hodge decomposition and modeling separate GPs to the divergence-free and the curl-free components of the system. To enable identifiability for the resulting additive model, Euclidean symmetries are imposed to the components. The obtained experimental results are promising when compared to a neural network model and other GP-based methods.

### Strengths
Learning dynamical systems is a fundamental problem that has been covered by the machine learning community from many angles. By considering the Helmholtz-Hodge decomposition and directly including symmetry constraints in the kernel function, the authors present a very interesting and relevant contribution.

The overall presentation is laid very carefully and the text is well written. The authors take their time to explain all the important concepts and related work in the main text, which greatly aids the reader. Despite tackling several concepts of dynamical systems and vector calculus, I found the manuscript to be very didactic and easy to follow.

Theoretical and implementation details are presented in the the very comprehensive appendix, which also includes additional plots from the experiments.

### Weaknesses
I believe it would be of interest to include at least one scenario where the number of training observations is larger to verify if the SPHHD-GP maintains its high gains compared to the baselines. Specifically, it would be beneficial to see how the performance scales when the training set size approaches the size of the test set, or even exceeds it. I think a larger Gaussian noise could also be tested, since a standard deviation of 0.01 (0.0001 variance) seems a bit too low. This is particularly relevant as real-world data is often corrupted by significant noise, and the robustness of the proposed method should be evaluated under more challenging conditions. For instance, testing with noise levels that are 5-10 times higher would provide a more comprehensive picture of the model's capabilities.

The authors consider only the RMSE and VPT metrics in the experiments. While these are useful for evaluating prediction accuracy, they do not fully capture the quality of the uncertainty estimates provided by the GP models. The predicted variances provided by the GP models should also be included in the evaluation, e.g., by computing the log predictive density. This is crucial for assessing the reliability of the model's predictions, especially in safety-critical applications where uncertainty quantification is paramount.

### Questions
It is difficult to visually differentiate the colors of the curves in Figs. 5, 6, 7. Is it possible to consider distinct line styles, similar to Fig. 2?
