## Abstract
Despite their success in many natural language tasks, solving math problems remains a significant challenge for large language models (LLMs).
A large gap exists between LLMs' pass-at-one and pass-at-N performance in solving math problems, suggesting LLMs might be close to finding correct solutions, motivating our 
exploration of fine-tuning methods to unlock LLMs' performance.
Using the challenging MATH dataset, we investigate three fine-tuning strategies:
(1) solution fine-tuning, where we fine-tune to generate a detailed solution for a given math problem;
(2) solution-cluster re-ranking, where the LLM is fine-tuned as a solution verifier/evaluator to choose among generated candidate solution clusters;
(3) multi-task sequential fine-tuning, which integrates both solution generation and evaluation tasks together efficiently to enhance the LLM performance.
With these methods, we present a thorough empirical study on a series of PaLM~2 models and find:
(1)~The quality and style of the step-by-step solutions used for fine-tuning can make a significant impact on the model performance;
(2)~While solution re-ranking and majority voting are both effective for improving the model performance when used separately, they can also be used together for an even greater performance boost;
(3)~Multi-task fine-tuning that \emph{sequentially} separates the solution generation and evaluation tasks can offer improved performance compared with the solution fine-tuning baseline.
Guided by these insights, we design a fine-tuning recipe that yields approximately 58.8\% accuracy on the MATH dataset with fine-tuned \palmLarge models, an 11.2\% accuracy improvement over the few-shot performance of pre-trained \palmLarge model with majority voting.

### Confidence
2: You are willing to defend your assessment, but it is quite likely that you did not understand the central parts of the submission or that you are unfamiliar with some pieces of related work. Math/other details were not carefully checked.

### Summary
This work aims to improve the LLMs’ performance on math problem solving. They adopt several methods. (1) Using step-by-step fine-grained solutions. (2) Using majority voting with re-ranking method to choose final solution. (3) multi-tasks tuning: solution generation task and solution evaluation task.

### Strengths
(1) Using reranking+ majority voting to choose solution and compare different re-ranking algorithm, different model size.
(2) This work propose the multi-tasks tuning in a sequential manner while a new training object.

### Weaknesses
 (1) I find its novelty is limited. Both reranking and majority-voting are not new, it seems the authors just combine them in this paper.
(2) Multi-task sequential fine-tuning is one of major contribution. However, I find it increase performance very limited as shown in Table 4.
(3) The paper claims the method obtains an 11.2% accuracy improvement. However, the simply SFT on PRM800+MATHalready has about 7.6% gain as shown in Table2  (47.6->55.2) , so the biggest gain is from SFT instead of proposed method.
(4) The paper only reports the performance on PaLM2. I think the authors can report the method on other LLM, like llama.
(5) In sec 5.1, I am not sure what's the dataset GSM800K? maybe it is PRM800K. The authors should carefully check the paper writing.

### Questions
(1) The authors train the model by a sequential manner, I wonder what's the result if the three tasks are trained together. Or what's the result if only two tasks are used.

(2) I am not sure the authors combine the reranking in the Section 4.4 or not. If it is not, what about the performance of reranking + majority-voting + multi-task tuning?

### Summary
This paper experiments several fine-tuning strategies to improve the LLM performance on math word problems. They also proposed 
1.  _Solution-cluster re-ranking_, which reduces the load of re-ranking a large number of candidates by just re-ranking top-_K_ clusters; 
2.  _Multi-task sequential fine-tuning_: sequentially fine-tune the model as a generator, then evaluator, and then generator again.

### Strengths
1. Experiments (Table 3) show consistent improvement by __RR.Top-8__ compared with __RR.All__.
2. Improvement of the sequential fine-tuning over the MLE fine-tuning.
3. Investigate a number of re-ranking strategy to show the advantages of reranking through top-_K_ clusters.

### Weaknesses
1. The contribution is incremental to the research community. 
    1. We can see the absolute improvements are not really significant for both solution reranking and sequential fine-tuning (Table 3 and 4). 
    2. Thus, it could be unnecessary to make this approach general for everyone.
    3. I would expect some deeper insights besides the engineering efforts made in this work. For example, how does the sequential fine-tuning change the behavior of the models? Answering some scientific questions like this would give the readers more insights for future research. 
2. Insufficient and unclear experiments.
    1. Reranking: why K is 8? I think there should be more experiments to explain.
    2. One more dataset would be even more convincing. 
3. Writing needs to be improved
     1. For example, in Section 3.2, we are following Cobbe et al., (2021) to perform re-ranking. When you have the pair loss in (7-9), it is obvious that we don't explicitly have the correct and incorrect pairs. The number sampled from the model could be unbalanced, how do you handle this problem. And, do you still use the gold annotations in this reranking?

### Questions
1. is equation 10 and 11 used in the experiments? Seems only (12) and (13) are used. Seems these two equations are useless there?

### Summary
The paper explores methods to improve large language models (LLMs) for solving math word problems.
The authors identify a gap between LLMs' pass-at-one (single attempt) and pass-at-N (multiple attempts) performance on math problems, suggesting LLMs can often find correct solutions but struggle to identify them.
Three fine-tuning strategies are proposed to improve LLMs' solution generation and evaluation:

- Supervised fine-tuning to generate step-by-step solutions 
- Solution-cluster re-ranking, where the LLM ranks candidate solutions clustered by equivalence 
- Multi-task sequential fine-tuning, combining generation and evaluation

Experiments on the MATH dataset with PaLM 2 models show the benefits of each strategy.

### Strengths
- The solution-cluster re-ranking approach creatively combines majority voting and re-ranking in a novel way to improve performance.
- The paper provides clear motivation,

### Weaknesses
- Lack of comparison with other open-source LLMs.
- Lack of comparison with other powerful LLMs such as ChatGPT [1], GPT-4 [2], and Claude-2 [3].
- The experiments are solely conducted on PaLM 2 models, not demonstrating generalizability to other model families such as LLaMA [4].
- Compared to the baseline, the performance gain is minimal.
