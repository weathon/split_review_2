## Abstract
The increasing availability of multi-sensor data sparks interest in multimodal self-supervised learning. However, most existing approaches learn only common representations across modalities while ignoring intra-modal training and modality-unique representations. We propose Decoupling Common and Unique Representations (DeCUR), a simple yet effective method for multimodal self-supervised learning. By distinguishing inter- and intra-modal embeddings, DeCUR is trained to integrate complementary information across different modalities. We evaluate DeCUR in three common multimodal scenarios (radar-optical, RGB-elevation, and RGB-depth), and demonstrate its consistent benefits on scene classification and semantic segmentation downstream tasks. Notably, we get straightforward improvements by transferring our pretrained backbones to state-of-the-art supervised multimodal methods without any hyperparameter tuning. Furthermore, we conduct a comprehensive explainability analysis to shed light on the interpretation of common and unique features in our multimodal approach.

### Confidence
4: You are confident in your assessment, but not absolutely certain. It is unlikely, but not impossible, that you did not understand some parts of the submission or that you are unfamiliar with some pieces of related work.

### Summary
This paper addresses the limitation of existing multimodal self-supervised learning methods, which only focus on learning cross-modal common representations while overlooking the training of modality-unique representations. The proposed DeCUR method decouples the common and unique representations by distinguishing between inter-modal and intra-modal embeddings, allowing the integration of complementary information from different modalities. The effectiveness of the method is validated on three multimodal scenarios and two downstream tasks, along with an analysis of interpretability.

### Strengths
1. The method is simple yet effective, and the supplementary materials provide ample resources for reproducing the results.
2. The interpretability analysis aids in understanding the effectiveness of the proposed method.
3. The experiments are sufficient and comprehensive.

### Weaknesses
1.The results of training with 100% labels using Barlow Twins and VICReg are missing.

### Summary
This paper proposes a multimodal representation learning approach, that aims at decoupling common and unique features from each modality.

### Strengths
+ The paper is well organized and clearly presented.
+ The proposed approach is simple, concise and efficient. It makes sense to divide the feature channels as common and unique, then enforce redundancy reduction through the resulting cross-correlation matrices.  
+ Ablation study in Section 6 and analysis in Section 7 provide good insight.

### Weaknesses
 + The novelty seems limited as the major approach is an extension of Barlow Twins to the multimodal setting.

+ Figure 3 (a): It is good that the authors present the ablation study on the percentage of common dimensions. In a lot of multimodal scenarios, modality can be unbalanced -- some modality contain more common features while others contain less. I wonder if it makes more sense to set different percentage to different modalities. Another problem related to this is that the proposed approach seems to require grid search of this ratio to get the best performance. I assume that by changing the percentage of common dimension, retraining of the whole model is needed? This results in computational burdens, and stand as a disadvantage.

+ I wonder if the discovered modality-common and unique features can be utilized in some multimodal robustness settings, besides visualization. Say if one of the modality gets perturbed by Gaussian noise / there is a certain probability that one of the modality is missing during inference time, I expect the learned common features would be beneficial in this scenario while modality unique features from the perturbed modality would diminish the performance. 

+ The datasets used for experiments, while being multimodal, are essentially all image modalities. Could the authors comment briefly about the applicability of the proposed approach to other modalities (say audio, text)?

### Summary
Based on Barlow Twins, this paper proposes DeCUR, aiming to decouple common and unique representations in multimodal self-supervised learning. Specifically, the DeCUR splits the output embedding into common and unique parts. The common parts are used for common Barlow Twins losses, while the similarities of unique parts between modalities are trained to be zero. The authors evaluate the DeCUR on multiple scenarios and provide further analysis on the effect of the DeCUR.

### Strengths
1: The DeCUR is easy to understand and reproduce.

2: Experimental results show that the DeCUR can outperform some previous methods.

3: The authors conduct extensive explainability analysis for the interpretability of DeCUR.

### Weaknesses
### Method

1: **Forcing the correlation score of unique embeddings to be zero is not convincing.** As shown in Figure 2 and the methodology, the DeCUR splits the original output embedding into common and unique parts for each modality. The similarities of paried unique parts between modalities are **required to be zero**, while they **belong to the same instance** across different modalities. In other words, it means partial features of an instance from two modalities need to be mutually exclusive. Why can such training objectives make the model learn meaningful features? Could the authors provide further explanations? In the overall training loss, the common parts are trained to be aligned. So, will only the shared common features contribute to the representation ability, and will the unique parts be trained to be a trivial solution and meaningless? The concern is that by explicitly decorrelating the unique features across modalities, the model might be incentivized to learn representations that are not only modality-specific but also potentially meaningless or even adversarial to the overall objective of learning a joint representation space. This raises questions about the stability and convergence of the training process, as well as the generalizability of the learned representations.

### Experiments

1: **Missing comparisons for the main results.** In the introduction, the authors show the benefits of Barlow twins, like the fact that they don't need a large batchsize. A similar work, Mocov2 [1] (released in 2020), performs contrastive learning for self-supervised learning while reducing the necessity of a large batch size, which can also be included for comparison. In Table 2, the authors didn't compare the CLIP with the RGB-only scenario. It is important to include these comparisons to properly contextualize the performance of the proposed method against established baselines. The absence of these comparisons makes it difficult to assess the true contribution of the proposed method.

2: **Missing ablation studies of the effect of the common and unique features.** The decoupling is one of the main contributions in this work, while the analysis of the independent effects of the common and unique features is missed in the experiments part. What will the performance be if we only use the common or unique features for downstream tasks? Without this analysis, it is difficult to understand the individual contributions of the common and unique feature components to the overall performance of the model. This is crucial for validating the core claims of the paper regarding the benefits of decoupling.

### Analysis

1: **The T-SNE visualizations.** In Figure 1, the common features of all the modalities are the same color and shape, which makes it hard for me to judge whether the common parts are well aligned (the authors only show one case using an enlarged circle).

 2: **The Cross-modal representation alignment analysis isn't convincing.** The authors calculate the correlation score of every corresponding dimension across two modalities' embeddings to illustrate the effect of feature decoupling. In other words, the authors judge the methods based on the assumption that the i-th dimension of modality A's embedding is paired with the i-th dimension of modality B's embedding. However, there is no guarantee that such an assumption is established since the alignment performs at the image-level rather than the channel-level.

### Summary
This paper proposes a self-supervised learning method for radar-optical, RGB-elevation, and RGB-depth joint data understanding. The design is simple, by disentangling modality factors of and between modalities. Benefiting from the proposed pretraining framework, the performance improvements on the downstream tasks are impressive.

### Strengths
* This paper is focused on practical multi-sensor complementary. It's a meaningful research topic.

* Performance improvements on 3 multimodal scenarios are impressive.

* The authors also provide a detailed analysis of their proposed method. It's useful to the community and inspiring for follow-up works.

### Weaknesses
 * This paper lacks significant references, specifically, Omnivore [CVPR' 22] and ImageBind [CVPR'23] play an important role in this multimodal learning problem. However, neither was discussed in this paper.

* Technical contribution. It seems that the proposed DeCUR is the combination of CLIP [ICML'21] and SimCLR [ICML'20]. Please highlight the special design and insights.
