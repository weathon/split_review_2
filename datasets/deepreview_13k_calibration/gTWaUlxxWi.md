## Abstract
FL is a popular approach for training machine learning models on decentralized data. For communication efficiency, one-shot FL trades the iterative exchange of models between clients and the FL server for one single round of communication. However, one-shot FL does not perform as well as iterative FL, and struggles under high data heterogeneity. While ensembles have repeatedly appeared as strong contenders in one-shot FL literature, their full potential is still under-explored. In this work, we extensively examine federated ensembles across the heterogeneity spectrum, in conjunction with various aggregation functions from the ensemble literature, with a specific focus on cross-silo settings. Our experiments reveal that an aggregator based on a shallow neural network can significantly boost the performance of ensembles under high data heterogeneity. Through comprehensive evaluations on the CIFAR-10, SVHN and the cross-silo healthcare FLamby benchmark, we show that federated ensembles not only achieve up to 26% higher accuracy over current one-shot methods but can also match the performance of iterative FL under high data heterogeneity, all while being up to 9.1x more efficient in terms of communication due to their one-shot nature.

### Summary
In this paper, authors focus on one-shot federated ensumbles in hetergenous cross-silo settings. One shot federated ensumbles is different from traditional federated learning as it only utlize one rounds of communication/aggregating of locally trained models. In general ensumble framework is used in such one-shot setting. Authors propose a new aggregator which is based on a shallow neural network and which is shown to siginificantly boost the perforamnce of ensembles under high data hetergeneity. In all experiments and ablation studies, such proposed method indeed shows large improvement over exisiting baselines.

### Strengths
1: One shot federated learning is indeed a very important research direction in FL as it totally avoids the communication cost during training and potentially avoids all network limitation (such as network safety and stability). I think any research in this direction will be valuable for the FL community.

2: The proposed method, i.e. using a shallow network as aggregator, is very simple and straight forward, which also induces little additional inference cost.

3: Extensive ablation studies and real life task settings are always welcomed.  

4: Finally, a general strength for all ensemble methods is that they can support model hetergenorty and each client can utilize different size of model based on their computation capacity.

### Weaknesses
1: My major concern is that the novelty of the proposed method is very limited. Shallow network as aggregator has been widely used in other ensemble framework. More advanced methods such as using attention based aggregator have also been proposed. Thus, simply applying such method to FL setting is not a enough contribution (also I feel this also has been explored by previous papers).

2: It is also unclear what is the architecture of the proposed shallow network: does it only use the logits of all local models as input? Isn't it too limited? Why doesn't it utilize the information/embedding of input image? Again I think more research into the architecture of the aggregator is needed.
 
2: The model used in the experiments is very limited (ResNet-8). I feel it needs to include larger models and tested on larger dataset with more classes to really show its performance on hetergenous settings.

### Questions
Please see weakness section for more detailed questions.

Overall my major question is: what is the novelty of the proposed method compared with other ensemble method using network aggregator?

### Summary
This work proposed one-shot federated learning using an NN-based aggregator, which can significantly improve the performance of ensembles under high data heterogeneity. Extensive experiments were conducted to demonstrate the proposed method outperforms the baselines by a large margin.

### Strengths
1. Developed an NN-based aggregator, which can significantly improve the performance of ensembles under high data heterogeneity. 

2. Conduct extensive experiments to show the proposed method achieve better accuracy than baselines.

### Weaknesses
1. Why does FEDCVAE-ENS (ResNet-8) have lower estimation accuracy than FEDCVAE-ENS (default CNN)? Do you use the decoder of ResNet-8 in the experiments?

2. It is unfair to compare the proposed approach to a data-free FEDCVAE-ENS.

3. The technical contribution is somewhat limited. This work only adopted a simple NN to aggregate the outputs.

### Questions
1. Why do you set the batch size to 16?

2. Why does FEDCVAE-ENS (ResNet-8) have lower estimation accuracy than FEDCVAE-ENS (default CNN)? Do you use the decoder of ResNet-8 in the experiments?

### Summary
One-shot FL, i.e. aggregating models once at the end of federated learning, is known to be the best in terms of communication efficiency, but its performance is worse in general especially for heterogeneous data. The authors of this paper consider ensembles in the cross-silo heterogenous setting. They show experimentally that an aggregator based on a shallow neural nets significantly improve performance over one-shot FL, a method which they call FENS. It matches the performance of iterative FL and yet potentially uses 9x less communication. They report their results on various datasets and benchmarks such as CIFAR-10, SVHN, and FLamby.

### Strengths
- The usage of nonlinear aggregation is challenging and interesting, and it has some good potential. Finding a practical nonlinear aggregator method is an important direction to explore.
- The method particularly better on highly non-iid, which is a more challenging setting.
- The approach is intuitive and simple and easy to implement.
- This is an experimental paper, and I think that the experiment setup and results are explained very well.
- The experiments are reproducible, which is great. Unfortunately, the code is not shared in the supplementary materials.

### Weaknesses
 - FENS requires proxy dataset, which might not always be available.
- An MLP aggregator implies a large dimension of the inputs, which in turn imply that the "shallow" neural net aggregator might have a large number of parameters. For example, if the client's model has 10K parameters (which is not a lot in cross-silo), and there are 10 clients (also not a lot), then the input dimension itself is 100K, so your aggregator for this simple case will have at the very least 1 billion parameters, which is quite a lot of parameters for some shallow neural net.
- It might be unfair to compare with methods with no trainable aggregator and no proxy dataset. Perhaps you can compare to a one-shot FL algorithm with a fine-tuned aggregator? You can consider an experiment where you train an MLP aggregator vs. tune the weights of the non-trainable aggregator (i.e. training a linear aggregator) on some proxy dataset. Then you can consider another experiment where you just average the models at the end and simply train the averaged model on the proxy dataset. You should show that using an MLP aggregator is indeed a better way to improve performance. Finally, you should consider the effect of the size of the proxy dataset on the performance because you might not always get a 10% cut of the original data publicly available.
- I’m not sure about experiment 4.2 and whether it is conclusive or not. You can tell that the increase is larger for FENS, but maybe that’s only because FedAvg was already closer to its top performance. The reason there seems to be a larger increase might be due to the efficiency of FedAvg at learning from fewer samples more than it is due to the efficiency of FENS at learning faster with more samples. Moreover, in this particular experiment, FENS seems to be performing strictly worse than FedAvg in this example, which is not a strong selling point of the method no matter how quickly it improves, especially since the improvement plateaus before it reaches FedAvg.
- The authors need to explain the low performance on iid data in more details. It should still be good as this case is strictly easier. The trainable aggregator might be hurting performance in this case. Why is this the case? Perhaps it would be helpful to investigate this by running experiments similar to the ones proposed in the "Weaknesses" section above.

### Summary
The authors investigate in which situations iterative FL is truly needed wrt using different ensembling techniques (so-called one-shot FL) while focusing on the cross-silo FL setting. The authors identify scenarii with both toy datasets (SVHN and CIFAR-10) and realistic ones (FLamby) where ensembling is sufficient to match or outperform iterative FL.

### Strengths
The paper highlights a question that is interesting and still opens to this day: is it always worth going through all the troubles to do FL ? Can ensembles be sufficient ? Especially in medical settings where privacy is an issue.
The paper moves progressively from developing an intuition using toy datasets and then testing/validating this intuition on a more realistic dataset.
Experiments on data starvation and changing heterogeneity are interesting
The paper writing is fair and the paper is clear.

### Weaknesses
Major:
- The model fusion strategy labeled as FENS is a specific case of what we call "late fusion" in the multimodal ML literature (see i.e. the references 39 and 40 in [1]), which has been already explored in depth (see all the rich literature on various fusion modules Multimodal Low-rank Bilinear pooling (MLB) / Multimodal Compact Bilinear (MCB), Multimodal Tucker Fusion, Attention, etc.). 
The authors should orient the paper more towards examining late fusion schemes vs FL instead of proposing a new method because the method is far from new. In this respect the title of the article is fine: the focus should be on comparing ensembles to (iterative) FL. The reviewer encourages the authors to drop the term FENS and to either remove or considerably shorten the corresponding sections 3.2 and 3.3.
- It is very mysterious for the reviewer the impact of having access to Dproxy in the server. The reviewer questions even adding Dproxy in the first place as the question tackled by the paper should be whether ensembling methods can match FL and with the current framing it becomes: "what is the effect of post-training on another dataset ?".  If the authors want to use this Dproxy anyway they should add a comparison with an (iteratively)-FL trained model fine-tuned on Dproxy. Note that some concerns are also linked to the two first questions of the reviewer. Authors should change Figure 2b) to compare the best FL method (aka FedAdam) vs the best trained and the best untrained ensembling methods vs the best FL method fine-tuned on Dproxy.
- Experiments on FLamby are inconclusive at best FENS does seem to outperform FL methods on Camelyon16 for Fed-Heart Disease and Fed-ISIC it is not the case so that goes a bit in the opposite direction that the paper argues. Note that Fed-IXI and Fed-TCGA-BRCA are also part of FLamby and relatively small the reviewer would like experiments on such datasets in order to form a more complete picture. Figure 4 would also benefit from including non-trained aggregation methods.
- All the discussion on communication efficience Table 1 and 2 is wasteful. By design, ensembles will require order of magnitudes less communications no need to hammer the point with two tables at least they should go in the supplementary. If the authors want to keep it at least they should compare to efficient (sparse and quantified) iterative FL approach but the reviewer thinks this is not a very interesting thing to add to the paper.
- So many more experiments would be needed to make this paper into a great paper. The reviewer already mentioned other FLamby datasets but also different experiments varying the heterogeneity source between centers by introducing artificial spurious correlations would be interesting (aka in once center all SVHN images are red and the center has a majority of one digit). Are there scaling laws for FL to be preferred to ensembles, aka starting from which critical mass does FL become interesting ? Does it depend on the task ? Is there a good formula to predict the gap between FL and ensembles from say #samples in local centers and alpha ? Does this formula transfer to realistic settings ? What about differential privacy ? For a fixed privacy budget is it better to do ensemble ? This is such an interesting question and there are so few experiments in the paper !

Minor

- The argument on model reusability in the conclusion should be dropped nothing prevents from reusing an iteratively trained model. The argument on easier unlearning for ensembles is a bit far-fetched
- Fed-Camelyon16 learns on small (and not large) ResNet features extracted from large breast slides (and not brain !). Features are larger than traditional clinical data (relative) but not large (asolute)
- The reviewers encourage the authors to insist on the privacy aspect of the ensemble methods because the two real gains of FENS in medical settings is easier IT setup and contractualization and better privacy.

### Questions
- It is unclear to the reviewer whether Dproxy is contained in the local dataset used in FL for CIFAR-10/SVHN and FLamby experiments. Even for FLamby the sentence: "We note that clients in other FL algorithms use 100% of their local datasets for training" is unclear.
- Are error bars averaged across different random selection of Dproxys ?
