## Abstract
Crystals are the foundation of numerous scientific and industrial applications. While various learning-based approaches have been proposed for crystal generation, existing methods seldom consider the space group constraint which is crucial in describing the geometry of crystals and closely relevant to many desirable properties. However, considering space group constraint is challenging owing to its diverse and nontrivial forms. In this paper, we reduce the space group constraint into an equivalent formulation that is more tractable to be handcrafted into the generation process. In particular, we translate the space group constraint into two parts: the basis constraint of the invariant logarithmic space of the lattice matrix and the Wyckoff position constraint of the fractional coordinates. Upon the derived constraints, we then propose DiffCSP++, a novel diffusion model that has enhanced a previous work DiffCSP~\citep{jiao2023crystal} by further taking space group constraint into account. Experiments on several popular datasets verify the benefit of the involvement of the space group constraint, and show that our DiffCSP++ achieves promising performance on crystal structure prediction, ab initio crystal generation and controllable generation with customized space groups.

### Summary
The authors propose DiffSCP++ - building upon prior work DiffSCP (Jiao et al., 2023), to incorporate inductive biases of space group symmetries in a computationally tractable form for crystal generation. The primary goal in this work is to learn to sample (via diffusion) from a conditional distribution (given the finite space group) rather than an unconditional generation combined with E(n) equivariant networks. The authors do this by decomposing into two parts -  constraints based on an orthogonal group invariant exponential subspace and constraints of fractional coordinates. Subsequently, to tackle the crystal generation problem, the authors employ diffusion models to jointly generate the lattice, the fractional coordinates and atom types conditioned on the obtained constraints pertinent to the space group. The authors then present results on 4 different datasets, for two different tasks (crystal structure prediction and ab-initio crystal generation) where their model outperforms the compared baselines


Note to AC: My lower confidence rating is because of lack of expertise with literature relevant to crystal generation.

### Strengths
1. Most parts of the paper are well written and easy to comprehend for someone not familiar with crystal generation literature.
2. Employs a conditional generation model - which takes into account the space group constraints rather than treating the generation and the invariances as separate modules.
3. Compares to other recent works, such as PGCGM (Zhao et al., 2023) which also incorporate the affine matrices of the space
group as additional input into a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) model. The big plus of DiffSCP++ is that it is more widely applicable without being constrained to ternary systems.
4. Strong experimental results in comparison to DiffSCP (out of which the model was built out of) and other baselines in the crystal structure prediction task.

### Weaknesses
1. Proposition 1 and 2 - are simple extensions of two known results from linear algebra - why is this presented without citations - to linear algebra books from Strang, Roman, etc.? Specifically, Proposition 1, which discusses the polar decomposition of a matrix, is a standard result and should be cited appropriately. Similarly, while the specific choice of orthogonal bases in Proposition 2 might be tailored to the problem, the fact that the space of 3x3 symmetric matrices has dimension 6 is also a well-established result and should be acknowledged with proper citations to standard linear algebra texts. The presentation without citations gives the impression of a more novel result than is actually the case.
2. Novelty is definitely present - but not something completely unexpected and draws and builds upon existing literature

### Summary
A novel approach for crystal structure generation and ab-initio
crystal generation. The approach complements a recent solution based
on diffusion models with the support for space group
constraints. Experimental results confirm the potential of the
proposed solution.

### Strengths
Tackling a relevant application which requires non-trivial changes to existing solutions.

A sound and well-motivated approach.

Well-written and well organized manuscript.

### Weaknesses
The relationship of the method with DiffCSP, on which it builds,
should be better clarified, so as to more clearly highlight the
contribution of the space group constraint.

I am not entirely happy with how results are reported in Table 2. My
understanding is that given that the space group of the GT data is
typically not available, the real method is what you call DiffCSP++
(w/ CSPML) (which I would name DiffCSP++), and this is the method you
should compare with the competitors (with boldface for best performing
method etc).  The approach using GT space group (that you name
DiffCSP++) is an upper bound on the achievable performance, and should
be reported as such (including the discussion on future work about
better template-finding algorithm, that you already have in the paper).

This also affect table 3, in case DiffCSP++ uses GT space group and
this is not a kind of knowledge to be expected in ab-initio generation
(I do not know the domain).

### Questions
Does DiffCSP++ in Table 3 use GT space group? is this to be expected? 

Also, see weaknesses for clarification requests.

### Summary
This paper proposed to consider crystal symmetry group constraints during crystal structure prediction, and proposed decomposition technic to control the symmetry group for lattice and fractional coordinates of atoms in the cell. The idea is interesting and the performances beyond DiffCSP is reasonable and significant.

### Strengths
- The first crystal structure prediction method consider crystal symmetry groups.
- SOTA performances beyond DiffCSP.
- Interesting use of crystal symmetries, with controls that can be used during generation.

### Weaknesses
 - The model details are not provided, some details about the model are missing. This makes me a little confused about what kind of model they are using, e.g., invariant ones or Equivariant ones. Specifically, it's unclear how the model handles the rotational symmetry of the lattice when predicting the fractional coordinates. The description lacks details on how the invariant representation k is constructed and used within the message-passing framework. Furthermore, it is not clear whether the message passing module is equivariant with respect to the fractional coordinates, or how the relative fractional differences are computed and used in the message passing. 
- How they construct the crystal structures from reduced number of atoms N' is not clear. It's not explained how the Wyckoff positions are used to generate the full atomic structure. Specifically, the process of mapping the reduced set of atoms to the full set using symmetry operations is not detailed enough. The description should clarify how the fractional coordinates of the atoms within the same Wyckoff position are derived from the basic fractional coordinate and the symmetry operations.
