- Decision: Reject

## Abstract
We present a single attention head in GPT-2 Small that has one main role across the entire training distribution.
If components in earlier layers predict a certain token, and this token appears earlier in the context, the head suppresses it: we call this \gls{CopySuppression}.
Attention Head 10.7 (L10H7) suppresses naive copying behavior which improves overall model calibration. This explains why multiple prior works studying certain narrow tasks found negative heads that systematically favored the wrong answer.
We uncover the mechanism that the Negative Heads use for copy suppression with weights-based evidence
and are able to explain \xx\% of the impact of L10H7 in GPT-2 Small.
To the best of our knowledge, this is the most comprehensive description of the complete role of a component in a language model to date.
One major effect of copy suppression is its role in \selfrepair. \Selfrepairspace refers to how ablating crucial model components results in downstream neural network parts compensating for this ablation. Copy suppression leads to \selfrepair: if an initial overconfident copier is ablated, then there is nothing to suppress. We show that \selfrepairspace is implemented by several mechanisms, one of which is copy suppression, which explains 39\% of the behavior in a narrow task.

### Confidence
3: You are fairly confident in your assessment. It is possible that you did not understand some parts of the submission or that you are unfamiliar with some pieces of related work. Math/other details were not carefully checked.

### Summary
This paper examines a single attention head in GPT-2 small and identifies that it attempts to reduce the probability of previous tokens.

### Strengths
* The paper carefully examines a particular head, including analysis and visualizations.

### Weaknesses
I would like to preface the discussion here with the comment that perhaps I am not the ideal audience for this paper. But from my personal impression as someone familiar with language modeling, and also interested in model interpretability, I looked at the main contribution of the paper:

> Our central claim is that at least 76.9% of the role of attention head L10H7 on GPT-2 Small's training distribution is copy suppression.

and was left with the impression "I'm not sure why I care about this result?"
Here are several reasons why I'm not sure if this result is significant:

1.  "negative heads" and "anti-induction heads" have already been discussed in prior work. It was not clear to me what this work contributes on top of these works.
2.  It is not clear why we should care about a single head in GPT-2 Small (a model that few people use in practical settings anymore). If similar heads could be identified across a wider variety of models that would increase the generality and perhaps interest.
3.  Even if "1." and "2." is achieved, it is not clear to me how these findings would be actionable. I don't necessarily think that all interpretability research needs to be actionable, but it makes the relevance of the interpretations much more convincing if there is a path to better system building, more fair/generalizable models, etc.

### Questions
I would be interested in answers to my questions above.

### Summary
The paper introduces the concept of copy suppression, where a head suppresses a predicted token if it appears earlier in the context. The authors focus on Attention Head 10.7 (L10H7) in GPT-2 Small, which plays a crucial role in copy suppression throughout the training distribution (OpenWebText dataset is used). This head prevents naive token copying and corresponding analysis can explain negative heads in prior works. Moreover, the paper presents evidence of copy suppression's role in self-repair, where downstream neural network components compensate for crucial part ablation. In a narrow task, copy suppression explains 39% of the behavior.

### Strengths
1. This paper presents an interesting hypothesis called "copy suppression": If components in earlier layers predict a certain token, and this token appears earlier in the context, the head suppresses it. The paper conducts extensive experiments to verify this hypothesis. The results show that a single head can play a complete role, which helps deepen our understanding of attention heads.
2. Copy suppression helps to understand the self-repair phenomenon, and the author conducts a quantitative analysis on this topic.

### Weaknesses
1. The conclusions given in the paper about transferability across different model classes, sizes, and data are not clear. In my opinion, this is the biggest issue with this paper. Although the author's experiments involve other models such as GPT-2 medium and Pythia besides GPT-2 small, it still does not eliminate concerns about this issue. The unclear applicability of the conclusions makes it difficult to assess the paper's contribution. The experiments do not sufficiently demonstrate that copy suppression is a universal mechanism across diverse architectures, training datasets, and model scales. The limited number of models tested, particularly within the GPT family, leaves open the possibility that the observed behavior is specific to certain model configurations or training regimes. The lack of a systematic exploration of how different training data characteristics (e.g., size, domain, and pre-processing) affect copy suppression further limits the generalizability of the findings.
2. The presentation of this paper is not clear enough. For example, Figure 1 shows a illustration of L10H7's copy suppression mechanism, which is not easy for readers to understand. In Section 3.1, the WU matrix appears for the first time but without any clear explanation, which may cause difficulties for readers to understand. The description of the copy suppression mechanism in Figure 1 is too abstract and lacks concrete details. The figure does not clearly illustrate the process of how the attention head identifies and suppresses copied tokens. The introduction of the WU matrix without proper definition and context makes it difficult for the reader to grasp its role in the proposed mechanism. The paper should provide a more detailed explanation of the WU matrix, including its dimensions, how it is computed, and how it relates to the attention mechanism and token embeddings.

### Questions
1. The connection between copy suppression and self-repair may not be intuitive. Can authors elaborate on the relationship between copy suppression and self-repair? Also, what motivated authors to explore the role of copy suppression in self-repair?
2. Can authors provide one or two more possible scenarios where insights related to copy suppression might be helpful?

### Summary
This paper explores the main role of an attention head in an LLM across the entire training distribution. The authors explain "negative heads" and "anti-induction heads" as instances of copy suppression, and define "negative heads" as attention heads that primarily reduce the model's confidence in token completions. It can be defined by three steps, including prior coping, attention, and suppression.

They also apply weights-based arguments to explain the role of language model components. Experimental results show that about 77% of the role of attention head L10H7 on GPT-2 Small's training distribution is copy suppression, and copy suppression can explain about 40% of the self-repair phenomenon.

### Strengths
1. This paper defines copy suppression, namely the main role of an attention head across GPT-2 Small's training distribution. Then they apply weights-based arguments to analyze the hypotheses about copy suppression.

2. Experiments demonstrate that copy suppression explains 39% of self-repair in one setting and copy suppression with weights-based evidence and can explain 76.9% of the impact of L10H7 in GPT-2 Small.

### Weaknesses
This work only explores the findings on GPT2 models, and it would be better to verify it on more and larger models.

### Questions
Are there other attention heads that have similar effects of copy suppression?

Can we apply the findings to further improve models?

### Summary
This paper does a very deep and comprehensive analysis on an attention head (L10H7). It firstly defines its role as copy suppression. Then, the authors applied weights-based arguments using QK and OV circuits to mechanistically verify the hypotheses about the copy suppression. Finally, they showed how the analysis has applications to open problems in ablation-based interpretability.

### Strengths
The analysis did in the paper is very insightful and interesting. It analyzed the behaviors of an attention head in a very innovative way. The proposed hypotheses are also well justified with further analysis. Considering understanding LLM can be essential to the model safety, I believe this paper would provide helpful perspectives to the community.

### Weaknesses
The paper is limited to a very specific model architecture and probably checkpoint, so whether the conclusion is generalizable and the method is scalable is questionable.

### Questions
While reading the paper, I was wondering how did you find and choose to target L10H7?
