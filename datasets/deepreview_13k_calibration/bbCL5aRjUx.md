## Abstract
Despite the remarkable capabilities of deep neural networks in image recognition, the dependence on activation functions remains a largely unexplored area and has yet to be eliminated.
On the other hand, Polynomial Networks is a class of models that does not require activation functions, but have yet to perform on par with modern architectures. In this work, we aim close this gap and propose \modelnamePM, which relies \emph{solely} on multilinear operators. The core layer of \modelnamePM, called \layer, captures multiplicative interactions of the elements of the input token. \modelnamePM{} captures high-degree interactions of the input elements and we demonstrate the efficacy of our approach on a series of image recognition and scientific computing benchmarks. The proposed model outperforms prior polynomial networks and performs on par with modern architectures. We believe that \modelnamePM{} can inspire further research on models that use entirely multilinear operations.

### Summary
The authors propose a multilinear operator network which avoids nonlinear interactions. The architecture makes use of "Poly-blocks" composed of "Mu layers" which can capture up to fourth degree multiplicative interactions in input tokens. The authors demonstrate that their multilinear networks are competitive against other polynets, traditional MLPs, and ResNets on tasks such as image classification and ODE problems.

### Strengths
1. The Mu layer design is simple enough and the theory underlying the layer is well-proven and explained.
2. The MONets appear to be quite competitive against a variety of baselines on a wide array of tasks. 
3. The number of FLOPs and memory required to operate the MONet are drastically reduced compared to other baselines.

### Weaknesses
1. Fundamentally, it's unclear why the MONet should generalize well to other tasks if the Poly-block is only capturing up to fourth degree interactions. For instance, for general MLPs, results such as Cybenko's theorem tells us the MLP should capture many families of Lebesgue integrable functions but here the limit is restricted to functions that are captured by compositions of fourth degree approximations and skip connections. The surprising capacity of the MONet is not adequately discussed. It is not sufficient to simply state that the composition of multiple poly-blocks results in higher degree interactions; a more rigorous analysis of the effective degree and its relation to the network's capacity is needed. Specifically, how does the network avoid overfitting when approximating high-degree polynomials with a fixed architecture? Furthermore, the authors should discuss how the specific choice of fourth-degree interactions impacts the expressiveness and generalization of the network compared to other polynomial degrees. 

2. The numbers reported for the P-Nets [1] do not appear to be accurate. With >11 parameter P-Nets, the achievable accuracy on CIFAR-10 is 94.5% and ImageNet ~77% Top-1 accuracy/ ~94% Top-5 accuracy. The exact accuracies reported in [1] would either closely-defeat or match the performance of the MONets with similar or drastically fewer numbers of parameters. Please address this discrepancy. The reported results for P-Nets without activation functions are not representative of the method's potential. The authors should clarify why they chose to compare against a restricted version of P-Nets, especially given that the original paper [1] emphasizes the importance of activation functions in achieving high accuracy. This raises concerns about the fairness of the comparison and whether the reported performance differences are due to architectural choices or simply due to the use of a weaker baseline. Similarly, the ResNet 50 numbers are reported strangely. It can be easily fine-tuned to achieve 78.8%/94.5% Top1/5 accuracies, respectively, but this is not in concordance with Table 2. The authors should justify their choice of using a specific ResNet-50 accuracy, especially when higher accuracies are readily achievable with standard fine-tuning techniques. This lack of clarity undermines the validity of the comparison and makes it difficult to assess the true performance of the proposed MONet architecture.

### Questions
Please see weaknesses. Is there some intentional restriction placed on the P-Net method? I believe you have pulled the numbers from [2], which is also in discrepancy with the first work (by the same authors, no less). Similarly, the ResNet 50 numbers are reported strangely. It can be easily fine-tuned to achieve 78.8%/94.5% Top1/5 accuracies, respectively, but this is not in concordance with Table 2.

### Summary
The authors propose MONet, a Polynomial Network architecture that outperforms prior polynomial networks on image recognition tasks. The model uses stacked "multi-linear" operations to learn representations. The authors compare MONet models to state-of-the-art image classification models such as MLPMixer and ViT-16/B on image classification tasks, such as ImageNet1K and CIFAR10, along with medical image classification with MedMNIST and scientific computing with Neural ODE solver.

### Strengths
* Achieves impressive results on ImageNet1K compared to existing polynomial network work compared to vision transformer and CNN baselines, notably better particularly in Top-5 accuracy, which should be the more informative metric.
* Some good results in some of the categories for ImageNet-C under some image corruptions, such as weather and digital.
* Results are compared with state-of-the-art image classification baseline models such as MLPMixer and ViTs amongst others.
* Results are demonstrated on more than CIFAR-10/ImageNet with a tiny medical image classification dataset, and more interestingly, in the task of solving an ODE.
* FLOPS analysis is given (and it is reasonable) in the appendix, and is presented along with model size in parameters when comparing with models in e.g. Table 2. FLOPS/parameters appear reasonable in Table 1 compared to other models, however it seems perhaps VRAM usage is much more (see below), which is practically the bottleneck in most GPU-based training.
* One area where MONets may have more interpretability might be useful is in very specific cases, such as particular ODEs, that have a similar polynomial representation (as demonstrated in 4.4), but this seems like a very niche case.
* An Ablation analysis on the proposed methodology in the architecture is performed.

### Weaknesses
 * This is a poorly written and organized paper as it is, which unfortunately lets down what appear to be some very good results, and perhaps an interesting method/model architecture.
* Virtually no motivation for the work aside from making polynomial networks have better generalization. We are given a sentence in the introduction "Interpretability and encryption..." with no reasons at all given as to why the proposed model architecture would be any more amenable to interpretation or encryption, and certainly no such results/analysis. Even the most academic work needs motivation. Getting closer to reaching state-of-the-art performance on some task alone is not enough of a motivation for a method if there are no tangible benefits over existing methods (and especially when it seems there are disadvantages in memory usage as covered below).
* Similarly, why are we interested in getting rid of activation functions? No motivation is given for this explicitly, and the only reason I can think of given the interpretability word is to remove non-linearity in the mapping from input to output. A sentence in the conclusion backs this up: "which avoids the requirement for activation functions or other non-linear mappings". However, the "multilinear" operation in this work is itself still a non-linear mapping of input to output (a polynomial of degree 2), making this statement false.
* The background is *way* too short and doesn't give near enough information on the current work's context in polynomial network literature.
* While the method is detailed enough, with much more detail in the appendix on some of the most interesting bits, the paper doesn't explain much at all what specifically is different from current polynomial networks, seemingly assuming the reader should know this. It is up to the authors to explain how their method fits into the current research literature in the background and method and compare their method explicitly with the closest existing work in literature.
* Requires 4 A100 GPUs to train for a batch size of 448 according to the authors (and they say they maximize batch size). This means that the maximum batch size on each GPU is 112. This is **much more VRAM usage** than the baselines being compared to that are achieving similar accuracy on ImageNet1K - for example, ViT B/16 can fit with a batch size of 256 on a single A100, and ResNet-50 a batch size of 512 on a single A100. Note it is not clear if these are 40GB or 80GB A100 models.
* Bold figures in captions are misleading, and do not it turns out always represent the best result as you might expect! For example, in Table 2

### Questions
* How is Mu-Layer novel compared to existing polynomial network architectures? Is the polynomial representation learned different, and why? 
* What is the VRAM usage of the MONet models compared to baselines in Table 1, does it need much more VRAM in practice to train than those baselines?
* Why should be be interested in training ImageNet1K with MoNet instead of ViT or ResNet 50 which get comparable performance? In other words motivate your research work and method.
* Explain the statement "...which avoids the requirement for activation functions or other non-linear mappings" in the conclusion. How is a polynomial mapping linear, or am I misunderstanding this statement?
* Why are activation problems interesting to remove?
* How are MONets more interpretable in the general case?
* How are MONets more amenable to encryption than other models?

### Summary
This paper introduces a novel polynomial network called MONet, which exclusively relies on multilinear operators. The core layer of MONet is capable of capturing high-degree multiplicative channel-mixing operations for tokens, enabling non-linearity and, as a result, eliminating the need for activation layers. Extensive experiments were conducted on various image recognition and scientific computing benchmarks, demonstrating superior performance compared to previous polynomial networks and achieving results on par with state-of-the-art CNNs and Transformers.

### Strengths
1. The efficiency of this network design is truly impressive. In ImageNet, the Multi-stage MONet-S achieves performance comparable to the state-of-the-art, all without the use of any activations. It's also worth noting its robustness to image corruptions. When applied to solving ODEs, its performance appears strong based on the provided cases. The extensive experiments seem to highlight numerous promising characteristics of this new design, which warrant further exploration.
2. MONet simplifies prior polynomial networks by utilizing mu-layers. It appears reasonable that mu-layers are designed to accommodate only two-degree polynomials, as stacking these mu-layers enables high-order interactions.

### Weaknesses
1. In mu-layer, is it possible to use low-rank matrices multiplication for A? How will it perform
2. Is it feasible to employ low-rank matrix multiplication for A in the mu-layer? How would this alternative approach perform?
3. In the ODE experiments, could the authors offer more detailed quantitative results and compare them with other state-of-the-art methods, such as NeuralODE?
4. In the ODE experiment setup, is it necessary to use patch embeddings? Could you please provide additional details about the data processing and experimental settings for this specific task?

### Questions
1. In solving ODE, could the authors provide more details regarding how the model recovers the right-hand side of the Lotka-Volterra formula?
