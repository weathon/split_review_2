## Abstract
With significant advancements in diffusion models, addressing the potential risks of dataset bias becomes increasingly important. Since generated outputs directly suffer from dataset bias, mitigating latent bias becomes a key factor in improving sample quality and proportion. This paper proposes time-dependent importance reweighting to mitigate the bias for the diffusion models. We demonstrate that the time-dependent density ratio becomes more precise than previous approaches, thereby minimizing error propagation in generative learning. While directly applying it to score-matching is intractable, we discover that using the time-dependent density ratio both for reweighting and score correction can lead to a tractable form of the objective function to regenerate the unbiased data density. Furthermore, we theoretically establish a connection with traditional score-matching, and we demonstrate its convergence to an unbiased distribution. The experimental evidence supports the usefulness of the proposed method, which outperforms baselines including time-independent importance reweighting on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, FFHQ, and CelebA with various bias settings.

### Summary
The paper proposes a time-dependent importance-sampling objective for diffusion models, to mitigate the bias in the training set. The idea is to estimate the time-dependent importance weights between the bias distribution and the true (unbiased) distribution. The importance-weighted score-matching objective is then translated into a corresponding denoising score-matching objective. Controlled experiments showcase the effectiveness of the proposed method.

### Strengths
- The paper proposes a new denoising score-matching objective to tackle the biases in the training set.

- In contrast to the previous method (Eq.7), the proposed method estimates the time-dependent density ratio, which is arguably easier to estimate.

- Experiments on CIFAR-10/CIFAR-100/FFHQ demonstrate that the proposed method (TIW-DSM) not only outperforms baselines with solely reference unbiased data but also beats the vanilla go-to method IW-DSM.

### Weaknesses
 - The biggest concern I have is that the proposed methods lack practical significance, and seem tangent to practical settings. The biases problem studies in this paper go away when considering conditional generation (e.g., text-to-image generation). For example, we can generate a batch of male images by conditioning on the "male" label, even though the female images are the majority. 


- Regarding comparison to baseline (IW-DSM), some of the claimed advantages are not rigorous：(1) On page 4, "the perturbation provides an infinite number of samples from each distribution.": note that the perturbed distribution is $p_{data} * N(0, \sigma_t^2)$, one would still need large amount of data in $p_{data}$ (or $D_{ref}$) in order to estimate quantities related to $p_{data} * N(0, \sigma_t^2)$. (2) It's true that the accumulated MSE error in the density ratio estimation is smaller in the proposed method, but it introduces an additional erroneous term $\nabla \log w$ in the new objective. It could result in an even larger error compared to the baseline.

- Fig. 8.(a): I think a better density ratio estimator can get away from this over-confidence issue. A simple method is to regularize the classifier such that it cannot perfectly distinguish the two distributions.


- A natural baseline missing in the paper is asking generative models (e.g. SDXL) to generate more unbiased data for the considered small datasets and train the model in the vanilla DSM way.

### Questions
- For the experiments, do the authors generate 50k images to calculate the FID score? What's the architecture and noisy schedule used in this paper? The current FID score seems quite worse off.

- How can this method be used in practical text-to-image generation?

### Summary
The paper proposes time-dependent importance reweighting to mitigate the dataset bias for diffusion training. The proposed method utilizes time-dependent density ratio estimation, which is more precise than the previous time-independent one used in GAN. The authors provide both theoretical understanding and empirical demonstrations of the proposed method's benefits.

### Strengths
1. The paper is very well-written and easy to follow. I really enjoy the presentation flow and the thought process from Eq.7 to Eq.9 to Eq.10, with clear reasoning behind each change.
2. The method is intuitive and simple, yet clever and effective. Utilization of importance sampling by time-dependent density ratio estimation (DRE) in diffusion models is novel and natural. DRE becomes more precise as $t$ becomes larger.
3. I also appreciate the authors' efforts in providing toy examples and figures, which further makes the paper easy to understand.
4. The problem the paper proposes to study is an important one, as real-world datasets are never short of biases, especially the unannotated ones.
5. The proposed method's empirical performance is convincing. I also appreciate the inclusion of Eq.7 training numbers for the ablation study.

### Weaknesses
I do not have any major complaints. I list my minor questions and suggestions in the Questions section below.

### Questions
1. I can see the arguments for time-dependent density ratio estimation the same as the ones for [1] (especially), [2], etc. Thus I suggest the authors make the citations and discussions accordingly. Nonetheless, I agree that the use case of DRE is different.
2. In theory, the method works if $E_{x_0 \sim p_{\textrm{bias}}(x_0|x_t)} [\nabla\log p(x_t|x_0)] = \nabla\log p_{\textrm{bias}}^t(x_t)$ and DRE's gradient actually contains $\nabla\log p_{\textrm{data}}^t(x_t)$ information. Both require DRE to be really accurate, which, as the authors demonstrate, is reasonably true only for large $t$. Thus, might I suggest that the authors only train with Eq.10 for large $t$, and revert back (gradually) to standard diffusion training on the biased dataset for small $t$? The intuition is that for small $t$, the model only does denoising, which does not care about dataset biases (the model has already decided on the content it wants to generate). For an intuitive understanding, see Fig.2 in [3]. For a more theoretical explanation see [4], where small $t$'s score field is dominated by one sample, making the score for unbiased the same as biased here.
3. In Fig.4, every method's performance peaks early and gets worse. This is unexpected for me. Could the authors provide an explanation?

### Confidence
3: You are fairly confident in your assessment. It is possible that you did not understand some parts of the submission or that you are unfamiliar with some pieces of related work. Math/other details were not carefully checked.

### Summary
This paper proposed a method to train an unbiased diffusion model with a weak supervision setting based on a sampling process that they called time-independent importance reweighting. They first analyzed why they should use the time-independent importance reweighting, then how to apply score matching to the reweighting process.

### Strengths
1. The paper builds on successful recent advances in diffusion models, which excel in high-fidelity image generation within generative learning frameworks. Thus, the proposed TIW method shows promise for diverse applications, including text-to-image generation, image-to-image translation, and video generation.
2. The paper addresses the understudied issue of dataset bias in generative modeling, introducing a method to enhance the fairness and reliability of ML systems.
3.The paper establishes a theoretical equivalence between the proposed method and existing score-matching objectives from unbiased distributions, which could provide a strong foundation for the validity of their approach.

### Weaknesses
1. The paper builds upon a large body of previous work, which while showing the paper’s relevance, also means that any limitations or issues in those previous works could potentially affect the validity and effectiveness of TIW. The actually implementation process is similar to previous work on GAN.
2. The paper shows that it mitigates the bias in the dataset, but I am not sure whether that method would influence the overall generation quality. It is important to see detailed qualitative and quantitative analysis.

### Summary
This paper addresses the issue of dataset bias in diffusion models. Authors introduces a novel method called Time-dependent Importance reWeighting (TIW). This method, leveraging a time-dependent density ratio, offers improvements in both reweighting and score correction processes. One of its major contributions is making the weighting objective more manageable and drawing a theoretical link to traditional score-matching objectives that aim for unbiased distributions. Experiments shows TIW outperforms other baselines.

### Strengths
1. The problem this paper tries to address is important.

2. The methodology introduced is innovative.

3. This research creates a theoretical bridge between the proposed objective and the conventional score-matching objectives, offering a robust guarantee.

4. Extensive testing of the method across diverse datasets and under varied conditions underscores its robustness and versatility.

5. Preliminary results from the experiments are encouraging.

### Weaknesses
1. Introducing time-dependent methods might lead to heightened computational complexities in contrast to their time-independent counterparts. It would be beneficial to include a comparative analysis or discussion addressing this aspect, specifically detailing the increase in training time and memory overhead, and whether this impacts practical applicability.

2. One pivotal query that emerges is whether the efficiency and overall success of the proposed method are intrinsically tied to the performance of the time-dependent discriminator. It would be enlightening to elucidate this relationship, particularly how the discriminator's training progress and accuracy affect the diffusion model's performance, and if there are any failure modes or sensitivity to discriminator quality.

3. There's a pertinent concern regarding the model's robustness. If the model isn't aptly regularized or subjected to limited training data, it might inadvertently heighten the risk of overfitting. It would be beneficial to see a more thorough analysis of the model's sensitivity to different regularization techniques, training set sizes, and noise schedules, and how these factors interact with the proposed method.

4. The research paper titled "Fair Diffusion" by Friedrich et al. [1] is notably aligned with the theme of fairness in diffusion models. However, its conspicuous absence in the current work, either as a benchmark or a referenced study, is intriguing. The authors might want to consider explicating their rationale behind not incorporating it as a baseline or offering a comparative analysis, especially given its relevance to the problem of bias in diffusion models.

### Questions
Can this method be transferred to other models like GAN-based model?
