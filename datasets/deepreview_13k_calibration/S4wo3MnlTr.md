## Abstract
We present a novel technique for exercising greater control of the weights of ReLU activated neural networks to produce more accurate function approximations. Many theoretical works encode complex operations into ReLU networks using smaller base components. In these works, a common base component is a constant width approximation to $x^2$, which has exponentially decaying error with respect to depth. We extend this block to represent a greater range of convex one-dimensional functions. We derive a manifold of weights such that the output of these new networks utilizes exponentially many piecewise-linear segments. This manifold guides their training process to overcome drawbacks associated with random initialization and unassisted gradient descent. We train these networks to approximate functions which do not necessarily lie on the manifold, showing a significant reduction of error values over conventional approaches.

### Summary
This paper studies the approximation ability of ReLU networks by encoding complex operations into ReLU networks using smaller base components. The derivation in this paper can produce networks with exponentially many piecewise-linear segments. The author claims that Their construction can enable the training process to overcome drawbacks associated with random initialization. The authors conduct the experiments on some synthetic datasets.

### Strengths
- This paper is well organized and has clear illustration figures.  

- This paper only requires four neurons per layer to approximate.

- According to Tables, the constructed neuron networks can achieve better performance when approximating the simple function such as $y=x^3$, $y = x^{11}$, $y = \sin(x)$, $y = \tanh(x)$.

### Weaknesses
1. The proposed optimization approach can be more useful if the reparameterization argument can be extended to high dimensional problems. It would be clearer for the reader if the authors can describe the main difficulties of such extension. Specifically, the current reparameterization seems to rely heavily on the one-dimensional nature of the input space, and it is not immediately clear how this would generalize to higher dimensions where the notion of a 'sawtooth' function becomes less intuitive. The paper should discuss whether the differentiability constraint, which is derived from an analysis of an infinite-layer ReLU network in one dimension, can be similarly derived or adapted for higher dimensional inputs. Furthermore, the computational cost of maintaining this constraint in higher dimensions should be addressed.

2. The nonlinear functions picked in Section 4.2 seem to be simple. It would be more convincing if the authors could also show superior performance for complicated nonlinear functions. Is preserving the linear segments truly beneficial for learning general nonlinear functions? I think a discussion of the function family that is friendly to the proposed method is important. For instance, the paper could benefit from a discussion about the types of nonlinearities that are well-approximated by piecewise linear functions with a large number of segments, and whether the proposed method is particularly suited for functions with specific frequency characteristics or local variations. The limitations of the method should be explored by testing on functions with varying degrees of complexity and smoothness.

### Questions
- The author claims that their results are minimally probabilistic and thus can prevent weight collapse. Why? How to understand this claim, and which theorem supports it? The authors may better add some comments or remarks about that. 

- The authors propose a new architecture, but how to initialize it, can it be potentially extended to other structures like CNN or transformer?

### Summary
A ReLU network trained with gradient descent in the parameter space does not efficiently leverage the usage of the linear segments given by ReLUs. To address this issue, the paper proposes a new reparameterization such that the output of a ReLU network is guaranteed to output a sawtooth-like function with exponentially many more linear segments as depth is increased. Since this procedure also creates many more discontinuities on the optimization landscape, a differentiability constraint is added to the reparameterization to steer the solution away from bad local minima. Such a constraint is derived from analyzing the derivative of an infinite-layer ReLU network. A theorem about this differentiability constraint is proved. Computer simulations are also provided to evaluate the proposed reparameterization. Several nonlinear functions are tested, and the results are promising.

### Strengths
- Originality: Most existing approximation results rely on the base function $x^2$, however, the structure of this base function can be destroyed by gradient descent and then hinder the approximation performance. This paper provides a novel optimization approach that constrains the optimization on a low-dimensional manifold such that superior approximation performance can be achieved. This new method is new in the sense that the exponentially many linear segments of a sawtooth-like function are preserved during training. Furthermore, along with a novel differentiability constraint, bad local minima can be avoided.

- Quality and clarity: This paper gives a comprehensive presentation on the approximation results of ReLU networks based on $x^2$. Using that argument, the paper seamlessly leads the read to understand how exponentially many linear segments can be preserved by designing a low-dimensional manifold. The part where the authors limit the manifold further with a differentiability constraint is also well presented. The whole paper is fairly well-written and easy to follow. I very much enjoy reading the paper.

- Significance: This new low-dimensional manifold idea greatly improves the optimization accuracy of ReLU networks for nonlinear function approximation. The improvements are significant, and the results are well supported by the theoretical justification in the paper.

### Weaknesses
As for the current manuscript, the optimization and generalization property of such initialization is not sufficiently explored. Right now, only synthetic experiments are provided on some simple setting. Based on those simple setting, it seems that we can optimize the manifold, however, how hard it is to optimize such manifold in the real world setting is worth further studying. Further, in practice, the goal of people training a network is to hope the network can generalize. It is worth further investigation on the generalization property of the network. Since the network output has exponentially many linear region (and thus more capacity to fit), one may suspect that the network is highly vulnerable to input noise such that network overfits the data and is not able to generalize.

### Questions
1. Is the proposed method sensitive to the selection of optimizer? Can SGD yield the same performance?

2. How many bits are used to represent the weights in the ReLU network?

3. The performance is reported in mean and min. How is the worst-case scenario? Perhaps adding the max metric in Appendix.

4. Please add a subtitle to Figure 5 to indicate which of them is using the differentiable manifold.

5. Section 2.1, there is a typo in “Since each layer converts …”

6. Section 3.1 page 5, where is the definition of W(x)?

7. Lemma 3.3 For all x…

8. Given the fractal nature of the sawtooth-like function, would the proposed method demonstrate superior performance on some fractal functions? For example, the Cantor function.

### Summary
This paper presents a trainable manifold with ReLU networks for function approximations, by reparameterizing the ReLU networks. This work is built upon the previous work on constructing the weights of the ReLU networks such that the network can generate triangle waves (Telgarsky 2015) which can be utilized to show an exponential separation between deep and shallow ReLU networks. The trainable parameters of the networks are $a_i$ which control the center of the triangle and $s_i$ which is the coefficient of the depth-$i$ composition of the triangle waves. Hanin and Rolnick, 2019 shows that the number of expected number of linear regions in a randomly initialized ReLU network does not scale exponentially with depth. Thus, the benefit of using the reparameterization (the authors proposed in this work) is that the output will have an exponential number of line segments. The authors show by their experiments that their initialization is able to produce smaller MSE error.

### Strengths
I personally find this idea of initializing the network to be on a manifold with exponential number of linear region novel and interesting, which connects theory and practice.

### Weaknesses
As for the current manuscript, the optimization and generalization property of such initialization is not sufficiently explored. Right now, only synthetic experiments are provided on some simple setting. Based on those simple setting, it seems that we can optimize the manifold, however, how hard it is to optimize such manifold in the real world setting is worth further studying.

Since the network output has exponentially many linear region (and thus more capacity to fit), one may suspect that the network is highly vulnerable to input noise such that network overfits the data and is not able to generalize.

### Questions
I find the second paragraph of section 4.1 confusing. In table 1, what is the difference between default network and stage 3 (GD only)? The default network is Kaiming initialized but the stage 3 network is initialized with exponential number of linear region?

### Summary
This paper discusses the learnability of a simple neural network architecture. Specifically the problem of fitting a quadratic function is of interest. This paper proposes a compositional network architecture where each base component is composed by four simple linear or nonlinear activation functions, and that the neural network architecture is replication of the base component. The paper demonstrates its learnability, in other words the power of this architecture that approximates a quadratic function.

### Strengths
I think this paper is readable and intuitive. Although it discusses a simple model, it is astonishing that the application of a single model can fit a different function with fast approximation rate. The content is precise and self-consistent, and there are many figures and discussions that help readers go through the approximation process. The proof is mathematically correct.

### Weaknesses
I think it would be great to discuss this paper in a bigger picture, for example, how does the power of approximation of this model architecture compare with other kinds of neural networks, especially how does it present a tradeoff between learnability and simpleness, and why is this architecture of interest. Since today's neural networks are complicated and they perform well with a lot of reasons, while this unusual neural network is seldomly used, how is the proof in this paper share the light on the analysis of other types of neural network models, and how does it guide the selection of neural network architectures, training algorithms, and the simple complexities required to train a model without overfitting etc.? With the answers to the above questions, I think the importance of this paper is better presented.
