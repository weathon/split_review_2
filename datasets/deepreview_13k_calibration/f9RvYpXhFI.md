## Abstract
We develop methods for estimating Fréchet bounds on (possibly high-dimensional) distribution classes in which some variables are continuous-valued. We establish the statistical correctness of the computed bounds under uncertainty in the marginal constraints and demonstrate the usefulness of our algorithms by evaluating the performance of machine learning (ML) models trained with programmatic weak supervision (PWS). PWS is a framework for principled learning from weak supervision inputs (e.g., crowdsourced labels, knowledge bases, pre-trained models on related tasks, etc.), and it has achieved remarkable success in many areas of science and engineering. Unfortunately, it is generally difficult to validate the performance of ML models trained with PWS due to the absence of labeled data. Our algorithms address this issue by estimating sharp lower and upper bounds for performance metrics such as accuracy/recall/precision.

### Summary
The paper studies the problem of estimating Frechet bounds. In short, the idea is that we want to evaluate the expectation of a function g(X,Y,Z) with respect to some unknown joint distribution $P_{X,Y,Z}$, but we only have access to some information about this joint distribution, e.g., $P_{Y}$, $P_{Y|Z}$, and $P_{X,Z}$. In Frechet bounds, we compute an upper bound $U$ and lower bound $L$ to the value of this expectation by considering respectively the higher value of the expectation and lower value of this expectation that can be obtained by a joint distribution $P'_{X,Y,Z}$ that satisfies the information that we are given about the marginals.

The paper provides a computationally efficient method to estimate those upper bound $U$ and lower bound $L$ from a set of samples that are used to estimate those marginal informations. Under some assumptions, it also shows asymptotic convergence results of those estimated lower and upper bound to the true values $L$ and $U$ to the their true value when the number of samples goes to infinity.

The estimation of the Frechet bounds is showcased for the problem of evaluating programmatic weak supervision methods. In weak supervision, a classification model $h : X \mapsto Y$ is trained only using the information Z provided by a set of weak supervision sources, since there is no labeled data. While programmatic weak supervision is an important method in practice with a lot of useful applications, it is hard to evaluate the performance of a trained classifier due to the lack of labeled data.

Even without labeled data, the Frechet bounds can be used to upper bound and lower bound  the expected accuracy of a classifier h with the function g(X,Y,Z) = 1(h(X) = Y). The paper shows a practical application of this idea in different benchmark datasets used in weak supervisions. This method can enable the practitioners to evaluate the weak classifiers in a weak supervision setting without access to labeled data.

### Strengths
The paper studies a very important problem. Programmatic weak supervision is a method of paramount importance in practice, and the lack of labeled data makes it hard to validate the performance of those models. The paper proposes a general method that can also be used to address this issue.

I think the use of optimistic and pessimistic argument on the missing information (i.e., the missing information of the joint distribution X x Y x Z) to provide bounds is a clever and practical way to get around the lack of information. The paper provides a theoretical discussion of their estimator with respect to computability and asymptotic convergence. I found the application of the smoothing operation to simplify the problem while maintaining approximation guarantees (2.3) very interesting.

While the paper provides some theoretical results on their estimator, I think that the main strength of the paper lies in the empirical evaluation. In particular, I think that the plots of Figure 1 on benchmark weak supervision dataset illustrate the strength of their methods in providing useful information about the accuracy of the weak supervision classifier.

### Weaknesses
(1) While I think that the paper is overall well-written, and it is easy to understand its contribution, I think that the presentation is lacking in some parts.

In my opinion, the paper provides no intuition behind the Frechet bounds and what they represent, and what information they are providing in the weak supervision setting. The current explanation lacks a clear connection to the practical implications for evaluating weak supervision models. It would be beneficial to elaborate on how the bounds relate to the uncertainty in the weak supervision process and how they can be used to guide model selection or improvement.

In my interpretation, we assume to have access to (or an estimate of)  $P(Y|Z)$, $P(Y)$, and $P(X,Z)$. Let's say that as a function $g$, we use the accuracy $g(X,Y,Z)$ = indicator$( h(X) = Y)$. From  the definition, Frechet bounds look at the "worst-case" and "best-case" joint distribution $X \times Y \times Z$ with respect to the value of the expectation of the function g. In this case, the information on the label $Y$ is given by $Z$. From my intuition (possibly wrong), the worst-case (lower-bound) is given by trying to get as much as possible $g(X) = 0$  (we make a mistake) whenever $h(X)$ is different from the most likely value of $Y$ given by  $P(Y|Z)$. Analogous intuition for the upper bound. In particular, it looks like the gap between the lower bound and upper bound depend on "how much" the output of the classifier $h(X)$ differs from $P(Y|Z)$ given a sample $(X,Z)$. If this interpretation is correct, then it looks like that the lower bound and upper bounds are informative (i.e., close to one another) only if $h(X)$ follows the output of the labels $P(Y|Z)$, in which case it is not clear what is the advantage of training a classifier h.

------

(2) I think that the assumption that we can estimate $P_{X,Z}$ is too strong and not necessary (and not really used).

If $X$ is highly dimensional (i.e. images), it is impossible to estimate this distribution within any reasonable finite sample size. I do not think that this assumption is actually necessary for the scope of this paper, in fact all the applications of the results could be formulated substituting $X$ with $h(X)$, in which case $h(X)$ has the same support than the label space Y. In fact, for precision recall etc, we only need to consider a function$ g(Y',Y,Z)$ where $Y'$ is the output of the classifier that is being evaluated. The paper should clarify the practical implications of this assumption and whether the method is still applicable when $P_{X,Z}$ cannot be accurately estimated. The current presentation gives the impression that a full joint distribution needs to be estimated, which is not feasible in many real-world scenarios.

I find it surprising that the results do not add any assumption on estimating the distribution $(X,Z)$ as this is a very hard problem in general. I think this is due to the fact that we never actually estimate the distribution itself, but we simply evaluate the function g that is bounded. This is a bit misleading with the introduction, where it is written that we use an estimate of $P(X,Z)$.

------

(3) I think that the Appendix section with the proof of the results is not well written nor easy to follow. I believe that the paper would greatly benefit from having a more organized proof structure, so that an interested reader can learn about the techniques used.

As an example, results from other papers are often used (e.g., Beiglbock & Schachermayer for  proof of Theorem 2.1). It takes a lot of effort by the reader to understand the applications of those results, as these cited theorem use some assumptions, have different notation, and it is not immediately straightforward how they are translated to this paper setting. For readability, It would be easier to say something along the lines "since [... these assumptions hold ...] then we can apply this result from [citation] that says: "

Another example is the Proof of Theorem 2.4 (e.g., sequence of equations of page 16, or the sequence of Theorem and Lemmas). It would be easier if the proof is organized in a way such that it is easy to follow and understand the different parts of the proof.

----

(4) Concerns on the experiments.

In the experimental evaluation, only four datasets from Wrench are used. Wrench provides a lot of different datasets, it is not clear why only 4 were selected for the evaluation, and why only those specific 4 were selected (there are other datasets that are also limited to binary classification as SMS, Commercial ... from Wrench). In some practical cases in Wrench (as Youtube), we also care about the F1 score, which I think it can also be estimated with your method. The paper should provide a more comprehensive evaluation of the method across a wider range of datasets and metrics to demonstrate its robustness and applicability.

----

(5) Assumption on being able to estimate $ P(Y|Z) $.

The assumption that one can estimate P(Y|Z) is very strong, and this is how the paper gets around the need of labeled data. This is unrealistic in practice. I think that the paper should specify that happens when the model is misspecified (theory), which is often the case for the parametric model mentioned in the paper. It would be interesting to understand if we can say something about the Frechet bound if we allow for a bounded misspecification, i.e. $|P(Y|Z) - \hat{P}(Y|Z)| < Delta$ for some $Delta >0$.

---

There are other papers that used somehow similar ideas to consider a "worst-case"(or adversarial) distribution over all possible distributions in a weak supervision setting that I think are very relevant (e.g.,  [A,B,C,D,E,F]). In particular, this problem was studied mostly  for the case of trying to solve the map Z -> Y from weak supervision sources outputs to label without adding any assumption (e.g., independence or parametric assumption) [A,B,E], although some other work consider the more general case of training a classifier h [C,D,F]. 

The use of the "worst-case" allows to obtain an upper bound (analogous to the U of the Frechet Bound). As an example, the underlying idea is to consider possible joint distribution $Z,Y$ that satisfy some information on the marginal $P(Y|z_i)$ or $P(Z)$ (this information may vary among the work).

### Questions
I think the paper studies an important problem and provides an interesting solution to it, and I am open to raise the score if the following concerns are addressed (summarized below, see Weakness for additional details).

1. What is the interpretation of the Frechet bounds? When is the lower bound close to the upper bound, and under which conditions are those bounds informative.

2. What happens to your results when $P(Y|Z)$ is misspecified from a theory point of view?

3. Why did you use only 4 binary classification tasks from Wrench, and why those specific four were selected? Are the results different for the other tasks?

### Summary
This work develops methods for estimating Fréchet bounds for distributions where some variables are continuous valued and others are discrete. Importantly their method boils down to solving a convex program and does not scale with the dimensionality of the feature space. They derive the asymptotic distribution for their estimators, allowing them to quantify uncertainty. Finally, they cast the main motivating application of their work to be evaluating the performance of models trained under programmatic weak supervision. They compare their bounds to actual test metrics on 5 different PWS datasets, pointing out that they reveal useful insights for PWS trained models.

### Strengths
I think the problem setting is well-motivated from a weak supervision point of view. The premise of PWS is that ground-truth labels are scarce (or expensive to procure). Yet often in this field, methods assume access to validation/test labels for model selection/evaluation. Being able to estimate performance *without* requiring (m)any ground-truth labels is important so as to be able to reduce reliance on this assumption and perform more realistic forms of model selection. The approach proposed by this paper is interesting technically and nicely comes with uncertainty estimates.

### Weaknesses
The main weakness of the paper in my opinion is in the experiments, which the authors use to show that their bounds have practical usefulness in PWS. However, I think this can be better substantiated in several ways.

For starters the experiments would ideally be expanded to encompass a wider array of PWS settings, i.e.:
- Testing on multiple types of end models (beyond logistic regression) and label models (beyond just Snorkel)
- Testing on datasets beyond binary classification
- Measuring precision/recall on the unbalanced datasets such as *Tennis* and *Census*. On these tasks, F1 (and not accuracy) is the default metric in WRENCH.

But perhaps more importantly, I think the results would benefit from more directly showcasing the usefulness of the bounds as a way for **hyperparameter tuning/model selection.** Personally, I think this is the more interesting use case of the bounds. In the current results, it seems that $L$ and $U$ are not always reliable for precisely estimating performance (i.e., they are often wide or fail to capture true test performance due to the assumption on the label model quality). However, I do think the bounds may still be practically useful in that they can help *relatively* rank different models. This is indeed something that the authors allude to in several places, such as when discussing how they can help pick the threshold on *IMDb* or select LFs on *Youtube*. However, I believe this claim should be tested more extensively, perhaps by defining explicit selection rules and comparing the effectiveness of these rules for selecting *all* hyperparameters (and for more complex WS methods).  

Furthermore, I think some relevant baselines for evaluation/model selection here would be (a) using weak labels for the validation set; (b) using a small amount of clean labels. The latter is not a totally fair comparison, but would reflect an important practical question re: "how many labeled points does using these bounds actually save?" Even for the current results, it would be nice to compare the widths of the bounds to something like the 95% CIs one would obtain when using different amounts of labeled data.

### Questions
(1) Curious if the authors have thoughts on what other applications their techniques may have besides validating PWS? Does their approach, for instance, generalize to other applications where one can define discrete $Y$ and $Z$? 

(2) One core assumption is that *"Any performance metric based on $h$ cannot be estimated without making extra strong assumptions, e.g. $X \perp Y$, or assuming the availability of some labeled samples."* However, I think in practice, it is likely the case that PWS users have access to *some* (albeit quite limited) set of labels. It would be interesting to see if/how the bounds can be sharpened when you allow for some labeled data to be incorporated. Curious if the authors have any thoughts?

### Confidence
3: You are fairly confident in your assessment. It is possible that you did not understand some parts of the submission or that you are unfamiliar with some pieces of related work. Math/other details were not carefully checked.

### Summary
The paper develops an algorithm for estimating the Frechet bounds based on convex programs. The paper also provides an asymptotic theoretical guarantee of the proposed estimator. Finally, the paper provides experiments showing a case that the bound can be used to evaluate classifiers in the weak supervision setting without access to labels.

### Strengths
1. The proposed estimator also has a theoretical guarantee.
2. The experiment demonstrates that the bound is meaningful.
3. The mathematical parts are rigorous.

### Weaknesses
1. The estimator in equation (2.4) heavily relies on the distribution P_{Y\mid Z} which is not observed. The paper suggested using a label model to approximate such distribution. This requires the label model to be “good”. However, in this case, we can just use it to evaluate classifiers directly without deriving the Frechet bound.

2. For most tasks, a small set of labeled data is available. In fact, snorkel also relies on a small dev set to tune the hyperparameters of the final predictor. One could also use these labels to provide a bound on the performance of a classifier. It would be interesting to compare a confidence interval from a small dev set and the Frechet bound.

### Summary
This paper proposes solutions via convex programs to estimate Frechet bounds for Programmatic Weak Supervision (PWS). This approach uses estimates of the true labels via labelmodels (i.e., different aggregation schemes that exist in the literature). With these estimates of the labels, they provide an approach to estimate bounds on the accuracy (and other quantities) of the weak labelers. They provide experiments to check the validity of their bounds and also provide experiments with weak labelers generated via prompting to examine how their bounds perform under instances of weak labelers with different qualities/accuracies.

### Strengths
1. The authors provide a nice analysis of their estimation scheme. 

2. They derive the asymptotic distributions of their estimators and show they are consistent. 

3. They also provide CI for their estimates given finite sample data.

4. A novel application of Frechet bounds (and the corresponding literature) to the field of programmatic weak supervision.

### Weaknesses
1. One weakness is that this approach is fundamentally reliant on the quality of the label model. This is manifested in assumption 2.3, which states that the estimate of the conditional distribution of $Y | Z$ should approach the true conditional distribution. However, given biased and underperforming weak labelers, does this assumption actually hold? As such, are these truly valid bounds? They are violated in a few instances in Figure 1 (lower bound in second to the left in the bottom row, upper bound in second to left in the top row).

2. As highlighted by the authors in their Limitations section in the conclusion, this approach implicitly makes the same assumptions as the specified labelmodel, which can indeed be making assumptions about the conditional independence of the weak labelers (e.g., what is default in the Snorkel implementation).

3. I’m a bit confused as to what is the underlying message of Section 4.3. It seems to me that the proposed bounds perform poorly in the case with a few LLM generated weak labelers. I currently am understanding the “label set selection” approach to be picking weak labelers based on “accuracy”, except where accuracy is measured by disagreement with the estimated weak labels (i.e., label model outputs). As such, this would simply be pruning away weak labelers that disagree with the labelmodel, which seems somewhat undesirable.

4. There seems to be a lack of discussion about existing work on adversarial methods in PWS (namely [1] and subsequent followup work). I realize this existing work focuses on the classifier error rate, although the relaxed convex program approach seems similar.

### Questions
Primarily my first point in the weaknesses section above: is this assumption too strong? Given imperfect weak labelers, we cannot correctly estimate the true label (with a labelmodel), and, thus, wouldn’t these bounds would be violated in many cases? Any justification about the strength of these assumptions (i.e., allowing to swap in label model estimates with true labels) would be much appreciated.
