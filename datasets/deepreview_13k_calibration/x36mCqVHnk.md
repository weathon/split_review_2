## Abstract
The problem of two-player zero-sum Markov games has recently attracted increasing interests in theoretical studies of multi-agent reinforcement learning (RL). In particular, for finite-horizon episodic Markov decision processes (MDPs), it has been shown that model-based algorithms can find an $\epsilon$-optimal Nash Equilibrium (NE) with the sample complexity of $O(H^3SAB/\epsilon^2)$, which is optimal in the dependence of the horizon $H$ and the number of states $S$ (where $A$ and $B$ denote the number of actions of the two players, respectively). However, none of the existing model-free algorithms can achieve such an optimality. In this work, we propose a model-free stage-based Q-learning algorithm and show that it achieves the same sample complexity as the best model-based algorithm, and hence for the first time demonstrate that model-free algorithms can enjoy the same optimality in the $H$ dependence as model-based algorithms. The main improvement of the dependency on $H$ arises by leveraging the popular variance reduction technique based on the reference-advantage decomposition previously used only for single-agent RL. However, such a technique relies on a critical monotonicity property of the value function, which does not hold in Markov games due to the update of the policy via the coarse correlated equilibrium (CCE) oracle. Thus, to extend such a technique to Markov games, our algorithm features a key novel design of updating the reference value functions as the pair of optimistic and pessimistic value functions whose value difference is the smallest in history in order to achieve the desired improvement in the sample efficiency.

### Summary
The paper studies a model free algorithm to compute equilibria in two players zero-sum finite horizon Markov games. Technically the authors obtain an optimal dependency on the horizon $H$, by combining the reference-advantage decomposition and the CCE collapse technique into a novel Q-learning like algorithm.

### Strengths
The work present a model-free algorithm for equilibrium computation in two players zero-sum finite horizon Markov games that matches the best known model-based algorithm for the same setting, and it is suboptimal only in the cardinality of the action space ($O(A^2)$ instead of $O(A)$). Given the recent attention of multi-agent RL this is an important achievement and in line with the interests of the ICLR community.

### Weaknesses
The main weakness of the paper is clarity. In my opinion, an accurate revision is essential to significantly enhance the quality of the paper, and high level ideas could be communicated more efficiently. In particular the paper assumes that the reader is familiar with [40] and [36], and without a deep understanding of these works the reader is confronted with high level ideas that are hard to grasp. This leaves the reader unsure on the technical contributions of the paper.

It is not clear what "min-gap" refers to. It is never formally defined. While I suspect it relates to $\Delta(s,h)$ and ensures monotonicity, this should be explicitly stated. The explanation of why single-agent techniques from [40] are challenging to extend is also unclear. The last two paragraphs on page 4 are particularly difficult to follow, failing to clearly articulate the challenges and contributions. Algorithm 1 includes excessive, unnecessary detail. Lines 9 to 13, in particular, lack commentary and could be simplified using $O$ notation or similar. The fact that actions in Algorithm 1, line 6, are drawn from a correlated strategy is not sufficiently discussed. It is unclear whether the learning can be decoupled by marginalizing $\pi$ or if marginalization must occur only at the end. The "standard update" and "bonus" terms on page 5 are not defined. Finally, the connection between CCE and Nash equilibrium computation is not explained. While I understand the "collapse" idea from Cai, Yang, et al. (2016) and its use in [36], the paper should at least present this at a high level. The decentralised model-free algorithm of "On improving model-free algorithms for decentralised multi-agent reinforcement learning" is not discussed, though it achieves a $O(H^5)$ sample complexity, albeit with optimal dependency on $A$.

### Questions
1) What does "min-gap" exactly refers to? It is never defined formally. Does it refers to $\Delta(s,h)$ which is the minimum gap over all episodes and this ensures monotonicity?
2) You say that using the techniques of [40] for single agent RL is challenging due to the fact the upper bounds are no longer monotonic. It is unclear way this is needed. More precisely, the last two paragraphs on page 4 are really hard to read and do not convey clearly neither the challenges nor the contributions.
3) Algorithm 1 gives too many unnecessary details, and simplifying it would help the reader understand better its workings. In particular, I think lines 9 to 13 are never commented and could be written with $O$ notation or something alike.
4) In algorithm 1 the actions played come from a correlated strategy (line 6)? Can the learning be decoupled by marginalising $\pi$ or the marginalisation has to happen only at the end of the learning procedure?
5) On page 5 the authors refer to a "standard update". What is this standard update and what is "bonus"?
6) It is never explained what CCE has to do with the problem of computing Nash equilibrium. After some tome I arrived at the conclusion that it is the "collapse" idea first introduced in "Cai, Yang, et al. "Zero-sum polymatrix games: A generalization of minmax." Mathematics of Operations Research (2016)" in which the CCE of a $\epsilon$-perturbed zero sum game is an $\epsilon$-CCE of the zero sum games which marginalisation is in turn a $O(\epsilon)$ of the Nash of the zero sum game. I get that this idea was already presented in [36] but the authors should at least presented at a high level this idea.
7) I think you are missing to discuss the decentralised model-free algorithm of "On improving model-free algorithms for decentralised multi-agent reinforcement learning", but there's no issue there as it obtains a $O(H^5)$ sample complexity, although the dependency on $A$ is optimal

### Summary
The purpose of the paper is to provide a model-free algorithm for two-player zero-sum Markov games that exhibits best case dependence on H, which is the horizon as well as S which is the size of the state space. The paper notes that it is the first work to achieve this type of optimality. The paper is based on Q-learning, where its main novelty is in introducing a variance reduction technique for single-player reinforcement learning. However, because the games does not exhibit monotonicity the way single-player systems do, the authors introduce the use of two estimates of value functions: optimistic value functions and pessimistic value functions. The general framework they use comes from the Nash Q-learning framework, but that framework does not provide optimality bounds with respect to the horizon which is the subject of the current work.

### Strengths
The authors provide an algorithm for two-player zero-sum games with self-play that improves upon best known results. The lower bound for two-player zero-sum Markov games is Omega(H^3S(A+B)/eps^2) . The work of "Near-Optimal Reinforcement Learning with Self-Play" gives bounds that are O(H^5SABi/eps^2). The present work gives a bound O(H^3SAB/eps^2), which is a large improvement when the horizon is very large. Another strength is the novelty of the proof technique. The proof technique draws upon a variance reduction technique in single player settings. In order to adequately incorporate the variance reduction technique, the authors store optimistic and pessimistic estimates of the optimal value function, rather than only optimistic which is used in the single player setting. Doing this allows the authors to obtain convergence guarantees.

### Weaknesses
I think that it would be helpful to provide a comparison to the proof techniques used in "Near-Optimal Reinforcement Learning with Self-Play". This is because the algorithm is largely inspired by their algorithm. Additionally, both algorithms use upper and lower bounds for the value function (I'm not sure if I'm using the term here in the right way), which is one of the crucial pieces that allows the algorithm of the current work to get the optimality in H bound. In this way, the key novelty would be clearer. 
I also think that because the algorithm builds upon another algorithm and modifies the bound to make the dependence on H stronger by a factor of H^2, it may be useful to incorporate more than one theorem to show extensions such as incorporating the use of function approximation etc. Or perhaps the authors could look at an extension where the agents play against each other.

### Questions
I really like your results. However, I have a question regarding your proof technique. I understand that there is a monotonicity assumption that is required to be overcome in order for single player reinforcement learning settings to be applied to multi-agent reinforcement learning. Prior works have used various properties to overcome this monotonicity assumption (see the work of https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.09716 for example). However, to me it is not immediately clear how simply storing reference values of optimistic and pessimistic value functions overcomes the monotonicity assumption. This is because when there is no noise, i.e., perfect estimates of the value functions, then that would mean that there would be no need for an optimistic or pessimistic bound and only one bound would be needed. But if that is the case, when the monotonicity issue still would not go away, since the monotonicity issue inevitably arises in games versus single player settings. So then I'm confused what is the exact role of the optimistic and pessimistic estimates of the optimal value function. 
Another question I have is what is the difference between your proof techniques and those in "Near-Optimal Reinforcement Learning with Self-Play". This is because they also use optimistic and pessimistic estimates of the optimal value function. However, their bounds are clearly less tight than yours since they are of order H^3. Could you please provide a comparison to that work or point me to where you discuss it in the paper?

### Summary
For the first time, the paper proves a model-free algorithm for two-player zero-sum Markove games can achieve the same sample complexity as the best model-based algorithm. To achieve this, the paper proposes a method that features reference-advantage decomposition and a novel design of updating the reference value functions as the pair of optimistic and pessimistic value functions.

### Strengths
1. The contribution of the paper is unique and may have a broad impact. Although the work is based on recent work in single-agent RL, this paper solves critical technical difficulties in applying similar analysis to multi-player Markov games.
2. The proposed method and the theoretical analysis seem sound to me. 
3. The paper is well written, although it is not easy to follow due to dense notation.

### Weaknesses
1. Since the single-agent work [1] is very related, it would be better if a short introduction about it is given. Specifically, the paper should clarify how the reference-advantage decomposition is used in the single-agent setting and what are the key challenges in extending it to the two-player zero-sum Markov game. Without this context, the reader may struggle to understand the novelty of the proposed approach.
2. Some intuitive explanations may be needed for readers to catch the general idea before section 3, which discusses the details of the algorithms directly. The current presentation dives directly into the algorithm details, making it difficult to grasp the high-level intuition. It would be beneficial to provide a conceptual overview of the algorithm, perhaps using a simplified example to illustrate how the optimistic and pessimistic value functions interact to achieve the desired sample complexity. For instance, a simple two-state, two-action game could be used to demonstrate the core mechanics of the algorithm.

### Summary
This paper considers MARL in 2p0s Markov games and proposes the first model-free algorithm w/ optimal dependency on H, which is only achieved by model-based approaches before.

### Strengths
1. The contribution is interesting for the MARL literature as model-free algorithms consumes much smaller memory than model-based ones.

2. The min-gap policy looks like an intersting innovation.

### Weaknesses
1. The description of technical innovations is not so clear. In the end of page 5, I cannot understand how V^ref helps. The authors shall elaborate why this overcomes the 1/H factor. Specifically, it's unclear how using a reference value function, even if it's a good approximation, directly translates to a better sample complexity. The explanation needs to detail the mechanism by which the reference value function allows for tighter concentration bounds, and how this specifically avoids the 1/H dependence. It's not sufficient to state that it provides a better estimate; the argument needs to be made precise with respect to the concentration inequalities used.

2. The result still suffers from the curse of multiagents (ie AB instead of A+B). The authors discussed it in the end of Sec 4.1. While understanding it's technically hard, it is still a pity. The core issue is that the sample complexity scales multiplicatively with the number of agents, which limits the applicability of the algorithm to scenarios with a large number of agents. This is a fundamental limitation that needs to be addressed to make the algorithm more practical. The discussion in Sec 4.1 acknowledges this, but it does not provide any concrete solutions or even potential directions for future work to mitigate this issue.

Minor: The paper is using (1) for both equations and citations. It's sometimes confusing.

### Questions
1. Is the min-gap policy completely novel? Given the maximizing and minimizing agent in 2p0s games, it sounds straightforward. It also appears in the gap-dependent RL literature (eg Xu et al COLT'21). If possible, it would be nice to discuss more related works with a (seemingly) similar technique and to distinguish your version to theirs.

2. see weakness 1.

I'm giving a 5 because of unabling to understand the main technical contribution. I'd be happy to reevaluate after the authors' feedback.
