## Abstract
We study the problem of learning hierarchical polynomials over the standard Gaussian distribution with three-layer neural networks. We specifically consider target functions of the form $h = g \circ p$ where $p : \mathbb{R}^d \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ is a degree $k$ polynomial and $g: \mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ is a degree $q$ polynomial. This function class generalizes the single-index model, which corresponds to $k=1$, and is a natural class of functions possessing an underlying hierarchical structure. Our main result shows that for a large subclass of degree $k$ polynomials $p$, a three-layer neural network trained via layerwise gradient descent on the square loss learns the target $h$ up to vanishing test error in $\widetilde \cO(d^k)$ samples and polynomial time. This is a strict improvement over kernel methods, which require $\widetilde \Theta(d^{kq})$ samples, as well as existing guarantees for two-layer networks, which require the target function to be low-rank. Our result also generalizes prior works on three-layer neural networks, which were restricted to the case of $p$ being a quadratic. When $p$ is indeed a quadratic, we achieve the information-theoretically optimal sample complexity $\widetilde \cO(d^2)$, which is an improvement over prior work~\citep{nichani2023provable} requiring a sample size of $\widetilde\Theta(d^4)$. Our proof proceeds by showing that during the initial stage of training the network performs feature learning to recover the feature $p$ with $\widetilde \cO(d^k)$ samples. This work demonstrates the ability of three-layer neural networks to learn complex features and as a result, learn a broad class of hierarchical functions.

### Summary
In this paper, the authors consider learning target functions of the form $g \circ p$ where $p$ is a degree $k$ polynomial and $g$ is a degree $q$ polynomial. They consider a specific 3 layer neural network with a skip connection and a bottleneck layer of size 1. They show, using layer-wise training that $O(d^k)$ samples are sufficient to train the second layer weights and $O(1)$ samples are sufficient to train the last layer weights. In particular, the total sample complexity $O(d^{k})$ is much smaller than $O(d^{kp})$ required for inner-product kernels. Note also that information theoretically, $\Omega(d^k)$ is information theoretically minimal to learn degree-$k$ polynomials, however they only consider a particular subset of polynomials that has much smaller functional space dimension (except for $k=2$).

### Strengths
- The paper considers the problem of understanding the benefits of feature learning for multi-layer neural networks. The one layer case has attracted a lot of attention, while multi-layer is so far way less understood.
- They are able to show a large separation with kernel methods. The reason is that the first layer is able to extract a good representation of the data (the polynomial $p(x)$) from only seeing samples $g \circ p (x)$.
- This class of target functions naturally generalizes the single index model ($k=1$), which is the natural class of functions for one-hidden layer neural networks (for one-hidden layer , the network has direct access to linear functions of the data).
- The paper is easy to follow and the assumptions and proof techniques are accurately presented and discussed.

### Weaknesses
 - The architecture and algorithm are chosen specifically to succeed for this specific class of target functions (composition of degree-$k$ multivariate polynomials with univariate functions). Several previous works have considered such layer-wise training on non-regular architectures for specific hierarchical classes of functions, including [Allen-Zhu,Li,2020] and [The staircase property, Abbe, Boix, Brennan, Bresler, Nagaraj, 2020]. It is unclear how this paper contributes in terms of novel ideas in that direction. The specific architecture with a bottleneck of size 1 and a skip connection seems very tailored to the problem and it is not clear how this setup can be generalized to other function classes. The analysis heavily relies on the fact that the intermediate representation is a low-degree polynomial, which is a strong assumption.
- Overall, the architecture choice and algorithm makes the analysis straightforward. It reduces the problem to sequentially fitting two linear random feature models, which is by now quite well understood. See for example [Generalization error of random feature and kernel methods: Hypercontractivity and kernel matrix concentration, Mei et al., 2022] which gives the sample size and network width $\Theta(d^k)$ to learn any degree-$k$ polynomials (for spherical data). The main technical innovation is Lemma 2, which relies on the specific construction of assumption 4. The analysis does not consider the effect of the non-linearities in the network, which are crucial for the success of deep learning in practice. The reliance on layer-wise training also simplifies the problem significantly, as it avoids the complexities of joint optimization of all layers.
- For these reasons, I wonder how much this analysis can be generalized to other settings. Especially, in more realistic settings, we expect a non-linear evolution of the parameters, which this paper avoids using their specific architecture. In contrast, while [Nichani et al., 23] only considers one step size (so ultimately also a linear model step), they use a more standard architecture (but get a worse sample complexity dependency). The paper does not explore the limitations of the proposed method or discuss potential failure modes. The analysis also assumes specific properties of the data distribution, which may not hold in practice.

### Questions
- Why not directly consider a general function $g$ instead of a polynomial? The random feature analysis shouldn’t change much in that case (it simply requires to show a $\eps$-approximate certificate using uni-dimensional random features).

### Summary
The authors examine the problem of learning hierarchical polynomials of Gaussian data with three-layer networks trained using layerwise gradient descent. They compare the performance of three-layer networks to kernel approaches and two-layer networks, demonstrating a clear sample-complexity improvement without requiring any low-rank structure, as is typically done with sparse multi-index targets learned efficiently by two-layer neural networks. The theoretical analysis is reinforced by extensive discussion.

### Strengths
The paper is pleasant to read and the mathematical results are supported with extensive discussion.

### Weaknesses
The main weakness of the paper is the close relationship with previous works. Although a fair comparison is given, the works by [Allen-Zhu & Li, 2019;2020] and [Nichani et al. 2023] contain many of the key ideas in the manuscript. Specifically, the core idea of using layer-wise training to learn hierarchical functions, while extended to higher degree polynomials, is conceptually similar to these prior works. The novelty is somewhat incremental, as the extension to degree k polynomials, while technically non-trivial, builds upon existing frameworks. The paper would benefit from a more detailed discussion of the specific technical challenges overcome in this extension, and how they differ from the challenges faced in previous works. Furthermore, the practical implications of this extension, beyond the theoretical sample complexity improvement, are not fully explored.

### Questions
- It would help the unexperienced reader to include a small comment on [Ben Arous et al. 2021] in the related works section to give a complete overview on learning single-index models.

- In remark 2 is written "can be extended to any $L= \omega_d(1)$". What is the original condition on L?

- Please state after Theorem 1 or Corollary 1 that there is a clear sample-complexity improvement for three-layer networks over two-layer networks. At the moment, this is done only with respect to kernel methods.

- Could the author comment with references characterizing the failure of two-layer networks in learning these high-rank target functions? Are there any provable guarantees?  

- Before Lemma 1 mention that $n = O(d^k)$ is used, and repeat references that prove for what reason you fit the best degree k polynomial.

- Could the author comment on the requirements for the gradient step size in the first phase? It is mentioned that [Nichani et al. 2023] considered one large gradient step in this phase. How does this relate to your learning rate requirement in Thm 1?

### Summary
This paper studies the problem of learning hierarchical polynomials with neural networks. In particular, it focuses on the problem of learning functions of the form $h(x) = g(p(x))$, where $p : \mathbb{R}^q \to \mathbb{R}$ is a degree $k$ polynomial and $g : \mathbb R \to \mathbb R$ is a degree $q$ polynomial (the special case $k=1$ recovers the well-studied family of single-index models).

The paper's main result is that for a subclass of degree $k$ polynomials $p$ and standard Gaussian marginals, a 3-layer NN trained via layerwise GD on the $L_2$ loss learns the target hierarchical polynomial (realizable setting) with roughly $d^k$ samples and runtime that is polynomial in the parameters of the problem.

The main conceptual message is that this sample complexity guarantee improves over kernel-based approaches which require roughly $d^{kq}$ samples and essentially cannot make use of the special hierarchical structure of the target functions.

### Strengths
The paper's main result is that for a subclass of degree $k$ polynomials $p$ and standard Gaussian marginals, a 3-layer NN trained via layerwise GD on the $L_2$ loss learns the target hierarchical polynomial (realizable setting) with roughly $d^k$ samples and runtime that is polynomial in the parameters of the problem.

I think that the result is interesting and fits well with the ICLR community. In general, the paper is easy to read: the assumptions are presented in a clear manner, comparison with prior work is well-established and the contribution seems important in the field.

At a technical level, the authors essentially show that (i) during the first training phase, the NN implements kernel regression and essentially learns the underlying polynomial $p$ and (ii) during the second stage, the NN recovers the link function $g$. The main technical tool is that using the special structure assumed for the polynomials $p$ (Assumption 4), the paper provides an approximate version of Stein's Lemma (see Lemma 2), which can be used to show Item (i) from the above technical results. I think that the paper's technical contribution is sufficient for acceptance, since it extends existing ideas and provides new insights in the area.

In general, I enjoyed reading this paper and I vote for acceptance.

### Weaknesses
I believe that it would be beneficial if the authors mentioned families of polynomials not captured by Assumption 4. This would make more clear how strong and restrictive this assumption is. This assumption highly simplifies the analysis and, hence, it would be nice if the authors could further discuss on this assumption (I see why the families of Remark 3 satisfy this condition, but I think a further discussion on how this assumption simplifies the analysis would be helpful).

Specifically, the current presentation does not make it clear what types of polynomials are excluded by Assumption 4. For instance, are there simple, commonly used polynomial families that are not covered? Providing concrete examples of polynomials that violate this assumption, and explaining why they do so, would greatly improve the reader's understanding of the scope and limitations of the theoretical results. This is crucial for assessing the practical relevance of the findings. The analysis relies heavily on the orthogonality properties induced by this assumption, and a more detailed explanation of how this assumption simplifies the analysis would be beneficial.


### Questions
(1) I think a discussion on Assumption 4 (as I mention in the above section) is an important aspect that should be expanded in the current draft.

(2) As an additional comment, I think that Theorem 1 could be written more formally (e.g., mention that Assumptions 1-6 hold, mention the runtime of the training process, etc.). 

(3) The current result heavily relies on Gaussian marginals. Do you think similar results could be established for other continuous measures? Or discrete ones (in the Boolean domain, any function is essentially a polynomial in the Fourier basis)?

### Summary
This paper studies the three-layer neural network for feature learning trained by two-stage layer-by-layer gradient descent.
In the first stage, the network training is equivalent to a random feature model $u \sigma_1(Vx)$ where $V$ is fixed.
In the second stage, it’s also a random feature model. But it can be regarded as a composition of kernel methods, and achieves improved sample complexity than a single kernel methods.

### Strengths
I appreciate the authors’ discussion in Section 5. It addresses my several concerns.

- In the algorithm, it uses multiple steps in the first stage to learn the feature $p(x)$ and obtain better improved results when compared to (Nichani et al. 2023) on the sample complexity.
- I like the discussion on Sec. 5.2 and the question is quite interesting: why the compositional kernel methods can be efficiently learned than that with a single kernel? Intuitively, this question can be answered in some points but is difficult from the theoretical side.

### Weaknesses
 - The model and problem setting are a bit over-claim. Though it’s a three-layer neural network, only $u$ and $c$ are trained. This is actually a two-layer neural networks when the input is not the original data but after a fixed feature mapping. More importantly, the used layer-by-layer training scheme makes such three-layer neural network degenerate to a composition of two kernel methods (random features). With weight decay, the loss function under two stages is strongly convex and smooth. Both problem setting and algorithm are totally far away from true three-layer neural networks or even two-layer neural networks. The claim of feature learning is not fully justified, as the first layer's weights are fixed, and the second layer essentially learns a linear combination of these fixed features, and the third layer learns a linear combination of the output of the second layer. This is more akin to learning a composition of two random feature models rather than learning hierarchical features in the way that deep neural networks are typically understood.

- The results cannot handle the over-parameterized regime, i.e., the results require the width $m_1 << n$. The derived results set $m_1$ and $n_1$ depending on $d$, and $m_1$ and $n$ should have different orders of $d$. Otherwise the bound will become vacuous. This is because there is one $O(\sqrt{m/n})$ term in the convergence rate, deriving by Rademacher complexity for the random features model. Specifically, the analysis relies on bounding the Rademacher complexity of the random feature map, which leads to a term that scales as $\sqrt{m_1/n}$. This term becomes problematic when $m_1$ is not significantly smaller than $n$, as it can dominate the error bound and render the theoretical guarantees meaningless. The requirement that $m_1$ and $n$ have different orders of $d$ is a significant limitation, restricting the practical applicability of the results to scenarios where the number of features is much smaller than the number of samples.



### Questions
- How does the first inequality in Eq. (13) hold?

Overall, the model is a composition of kernel methods (or random features). In my view, understanding composition of kernel methods than a single kernel is more accurate and has more significance than so-called “three-layer” feature learning. I'm willing to increase my score if the significant revision on the motivation and story is done.
