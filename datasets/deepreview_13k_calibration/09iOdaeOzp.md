## Abstract
The popularity of LLaMA~\citep{touvron2023llama,touvron2023llama2}
    and other recently emerged moderate-sized large language models (LLMs)
    highlights the potential of building smaller yet powerful LLMs.
    Regardless, 
    the cost of training such models from scratch on trillions of tokens remains high.
    In this work, 
    we study structured pruning as an effective means to develop smaller LLMs from pre-trained, larger models.
    Our approach employs two key techniques: 
    (1) \textit{targeted structured pruning}, 
    which prunes a larger model to a specified target shape 
    by removing layers, heads, and intermediate and hidden dimensions in an end-to-end manner, and
    (2) \textit{dynamic batch loading}, 
    which dynamically updates the composition of sampled data in each training batch based on varying losses across different domains.
    We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach by 
    presenting the \textbf{Sheared-LLaMA} series, 
    pruning the LLaMA2-7B model 
    down to 1.3B and 2.7B parameters. 
    Sheared-LLaMA models
    outperform state-of-the-art open-source models of equivalent sizes, such as 
    Pythia, INCITE, OpenLLaMA and the concurrent TinyLlama models, on a wide range of downstream and instruction tuning evaluations,
    while requiring only $3\%$ of compute compared to training such models from scratch. 
    This work provides compelling evidence that leveraging existing LLMs with structured pruning is a far more cost-effective approach for building competitive small-scale LLMs.
    We present frequently asked questions and answers in~\Cref{app:faq}.}

### Summary
This paper introduces to employ the structural pruning to reduce the pre-training cost of LLMs.  It focuses on the integration of two techniques: targeted structured pruning and dynamic batch loading. This paper proposes two small models: Sheared-LLaMA-1.3B and Sheared-LLaMA-2.7B. Comparative testing reveals that these lightweight models are capable of outperforming other counterparts with 1.3B and 2.7B parameters.

### Strengths
1. This paper introduces two scaled-down versions of LLaMA-2, achieved through structured pruning.
2. Experiments demonstrate that these two small LLMs exhibit superior performance when compared to other models such as OPT, Pythia, INCITE, and Open-LLaMA. 
3. The performance and capabilities of these two pruned models are extensively assessed using the Open LLM Leaderboard.

### Weaknesses
1. My main concern centers around the novelty of this paper. The first method, named targeted structured pruning, has been previously employed in several papers, with some offering further advanced variations [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]. As for the second method, dynamic batch loading, it closely resembles the application of the technique from [6]. The main observation by the authors that structured pruning can reduce training costs is a well-known advantage of all the structured pruning methods.

2. The paper lacks experiments to show the effectiveness of targeted structured pruning. No experiments can be found to verify the effectiveness of the 'targeted structured pruning` compared with other pruning algorithms. Given that the proposed targeted structured pruning falls within the realm of structural pruning, a comparative analysis with LLM-Pruner[7] is essential to establish whether the newly proposed method improves upon the existing techniques for structured pruning of large language models. Utilizing the same experimental settings as LLM-Pruner for this comparison would provide a more direct and clear demonstration of the proposed method's effectiveness.

3. I cannot tell whether the enhanced performance is attributed to a stronger foundational model (LLaMA2) from which pruning occurs. It's conceivable that starting with a stronger base model could lead to better results post-pruning. Have any experiments been conducted where a model, for instance, OPT-2.7B, is pruned down to 1.3B and then compared against the officially pre-trained OPT-1.3B? (Given the limited time available for rebuttal, it might not be feasible to pre-train a 1.3B model. Conducting a similar experiment with a considerably smaller model, such as a 350M version, could also provide valuable insights.)

### Questions
1. Why the dynamic batch loading is a more efficient one than Doremi?

### Summary
The manuscript introduces a technique that prunes pretrained models towards a target (smaller) architecture rather than towards a target sparsity level. After a small amount of retraining, the pruned models outperform similar-size models trained from scratch on many more tokens than the retraining budget, suggesting that the pruning approach is a more efficient path to producing a small model than training from scratch. The efficiency of retraining is enhanced by a simple and effective data selection scheme. Comparisons with other pruning methods show that "targeted structured pruning" (i.e., "shearing") can lead to models that are faster than those created by other approaches.

### Strengths
The manuscript focuses on the problem of creating a compact LLM -- existing approaches either train from scratch (which is expensive and forgoes inheriting knowledge from stronger/larger models) or prune an existing model (which can lead to a suboptimal structure for inference speed). By pruning pretrained models to a target architecture with targeted structured pruning and using a short retraining period ("continued training"), the submission's proposed approach is able to address the prior problems in this significant area. The resulting models are trained faster and perform better than models trained from scratch, and they perform inference faster than models pruned by other approaches.

The shearing algorithm ("targeted structured pruning") is very clearly explained (with nice illustrations) and is simple despite its flexibility and power. The idea of pruning towards a target architecture is (as far as I know) novel.

To enhance learning in the pruned model during "continued training", an original scheme to dynamically change the data mixture is developed ("Dynamic Batch Loading"). This scheme is not only interesting for its usefulness to Sheared-LLaMA -- as the authors suggest, it could be used to help make any model's training more efficient by avoiding usage of training data that makes relatively little progress towards the desired model performances.

The analyses (e.g., of Dynamic Batch Loading, of other pruning approaches, etc.) thoroughly support the manuscript's arguments.

### Weaknesses
While the paper is very thorough, additional inference timings for models produced by other competitive methods could help readers better understand the merits of the proposed approach (see "Questions" below).



### Questions
Score-affecting:

1. Expanding Table 4 with inference speeds for the following models could help readers better understand the importance of the Sheared-LLaMA targeted pruning approach.
   - Before shearing
   - Before shearing with 2:4 sparsity and with 4:8 sparsity. This would allow us to compare Sheared-LLaMA to both older and newer pruning approaches (like Wanda).
   - LLM-Pruner model

Interesting:

1. To better understand the effect of the discovered pruning mask on performance during the "continued training" period, perhaps you could use only C4 data to find the pruning mask. If you did this, would "continued training" on the mixture of domains (without dynamic batch loading) still show GitHub performance reaching its reference loss and C4 performance not reaching its reference loss? Some related questions follow.
   - Are losses being reduced at different rates across domains because the pruning mask was learned on too little data to account for the complexity of some domains (like C4)?
   - 2 million tokens (500 sequences) are used for each held-out set: should the held-out set size be larger for more complex datasets (e.g., C4) to ensure that the pruning mask is found on a representative set of data?

2. A version of Figure 4 with perplexity or loss. 

Minor:

1. There are numerous typos. Please proofread the paper carefully. Some examples follow:
   - "Sheared-LLaMA-3B" is mentioned but 2.7B is probably intended.
   - $z^{inter}$ and $z^{int}$ are used interchangeably, so are $H^T$ and $H_T$.
   - Table 2 seems to have NQ and LAMBADA switched in the 7B row. 
   - Section 4.1: "hypothetical 2.7B parameter LLaMA2 model" is stated. Do you mean 1.3B?
   - Figure 8's caption is wrong.

2. How are the Lagrange multipliers initialized? Relatedly, a reference for the specific Lagrange multiplier approach used might be nice to include -- Platt and Barr (1987) looks related but not exactly the same. 

3. In section 4.2, the sentence "non-uniformity also introduces training and inference overhead due to irregularities in model architectures" could be followed by intuition/clarification that explains why irregularities add overhead. 

4. In Table 4, consider adding perplexity of Sheared-LLaMA *with* continued pretraining to complement the *without* continued pretraining numbers.

5. Like Kaddour et al. (2023), "Compute-Efficient Deep Learning" (Bartoldson et al., 2023) shows why promised gains "may not be consistently realized" -- it also discusses (in its survey) all of the various efficient training approaches mentioned in the submission's Related Work section.

### Summary
This paper introduces Sheared LLaMA, a method focused on developing streamlined LLaMA models through the pruning of pre-trained ones. Central to this approach is a sparse training technique that employs L0 regularization to systematically zero out specific substructures. Additionally, the paper presents a dynamic batch-loading strategy, effectively recalibrating the significance of different data domain. In the fine-tuning phase, Sheared LLaMA undergoes training on 50 billion tokens, ultimately attaining a performance level comparable to models produced by scratch training.

### Strengths
* This work studies a practical approach to craft lightweight LLaMA by pruning, which requires less training cost. 
* The proposed model achieves superior performance compared to publicly available models.
* The dynamic batch loading is interesting.

### Weaknesses
My main concern lies in the technical novelty and effectiveness of the proposed pruning and sampling method. And it's unclear which part plays the most important role in pruning & fine-tuning.

* Sheared LLaMA employs regularized training as a preliminary step before pruning. However, **the effectiveness of the proposed constrained optimization remains unclear**. As illustrated in Table 10, the performance gap between Sheared LLaMA and LLM-Pruner (a simple Taylor-based method) is marginal (ΔPPL=0.24). Questions arise regarding whether this improvement is attributable to the proposed pruning method or the dynamic batch loading. Additionally, it's unclear if the LLM-Pruner baseline was also trained with dynamic batch loading. 
* Based on the previous questions, this work mentioned that "This observation indicates that pruning preserves a greater amount of knowledge in low-entropy and smaller domains (e.g., GitHub) compared to high-entropy and larger domains (e.g., C4)". However, this phenomenon might be also caused by a biased regularization before pruning, since the regularized training step only saw 0.4B tokens as mentioned in Sec. (4.3). Maybe this problem can be avoided by sampling balanced data from different domains for regularization, or deploying a simple Taylor expansion [1, 2] with balanced data. 
* Table 4 presents some confusing results: CoFiPruning [1] shows superior Perplexity (PPL) but inferior Throughput compared to Sheared LLaMA. This raises the question: are CoFiPruning and Sheared LLaMA comparable in performance? Given these mixed results, it's difficult to conclusively state that Sheared LLaMA has outperformed CoFiPruning. 
* Might be a typo: There's an inconsistency in reporting the size of the LLM-Pruner baseline -- labeled as 1.3B in the figure caption but noted as 1.6B in the table. Clarifying these comparisons would be helpful.

### Summary
This paper introduces a pruning technique and a dynamic batching technique to continue training pre-trained LLMs. The proposed pruning technique offers control over the final network shape by solving a constrained optimization problem, where the shape constraint must be optimized while maximizing language modeling performance. The dynamic batching technique works by first estimating reference losses for different data domains via computing scaling curves and then adjusting weighting terms for different domains based on the difference between the reference loss and validation loss at different validation intervals. The dynamic batch loading method sounds a bit heuristic, and it requires computing scaling curves which can be often expensive (otherwise the algorithm cannot work), which may need a lot of computing and training time to obtain reference losses if there are many domains. Therefore, the efficacy of this method is questionable.

### Strengths
The paper is clearly written and provides enough context to understand the proposed contents. Given the simplicity of the proposed pruning technique, reproducing the results seems fairly easy. Additionally, the pre-trained checkpoints of the source LLM and the training text dataset are open-sourced, which is another plus. The proposed methods could be practically useful, as there seem to be some use cases where they can help. The pruning technique with target shape constraint shows a potential that this can work on different types of neural architecture, however, there is no empirical evidence in the paper.

### Weaknesses
The proposed pruning method is sound, but it is very specific for the Transformer architecture.

The title "ACCELERATING LANGUAGE MODEL PRE-TRAINING VIA STRUCTURED PRUNING" is somewhat misleading, as it suggests that the paper is proposing a generic pre-training method. My understanding is that these methods only work in a limited setting. First, a competitive pre-trained checkpoint is required. The proposed methods cannot be used when a model needs to be pre-trained from scratch. However, they may be effective in certain cases, such as when an LLM needs to be compressed and trained on different data domains (not necessarily the same ones used in the original pre-training).

Additionally, the authors' claim that this method can significantly reduce training costs compared to other LLMs trained from scratch is an overstatement, e.g. saying things like the proposed variant is outperforming baselines (which are usually trained on 300B~1T tokens) by only trained on 50B tokens. The authors should count the cost of training the source LLM as the worst-case scenario. Comparing the performance with other baselines without counting the significant training computes used for the source LLMs (7B parameters and 2T tokens) is unfair. To my knowledge, the dynamic batch loading technique is required to recover the performance on the data domains after pruning. In that case, the cost to compute the reference losses should also be reported somewhere in the paper, and it should be mentioned in the main table. It is misleading to only count the tokens used for a single training run of the pruned model when there are significant prerequisites to make it work in the first place (pre-trained and competitive LLMs and performing scaling studies on different sub-datasets).

If the same methods can also be applied to another source LLM and show similar improvements over baselines, this would reinforce the reported findings. It is difficult to distinguish whether the improvement is due to the superiority of the source LLM or the proposed methods.

Minor comments:
In Section 2.2, you wrote " pre-training dataset RedPajama (TogetherAI, 2023b; LLaMA’s pre-training dataset)". RedPajama is not the exact pre-training dataset used to train LLAMA2, but it's an open-source version trying to replicate the original training corpus, am I correct?

If Figure 8 is mentioned in the main paper, it should be included in the main paper, not the appendix.

### Questions
How much compute wasused to get the reference loss for each domain? Can the authors provide a breakdown and total costs?

What happens if authors continue training the model (sheared LLaMA) beyond 50B tokens? 
The training cost used for sheared LLaMA is as follows: 2T (7B parameter LLM) + 50B (2.7B LLM).
If one continues training one of the baselines, e.g., Open-LLaMA-3B-v2 for an additional 1T token, would sheared LLaMA still outperform?
