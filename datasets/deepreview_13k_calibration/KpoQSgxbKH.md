## Abstract
Generative models have gained more and more attention in recent years for their remarkable success in tasks that required estimating and sampling data distribution to generate high-fidelity synthetic data. In speech, text-to-speech synthesis and neural vocoder are good examples where generative models have shined. While generative models have been applied to different applications in speech, there exists no general-purpose generative model that models speech directly. In this work, we take a step toward this direction by showing a single pre-trained generative model can be adapted to different downstream tasks with strong performance. Specifically, we pre-trained a generative model, named SpeechFlow, on 60k hours of untranscribed speech with Flow Matching and masked conditions. Experiment results show the pre-trained generative model can be fine-tuned with task-specific data to match or surpass existing expert models on speech enhancement, separation, and synthesis. Our work suggested a foundational model for generation tasks in speech can be built with generative pre-training.

### Rating

### Rating Number
3

### Confidence
5: You are absolutely certain about your assessment. You are very familiar with the related work and checked the math/other details carefully.

### Summary
This paper proposes to use flow matching for speech generation. Experiments are conducted for speech enhancement, speech separation, and TTS.

### Strengths
The idea of using flow matching for speech synthesis is sound.

### Weaknesses
1. The novelty is limited. It's basically applying flow matching to the speech synthesis problem.
2. The evaluation of the experimental results are weak. For speech generation, subjective human evaluation are expected, especially for TTS. Without such evaluation, the results are not persuasive.
3. There is a disconnection between the main claim and the experimental results. The experimental results show strong performance with using flow matching for speech synthesis in a pretraining and fine-tuning matter (finetuning was done with large datasets, e.g. 360 / 960 hours speech) . However, it's not clear that it's a results of "a foundational model". The experiments of SpeechFlow without pretraining is not persuasive because it uses the same model size, which likely leads to overfitting.
4. The description of the experiments are severely limited. For example, what datasets were used, and the details on the model architecture and hyperparameteres. I have a major concern on reproductivity.

### Questions
- Sec 4.1 -- what are. the 60k hours of English speech data for training?
- Sec 4.3 -- can you give details on the 360 hours of training data?
- Sec 4.4 -- what's the 960 hours of transcribed English speech used for fine-tuning?
- Sec 4.4. -- the term "zero-shot TTS" is improper because the model is trained with fully supervised data. the reference is improper either as there are earlier and more established works not cited.
- Sec 3.1 -- typo: "variational audio encoders" => "variational autoencoders"

### Confidence
4: You are confident in your assessment, but not absolutely certain. It is unlikely, but not impossible, that you did not understand some parts of the submission or that you are unfamiliar with some pieces of related work.

### Summary
Speechflow is a generative model for speech generation and various tasks of it. It is trained with unlabeled speech with the goal of estimating the underlying distribution of speech conditioning on masked audio. Then it is fine-tuned for each specific task using labeled data.

### Strengths
-Novel idea on making a general-purpose speech generation model that can perform the following tasks outperforming the current SOTA approaches: speech enhancement, speech separation, zero-shot tts.
-I have listened to the audio samples and the model seems to perform well and produce high quality audio samples for all the tasks.
-Novelty of modeling speech directly.

### Weaknesses
 -No subjective evaluation is presented which could be useful for the users of this model. Most TTS works present both subjective and objective metrics for the evaluation.
-The work is not a very good match for this venue. It would be more suitable in a speech-related venue like ICASSP or InternSpeech.

### Questions
-What dataset are you using? for pre-training. You mention 60k hours of English speech.
-Have you tried different mask instead of filling with zeros?

### Summary
This paper proposes pre-training a flow-based speech synthesizer using 60kh of untranscribed speech, then fine-tuning it for downstream tasks including speech enhancement, speech separation, and zero-shot TTS.  In any self-supervised paradigm, one must find a way to add labels during the fine-tuning process; here, that problem is solved by using masked spectrograms as pseudo-labels during pre-training, then replacing those with actual labels (noisy speech, mixed speech, or phone sequences) during fine-tuning.  The idea of using masked spectrograms to condition flow was also used in the VoiceBox flow synthesizer, but that paper did not include a self-supervised pre-training stage.

### Strengths
Generative pre-training for speech synthesis might have been first proposed in "Semi-Supervised Training for Improving Data Efficiency in End-to-end Speech Synthesis" by Chung et al., 2019.  Generative flow was used for vocoding in "Waveglow: A flow-based generative network for speech synthesis," and was used for TTS in "Flowtron: an Autoregressive Flow-based Generative Network for Text-to-Speech Synthesis" --- neither of those papers used the flow matching paradigm, instead they trained the flow networks using end-to-end training criteria only.  The combination of these two ideas (flow-based TTS and pre-trained TTS) was not proposed in any paper I can find.  The new contribution of this manuscript, the use of generative flow in a self-supervised pre-training stage, is an elegant idea that forms a strong theoretical paradigm, and that is supported by strong experimental results compared to challenging baselines.

### Weaknesses
By omitting key references, this paper seems to be suggesting that nobody has ever thought of using self-supervised pre-training for speech synthesis before, and it seems to be suggesting that nobody has ever used generative flow for speech synthesis before.  The manuscript should include references to key works in both areas, in order to more clearly articulate what is the actual contribution of the paper. The paper's claim of being the first to use generative pre-training for a variety of tasks is not sufficiently supported, as prior work has explored similar ideas in speech enhancement and other generative tasks. The paper should also more clearly differentiate its approach from existing flow-based models, particularly in the context of flow matching versus traditional invertible flow architectures.

### Questions
The paper should better describe the history of (1) the use of self-supervised pre-training for speech enhancement and speech synthesis, and (2) the use of generative flow in speech synthesis.  I recommend the following references, but I think there may be others that I'm missing:

### Summary
The paper proposes to pretrain a flow-based model with unsupervised pre-training and supervised fine-tuning paradigms. The pre-trained generative model can be fine-tuned with task-specific data for speech enhancement, separation, and synthesis. According to the results across several benchmarks, the proposed models match or surpass existing expert models.

### Strengths
The paper explores a novel direction to pre-train a general-purpose generative model with unlabeled speech using flow-based models. The most similar work is Voicebox, a flow-based model with supervised slot-filling training, and the authors conduct details discussion and experimental comparisons to show the advantages. The pre-trained model can be finetuned to support various tasks such as speech enhancement, separation, and synthesis. The experiments are convincing.

### Weaknesses
One primary limitation of this work is the relatively limited range of supported task types. It would be beneficial for the authors to expand their support to include a wider variety of tasks, such as speech editing tasks, to further demonstrate the capabilities of their pre-trained models. By incorporating additional task types, the authors can provide a more comprehensive evaluation of the model's abilities and showcase its versatility across various domains. This would enhance the overall contribution and applicability of the proposed pre-training approach.
