## Abstract
Cross-modal knowledge distillation (KD) has expanded the traditional KD approach to encompass multimodal learning, achieving notable success in various applications. However, in cases where there is a considerable shift in data distribution during cross-modal KD, even a more accurate teacher model may not effectively instruct the student model. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive analysis and evaluation of the effectiveness of cross-modal KD, focusing on its dependence on the distribution shifts in multimodal data. We initially view cross-modal KD as training a maximum entropy model using pseudo-labels and establish conditions under which it outperforms unimodal KD. Subsequently, we introduced the hypothesis of solution space divergence, which unveils the crucial factor influencing the efficacy of cross-modal KD. Our key observation is that the accuracy of the teacher model is not the primary determinant of the student model's accuracy; instead, the data distribution shifts play a more significant role. We demonstrate that as the data distribution shifts decrease, the effectiveness of cross-modal KD improves, and vice versa. Finally, to address significant data distribution differences, we propose a method called the ``perceptual solution space mask'' to enhance the effectiveness of cross-modal KD. Through experimental results on four multimodal datasets, we validate our assumptions and provide directions for future enhancements in cross-modal knowledge transfer. Notably, our enhanced KD method demonstrated an approximate 2\% improvement in \emph{mIoU} compared to the Baseline on the SemanticKITTI dataset.

### Confidence
3: You are fairly confident in your assessment. It is possible that you did not understand some parts of the submission or that you are unfamiliar with some pieces of related work. Math/other details were not carefully checked.

### Summary
This work explored cross-modal KD (knowledge distillation) in multimodal learning. First, the hypothesis of solution space divergence (SPDH) is introduced to show that the success in cross-modal KD is decided by the data distribution shift. Then an effective method called PSSM (perceptual solution space mask) is proposed to enhance cross-modal KD. Experimental results on four popular datasets verify the effectiveness of the proposed hypothesis and method.

### Strengths
**Originality**: The paper proposes a hypothesis, SSDH, to show the key factor in cross-modal KD and a method, PSSM, to tackle the degradation in KD due to multimodal data. Both SSDH and PSSM are instructive.

**Quality**: The paper provides extensive experimental evaluations of the proposed hypothesis and method. 

**Clarity**: The paper also provides sufficient background information and related work to situate the contribution of the proposed hypothesis and method in the context of existing literature on cross-modal KD, KD analysis, and distribution shifts.

**Significance**: The paper has established the conditions under which cross-modal KD outperforms unimodal scenarios. This is very important for future research.

### Weaknesses
 **Symbol List in the Appendix**: 
It would be beneficial to include a comprehensive symbol list in the Appendix. This addition will enhance the clarity of the notation used throughout the paper.

**Table Placement**:
Consider moving some experimental results from the Appendix, specifically Tables 2, 5, and 6, into the main paper. On the other hand, certain equations from Sec. 3.2 might be more appropriately placed in the Appendix to streamline the main content.

**Formatting Improvements**:
The format of the paper requires further attention. Specifically, the use of `\cite` and `\citet` appears confusing. A consistent and clear citation style should be maintained throughout the manuscript.

### Summary
This paper investigates a weighted distillation loss by cosine similarity between teacher and student networks' logits under cross-modal setting.

### Strengths
This paper is well-written with clear assumptions and hypothesis, where later the hypothesis is experimentally validated by using synthetic Gaussian data.

### Weaknesses
My biggest confusion is that it is relatively difficult for me to connect data distribution shifts with KL divergence between two different probability distributions. From my understanding, the connection between data distribution shifts (here in this paper, modality differences) and ''solution space'' is a little bit absurd. The paper seems to imply that differences in input modality directly translate to differences in the optimal solution space, which is not necessarily true. While the network's parameters define the solution space, the relationship between input data distribution and the optimal parameters is complex and not explicitly addressed. The paper needs to clarify how changes in input modality directly influence the network's learned probability distribution in a way that justifies the use of cosine similarity on logits as a proxy for solution space differences. This connection requires more rigorous justification.

And also please see questions.

### Questions
1. Please check Eqn. (11), it might be wrong after the = symbol;
2. Why choose the cosine similarity function? Can other functions be used? What are the results?
3. Just curious, for A.3, what are the results if input noisy MNIST to student and use MNIST-M for teacher?

### Summary
This paper examines the influence of data distribution shifts on cross-modal knowledge distillation (KD) and establishes the circumstances in which cross-modal KD surpasses unimodal scenarios. It introduces the Solution Space Divergence Hypothesis (SSDH) to elucidate the difficulties encountered in cross-modal KD and proposes a technique known as the Perceptual Solution Space Mask (PSSM) to tackle substantial disparities in data distribution.

### Strengths
The paper includes theoretical analysis and method improvement, which is very good. The SSDH provides an insightful theoretical analysis of how data distribution shifts can lead to divergence between teacher and student solution spaces, hampering cross-modal KD. PSSM is an innovative practical method to enhance cross-modal KD by focusing on output features with smaller solution space differences.  Comprehensive literature review of cross-modal KD and related techniques like data distribution shifts.

### Weaknesses
1. Although this article provides a SOLUTION SPACE DIVERGENCE HYPOTHERSIS, the proposed PERCEPTUAL SOLUTION SPACE MASK (PSSM) is  simple and trivial  and plays a similar role to other common knowledge distillation methods.
2. There are few experiments in this paper. Please compare it with more classic single-modal and cross-modal knowledge distillation methods.

### Questions
Please refer to the weaknesses.
Please provide evidence of the differences in effectiveness between the PSSM in this article and other classical knowledge distillation methods. Please compare it with more classical unimodal and crossmodal knowledge distillation methods as part of your experiments.

### Confidence
4: You are confident in your assessment, but not absolutely certain. It is unlikely, but not impossible, that you did not understand some parts of the submission or that you are unfamiliar with some pieces of related work.

### Summary
The paper conducted a comprehensive exploration of cross-modal knowledge distillation and its broader application in multimodal learning. SPDH is introduced to highlight the role if data distribution disparities across modalities in KD effectiveness and PSSM is proposed to mitigate the impact of data distribution shifts on cross-modal KD. Experimental results on four multimodal datasets validate the assumptions and provide directions for future enhancements in cross-modal knowledge transfer.

### Strengths
1.	The paper is well-motivated with a focus on the effectiveness of cross-modal KD and its dependence on the distribution shifts in multimodal data.
2.	The theoretical derivations are relatively sufficient and comprehensive.
3.	The experiments validate the method for enhancing the effectiveness of cross-modal KD.

### Weaknesses
1.	The paper organization should be optimized, for instance, some detailed derivation can be put in the appendix while it is suggested to use more space for experiments and analysis (Sections 4.3 and 4.4).

2.	The experiments show that the proposed enhanced KD method demonstrates performance improvement compared to the Baseline. However, can it achieve state-of-the-art performance compared to existing cross-modal KD methods (e.g., [a,b]) tailored to specific multimodal tasks?

3.	More qualitative cases are suggested to be provided to better illustrate the effects the proposed enhanced cross-modal KD method has.

### Questions
The weaknesses mentioned above should be carefully responded in the rebuttal phase.
Besides, there are two more questions:
1.    The figures are not clear enough, especially when zoomed in.
2.    Some typo errors should be carefully checked and modified, like “modaalities” in page 2.
