## Abstract
We demonstrate that Contrastive Decoding -- a simple, computationally light, and training-free text generation method proposed by Li et al 2022 -- achieves large out-of-the-box improvements over greedy decoding on a variety of reasoning tasks. Originally shown to improve the perceived quality of long-form text generation, Contrastive Decoding searches for strings that maximize a weighted difference in likelihood between strong and weak models. We show that Contrastive Decoding leads LLaMA-65B to outperform LLaMA 2, GPT-3.5 and PaLM 2-L on the HellaSwag commonsense reasoning benchmark, and to outperform LLaMA 2, GPT-3.5 and PaLM-540B on the GSM8K math word reasoning benchmark, in addition to improvements on a collection of other tasks. Analysis suggests that Contrastive Decoding improves over existing methods by preventing some abstract reasoning errors, as well as by avoiding simpler modes such as copying sections of the input during chain-of-thought. Overall, Contrastive Decoding outperforms nucleus sampling for long-form generation and greedy decoding for reasoning tasks, making it a powerful general purpose method for generating text from language models.

### Summary
The authors experiment with Contrastive decoding, proposed by Li et al 2022, on three groups of reasoning tasks: algebraic word problems, commensense reasoning, and multiple choice reasoning. Contrastive decoding improves generations by finding sequences which maximizes a likelihood difference between a “strong” and “weak” model. They report better performances compared to greedy decoding for most of the arithmetic tasks and mixed results for commensense reasoning tasks. The authors analyze the out-of-the-box gain in performance and state that it could be attributed to contrastive decoding’s ability to prevent unwanted patterns in the strong model’s output (e.g. generic phrases, copies of the input phrases, etc) compared to greedy generation.

### Strengths
The refactoring of the original contrastive decoding formulation to work in logit space is a nice idea. Authors claim that this makes the method more interpretable, which I’m not sure about.

The authors cover a good number of tasks for arithmetic, commensense and multiple-choice reasoning. This makes for interesting results in the additional studies section, in which they did a good job at analyzing generations from CD to interpret the gains or losses from CD compared to greedy generation.

### Weaknesses
The paper lacks novelty as its primary contribution is merely the application of an existing method to additional datasets without introducing innovative or original elements.

The paper’s concept bears a noticeable resemblance to Coherence Boosting by Malkin et al 2022, which is similarly a simple inference-time method improving generations and rankings. However, this paper is not mentioned in related works. It seems that it would also be a reasonable baseline to compare contrastive decoding to.

The mixed results on commensense reasoning tasks, and results without self-consistency on arithmetic datasets do not strongly support the claims, and do not align well with the narrative and title of the paper.

### Questions
As mentioned before, the method is very similar to coherence boosting (Malkin et al 2022). I believe it is reasonable to add it as a baseline and compare results. 

In all the experiments (except for FLAN-T5), the smallest amateur model has 1B parameters. What would happen if you used smaller models? Given that CD can benefit from mid-training checkpoints, I believe studying smaller models as amateur models would be interesting. Perhaps you could use a different family of models and experiment with cross-family “strong” and “weak” models.

If contrastive decoding improves overall generation quality, it should ideally exhibit some improvement in the results without the presence of CoT in the prompts. Do you have any insights on why this is not happening?

In Fig.9 the FLOP increase of self-consistency is compared to contrastive decoding. Self-consistency does not have a hyper-parameter. How would you factor in your hyper-parameters (and search) in the FLOPS increase for CD?

Not a question, but I think that Fig.1 could benefit from an “Average” row at the top as well (at least the greedy generations).

### Summary
The paper addresses reasoning ability of large language models. The authors exploit and slightly modify and existing approach (Contrastive decoding) to improve, at inference time, the reasoning ability of pretrained LLMs.  The experimental results give a thorough analysis of the power of this approach, for long-form generation and for reasoning tasks.

### Strengths
1) The paper reports exhaustive experimental results (arithmetic analysis, commonsense reasoning, ranking), parameters analysis and ablation studies. Quantitative analysis and comparisons with related methods are well presented. I appreciate the overall discussions of the strengths and weaknesses of the model in different scenarios/case studies (ie, arithmetic vs reasoning). The overall conclusions of this experimental results highlight the potential of the Contrastive decoding approach and might be exploited in future work by others. 

2) The paper is well written overall, the general purpose of the approach clearly presented.

### Weaknesses
1) Novelty
The experimental results and conclusions of the paper are certainly interesting, but those are mainly based on an idea and concept borrowed from an existing paper (Li and al, 2022). The changes wrt to this previous work are minor in my opinion. The strength of the current submission is the experimental nature of the work, but the approach itself lacks of novelty. 

2) Presentation (minor weakness)
Since the current approach is based on previous work (Contrastive decoding, Li and al, 2022), it would be preferable to first give a recall of this early work, before introducing the revised formulation proposed by the authors. I had to read the original work in order to understand section 2.1, the meaning of the alpha-mask and of logic/motivation behind the logits-substraction.

### Questions
Could we use the idea of Contrastive decoding during the training stage itself?

### Summary
This paper explores how well Contrastive Decoding (CD), an alternative generation strategy proposed by Li et al. in 2022, performs on reasoning tasks. It reformulates CD and introduces a hyperparameter \beta, which controls the strength of the contrastive penalty. Contrastive Decoding (CD) can significantly improve over greedy decoding on some reasoning tasks, especially arithmetic tasks such as GSM8K. It can also yield smaller gains on commonsense reasoning tasks with large models and some contrastive ranking tasks such as HSwag. However, CD can degrade performance on other tasks, such as MATH and commonsense reasoning tasks with smaller models. Relative to greedy decoding, CD performs worse on arithmetic skills, better on logical reasoning, and can harm factual recall.
The paper shows that CD works better under certain conditions, such as when using weaker amateur models and with chain-of-thought prompting. Although the paper reports most of its experiments on LLAMA models, it does show that CD can produce small gains on FLAN-T5 in one experiment.

### Strengths
* Shows that Contrastive Decoding can improve upon greedy decoding for some reasoning tasks
* Reports ablation studies exploring the type of problems where CD performs better or worse than greedy decoding.
* Presents ablations that show the factors that affect the performance of CD, such as the sensitivity to the contrastive penalty term (i.e., β) and the type of amateur model (e.g., weak vs. strong, using negative prompting, using earlier checkpoints).

### Weaknesses
 * Contrastive Decoding (CD) yields highly inconsistent results. For example, it improves on arithmetic reasoning tasks such as GSM8K but not on MATH. It yields small gains on Commonsense Reasoning tasks, but only with large models and on some Contrastive Ranking tasks such as HSwag. Given these mixed results, it is unclear when to use CD effectively.
* The paper does not provide a detailed error analysis by presenting wins/losses on tasks or offer other insights into why CD performs better/worse on specific tasks. For instance, it would be valuable to see examples of where the contrastive decoding fails on the MATH dataset, and if there are any patterns in the types of errors that occur.
* Contrastive Decoding (CD) only works with chain-of-thought reasoning. This seems like a significant limitation, and it would be valuable to conduct more ablation studies to understand it better. It is unclear if this limitation is due to the nature of the tasks, or if it is an inherent limitation of the method itself.
* Most of the experiments in the paper (except for the single T5-FLan result) are obtained with LLAMA models. This makes it unclear whether CD would show the same behavior with other pre-trained models. The lack of experiments on other families of models limits the generalizability of the findings.

### Questions
* It would be good to provide error analysis (samples of wins/losses) especially when CD does not work e.g. on MATH
* In 2.1, it would be good to highlight that \alpha in [0,1] i.e. log \alpha <0. 
* Figure 4: What does 'GSM 8K EM' mean? 
* Table 1: What is the metric being shown?
* P7: In the section titled 'CD reduces copying from the prompt', can you provide statistics from the experiment for the baseline/CD models?
* Sec 2.2: It is not immediately obvious why the distribution in Equation 1 collapses to the argmax of pe/pa as beta->\infinity. It would be useful to show the steps in the appendix.
