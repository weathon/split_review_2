## Abstract
Climate change exacerbates riverine floods, which occur with higher frequency and intensity than ever. The much-needed forecasting systems typically rely on accurate river discharge predictions. To this end, the SOTA data-driven approaches treat forecasting at spatially distributed gauge stations as isolated problems, even within the same river network. However, incorporating the known river network topology into the prediction model has the potential to leverage the adjacency relationship between gauges. Thus, we model river discharge for a network of gauging stations with a GNN, and compare the forecasting performance achieved by different adjacency definitions. Our results show that the model fails to benefit from the river network topology information, regardless of the number of layers and, thus, propagation distance. The learned edge weights correlate with neither of the static definitions and exhibit no regular pattern. Furthermore, a worst-case analysis reveals that the GNN struggles to predict sudden discharge spikes. This work may serve as a justification for the SOTA treating gauges independently and suggests that more improvement potential lies in anticipating spikes.

4: You are confident in your assessment, but not absolutely certain. It is unlikely, but not impossible, that you did not understand some parts of the submission or that you are unfamiliar with some pieces of related work.

### Summary
The authors conducted an experiment to determine if topology information (i.e. slope, elevation change, and distance) could be used to improve flood forecasting results for graph neural networks. The authors concluded that the models do not benefit from inclusion of this information.

### Strengths
The field of flood forecasting still relies heavily on physics-based models and there is excellent potential to implement machine-learning approaches to improve existing practices.

The authors provide a detailed description of the methodology that was implemented, and the results should be reproducible by other researchers.

Relevant metrics to the field of flood forecasting including the Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency.

### Weaknesses
 Aside from Figure 4, which is described as the worst case scenario, no graphical results are shown to demonstrate the behaviour of the model.

If the model is intended to be used for flood forecasting rather than general daily flow forecasting, the training and testing process used in this study may not be appropriate. Instead of evaluating an entire period of record, flood forecasting models typically identify individual events within the historical flow record using an approach such as peak over threshold.

Given the negative results, additional attempts should be made to identify and demonstrate how/why the model is failing. Graphical analysis of results for a few sites would help to evaluate this.

It seems that the choices of 6 hours and 24 hours for the lead time and lookback windows, respectively, are arbitrary. The flood wave celerity between stations under typical flood peaks could be computed from the historical flow records to make an informed decision on how to select this window, ensuring that peaks have enough time to travel between stations.

Is it reasonable to perform element-wise normalization for a graph where the value of nodes relative to adjacent nodes is important? Additionally, have you considered that these absolute values (i.e. flows) may affect flood wave celerity (i.e. changes in discharge under Manning’s equation)?

What did the results look like on the best-performing stations? Were flood peaks predicted with errors in timing or magnitude, or did the model fail to predict them at all?

### Confidence
3: You are fairly confident in your assessment. It is possible that you did not understand some parts of the submission or that you are unfamiliar with some pieces of related work. Math/other details were not carefully checked.

### Summary
The paper described an application of graph neural nets for making using of river network topology, for the task of forecasting river discharge. The paper reported under different settings, incorporating such topology information does not improve the prediction accuracy and concludes that topology information doesn’t add additional prediction capacity for this task.

### Strengths
1. The paper is well-written and include in-depth details about the experiments, models and data. Together with publicly available code, the result seems to be highly reproducible.
2. The paper discuss the learnings from introducing topology information in a credible fashion, which contributes more to the community how and when such information is not useful.

### Weaknesses
My biggest concern with the paper is that, for such time series forecasting tasks, the paper uses cross validation instead of backtesting for validating model performance. Specifically, the authors splitter 18 years of data into 6 folds of 3 years of data and conducted cross-validation. I found it hard to be convinced of any conclusion derived from such setup. For example, in one of the 6 runs where training data happen to include data in 2014 and the prediction data happens to include data in 2013 - in that case, a model trained with future information is used to predict the past - unless there is no auto-correlation at all, otherwise, such future leakage will undermine the conclusion made from such numerical results. With such concern, it may not necessary be that topology information does not contribute to forecasting future river discharge, but rather, since the model has already known about the past and the future about the river discharge, such topology information may not add any information any more. In practical settings where only historical information is known, having such topology information could still yield accuracy gain - well this is just a hypothesis assuming the experiment is properly set up such that no future information is leaked.

### Questions
My suggestion is to re-run the experiment with backtest settings instead of cross-validation settings.

### Summary
The authors study the use of graph neural networks in flood forecasting. They find that with their models the use of river topology does not add significant value to the prediction of flood events.

### Strengths
- Flood prediction is an important problem under the climate change, and can lead to enormous social good via mitigation of the loss of human lives and economic damage. 

- The current work applies some of the most advanced time-series prediction method like LSTM, combined with using GCN to take into account the network topology to solve this problem.

### Weaknesses
 - The key issue with the current paper is the message is mostly a negative result, that incorporating the network structure does not help with the forecast of flood. Although there are some experimental support to this, it is difficult to draw this conclusion because the authors have only tried a limited set of models. As the claim is counter-intuitive, more analysis, especially analysis of the raw data, is required for supporting the claim. Are there correlations between the water level in two gauge stations upstream and downstream? And are there time lags between between a spike in an upstream gauge station and a downstream gauge station? If so, the spike in the upstream gauge station should be useful for predicting the spike in the downstream gauge station. Why is this not reflected in the experiment results? 

- I have reservations about the way the problem is modeled. Since we are interested in predicting flood, which is a rare event, fitting the average MSE loss to the time series data might not be the best approach. Assuming the floods are rare large spikes in the data, a conservative model will do best by trying NOT to predict a large spike, as getting the timing of the spike wrong can incur a huge MSE loss. It could, for example, be modeled alternatively as a time series prediction problem, where we try to predict if there is a flood event within the next 6 hours given the water level in the past 24 hours. There could be multiple ways to model this but MSE on the water level does not seem the right fit for modeling rare spike events.

### Questions
- How long does it take on average for the flow from one upstream gauge station to reach a neighboring downstream gauge station? I think these values should be taken into account for the history window size (24 hours currently) and the prediction horizon (6 hours currently). 

- What is the sample size for each gauge station? Or more importantly, what is the average number of flood events that each gauge station experience in the data? If the sample size is small, it could be beneficial to just pool all the data and train one model for the time series prediction of rare events, than to spread the rare event samples across multiple stations and try to model their correlations. Could that be a reason why the incorporation of network structure is not helping here? 

- The authors claim that the methods perform similarly. From Table 2 it seems to be true for NSE, but MSE has a lot more variations across the different methods. Why is this the case?
