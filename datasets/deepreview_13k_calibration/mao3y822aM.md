## Abstract
As language models scale up, it becomes increasingly expensive to verify research ideas because conclusions on small models do not trivially transfer to large ones. A possible solution is to establish a generic system that accurately predicts certain metrics for large models without training them. Existing scaling laws require hyperparameter search on the largest models, limiting their predicative capability. In this paper, we present an approach (namely \muscaling) to predict the pre-training loss, based on our observations that Maximal Update Parametrization ($\mu$P) enables accurate fitting of scaling laws close to common loss basins in hyperparameter space. With \muscaling, different model designs can be compared on large scales by training only their smaller counterparts. 
Further, we introduce \modelname: an affordable LLM pre-training benchmark
that facilitates this new research paradigm.
With around \textbf{$14\%$} of the one-time pre-training cost, we can accurately forecast the loss for models up to
\textbf{52B}. 

Our goal with \modelname is to empower researchers with limited resources to reach meaningful conclusions on large models. We also aspire for our benchmark to serve as a bridge between the academic community and the industry.

### Summary
Large language models (LLMs) have shown impressive performance on various tasks, with models getting increasingly larger. However, training such large models is computationally expensive. Recent work has explored scaling up data size rather than just model size, showing performance gains with smaller models trained on more data (Chinchilla). The goal of this paper is to introduce nanoLM, a benchmark for cost-effective LLM research within limited compute budgets. Larger LLMs like Meta's LLAMA require upwards of 1.7 million GPU hours and hundreds of billions of tokens to pre-train, using model parallelism.
Authors rely on μP and μScaling, which are methods for transferring hyperparameters (HPs) when scaling up model size. μP is a zero-shot transferring function for certain HPs like learning rate and initialization variance when changing model width. μScaling complements μP by fitting a power-law function to predict the loss L' that could be achieved by training a larger model M' with width w' and HP H', without directly training M'. 
Together, μP and μScaling allow extrapolating language models from small to large scale without expensive direct training, by predicting the optimal HPs and loss for larger models based on results from smaller models. This enables more efficient study of how model structure and non-μTransferable parameters affect large-scale LMs.
Authors then introduce the NanoLM benchmark for computing the loss of the different models with varying sizes. NanoLM allows comparing different LLM architectures by predicting their training loss, without having to do full training. It supports common architectures like GPT, BERT, and T5. Experiments validate nanoLM's ability to accurately predict loss for large models (26B-52B parameters) by fitting small models (38M-3.4B parameters), using just 13-14% of the total pre-training cost. They also include other empirical evaluations of the released benchmark. Finally, the authors release curated pre-training datasets with 100B to 2T tokens covering various domains. All code and datasets are open-sourced.

Overall this is a potentially high impact paper since releasing benchmarking datasets is always a great addition to the field. However, I think there is some analysis missing on comparison of their work with other similar papers such as  [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2304.01373.pdf, https://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.14322.pdf]. I would like to see more evidence that the predictions errors are meaningfully small and therefore the results are robust and would be happy to update my review if those are provided,

### Strengths
- Authors tackle an important problem of democratizing access to effectively experimenting with and comparing large language models, which has so far been limited to only the most resource-rich organizations. This could help advance LLM research and applications. It Enables researchers to compare LLMs within limited compute by predicting losses of smaller models instead of expensive end-to-end training. 
- Authors open source their benchmark (and code) thus greatly contributing to the advancement of the field. Making more benchmarks available ensures the field continues to innovate on interesting problems and ensures the available datasets are not overused.
- Authors validates nanoLM's loss prediction capabilities across scales - from simplified settings to 26B and 52B parameter models and show it achieves accurate loss forecasting for large models by fitting losses of smaller models, reducing pre training costs significantly (to 13-14% of total).
- Authors release the curated datasets used for pre-training and evaluation which can be used by other researchers.

### Weaknesses
 - The paper relies heavily on loss prediction as an evaluation metric, but does not provide strong evidence that lower loss directly translates to better downstream task performance. More analysis is needed to validate that loss is an appropriate proxy. 
- Authors show experiments that indicate that nanoLM can predict the loss of extremely large-sized models by fitting the losses of several smaller models. It is not clear how to calibrate the error they report. It would be good to compare the results the authors show the comparison with other sources of data for predicting loss such as the results of [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2304.01373.pdf]. In the same vein, it would be good to compare against other work in the field e.g. [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.14322.pdf]. 
- The long-term value of the benchmark requires ongoing maintenance and user adoption, which are not discussed. Plans for supporting and expanding nanoLM could be elaborated.

### Questions
- The experiments are limited to English language modeling. Have the authors considered testing the approach for other languages and tasks? It would strengthen the claims of applicability.
- How can I calibrate the results of this work, could you elaborate on why the reported errors are considered small? I think there is some analysis missing on comparison of their work with other similar papers such as  [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2304.01373.pdf, https://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.14322.pdf]. I would like to see more evidence that the predictions errors are meaningfully small and therefore the results are robust.

### Summary
The study addresses the challenge of identifying the best model configurations when computational resources are limited. It applies a method that involves training smaller models to estimate the performance of larger ones, thus facilitating the selection of the most efficient model design.

### Strengths
1. The paper is well-constructed, with lucidity and straightforwardness. The rationale behind selecting the most effective model design under computational constraints is well-motivated.
2. The authors have successfully utilized established techniques such as \mu P and \mu Scaling to anticipate the performance loss in larger Language Models (LLMs), thereby economizing on training expenses.
3. The research contributes to the field by making available a comprehensive pre-training dataset encompassing 100B to 2T tokens.

### Weaknesses
1. The paper's novelty is questioned as the methodology seems to be a synthesis of pre-existing approaches.
2. The datasets introduced appear to be aggregates of data already available.
3. The study does not offer an in-depth comparative analysis or discussion on how their proposed methodologies diverge from OpenAI's established scaling law[1,2] for loss prediction, as detailed in prior technical reports.

### Summary
This paper builds up a benchmark for evaluating LLM’s performance without direct training. The mainstream transformer architectures and data parallelism are supported. Empirical results demonstrate that the proposed benchmark can accurately predict the loss of models after scaling up.

### Strengths
- This paper proposes a cost-efficient benchmark to study LLM’s performance
- The authors organize the publicly accessible datasets for training LLMs

### Weaknesses
 - To make the paper stronger, the authors should phrase the critical component of the method more clearly.
- In terms of method, the paper lacks its own insights into the scaling law. The two main components uP and uScaling are refer to others’ work and not discussed enough

- Algorithm 1 should be worded more clearly:
  - Does “different in design” mean each input model is different from not only the widths but also the architecture?
  - Line 2: “Generate some models varying widths only” reads confusing. Does it mean generating models for each M_i by varying the widths? Is there any limit to varying the width?
  - Line 3: “Train above small-width models” reads as the width varied in line 2 should be small. So stating it clearly in Line 2 would help readers to understand the whole algorithm.

- In Figure 4, the training loss at 7k and 10k of different sizes of models are shown. 7k and 10k iterations are very early stages of 26B and 52B models. What about the loss prediction accuracy for longer training steps(eg, 20k or more)?

- The author should put the loss prediction values(with multiple fitting and std included) and ground truth into a table and display in the main paper. So the readers have a clear sense of the robustness and performance of the proposed benchmark.

Minor: there are some inconsistent notations and grammar errors, please fix them accordingly.

### Summary
The paper introduces nanoLM, a benchmarking framework aimed at making the study of Large Language Models (LLMs) more affordable and accessible. NanoLM leverages the Scaling Laws for LLMs to predict training loss across various model scales, thus allowing for meaningful comparisons between different architectures and configurations without the need for extensive computational resources. The paper validates the utility of nanoLM by accurately forecasting the loss for models with sizes up to 52B while incurring only a fraction of the total pretraining cost, and it supports a range of Transformer architectures and data parallelism strategies.

### Strengths
* The authors provide a cost-effective and scalable solution for LLM research by enabling accurate loss prediction across various model scales, thus allowing researchers to bypass the computationally intensive direct training phase. TAuthors tested multiple architectures like GPT, BERT, and T5 models.

* The authors also release large-scale, field-specific datasets for pre-training, with token counts ranging from 100B to 2T. This adds significant value as it enables more nuanced and targeted model comparisons and evaluations.

* The authors conducted extensive validation of nanoLM's capabilities across multiple dimensions, including single-machine, single-GPU setups, as well as multi-GPU, multi-machine configurations.

### Weaknesses
 * The paper focuses on loss prediction as the primary metric for benchmarking and comparison, but it does not explore how well this loss prediction correlates with performance on various downstream tasks. It's not clear if this is a limitation as loss on a pre-training task is not always indicative of performance in practical applications.

* While nanoLM aims to be a universal benchmark, its current limitation to the English language could restrict its applicability and adoption in global, multi-lingual research communities.

### Questions
1. How robust is nanoLM's loss prediction across different types of transformer architectures, beyond GPT, BERT, and T5 structures? Have you tried more recent open-source models like Mistral or Llama? Are there certain architectures or hyperparameter configurations where nanoLM's predictions are less accurate?

2. Have you considered extending nanoLM's capabilities to predict other important metrics beyond loss, such as energy efficiency or training time, to provide a more comprehensive view of a model's trade-offs?
