## Abstract
Learning causal relations from observational data is an important task in the real world, yet it remains challenging due to the super-exponential search space and the acyclicity constraint. To address these issues, practitioners develop promising topology-based methods to generate a complete topological ordering, reducing the search space and automatically maintaining the acyclicity constraint. However, these methods typically produce non-unique topological orderings with numerous spurious edges, resulting in decreased accuracy and efficiency in downstream search tasks. While using interventional data can quickly identify (non-)descendants for each node and construct a more precise topological ordering, full interventions are often expensive, unethical, or even infeasible. Therefore, we explore how the more readily available two time-slices data can replace intervention data to improve topological ordering. Based on a conditional independence criterion using two time-slices as auxiliary instrumental variables, we propose a novel Descendant Hierarchical Topology algorithm with Conditional Independence Test (DHT-CIT) to learn causal relations more efficiently, with a smaller search space and fewer spurious edges. Empirical results on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of our DHT-CIT algorithm.

### Summary
The paper is about learning causal relations from two time-slices data, which are more common and realistic than full interventions. The paper proposes a novel algorithm called DHT-CIT, which uses the previous time-slice as an auxiliary instrumental variable to quickly identify the descendants and non-descendants of each node in the causal graph. DHT-CIT can construct a more precise and unique topological ordering, which reduces the search space and spurious edges for learning the true DAG. The paper provides theoretical proofs, synthetic experiments, and a real-world application to demonstrate the effectiveness of DHT-CIT.

### Strengths
1.The paper proposes a novel algorithm, DHT-CIT, that can learn a unique descendant hierarchical topology from two time-slices of data with auxiliary instrumental variables1.
2.The paper shows that DHT-CIT can reduce the search space and address the acyclicity constraint in causal discovery, as well as eliminate numerous spurious edges in the learned topology.
3.The paper demonstrates the superior and robust performance of DHT-CIT on both synthetic and real-world data, compared to several state-of-the-art baselines.

### Weaknesses
1.The paper builds on existing methods and the main contribution is the use of instrumental variables to improve the topological ordering, but this idea seems have been explored in previous works. Specifically, while the use of instrumental variables is a well-established technique in causal inference, the paper does not adequately differentiate its approach from existing methods that also leverage instrumental variables for causal discovery. The novelty of using a previous time-slice as an instrumental variable needs to be more rigorously justified, especially considering that time-lagged variables are often used as proxies for instrumental variables in time series analysis. The paper should clarify how its method addresses the specific challenges of using time-lagged variables as instrumental variables, such as potential violations of the exclusion restriction.
2.The paper only evaluates the algorithm on synthetic data and one real-world dataset. The synthetic data are generated from linear Gaussian models, which may not reflect the complexity and diversity of real-world data. It would be better to conduct more experiments on real-world data from various fields. While the paper mentions experiments with non-linear models, the core evaluation still relies heavily on linear Gaussian data. The real-world dataset, PM-CMR, is a single case study, and more diverse real-world datasets are needed to demonstrate the robustness and generalizability of the proposed method. The paper should also address the potential limitations of its approach when applied to datasets with complex non-linear relationships or non-Gaussian noise distributions, which are common in real-world scenarios.

### Questions
1.How do you handle the cases where the previous time-slice data is missing or unreliable? How does this affect the performance of your algorithm?
2.What are the advantages and limitations of using two time-slices data?
3.How do you generalize your algorithm to other domains and applications, such as social sciences, economics, or biology? What are the challenges and opportunities for applying your algorithm to these fields?

### Summary
This paper uses time-series data to replace experimental interventions to help identify the true causal DAG. Under the acyclic summary graph, the authors introduce auxiliary instrumental variables in time-series to act as interventions for identifying (non-)descendants of each variables and propose a Descendant Hierarchical Topology for learning DAGs.

### Strengths
- This paper presents auxiliary instrumental variables in time-series to improve the topology learning and proposes a novel DHT-CIT algorithm to accurately identify the true DAG. 

- The proposed method has the potential to serve as a plugin module to help existing topology-based methods improve the learned DAGs. 

- This paper is well-organized and easy-to-follow. This paper provides a comprehensive review of traditional causal discovery methods and topology-based methods.

- The authors perform extensive experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. The empirical results provide solid evidence to support the claim of this paper.

### Weaknesses
 - I have some questions: Does this paper rely on Gaussian Models? While the experimental results indicate that the proposed method performs well on some Non-Gaussian Models.

- It would be time-consuming to conduct conditional independence tests for all variables from scratch. Why not use the proposed method directly, based on the Complete Topological Ordering learned by SCORE, to remove the unnecessary edges to identify the Descendant Hierarchical Topology? I think this would save at least half of the time.

- Can the proposed DHT-CIT be regarded as a model-free plugin module that can be incorporated into any existing topology-based method to improve the learned topological graph? Additionally, can it function as a test tool for selecting the true causal graph from Markov equivalence classes?

### Summary
The paper addresses the problem of causal discovery in a time series setting where data from two time slices are given. To do this, the authors propose an approach that identifies the topological order and results in a smaller number of potential edges, which simplifies the pruning problem. The suggested approach utilizes independence tests and the lagged time series structure. In the experiments, the authors compare different causal discovery approaches on artificial data and one real-world dataset.

### Strengths
- Provides a broad overview of different causal discovery works
- Figures are helpful for illustrating some of the concepts  
- The authors make some good efforts for a broad comparison in the experiments, although this could be improved (see Question section)

### Weaknesses
 - Unclear positioning of the paper. It addresses causal discovery with time series data but has very limited discussion of related work in the time series domain. Section 10 of the book "Elements of Causal Inference" could help in formulating a clearer problem statement.
- Novelty is unclear, since Theorem 1 seems to follow directly from the assumed lagged time structure (see Question section for details).
- While there is comparison with a broad range of methods, they are mostly designed for the IID setting rather than the time series setting. 
- The functional form in Eq. (1) is more restrictive than the referenced additive noise model class.



### Questions
My main concern is the unclear positioning of the paper. It refers to DAGs and compares approaches designed for IID data (e.g. PC, FCI, etc.) but in a time series setting, mixing the definitions. A much cleaner definition of the problem setting and introduction of "time slices" is needed, especially the connection between observations at different times as interventions. 

Some remarks and questions:
- You refer to "unique orderings" of the topology. However, this appears impossible since equivalent orderings exist (e.g. X → Y ← Z has completely equivalent orderings (X,Z,Y) and (Z,X,Y)). If the "uniqueness" refers to something else, then this should be clarified early on.
- After the introduction, it is unclear why the problem isn't an edge pruning problem, as mentioned later. It is unclear why the 'naive' approach of pruning edges after obtaining the causal order is insufficient.
- Consider avoiding the use of notations that has not yet been introduced, such as X^t-3 in the introduction.
- You write "two time-slides data" at the end of the introduction. What is a "slide" here?
- The related work is mostly IID approaches with very limited discussion of time series approaches. Why is this?
- You mention causal discovery algorithms identify the equivalence class, which is true for some (e.g. PC, FCI) but not all (e.g. NOTEARS aims to recover the whole DAG). 
- When you mention 'DAG', do you refer to the summary graph? This should be clarified.
- Defining X_i as a random variable does not make sense in the time series setting, where X_i^t is a random variable (with typically only one observation). See Section 10 of "Elements of Causal Inference".
- Equation (1) is more restrictive than an additive noise model. An additive noise model is defined as Y = f(instantaneous parents, all other lagged parents) + N in a time series setting. In your case, you restrict the lagged variables to be separate functions and has only an additive influence. This seems quite restrictive.
- The time slice definition is confusing. You mention an initial slice from 1 to t-1 and the present is t. Where is the gap between them? 
- Assumption 1 seems flawed. X^t should be independent of X^t-i-k given X^t-1, ..., X^t-i since any previous lag could directly impact the current time lag (skip connection), rendering them dependent. 
- Definition 2 is unclear. What about X → Y → Z? It has 3 layers (X)_L1, (Y)_L2, (Z)_L3. By the definition, L1 > L3, so X has a direct edge to Z, which would be wrong?
- Theorem 1 seems to follow directly from the lagged structure and Markov property. A discussion comparing it to Section 10.3 of "Elements of Causal Inference" and the paper "Necessary and sufficient conditions for causal feature selection in time series with latent common causes" by Mastakouri et al. would be helpful.
- Unclear why a time slice is an intervention. It seems a time slice just means recorded at different times (i.e. with a time gap)?
- How do you apply the IID algorithms like PC and FCI to the time series setting? Do you just treat it as IID?
- While the experiments have many approaches in the comparison and different data set sizes, more relevant comparisons to time series methods like Granger causality or VARLiNGAM would be insightful. The functional relationships could also be more general, like neural networks with random weights to generate arbitrary non-linear connections.
