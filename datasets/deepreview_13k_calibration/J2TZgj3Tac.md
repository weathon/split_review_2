## Abstract
In competitive two-agent environments, deep reinforcement learning (RL) methods like Policy Space Response Oracles (PSRO) often increase exploitability between iterations, which is problematic when training in large games. To address this issue, we introduce anytime double oracle (ADO), an algorithm that ensures exploitability does not increase between iterations, and its approximate extensive-form version, anytime PSRO (APSRO). ADO converges to a Nash equilibrium while iteratively reducing exploitability. However, convergence in these algorithms may require adding all of a game's deterministic policies. To improve this, we propose Self-Play PSRO (SP-PSRO), which incorporates an approximately optimal stochastic policy into the population in each iteration. APSRO and SP-PSRO demonstrate lower exploitability and near-monotonic exploitability reduction in games like Leduc poker and Liar's Dice. Empirically, SP-PSRO often converges much faster than APSRO and PSRO, requiring only a few iterations in many games.

### Confidence

### Summary
The authors consider the problem of approximating a Nash equilibrium in a two-player zeros-sum imperfect information games with perfect recall. They propose a new double oracle algorithm, the anytime double oracle (ADO) algorithm that builds a population of policies by adding the best response against an optimal policy of restricted games (restricted by using only a mixture of policies present in the population). They show that the exploitability of ADO, contrary to the one of DO, decrease at each iteration. They also propose the APSRO algorithm an approximation of ADO tailored for extensive games.  Then they propose the SP-PSRO algorithm that enhances APSRO by adding at each iteration a well-chosen mixed strategy.

### Strengths
-The new ADO algorithm improves over the DO algorithm by guarantying a monotonically non-increasing exploit ability.

-The two new practical algorithms APSRO and SP-PSRO seem to improve empirically over their direct competitor the PSRO algorithm.

### Weaknesses
 -While the text is globally easy to read I think that more pointers to the appendix, in particular for the experiments, could improve the clarity of the presented work. Some additional explanations about the computation of $\pi^r$ in the different algorithm is missing at least in the main text.

-The improvement in terms of monotonically of the exploitability curve that motivates the introduction of the different new algorithms is not completely clear in the experiments, especially for the APSRO algorithm vs PSRO algorithm.

- The SP-PSRO  involves many different components: Q-learning for BR, regret minimization for solving the restricted games, potential reservoir sampling and additional supervised learning to train the mixed policy which results in a rather involved algorithm. Maybe it could be interesting to identify the key components of the SP-PSRO 

- It could be useful to describe in details what is the restricted games and how the Nash equilibrium of these games is approximated by regret minimization. And maybe you could also provide more details for the proof of Theorem 3.

- What is the average size of the population in the different experiments? Because one possible drawback of the presented methods is that we have to store all the polices of the populations (and possibly for the average in SP-PSRO). Could you comment on this point?

- P3, beginning of Section 3: It is a bit hard to follow this part without knowing in advance what is DO and PSRO.

- P3, (1): It is not completely clear with the current notations if the policy \pi_i \in \Pi_i could be a mixture of the policies in the population or should be exactly one of them. The introduction suggested that the first statement is the correct one? It could be also interesting to remark that a mixture of policy is also a policy somewhere.

- P5 beginning of Section 4: Can you describe precisely how you do regret minimization among the the population of policies in the restricted game? In particular how do you deal with an increasing number of policies?

- P7 bottom: Can you define precisely the time average \bar{\nu}_i. Th whole procedure looks quite involved. i do not really see the motivation behind the averaged best response.

- P8, Section 6.1: It would be interesting to compare also with ADO to see what the new Double oracle brings over PSRO and how well APSRO approximate ADO. Which hyper-parameters did you use and which regret minimizer did you use in APSRO and SP-PSRO? (pointers to the appendix). Why not use the same horizon for all the games? How many seeds did you use in the experiments?

- P8, Section 6.2: Same remark it would be clearer to add reference to the appendix about the details of the experiments. How do you explain intuitively the gap between SP-PSRO and the other algorithms? It seems that that  SP-PSRO converges quickly but then get stuck to a sub-optimal solution, e.g. in Leduc Poker it converges to an exploitability of ~0.4 which is not that good for this game. It is not very clear in Fig 5 that the exploitability of APSRO decrease more monotonically than the one of PSRO contrary to what is claim in the previous sections (in particular for tiny battleship. Could you comment on this point? 

- P8, Section 6.2: Same question as above. And would it be possible to use larger horizon in Fig 6 and 5 to see if the exploitabilities of SP-PSRO and APSRO cross or not. How do you compute the average strategy in the experiments?

### Summary
I have read the author's rebuttal, and I have decided to keep my score unchanged. The main reason is the resource consumption issue of PSRO-like methods in large-scale problems. The author mentioned Barrage Stratego, which is still too small for me (as a RL researcher). I acknowledge that large-scale problems, multi-player games, and multi-agent issues often do not guarantee convergence to Nash equilibrium, but the vast majority of problems we actually face are of this kind. Therefore, I encourage the author to try PSRO-like methods in these problems to expand the impact of the article.

========================================================================================================

This paper addresses the issue of increased exploitability in deep reinforcement learning methods, such as Policy Space Response Oracles (PSRO), in competitive two-agent environments. The authors propose anytime double oracle (ADO), an algorithm that ensures exploitability does not increase between iterations, and its approximate extensive-form version, anytime PSRO (APSRO). Furthermore, the paper introduces Self-Play PSRO (SP-PSRO), which incorporates an approximately optimal stochastic policy into the population in each iteration. Experiments demonstrate that APSRO and SP-PSRO have lower exploitability and near-monotonic exploitability reduction in games like Leduc poker and Liar's Dice, with SP-PSRO converging much faster than APSRO and PSRO.

### Strengths
Originality: The paper presents novel algorithms (ADO, APSRO, and SP-PSRO) that address the exploitability issue in competitive two-agent environments, which is a significant contribution to the field of deep reinforcement learning.
Quality: The proposed algorithms are well-motivated, theoretically grounded, and empirically validated through experiments on various games.
Clarity: The paper is well-written, with clear explanations of the algorithms and their motivations, making it easy to understand the authors' contributions.
Significance: The proposed algorithms have the potential to significantly improve the performance of deep reinforcement learning methods in large games, making them more applicable to real-world problems.

### Weaknesses
Scalability: While the proposed algorithms show promising results in the tested games, it is unclear how they would scale to even larger games or more complex environments, such as limit Texas Hold'em or Atari games. The paper could provide more insights into the scalability and potential limitations of the proposed algorithms in these settings.

Comparison: The paper could benefit from a more comprehensive comparison with other state-of-the-art methods, including non-PSRO methods such as population-based training and league training (e.g., AlphaStar). This would provide a clearer understanding of the relative performance of the proposed algorithms and their advantages over existing approaches.

Generalization: The paper focuses on competitive two-agent environments, but it would be interesting to see how the algorithms could be adapted or extended to handle multi-agent or cooperative settings, where exploitability is harder to compute but more general problems are commonly encountered.

### Questions
Similiar to the weaknesses:

Can the authors provide more insights into the scalability of the proposed algorithms, particularly in the context of larger games or more complex environments, such as limit Texas Hold'em or Atari games?

How do the proposed algorithms compare to other state-of-the-art methods, including non-PSRO methods such as population-based training and league training (e.g., AlphaStar), in terms of exploitability reduction and convergence speed?

Are there any plans to extend the proposed algorithms to multi-agent or cooperative settings? If so, what challenges do the authors foresee in adapting the algorithms to these settings, where exploitability is harder to compute but more general problems are commonly encountered?

### Summary
This paper considers the redesign of Policy-Space Response Oracles (PSRO) as an _anytime algorithm_---designed so that it can stop at any time and return the best result found so far, for two-player zero-sum games. The authors begin by extending the Double Oracle (DO), the precursor of PSRO, to the anytime setting. They accomplish this through their proposed algorithm Anytime Double Oracle (ADO) that considers differing restricted games per-player that leave the opponent always unrestricted. They show theoretically that ADO inherits the limit convergence properties of DO. This is followed by their introduction of Anytime PSRO (APSRO), an algorithm that "never increases exploitability by much" when compared to PSRO. APSRO works by continually computing the estimated solution using a regret minimization algorithm. Finally, they introduce Self-Player PSRO (SP-PSRO) that modifies APSRO to add the BR(BR) at each iteration instead of just a BR. SP-PSRO and APSRO are evaluated against PSRO on a suite of small two-player zero-sum games.

### Strengths
- The anytime property in game-solving algorithms is important as more heuristics for strategy exploration are being considered. This is particularly true because adding best responses at each iteration is a heuristic method, resulting in the increasing exploitability sometimes observed in PSRO. 
- Visualizations of didactic examples of the algorithm are very welcome and clear.
- Evaluated on a diversity of games --- albeit, all small games presumably to compute exact exploitability.

### Weaknesses
 - The premise of the paper, PSRO/DO can result in increases in exploitability between iterations, is not sufficiently justified or explained. Wouldn't a more straightforward approach to just be take the best-found-so-far solution across PSRO iterations? With this slight modification on the return statement, you obtain the desired anytime property.
- Another premise of the paper is that "PSRO and APSRO add pure-strategy (i.e. deterministic) best responses in each iteration." PSRO _does not_ have this requirement, and in fact, begins by adding a uniformly stochastic policy to the strategy set. As it is relatively common for implementations of PSRO to include only deterministic policies, I am fine with this being used as a premise, but I think this needs to be directly discussed in the text. This fact also has side-effect of suggesting an alternative simpler approach to APSRO/SP-PSRO in differing methods of computing stochastic policies.
- ADO is marginally novel compared to Range of Skill (RoS) and DO, and I think its limitations are not discussed well enough. To me, the main intuition behind DO/PSRO is when you cannot consider analytical solutions to game reasoning, and instead need to consider a restricted/empirical version of the game. ADO considers a partially restricted version of the game (only expanding a single players policy-space), and as a result is intractable and bears common complaints to direct game reasoning. The authors should discuss this and the complexity trade-offs more directly.
- The authors should address the focus on NE, when PSRO is flexible to any chosen solution concept. They should also state for all of their algorithms if they are constraining this aspect of PSRO.
- Very limited analysis of the design of APSRO/SP-PSRO. Consider including ablation-style experiments.
- Restricted games and empirical games are used interchangeably when they are not interchangeable objects.


- This is more minor, but I think is very important: the language and notation are more posed to a game theory audience than to the ML audience of ICLR. Following the notation and definitions in say the PSRO paper for example would make this paper significantly more approachable by this community. I personally find trouble whenever the RL definitions/notations are conflated with the notations used within the game-theoretic reasoning. For example, when you see \pi, is it a single policy, or a distribution over policies (i.e., solution)?

### Questions
- "In addition to introducing APSRO, we also build on APSRO by adding to the population in each iteration an approximation of the myopically optimal policy, that is, the stochastic policy that maximally lowers the exploitability of the least-exploitable distribution of the resulting population."
  - If I understand this claim correctly, this is not a new insight, and the work discussed in A.2 presented this idea?
- I would suggest the authors consider a different name than Self-Play PSRO. This makes me think of PSRO with the MSS set to Self-Play, and doesn't really hint at all as to the nature of the underlying algorithm. 
- Why bother forcing SP-PSRO to train off policy?
  - The focus of this work is on anytime stopping not on computational efficiency.
  - Have the authors tried using on-policy algorithms? This could result in further benefits. 
- "Moreover, adding mixed strategies can generally reduce exploitability faster than adding pure strategies."
	- Is another way to make this argument that adding mixed strategies enables us to add multiple pure-strategies per iteration; therefore, we can generally solve the game quicker---by the measure of number of iterations?
	- This seems to suggest a degenerate solution of just immediately solving the full game, which of course we can't generally do.
- "Why the episode is terminated, the time average of v is added to the population." Why is episode used here? Do you only train your policy for a singular episode?
- Limitations should discuss that while SP-PSRO uses same budget as APSRO, they're both way more expensive than PSRO.
- Limitations need to also discuss that this analysis is on NE, PSRO is more general


Exp 6.1
- You've had to add lambda to apply your algorithms to these games. What is the impact of lambda on the performances you've demonstrated?
- "As shown in Figure 4, unlike PSRO, APSRO tends not to increase exploitability" I don't think eyeballing Fig 4 or 5 really provides enough evidence to support this claim. 
	- PSRO only looks guilty of a large exploitability increase in Leduc Poker, and all other both algorithms are erratic.
- "Note that APSRO and SP-PSRO only reach an ϵ-NE because they use a finite number of regret minimization updates to determine the restricted distribution, while PSRO is able to exactly compute a NE."
	- I would have preferred the authors to have included an analysis of this.
	- A/SP-PSRO with exact equilibrium computation. 
	- PSRO with regret minimization for computing equilibrium.
	- Would help better understand where the benefits are coming from.

Exp 6.2
- "We hypothesize that this is due to the APSRO iterations not being long enough for the no-regret process to converge."
	- Thank you for including this point.
	- I was wondering if you had any insights into how we could know when we should apply APSRO based on this?
