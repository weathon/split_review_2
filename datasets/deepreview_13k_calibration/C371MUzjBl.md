## Abstract
Many works recently have focused on computing optimal solutions for the ex ante coordination of a team for solving sequential adversarial team games, where a team of players coordinate against an opponent (or a team of players) in a zero-sum extensive-form game. However, it is challenging to directly compute such an optimal solution because the team’s coordinated strategy space is exponential in the size of the game tree due to the asymmetric information of team members. Column Generation (CG) algorithms have been proposed to overcome this challenge by iteratively expanding the team’s coordinated strategy space via a Best Response Oracle (BRO). More recently, more compact representations (particularly, the Team Belief Directed Acyclic Graph (TB-DAG)) of the team’s coordinated strategy space have been proposed, but the TB-DAG-based algorithms only outperform the CG-based algorithms in games with a small TB-DAG. Unfortunately, it is inefficient to directly apply CG to the TB-DAG because the size of the TB-DAG is still exponential in the size of the game tree and then makes the BRO unscalable. To this end, we develop our novel TB-DAG CG (DCG) algorithm framework by computing a coordinated best response in the original game first and then transforming this strategy into the TB-DAG form. To further improve the scalability, we propose a more suitable BRO for DCG to reduce the cost of the transformation at each iteration. We theoretically show that our algorithm converges exponentially faster than the state-of-the-art CG algorithms, and experimental results show that our algorithm is at least two orders of magnitude faster than the state-of-the-art baselines and solves games that were previously unsolvable.

### Summary
This paper studies the problem of computing an equilibrium in team games in extensive form in which the team members can coordinate their strategies ex ante, before the beginning go the game. The paper introduces a new column generation approach working with the team-belief directed acyclic graph representation recently introduced by Zhang et al. (2022). The proposed method is experimentally evaluated and compared with state-of-the-art baselines in standard benchmark of games.

### Strengths
Providing better computational methods for computing equilibria in adversarial team games is of paramount importance in order to operationalize game-theoretic techniques in real-world settings beyond two-player zero-sum games.

The experimental evaluation provided in the paper is sufficiently broad.

### Weaknesses
I believe that the algorithm proposed in the paper is rather incremental over previous state-of-the-art techniques, for the following reasons:
1) The column generation algorithm doe not really add anything new compared to what done in classical column generation algorithms.
2) The only addition made by the proposed algorithm is related to the implementation of the best response oracle, and I believe this is not enough to constitute a contribution warrant publication in a top-tier AI conference as ICLR.

### Summary
The paper proposes a novel algorithm for computing a TMEcor in adversarial team games. The main idea is that of combining the two algorithms currently used in the literature, Column Generation and DAG/belief-based representation. The proposed algorithm employs column generation for equilibrium computation on a reduced version of the game, while adopting the faster equilibrium computation enabled by the DAG. The role of the best response routine is to progressively expands the DAG representation.

The paper shows that this procedure does not worsen the theoretical bounds of the previous algorithms, and thoroughly evaluates different variants of the main algorithm on a large suite of games.

### Strengths
* clear positioning of the paper wrt the literature
* strong empirical results
* Comprehensive evaluation set and analysis
* I also appreciated the structure of the paper, where detailed and satisfactory discussions are moved to the appendix and the paper focuses on the main

### Weaknesses
 * No clear winner between \emph{pure} or \emph{linrelax} versions of the algorithm
* the proopsed algorithm somewhat lack originality, in the sense that is an incremental improvement that recombines ideas already available in the literature. This lowers the contribution provided by the paper, even if my opinion is that this paper is interesting nonetheless.

### Questions
The paper was clear enough for me to understand the points
I suggest the following corrections/clarifications to improve the minor problems I found in specific points of the paper:
* in many occasions it is said that "by exploiting the team’s correlation property.. the BRO".. This property is not clear to me, and I thnk it should be better specified in the text
* the BRO algorithm presented in Section 3.3 is not completely novel. A similar algorithm was provided in "Subgame Solving in Adversarial Team Games" by Zhang et al., with the similar purpose of providing a more sparse BR (in that case sparsity is useful for reaching fewer private states in the same public state). My suggestion is to add a short reference to such a similar method.

### Summary
This paper adapts the TB-DAG representation of an adversarial team game for column generation techniques, outperforming state-of-the-art CG implementations in numerical experiments on large instances.

### Strengths
I reviewed a previous version of this paper.

The paper's exposition has improved substantially from this previous iteration. Notation has been standardized to match what is used in existing literature, and the flow of the paper has been vastly improved. Additionally, a discussion has been added regarding the transformation cost of DCG based on using the BRO that has been proposed, which makes clear that the transformation cost is not overly expensive. 

The paper provides a solid technical contribution in providing a novel CG framework for TMECor computation. Extensive experiments are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of this framework and how it compares to SOTA approaches for TMECor computation. The authors sufficiently discuss the novelty of their approach in the main body of the paper as well as in Appendix A. It is clear that their approach outperforms existing approaches in certain settings, and thus is a valuable contribution.

### Weaknesses
Prior weaknesses that I (and other reviewers) had mentioned in an earlier review have been adequately addressed. In the past, some reviewers have mentioned concerns about the novelty of the approach; I think this has also been sufficiently addressed (see discussion in Strengths).

### Summary
The authors propose a column generation/double oracle-based framework for adversarial team games, in which the meta-Nash equilibrium is computed by allowing any (joint) action proposed by any of the strategies in the support through the TB-DAG framework, and the best responses are computed through an integer program. Via extensive experiments, the authors demonstrate that their method is more scalable than past techniques.

### Strengths
The techniques proposed by the paper are at least somewhat novel. The authors do a reasonable job of positioning the paper within prior work, addressing what aspects of their proposed techniques are new and performing ablation tests in the experiments. The experiments show that the method scales better than past methods, which is important for practical applications of TMECor.

### Weaknesses
As mentioned by the authors, the basic idea of using the sequence form to speed up column generation/double oracle for extensive-form games was proposed by Bosansky et al (2014). I do appreciate the authors' frank discussion of this comparison (Appendix A), but I think this should be reflected in the framing of the paper (e.g., perhaps Bosansky et al.'s method should be introduced in the body, and then the proposed DCG method should be framed as the natural analogue of that method for adversarial team games). I think the current framing of DCG makes it seem like it is more complex of a method than it really is. Phrased another way, in some sense I think Appendix A is the most important part of this paper from a conceptual standpoint, and it should be as much as possible moved into the body/discussed earlier, maybe even in the introduction. (if space is needed, for example, I'd suggest moving some of the ablation experiments, or the discussion of the BRO to the appendix; these matters are in my opinion less important than correct positioning of the work within past literature).

For the BRO, there should be some discussion of the total size of the representation (number of nonzeros in constraint matrix), as a function of e.g. the number of sequences, number of players, game size, etc. It seems to me that this size can be exponential in |H| in the worst case (when the number of players is large), which is somewhat troubling especially compared to past BROs which, as you say in Appendix A, do not have this problem. (For example, consider a polymatrix game with $N$ players and $A$ actions per player converted in the natural manner to extensive form---such a game would have $|H| = O((NA)^2)$ but every tuple of sequences will be relevant, so the  BRO will have representation size something like $A^N$).

On a more minor note, I would also like to see experiments on team-vs-team games, in which both teams would have to apply this column-generation method. In that setting, my guess would be the advantage over the baseline DAG algorithm will be less, because of the added inefficiency of having to perform CG for both sides---but I would still expect the method to perform very well.

### Questions
1. (from above) How does the proposed technique (or, the natural generalization thereof) perform in the setting of team-vs-team games?
1. Why does DCG_pure perform differently from DCG_linrelax^pure? Wouldn't an integer program solver first attempt to solve the linear relaxation anyway? (so they should do the same thing?)
