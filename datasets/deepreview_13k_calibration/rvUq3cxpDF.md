## Abstract
Pre-training large models on vast amounts of web data has proven to be an effective approach for obtaining powerful, general models in domains such as language and vision. However, this paradigm has not yet taken hold in reinforcement learning. This is because videos, the most abundant form of embodied behavioral data on the web, lack the action labels required by existing methods for imitating behavior from demonstrations. We introduce \textbf{\mbox{\methodfull{}}}~(\method{}), a method for recovering latent action information---and thereby latent-action policies, world models, and inverse dynamics models---purely from videos. \method{} is the first method able to recover the structure of the true action space just from observed dynamics, even in challenging procedurally-generated environments. \method{} enables training latent-action policies that can be rapidly fine-tuned into expert-level policies, either offline using a small action-labeled dataset, or online with rewards. \method{} takes a first step towards pre-training powerful, generalist policies and world models on the vast amounts of videos readily available on the web.

### Summary
The paper proposes an approach (LAPO) to learn latent-action policies from action-free demonstrations. The approach involves training a inverse dynamics model (IDM) along with a Forward Dynamics Model (FDM) using an unsupervised objective. The IDM learns to predict the latent action given the past and future observation. FDM on the other hand uses the predicted latent action, and past action to predict the future observation. Training these two models together for predictive consistency helps learn latent actions that can reliably explain observed transitions. To prevent the model from compressing all of past observation’s information into the latent action, the authors propose using vector quantization which acts as an information bottleneck. Finally, the authors show that latent actions can be mapped to real actions using online RL policy fine-tuning, or by using an offline dataset of action-labeled transitions. The authors show results on the Procgen benchmark. They show that the approach exceeds expert demonstrations by fine-tuning a policy pretrained with LAPO using significantly fewer number of steps. The authors also show through many visualisations that the structure of the latent space is highly interpretable

### Strengths
1. Learning policies from unlabeled (lacking action annotations) demonstrations is an important problem because it allows to leverage large collection of videos available on the web. The proposed approach shows how we can leverage this data to train policies in an unsupervised way, even when no labeled demonstrations are available. 
2. I really appreciate the UMAP projection visualisations in the paper! The visualisations clearly demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach to learn disentangled latent space for actions, that can be meaningfully mapped to real actions corresponding to the transitions. Comparing Figure 5 and Figure 7, also clearly demonstrate the usefulness of Vector Quantization in their method. 
3. The paper is well-written! I specially appreciate a well-written related works section that did a great job putting the paper in context with other related works!

### Weaknesses
### Weaknesses

1. The experiments assume that the underlying action space in the videos used for pre-training is the same as the action space of the agent. In other words, the videos used during pre-training are of the same agent. I think this assumption is limiting. To leverage large-scale video data available on the internet, one of the key ingredients is learning from videos that doesn’t necessarily match the action space of the agent. Imagine learning from Ego4D like ego-centric observations, and using it to execute tabletop rearrangement tasks. Or using RealEstate10K videos to learn how to navigate in indoor environments. 
2. Secondly, it would have also been nice to consider experiments on continuous control tasks. The approach uses a vector quantised latent space to model actions. Will such an approach also work for actions that are continuous control? 
3. Finally, the paper doesn’t fully justify using vector quanitization approach to learn disentagled latent actions. While the empirical results do show the efficacy of this approach, I don’t fully grasp why vector quantization based information bottleneck works. Additionally, did the author consider an approach like maximizing the conditional mutual information I(o_t+1 | a_t) while minimizing  I(o_t+1 | o_t)  (as in  Deep Variational Information Bottleneck, Alemi et al, 2016) to learn a latent action space that is consistent with the transition observed without over-relying on the past observations

### Confidence
3: You are fairly confident in your assessment. It is possible that you did not understand some parts of the submission or that you are unfamiliar with some pieces of related work. Math/other details were not carefully checked.

### Summary
In this paper, the authors focus on the problem of inferring and leveraging latent actions to train RL models from unlabeled demonstrations. To this end, they propose Latent Action Policies from Observation, where an Inverse Dynamics Model infers an aggressively bottlenecked latent from two observations adjacent in time. These latent actions can then be used to train a behavioral cloning model. They evaluate their approach on the Procgen dataset, show large performance margins over baselines, and analyse the learned action space visually through UMAP projection.

### Strengths
1. Unsupervised learning has been successfully applied to domains such as language understanding and computer vision, but this is still a frontier problem in the reinforcment learning community. This paper is a promising step in that direction.

2. The approach is simple and makes intuitive sense. A latent action could well be considered the "difference" between two observations.

3. Experimental results are strong, and the analysis of learned latent space is insightful.

### Weaknesses
1. The approach is only evaluated in one environment, Procgen. It is unclear if this approach will generalize across different domains (i.e. continuous control/Robotics). Additional experiments in other environments could strengthen the case of the paper.


### Questions
1. Do the results of LAPO generalize to other environments, especially in continuous control settings? (such as MoJoCo, DMControl, Meta-World, etc.)

### Summary
In this paper, authors present a method to learn from pure observation-only data (e.g., videos demonstrating a control task without explicit action labels). The proposed algorithm LAPO aims to infer actions taking place between two consecutive observations of such data. LAPO models latent representations for the actions instead of trying to infer the true ground-truth action. It does so using two components -- inverse dynamics model (IDM) and forward dynamics model (FDM). The IDM's task is to generate a latent representation of the action that takes place between a given history of observations (including current observation) and the next observation. Consequently, the FDM's task is to generate the next observation given the current observation and a latent representation generated by IDM. Both these components are trained in conjugation to learn latent representations of unknown actions. These representations are further finetuned using true actions via either online rollout or matching actions in an offline dataset. The paper presents results on 16 discrete-action ProcGen environments.

### Strengths
I find the following strengths of the paper:

The paper does a superb job in terms of the writing and the clarity of the presentation. The algorithm design seems logical from the description. The UMAP plots on 16 different environments are very well-organized and exciting to go through. They convincingly substantiate the algorithm's usefulness in inferring unknown actions.

The problem statement of the work, inferring actions from observation-only data, is quite relevant for current RL research where there is a need to learn control aspects from unlabelled video demonstrations.

### Weaknesses
I find the following weaknesses in the paper:
1. The utility of learned latent representations for large-scale pretraining: It is evident from the plots that the actions are meaningfully clustered. However, if one has enough compute, to me, it seems plausible to train a transformer autoregressively to generate the next observations in observation-only data, ensuring that the latent representation for actions is also learned. I raise this point because if such a pretraining is possible directly with transformers, the utility of LAPO reduces. Plus, if someone wants to apply the LAPO (IDM + FDM) approach, it could be inflexible compared to a transformer extension. Anyway, I do acknowledge that LAPO does provide evidence that it is possible to meaningfully identify actions in observation-only data.

2. Issue with NOOP: From the IDM-FDM perspective, the NOOP being a null action, its latent representation should produce no transition when sent to FDM. It was unclear from the writing if there is any experimental validation of the same. Also, there is an issue with NOOP and actions with delayed effects. The present IDM-FDM model will fall short in modeling the two separately. (Authors briefly touch up on modeling the delayed effect actions, but I did not find their mention contrasting them with NOOP's.)

3. LAPO with continuous action environments: The current implementation of LAPO involves using vector quantization (VQ). However, using VQ would, in principle, limit the actions to be chosen from a finite set of discrete codes. This, in turn, creates issues while scaling to continuous action environments. The ProcGen games, environments used in the experiments, are discrete action environments, too, and I find it difficult to see how the approach would scale to non-discrete real-world control tasks.

### Questions
In the context of the aforementioned weaknesses, I have the following questions:

1. How can we advantageously use the LAPO latent representations for large-scale pretraining on unlabelled videos of control tasks?
2. Do authors observe that NOOP IDM representation does not affect FDM's transition? 
3. Do NOOP IDM representations get clustered similarly to other actions? 
4. How does NOOP compare with actions with delayed effects?
5. How will VQ-based LAPO fare in continuous action environments? 
6. What are the possible extensions to the current architecture that will allow us to use LAPO seamlessly on real-world continuous action control tasks?

Given these questions, I am presently inclined to borderline reject the work. But with clarifications provided, I would definitely like to increase the score.

### Summary
This paper proposes a novel method to pretrain for RL with only observation sequences without action labels. It first infers latent actions, then learns a policy by behavior cloning on the inferred latent actions, and subsequently refining the policy via RL. What sets this research apart from previous studies is its unique strategy in latent action inference, which features a VQ latent action space and a combined optimization target for IDM and FDM.  Experiments on Procgen demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

### Strengths
This paper is well written. Motivation, methodology, and experiments are presented clearly. The idea of optimizing forward modelling objectives using a constrained action latent space is coherent and logical. The provided UMAP projections greatly support the effectiveness of the proposed method.

### Weaknesses
1. Toy experimental setup: The paper motivates from learning (pretraining) with large scale web data. However, during experiments, the author uses the data from a simulator (Procgen). The pretrain data contains less visual complexity compared to real world data. I encourage author to explore pretraining with real world data (like MC YouTube videos and first-view driving videos). Or, the authors should at least make the pretraining data different from the RL observation data to simulate the difference between pretrain and finetune scenario. One way could be using different backgrounds in Procgen.
2. In my opinoin, this paper could benefit from including references to a relevant work which uses IDM to label the dataset and conduct contrastive learning for policy pretraining.
3. I think this paper could benefit from additional comparison with  and . It could provide additional insight of how methods that use extra data for IDM training perform compared to the proposed method. I am particularly interested in understanding whether training IDM  yields performance improvements or if the proposed method (without IDM) is already capable of achieving comparable, or even superior, results to the aforementioned prior works.

### Questions
1. Do you think this method can generalize to domains with continuous action space?
2. Does the number of discrete tokens in VQ matter? I would appreciate a ablation on this.
