## Abstract
Inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) offers a powerful and general framework for learning humans' latent preferences in route recommendation, yet no approach has successfully addressed planetary-scale problems with hundreds of millions of states and demonstration trajectories. In this paper, we introduce scaling techniques based on graph compression, spatial parallelization, and improved initialization conditions inspired by a connection to eigenvector algorithms. We revisit classic IRL methods in the routing context, and make the key observation that there exists a trade-off between the use of cheap, deterministic planners and expensive yet robust stochastic policies. This insight is leveraged in Receding Horizon Inverse Planning (\textsc{rhip}), a new generalization of classic IRL algorithms that provides fine-grained control over performance trade-offs via its planning horizon. Our contributions culminate in a policy that achieves a 16-24\% improvement in route quality at a global scale, and to the best of our knowledge, represents the largest published study of IRL algorithms in a real-world setting to date. We conclude by conducting an ablation study of key components, presenting negative results from alternative eigenvalue solvers, and identifying opportunities to further improve scalability via IRL-specific batching strategies.

### Summary
This paper considers the important problem of Inverse Reinforcement Learning for route optimization and planning, and specifically the practical limitations of existing methods when scaled to larger problems. The authors draw a unified theoretical perspective around Max Margin planning (Ratliff et al. 2006), the classic MaxEnt framework (Ziebart et al. 2008), and Bayesian IRL (Ramachandran and Amir 2007) which is helpful and insightful. Connections with graph theory methods lead to a novel IRL initialization and algorithm (MaxEnt++ and Receding Horizon Inverse Planning) which demonstrates significant improvements over other methods for large-scale problems. Several other graph optimization methods are presented which further allow scaling to global-scale routing problems.

The paper is well written, clear to read (despite covering a lot of theory and background), and the experimental evaluations are thorough and provide support for the claims.

I have a background in Inverse Reinforcement Learning theory, however have focused in other areas of computer science more recently, so may be out-of-touch with some recent literature results when performing this review. I have read the paper and appendices closely, however did not check the proofs carefully.

### Strengths
* A compelling problem
 * Real-world empirical experimental problem considered
 * The paper does a good job straddling both novel theory advancements, and practical and engineering advancements, but presents the findings appropriately for the ICLR audience.
 * The connections with graph theoretic results (App. A1, A2, and Theorem B3) are useful and insightful.
 * The paper and appendices include negative results, in addition to the main results - this is encouraging to see (more papers should do this).
 * [Note to ACs and other reviewers]: Although the proposed method is framed for discrete MDP-based route optimization, note that there are several ways to generalize this framework to other interesting problem settings quite trivially, (see e.g. [A]) - as such, the findings here are actually quite broadly applicable, as noted by the authors in Sec 6.

### Weaknesses
 * The literature review is compact and the theory background provides a rapid but very nice summary of classical IRL results (in particular the unifying view of stochastic vs. deterministic policy trade-offs is helpful). One relevant piece of prior work that isn't mentioned however is the improved MaxEnt approach(es) by Snoswell et al. (e.g. [B, C]) - which address theoretical and empirical limitations with Ziebart's MaxEnt model, and are specifically applied to the problem of route optimization (albeit at city scale, not a global scale).

 * Unclear notation - Paragraph 'Parallelism strategies' under Sec 4 defines the global reward based on the sharded MDP as $r(s,a) = r_{\theta_i}(s,a),(s,a) \in \mathcal{M}_i$. This notation isn't clear to me - is there a typo here? Is this mean to be a product over the sharded individual reward functions?

 * Typo in footnote 1 - 'rouute'

### Summary
This paper mainly focuses on scaling inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) for route optimization by learning the reward function from expert demonstrations. The application scenario is a popular route recommendation platform that should be able to generalize globally. Given a dataset of expert trajectories, in this approach, a reward function is learned from these demonstrations and this reward then guides an action selection policy from the start state to the destination. 

Building on prior work in IRL, particularly MaxEnt IRL, the authors propose an initialization strategy that leads to faster convergence, called MaxEnt++. Next, they generalize these and other IRL algorithms in their proposed framework called RHIP (Receding Horizon Inverse Planning) that trades-off using an expensive stochastic policy upto a horizon H with a cheap deterministic planner afterwards. Additionally, a number of parallelized computation and graph compression techniques are implemented to further improve the scalability of their algorithm for the application setting. Experiments on held-out validation trajectories show the superior performance of their method compared to prior work in IRL for quality route recommendations.

### Strengths
1. The authors address a well-motivated and useful application to show the statistically significant gains obtained from scalable IRL in route recommendation. The techniques that worked for this task have been clearly explained, along with explanations and evidence for some techniques that didn't work. 

2. The proposed method unifies several prior IRL algorithms through the RHIP framework for trading-off quality of route recommendation with convergence speed. This helps improve understanding of the similarities and differences in these approaches.   

3. Several ablation studies have been performed for different graph compression techniques and reward modeling approaches that help establish the significance of the experimental results.

### Weaknesses
1. The experimental results are not from real-time execution of the proposed method and utilizes static features of the road network for route optimization. Incorporating dynamic features, for example varying traffic flow throughout a day, planned or unplanned diversions and road closures etc. would increase the difficulty of obtaining a scalable DP approach. The current approach does not address the temporal aspect of route planning, which is a significant limitation for real-world deployment. Specifically, the MDP formulation appears to assume a time-invariant environment, which is a strong assumption given the dynamic nature of traffic networks. This limits the applicability of the proposed method to scenarios where the environment is relatively stable and predictable.

2. The reward function is learning a scalar value, whereas in the real world for applications like route optimization, it should intuitively be a multi-objective optimization problem. It is not immediately clear whether such possibilities would fit into the proposed algorithmic framework. The paper does not explore the possibility of incorporating multiple objectives, such as minimizing travel time, distance, and fuel consumption, which are often conflicting. A scalar reward function may not be sufficient to capture the complexity of real-world route optimization problems, and the proposed framework needs to be extended to handle multi-objective optimization.

### Questions
1. The paper does not provide much details about the road graph. Would the authors be able to provide any intuition about the relation between the coarseness of the road network graph and the choice of H? 

2. Fig 4 and 12 highlight an interesting outcome of the sparse reward modeling approach in correcting data quality errors. Is this a consistent observation across different geographical regions? Or is there any noticeable difference in the road graph network when this method of reward modeling demonstrates a particular benefit over others? 

3. It is not quite clear what Fig. 7 is meant to convey. Could the authors explain more?

### Summary
The paper proposes MaxEnt++, an adaptation of the classical MaxEnt algorithm, to handle very large route instances with hundreds of millions of states and demonstration trajectories. Their techniques include MaxEnt++, a MaxEnt algorithm with a DIJKSTRA component, a new policy formulation that the authors call Receding Horizon Inverse Planning (RHIP), and a graph compression technique to reduce memory usage. The algorithm was then tested with a routing dataset of 200M states, showing some improvements compared to the standard MaxEnt and other baselines.

### Strengths
The paper addresses an interesting problem. Learning with very large-scale routing datasets would have significant applications in modern transportation systems. The techniques used in the paper (except for MaxEnt, as I will discuss in the Weaknesses) are sound and relevant. The algorithm seems to work well (but again, the experiments lack comparisons with more scalable IRL algorithms, as I will discuss later).

### Weaknesses
My biggest concern is that the paper primarily revolves around MaxEnt, which was developed about 15 years ago and is now very outdated. In the introduction, the authors state that MaxEnt is limited in its scalability, which is true. Recent literature on IRL has introduced many advanced algorithms to address this issue. For instance, Adversarial IRL [1] and IQ-Learn [2], value DICE [3] are well-known recent IRL algorithms that are much more scalable. Therefore, it is crucial to focus on these algorithms instead of the outdated MaxEnt.

I notice that the related work section exclusively references older papers and appears to be outdated. It would be beneficial for the authors to give greater consideration to more recent developments in the field of IRL/imitation learning.

This should be noted that the routing task is deterministic, so both online and offline IRL/imitation learning algorithm can be applied. The authors should look at relevant works and make a complete comparison.

### Questions
I do not have many questions about the current work, as the current contributions are not convincing, and the paper clearly needs much more work to reach a publishable level.

### Summary
This paper addresses the problem of route optimization. Given a set of demonstrations of chosen navigation routes that optimize a set of unknown preferences (e.g., concerning distance, traffic, pollution), the goal is to learn a model such that suitable routes can be suggested for (possibly unseen) route-destination pairs. The authors address this problem with inverse reinforcement learning, in which the goal is to learn the reward function underlying these preferences. Equipped with the reward function, routes can be suggested e.g. via finding the highest cumulative reward path between the source and destination.

The authors present a set of improvements over standard IRL algorithms, concerning an improved initialization of the MaxEnt algorithm,  learning separate reward functions per geographical region, and trading off between expensive stochastic rollouts and cheaper deterministic planners. The method is evaluated on a global dataset of routes in several cities, showing that the method compares favorably with other IRL algorithms.

## Post-response update
I am updating the score to 6 as a result of the discussion. I think the benefits of publishing the findings of this work outweigh the shortcomings.

### Strengths
**S1**. The work successfully scales IRL to a large, real-world setting, indeed representing (to the best of my knowledge) the largest-scale evaluation of IRL.

**S2**. Furthermore, it provides an interesting perspective on the inherent challenges of global route optimization, for example regarding the "locality" of the learned policies, suggesting individuals navigate differently in different cities. This may have wider implications in other domains e.g. transportation science, neuroscience.

### Weaknesses
 **W1**. Methodological contributions: with the exception of the MaxEnt initialization findings, I am unsure of the value of the methodological developments. The geographical split into multiple experts and the graph compression are, in my opinion, both straightforward. I think simplicity is desirable, but the contribution is oversold. 

**W2**. Generalizability and reproducibility: given the repeated nods to engineering and deployment constraints, how generalizable and reproducible are the results? How many organizations face global scale routing optimization? While the achieved improvements are definitely impressive in terms of e.g. customer satisfaction, the contribution to the scientific community is not clear-cut, especially given that code and data (I assume) will not be released. Reproducibility and code / data availability are not even mentioned in passing.

### Questions
Please see W1/W2 above. In terms of additional comments:

**C1**. The style of Figure 1 and Figure 2 is by now instantly recognizable and, in my opinion, represents a breach of anonymity.

**C2**. The wording "largest published benchmark of IRL algorithms [...]" (abstract, p.2, p.9) is misleading. I assume that the authors do not intend to publish the actual benchmark (e.g., data and evaluation metrics), but solely the results of this evaluation. This should be revised.

**C3**. Typos: "rouute" (Footnote 1)
