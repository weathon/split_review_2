## Abstract
Hypergraphs, which incorporate hyperedges to link multiple nodes and capture complex high-order relationships, have attracted increasing attention in recent years.
Consequently, a bunch of hypergraph neural networks has been proposed to model the high-order relationships between hyperedges and nodes. Inspired by the success of graph contrastive learning, researchers have begun exploring the benefits of contrastive learning over hypergraphs. However, these works still have the following limitations in modeling the high-order relationships over unlabeled data: (i) They primarily focus on maximizing the agreements among individual node embeddings while neglecting the capture of group-wise collective behaviors within hypergraphs; (ii) Most of them disregard the importance of the temperature index in discriminating contrastive pairs during contrast optimization. To address these limitations, we propose a novel \textbf{Ad}aptive \textbf{T}emperature enhanced \textbf{Hy}per\textbf{G}raph \textbf{C}ontrastive \textbf{L}earning framework called \textbf{AdT-HyGCL} to boost contrastive learning over hypergraphs. Specifically, we first introduce a noise enhancement module to generate relatively challenging augmented hypergraphs for hypergraph contrastive tasks. Unlike most works that merely maximize the agreement of node embeddings in hypergraphs, we then propose a dual-level contrast mechanism that not only captures the individual node behaviors in a local context but also models the group-wise collective behaviors of nodes within hyperedges from a community perspective. Furthermore, we design an adaptive temperature-enhanced contrastive optimization to improve the discrimination ability between positive and negative contrastive pairs, thereby facilitating more effective hypergraph representation learning. Theoretical justifications and empirical experiments conducted on eight benchmark hypergraphs demonstrate that AdT-HyGCL exhibits excellent rationality, generalization, effectiveness, and robustness compared to state-of-the-art baseline models.

### Summary
This paper introduces a dual-level hypergraph contrastive learning framework, AdT-HyGCL. It incorporates a dual-level contrast mechanism (the node level and community level) and an adaptive temperature-enhanced approach to improve the effectiveness of contrastive learning over hypergraphs. The research addresses certain limitations observed in existing works focusing on modeling high-order relationships over unlabeled data. Extensive experiments show the effectiveness of the proposed AdT-HyGCL.

### Strengths
The novelty of this paper lies in its endeavor to overcome the constraints encountered in prior research pertaining to the modeling of high-order relationships within unlabeled data. It shifts its emphasis towards the intricate realm of group-wise collective behaviors within hypergraphs. Additionally, it introduces an innovative adaptive temperature coefficient designed to autonomously fine-tune the representation distances. As for clarity, I think this paper is written in a lucid and comprehensible manner, ensuring ease of understanding for its readers. Theoretical justifications meet the requirements, and empirical experiments are abundant.  The authors demonstrated through a substantial number of experiments that the method exhibits advantages in terms of generality, effectiveness, and robustness. This method has achieved SOTA performance in hypergraph contrastive learning, which I believe holds implications.

### Weaknesses
The methodology section of this paper appears to be somewhat limited, particularly in section 4.2.2, which lacks a comprehensive theoretical explanation of 'COMMUNITY-LEVEL HYPERGRAPH CONTRASTIVE LEARNING'. Additionally, it may be beneficial to provide an exposition on how these two branches are integrated to obtain the final representations.

### Questions
1. I have some difficulty in comprehending how the adaptive temperature parameter is implemented. Could you provide more formulaic evidence or details of its code implementation?
2. Why were UniGCNII and AllDeepSets chosen for the robustness experiments instead of a seemingly more effective method like CHGNN? Can you provide the robustness experiment results for CHGNN?
3. I am curious about how the final representations obtained from the "node-level" and "community-level" branches in the paper are combined. On a theoretical level, how is the balance between the results obtained from these two branches achieved?

### Summary
This paper focused on hypergraph contrastive learning. Previous papers only deal with the node level information instead of the group (community) information. The paper also applied adaptive temperature technique when discriminating contrastive pairs. This allows the model to adaptively optimize the positive and negative pairs. 

The authors first introduced a noise enhanced hypergraph augmentation, which includes 5 different ways. Then a two stage contrastive learning is proposed. It includes the node-level and community-level.

The experiments show that the paper outperforms other hypergraph models and hypergraph contrastive learning models in accuracy, macro-F1, robustness. The ablation study shows that different hypergraph augmentation methods can help increase the performance. Among all augmentation methods, hyperedge removing is the most important one. The temperature analysis indicates that the adaptive temperature is helpful.

### Strengths
This paper propose a contrastive learning method for hypergraph, and outperforms the baselines including both hypergraph algorithms and hypergraph contrastive learning algorithms. The paper is well written and easy to follow. The proposed algorithm is simple yet effective. The ablation study shows which augmentation algorithm is helpful. It turns out hyperedge removing is the most helpful augmentation, which is intuitive.

### Weaknesses
Typo:, in Figure 1, Dual-Leve -> Dual-Level Hypergraph Contrastive Learning.

For the citeseer's Macro F1, it seems CHGNN performs slightly better.

And some common datasets like DBLP and Pubmed seems missing in the paper. 

For House and walmart, most baseline models performs poorly, probably due to the heterophily intrinsic.

Only one data augmentation method is new, which is HyedgeR. I'm a little concern about the novelty since it's intuitive.

### Questions
Overall, the performance greatly outperform the hypergraph models, while slightly outperform the contrastive learning models. So this work seems focus on contrastive learning instead of hypergraph models. However, i'm not sure whether this is novel in contrastive learning. More details regarding to this in the related work may be appreciated.

Meanwhile, the $\tau_{low}$ is a hyperparameter. Without the $\tau_{low}$ the model will have a significant performance decrease. I'm curious how to determine the $\tau_{low}$. Is there any method? Or it is decided based on empirical result.

### Summary
This paper proposes an adaptive temperature-enhanced hypergraph learning framework, AdT-HyGCL, for self-supervised hypergraph learning, which integrates the dual-level contrast strategy and the adaptive temperature-enhanced contrast optimization to improve hypergraph contrastive learning. Theoretical justifications and empirical experiments justify the effectiveness of AdT-HyGCL.

### Strengths
1. This paper studies an important problem of self-supervised hypergraph learning.
2. The paper is well-organized and clearly written.

### Weaknesses
1. The novelty of the proposed framework in this paper is incremental. Both multi-level contrast and adaptive temperature are not novel ideas. The former has been explored in many previous works [1-3], while the latter has been studied in [4]. The authors didn't cite these works, which should be referred to, discussed, and compared.
2. The performance improvement seems limited in Table 1. 
3. Table 2 misses several competing baselines in Table 1, like CHGNN.

### Summary
An adaptive temperature-enhanced dual-level hypergraph contrastive learning model (called AdT-HyGCL) is introduced to enhance hypergraph contrastive learning. AdT-HyGCL designs a dual-level contrast mechanism to capture both individual behaviors and group-wise behaviors. Also, it introduces adaptive temperature-enhanced contrast optimization to improve discrimination ability between contrastive pairs. The experimental results on several hypergraph datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of AdT-HyGCL.

### Strengths
1. This paper designs a hypergraph contrastive learning framework that integrates the dual-level contrast strategy and the adaptive temperature-enhanced contrast optimization to pre-train the HyGNNs encoder. 
     
2. AdT-HyGCL uses several hypergraph augmentations and contrast optimizations to improve the hypergraph representation learning. The experimental results on several hypergraph datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of AdT-HyGCL.

3. The paper is well organized.

### Weaknesses
1. The motivation of this work is not good enough.
For example, the authors claim that "they (graphs) have limitations in captureing ... higher-order group-wise structures.'' What is the meaning of high-order group-wise structures in this paper? Why is the statement correct? Considering the higher-order structures (such as communities) are widely studied in the field of graph data analysis, it is better to showcase the viewpoints carefully.
Furthermore, the authors claim that "current contrastive learning methods over hypergraphs still have limitations in modeling the high-order relationships ... within hypergraphs ...". Then, maybe hyper-hypergraphs, if any, cannot capture the high-order relationshi within hyper-hypergraphs. Is it really interesting? Should we propose another "dual-level contrast mechanism" for the hyper-hypergraphs?
   
    
2. The novelty of this study is not clear. 

(1) The novelty of the concept of `noise-enhanced' should be clearly presented. The stategy of performing noises to node attribute features has been well utilized in the literature, such as [1]. The authors should carefully discussed them in the manuscript, especially when [1] has been cited as [Zhu, et al. 2021b] in the paper. 

(2) The idea of using community structures in constrastive learning has been proposed in the literature, such as [2]. The authors should clearly present this point. In addition, it seems that the ``community'' in this study does not match the well-known community in the literature. Then, it is better to use another phrase in this work to aoivd the ambiguiity. 

(3) The idea of the adaptive temperature-enhanced contrast optimization in pre-tained models (including GNNs) has been proposed in the literature, such as [3-6]. The authors should clearly discuss the differences between this work and the literature.

3. The methods of the paper should be carefully presented.
Considering the adaptive temperature-enhanced contrast optimization in pre-tained models (including GNNs) has been proposed in the literature, such as [3-6], the authors should clearly present the relationship between the propostions as well as their proofs and the literature. In addition, the proofs of these propositions should be carefully presented rather than giving one or more examples. For instance, it is stated that ``the temperature descents'' in the paper. Why must the temperature descent during the training process for any loss? The authors should prove it seriously. 

4. The experiments of the paper should be improved.
As shown in Table 1 and Table 2, the experimental results of the proposed AdT-HyGCL are not always the best. Maybe the authors should analyze and present the reasons. Also, the parameter sensitivity experiments should be provided, such as $\tau_{low}$, $\eta$, $\rho$, $\lambda_1$ and $\lambda_2$. In addition, more recent studies on hypergraph contrastive
learning shoud be considered as baselines, such as [7][8].

### Summary
In this paper, the authors design AdT-HyGCL, an adaptive temperature-enhanced dual-level hypergraph contrastive learning model. It overcomes the limitations of existing hypergraph contrastive learning by capturing both individual and group-wise behaviors. The adaptive temperature-enhanced contrast optimization improves discrimination, enhancing hypergraph representation learning. Theoretical justifications and empirical experiments on eight benchmark hypergraphs demonstrate AdT-HyGCL's effectiveness and robustness.

### Strengths
S1: The studied issue of hypergraph contrastive learning is important.

S2: The baseline methods selected for this study are well-suited for comparison and evaluation.

### Weaknesses
W1: The presentation of the paper requires to be improved heavily. Some examples are as follows:

(i) In the listed contributions, the statements of "Novelty", "Generalization", and "Effectiveness and Robustness" are improper. The authors should state the specific contributions of this work here, e.g., "Novelty"->"A novel adaptive temperature enhanced
hypergraph contrastive learning framework".

(ii) In Preliminaries, the statement "The main idea of graph contrastive learning aims to maximize the agreements among positive and negative contrastive pairs over" is not clear. Using a more clear statement "The main idea of graph contrastive learning aims to maximize the similarity between positive pairs and meanwhile minimize the similarity between negative pairs" is better. Also, in Equation (2), sim($\cdot$) is not given a definition or explanation.

(iii) In Methodology, the graph augmentation process itself adds noise to the original graph, so the module with the name "noise-enhanced hypergraph augmentation" is strange. It may be better if the authors replace "noise-enhanced" with "feature distortion based".  The symbols of $x_{i}$ and $\delta_{i}$ should be bolded as they represent vectors, not values. The definition of the concatenation operator is ambiguous: sometimes they are denoted as $[\cdot:\cdot]$ and sometimes they are denoted as $\oplus$. In Equation (5), $\eta$ has unclear statements and it represents the learning rate of the temperature adjustment.

(iv) Many contents in the main body are not self-contained, e.g., Table 3 should be moved into the main body.


W2: Lacking necessary analysis of the important loss function. The authors do not analyze the JSD loss in the paper, but why they can conclude that  AdT-HyGCL is suitable for JSD loss (note that JSD loss is totally different from NT-Xent loss)?

W3: The presented experimental results have lots of errors. Some examples are as follows:

(i) In Table 1, for Macro-F1 results, the best result should be "64.98 ± 1.77" and the runner-up should be "64.65 ± 0.85" on Citeseer.

(ii) In Table 2, the best result should be "59.65 ± 1.62" on House (Nettack).

These errors make the whole experimental analysis not convincing.

W4: Lacking some important baseline comparison. The paper does not compare AdT-HyGCL with other temperature adjustment methods (e.g., the methods in [1], [2], and [3]), which limits the ability to assess the effectiveness of AdT-HyGCL relative to other methods.
