## Abstract
The unprecedented performance of large language models (LLMs) necessitates improvements in evaluations. Rather than merely exploring the breadth of LLM abilities, we believe meticulous and thoughtful designs are essential to thorough, unbiased, and applicable evaluations.
Given the importance of world knowledge to LLMs, we construct a Knowledge-oriented LLM Assessment benchmark (KoLA), in which we carefully design three crucial factors: (1) For \textbf{ability modeling}, we mimic human cognition to form a four-level taxonomy of knowledge-related abilities, covering $19$ tasks. (2) For \textbf{data}, to ensure fair comparisons, we use both Wikipedia, a corpus prevalently pre-trained by LLMs, along with continuously collected emerging corpora, aiming to evaluate the capacity to handle unseen data and evolving knowledge. (3) For \textbf{evaluation criteria}, we adopt a contrastive system, including overall standard scores for better numerical comparability across tasks and models and a unique self-contrast metric for automatically evaluating knowledge-creating ability. We evaluate $28$ open-source and commercial LLMs and obtain some intriguing findings. The KoLA dataset will be updated every three months to provide timely references for developing LLMs and knowledge systems.

### Summary
The paper presents KoLA, an interesting Knowledge-oriented LLM Assessment benchmark. It assesses LLMs on four-level knowledge-related abilities: knowledge memorization, knowledge understanding, knowledge applying and knowledge creating, with known and evolving data sources.

The authors plan to make available their data, leaderboard, participation information, and supporting tools upon acceptance. They plan to host  a new competition season every three months, updating their evolving data sources, inviting participations from both open and commercial LLMs. The paper reports analysis of two searsons run comparing 28 open-source and commercial LLMs. 

I found the framework to be very interesting and insightful. The community will benefit from such a large scale analysis over knowledge-related abilities with known and evolving sources.  The paper is very well written.

### Strengths
The tools and data from the paper will be released upon acceptance. 

The community will benefit from such a large scale analysis over knowledge-related abilities with known and evolving sources. The presented analysis is already very insightful.

The breakdown of the task using knowledge-related abilities with known and evolving sources is compelling to assess LLMs evolving capabilities.

### Weaknesses
I don’t see any major weaknesses in the paper. 

One could argue that it is just an analysis paper, some of the insights that were drawn here might not be novel. But I feel that the presented framework will be valuable to the community. The authors have done a very good job explaining the framework in detail.

### Questions
I would have liked to see the human evaluation results in the main part of the paper. It would strengthen the analysis.

Do authors discuss the costs involved with these studies for both seasons?

### Summary
The authors proposes a world knowledge assessment benchmark KoLA that consists of factual knowledge from Wikidata to evaluate the world knowledge of large language models (LLMs). KoLA consists of a four-level taxonomy: knowledge memorization/knowledge understanding/knowledge applying/knowledge creating. The first two tasks focus on directly extracting/generating the information associated with the corresponding world knowledge, and the last two focus on the application of knowledge in reasoning and text generation. 

The data comes from both the data already exposed to LLMs (known data) and the data appeared afterwards (evolving data). Results show that pre-alignment/instruction-tuning models has higher correlation between model size and knowledge memory performance. However, instruction-tuning empowers the models with high-level abilities (e.g. knowledge applying tasks) and commercial models still have leading performance in general.

### Strengths
- The knowledge benchmark fills the blank of thoroughly evaluating world knowledge of current large language models. The taxonomy is carefully designed and rich experiments on model choices are conducted.
- The ever evolving setup has long-term benefit in considering the generalization problem in knowledge-intensive tasks.
- The self-contrast metric has a good motivation in balancing the hallucination in knowledge-based generation.
- The annotation team is of strong educational background.

### Weaknesses
 - The knowledge-wise strength of Rouge-L used in Eq. 3 doesn't look to be strong enough in capturing the knowledge association especially when T is a free-generation result, maybe replacing the measurement with another model (e.g. a entailment model) would be better? (w/ additional computational cost)


### Questions
Comments
- The caption of the figures should include necessary details to understand the them if the space allows (e.g. Figure 4).

### Summary
The paper presents a world knowledge benchmark for LLM, focusing on three aspects: (1) ability modeling; (2) evolving benchmark built upon emerging corpora and (3) evaluation criteria. The author also presented metrics of SOTA LLM's performance on the benchmark and provided insights observed from the evaluation results.

### Strengths
S1. The paper presents a new LLM benchmark with some innovations, including constructing benchmark with emerging corpora, evaluating model's knowledge creation capability.
S2. The paper evaluated major SOTA LLMs, providing good comparison in model's capability from different perspective.
S3. The paper reads well, easy to follow.

### Weaknesses
W1. Benchmark on emerging corpora is a great idea and it is quite encouraging to see the authors promised to refresh the benchmark regularly. However, it is not clear how to maintain such benchmark in the long term.  It is unclear what specific mechanisms are in place to ensure consistent data quality and annotation standards across different iterations of the benchmark, especially as the corpora evolve. The potential for annotation drift or inconsistencies in data collection methodologies could compromise the benchmark's reliability over time.

W2. It is not clear why we need another new LLM benchmark. Given all different benchmarks available publicly, I am not convinced KoLA is a must-have addition. The paper does not provide a sufficiently compelling argument for why existing benchmarks are inadequate, or how KoLA addresses specific gaps that are not already covered. A more detailed comparison with existing benchmarks, highlighting the unique aspects of KoLA, would be beneficial.

W3. It is not clear why the standardized overall scoring can give better idea than simple ranking. The paper does not adequately justify the choice of standardized scoring over simpler ranking methods. The potential for the standardized scores to obscure important performance differences between models on specific tasks needs to be addressed. The rationale for using standardized scores needs to be more thoroughly explained, and the potential limitations of this approach should be discussed.

### Questions
Q1. The paper identified four knowledge capabilities. It is clear on knowledge memorization and knowledge creation. However, it is vague to distinguish knowledge understanding and knowledge application. Take knowledge understanding as an example, would reading comprehension a task of knowledge understanding or knowledge attention? Why knowledge understanding only has extraction tasks?
Q2. Benchmark on emerging corpora is a great idea and it is quite encouraging to see the authors promised to refresh the benchmark regularly. However, it is not clear how to maintain such benchmark in the long term. As the time goes by, some evolving benchmark is no longer most up-to-date, how to handle the benchmark data? How would this evolving benchmark interact with the known dataset?  
Q3. How much does the new KoLA benchmark differ from existing LLM benchmark? There are so many available benchmark published, each focusing on one/multiple capabilities of the model. Why do we need KoLA? What if we combined existing ones? 
Q4. It is not clear the contribution/motivation with standardized overall scoring. As the score would depend on the evaluated models, it will change a lot as more evaluated models would be added in. Also why this is better than simple ranking?

### Summary
The paper studies how to thoroughly evaluating LLMs on its knowledge capability.  Inspired by cognitive science, the authors establish an extensive benchmark that focuses on memorization, understanding, applying and creating respectively. For each capability, the authors have chosen/created new tasks for that capability and evaluate a significant amount of LLMs to draw insights conclusions on those experiments.

The author also introduces a new metric for knowledge creating, which in the experiments shows a notable correlation to faithfulness.

### Strengths
The paper tackles a timely and important issues which evaluates the LLM capability instead of just evaluating on some tasks. To answer this question seems still hard and the paper has selected various datasets and made sensible grouping to evaluate the four aspect that it mentions. 

The paper has run the experiments for several seasons for now and has shown some interesting trends that correlate with model size. The paper also proposes a novel metric for knowledge creation that seems interesting and notably correlated with faithfulness.

### Weaknesses
There are several questions that I think arise after reading the paper, I would consider these just missing some clarity:
The paper said that "Comparing the second-season results with the first season, the rankings of most open-source models have declined" but Table 2 and Table 3 seem to show results of four levels of the same season.
Why COPEN and 2wikiMultiQA are also considered as exclusive?

One of the potential strength of the paper is to analyse the results on the fresh data of each season that the paper claims; however, we don't find such results in the current version. Meanwhile, the paper draws some conclusions (the ones related to knowledge) that don't seem to be part of the contributions of this particular paper.

### Questions
The paper said that "Comparing the second-season results with the first season, the rankings of most open-source models have declined" but Table 2 and Table 3 seem to show results of four levels of the same season.

Why COPEN and 2wikiMultiQA are also considered as exclusive?

How the knowledge is designed in Figure 2 to apply self contrast metric please?
