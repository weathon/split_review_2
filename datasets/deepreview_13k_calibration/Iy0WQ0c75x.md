## Abstract
Learning good self-supervised graph representations that are beneficial to downstream tasks is challenging. Among a variety of methods, contrastive learning enjoys competitive performance. The embeddings of contrastive learning are arranged on a hypersphere that enables the Cosine distance measurement in the Euclidean space. However, the underlying structure of many domains such as graphs exhibits highly non-Euclidean latent geometry. To this end, we propose a novel contrastive learning framework to learn high-quality graph embedding. Specifically, we design the alignment metric that effectively captures the hierarchical data-invariant information, as well as we propose a substitute of uniformity metric  to prevent the so-called dimensional collapse. We show that in the hyperbolic space one has to address the leaf- and height-level uniformity which are related to properties of trees, whereas in the ambient space of the hyperbolic manifold, these notions translate into imposing an isotropic ring density towards boundaries of Poincaré ball. This ring density can be easily imposed by promoting the isotropic feature distribution on the tangent space of manifold. In the experiments, we demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed method across different hyperbolic graph embedding techniques in both supervised and self-supervised learning settings.

### Summary
In the paper "Alignment and outer shell isotropy for hyperbolic graph contrastive learning", the authors suggest a novel approach to hyperbolic (graph) contrastive learning. In contrastive learning, similar pairs of objects attract ("alignment" part of the loss function) while all pairs repulse ("uniformity" part of the loss). In usual contrastive learning, the embedding space is compact (hypersphere) and the uniformity loss aims to spread the embedding vectors uniformly. In contrast, hyperbolic embedding space has infinite volume, so uniformity loss would not make sense. The authors suggest an alternative, and apply this setup to graph contrastive learning. They show that the resulting GraphGCL outperforms all competitors on common benchmarks.

### Strengths
I am not familiar with the literature on hyperbolic graph neural networks, so can not really judge the novelty aspect. That said, I found the paper interesting: it suggests a new idea and shows that the resulting method outperforms existing methods. That hyperbolic embeddings would perform well for graph data, seems to make sense.

### Weaknesses
I do not have major criticisms. The suggested algorithm, HyperGCL, shows a marginal (~1 percentage point) improvement on all datasets that the authors analyzed.

MAJOR COMMENTS

* The results tables (Table 1/2) look a bit "too good to be true": HyperGCL take the first place for every single dataset. Did the authors obtain all the values themselves (by running all the algorithms on all datasets)? Or are the values for other algorithms taken from the respective publications? This should be clarified.

* According to Table 1, HGCL is also a hyperbolic graph contrastive learning method. The authors should explain how it is different from HyperGCL. Is it the only hyperbolic graph contrastive learning method in existence?


MINOR COMMENTS

* page 3, Definition 2: should \mathbb D^n_c be D^d_c? Previously you only used D^d_c.

### Summary
The paper tackles the challenge of learning effective self-supervised graph representations, with a focus on hyperbolic spaces. While contrastive learning is effective in Euclidean spaces, graphs often have non-Euclidean latent geometry. The proposed contrastive learning framework introduces an alignment metric capturing hierarchical data-invariant information and addresses the dimensional collapse issue. The authors associate dimensional collapse with "leaf collapse" and "height collapse" in hyperbolic spaces, proposing a graph contrastive learning framework that operates in the hyperbolic space. To mitigate dimensional collapse, they introduce an isotropic Gaussian loss on the tangent space of the hyperbolic manifold, promoting an isotropic feature distribution. The contributions include investigating the dimension collapse problem, proposing a hyperbolic graph contrastive learning framework, and introducing an isotropic Gaussian loss to address dimensional collapse.

### Strengths
- The paper is well-written.
- The proposed contrastive learning framework in hyperbolic spaces is interesting.
- The paper's emphasis on theoretical properties adds a robust theoretical foundation to the proposed framework.
- The framework's adaptability to various downstream tasks is highlighted.
- Detailed experimental information in the appendix enhances transparency.

### Weaknesses
 - The paper's weakness lies in the observed marginal improvement in performance over prior methods. While the idea is intriguing, the practical impact of the proposed framework in terms of tangible performance gains may be limited.
- Personally, the empirical results do not convincingly demonstrate the advantages derived from the theorems.
- The absence of clear computational complexity advantages over existing methods is a point of consideration. Without distinct efficiency benefits, it becomes challenging to justify the adoption of the proposed approach, especially if it offers similar performance to existing methods. Addressing this aspect would enhance the paper's practical appeal.

### Summary
Authors propose a novel graph contrastive learning framework called HyperGCL that relies on the projections of GNN node embeddings into hyperbolic spaces. For a given graph, two views are randomly produced by applying random perturbations (dropping egdes and nodes). These are fed to a 2-layer GCN to get node embeddings, which are then projected onto a Poincaré ball. A loss is then designed to achieve representation learning in this space. A first classical term based on the distance in this hyperbolic space is proposed to promote alignment of views. A second term handles the diversity of these representations by ensuring that embeddings populate the ball uniformly. To this end, authors propose to map embeddings into an Euclidean space where representations are forced to fit an isotropic gaussian distribution. This method allows to prevent the well-known dimensional collapse for which authors propose a clear taxonomy when learning in hyperbolic spaces.
Then they benchmark their method to several supervised GNN and contrastive methods using common evaluation in this literature, for node classification and collaborative filtering. HyperGCL consistently outperforms other compared methods across 8 datasets. Finally, the authors analyze both theoretically and empirically the effectiveness of HyperGCL in preventing dimensional collapse using the notion of effective rank.

### Strengths
-	Clear presentation of involved mathematical concepts
-	Clear analysis regarding the collapse modes when learning representations in hyperbolic spaces
-	Extensive benchmark of HyperGCL when learning representations in an unsupervised manner. Supervised evaluation of these representations show that HyperGCL is a novel SOTA contrastive graph learning method.
-	Pertinent analysis in terms of Effective rank with an interesting theoretical result.
-	Interesting ablation studies w.r.t the topology used to enforce alignment and uniformity.
-	Interesting analysis w.r.t the choice of gaussian distributions.

### Weaknesses
 **1. On the form**: as a consequence few points are not so clear in substance.

  - a)	There are many tipos in the paper, please correct them.
  - b)	Figure 1 and 2 and their respective analysis in the text are not clear. Figures and their explanations could be improved / completed. As such, I would even suggest to move them in the supplementary material to have enough space to complete them.
  - c)	Definition 2 could be made clearer.
  - d)	Figure 4: modes of collapse should be put on the subplots. Clean tree should be isolated.
  - e)	Figure 5: in the text you say that you randomly drop edges and nodes. But in the figure it seems that you rather mask some node features not completely remove nodes.

**2. contextualizing research**
   - a)	I think that mappings from hyperbolic spaces to gaussian distributions were already studied in the Machine Learning literature e.g [A]. This should be clear in the paper. Also it seems to mitigate the theoretical contribution stated in Theorem 2.
   - b)	Optimization in Riemannian framework is clearly an active field of research whose advances seem to be disregarded by authors e.g [B], [C]. Could you further justify your choice for RSGD and perform simple benchmarks with other more recent approaches ?
   - c)	Various clearly competitive approaches are not benchmarked e.g GraphMAE [D] and more importantly CCA-SSG [E]. The latter also conducts a reflection to circumvent to dimensional collapse when operating in an Euclidean setting. The uniformity loss essentially comes down to enforcing embedding covariances to be close to an identity matrix like the one of an isotropic gaussian distribution. [E] also establishes relations between CCA-SSG and Mutual Information maximization under gaussian assumptions so in substance it clearly seems like an Euclidean counter to HyperGCL. As such clear comparisons should be present in the paper. Interestingly, It seems that these methods need a higher embedding dimension to compete/outperform HyperGCL which was benchmarked for a fixed embedding dimension of 50 but where the curvature parameter needs to be fine-tuned. 

**3. Incomplete experiments or analysis.**
   - a)	What are the hyperparameters involved in the perturbation strategy ? Is there a validation of these parameters and if so what is the sensitivity of the method to these hyperparameters ?
   - b)	Could you provide the sensitivity analysis to the curvature parameter on the node classification part.
   - c)	No experiments in semi-supervised learning settings. As HyperGCL seems to provide discriminant embeddings keeping low-dimensional embeddings, I would tend to believe that they would better suit semi-supervised learning than Euclidean contrastive graph learning method. As CCA-SSG seems on par with HyperGCL (see 2.c)) , it is not obvious that the overall hyperbolic setting is better than the Euclidean one.
   - d)	Lack of clarity or hindsight w.r.t the evaluation : No clear justifications for the choice of supervised evaluation. No fully unsupervised evaluations proposed which would suit the learned topology.
   - e)	No sensitivity analysis w.r.t the encoder. Nor a clear comparison between performances of this GNN backbone in a fully supervised setting vs the 2-step strategy used by authors to evaluate HyperGCL embeddings. Such analysis could relate to the common concerns in the GNN literature e.g i) expressivity simply considering e.g several GNN layers using Jumping Knowledge based backbones; ii) homophily vs heterophily via e.g [F] whose supervised models exhibit considerably higher classification performances than those reported in Table 1.

### Questions
I invite the authors to discuss the weaknesses I have mentioned above and to provide additional results/analyses for refutation, knowing I am inclined to increase my score. Follows some questions to clarify some points:

Q1. Do you normalize embeddings or just center them ?

Q2. The choice of  a linear classifier to evaluate clearly non-linear embeddings is not so obvious  (I know that it is not questioned in most graph contrastive learning papers). Could you provide complementary evaluations with a non-linear classifier e.g 2-MLP with ReLU activation ?

### Summary
The authors proposed a contrastive learning method using hyperbolic space with the alignment between representations and the standard normal distribution in the tangent space at the origin of the hyperbolic space. The authors discussed the effectiveness of the proposed method using the Effective rank of the representations in a tangent space.

### Strengths
1. The proposed model is simple, intuitive, and novel in the contrastive learning area, as far as I know.
1. The proposed model has shown good results in numerical experiments.

### Weaknesses
While main ideas of the paper are interesting to me, the paper needs significant improvement mainly due to its incompleteness and mathematical soundness issues.
1. Contrastive learning, the main theme of the paper, is not defined in the paper. Readers cannot understand what kind of data we are handling and suddenly see the pair of (X, A) and (X', A') in Section 3.1. without knowing what kind of real data these symbols correspond to in real applications. 
2. The explanation of Theorem 1 is wrong. Theorem 1 roughly says that distance among points in hyperbolic space can be approximated by a tree, but does NOT say its converse.  However, your explanation is "any tree can be embedded into a
Poincaré disk with low distortion." This is the converse of Theorem 1.
3. Many important definitions are missed. What are $p_\mathrm{pos}$ and $p_\mathrm{data}$ in Equation (1)? Also, $p$ and $D$ are not defined in Equation (9). Specifically, while $D$ appears to represent a KL-divergence, the distributions involved are not explicitly defined. The variable $p$ is only described as one of two distributions, but its specific form is not given, making it unclear how Equation (9) is derived. It seems that $p$ is intended to be a multivariate standard normal distribution, but this is not stated in the paper.
4. Theorem 3 says nothing since the left-hand side, the negative KL distance, is always non-positive and the right-hand side, Erank, which is the entropy of the normalized singular values, is always non-negative. Also, these are not strongly related. If we consider $\mathcal{N}(\mathbf{0},c\mathbf{I})$, we can see that the entropy of the normalized singular values is constant but the KL divergence varies as we change $c$. For the above reasons, the discussion of the results in Table 3 using Erank, which is the entropy of the normalized singular values of the covariance matrix in the tangent space, does not support the justification of the proposed method. First of all, the authors could have shown the value $\mathcal{L}_{U}^\mathcal{T}$ in Table 3, instead of Erank. Hence, the whole structure of the paper needs significant improvement. This technical issue regarding Theorem 3 is the strongest concern about this paper. The connection between the proposed loss function and the effective rank (Erank) is not clearly established. The loss function minimizes the KL divergence between the covariance matrix and the identity matrix, but the paper does not explain why this minimization should lead to a higher effective rank. The paper should clarify why the KL divergence is a suitable proxy for the effective rank, especially given that the KL divergence is sensitive to the scale of the covariance matrix, while the effective rank is scale-invariant.
5. The motivation of introducing the term $\mathcal{L}_{U}^\mathcal{T}$ is to force the uniformity. However, since the normal distribution decays exponentially in the tangent space and the surface area of a hyper-ball in hyperbolic space exponentially grows with respect to its radius $r$, the density of the normal distribution decays double exponentially. So the concentration effect is much more dominant than the uniformity effect. The authors have not discussed it.
6. In Section 3.1., it says "The N pairs of node embeddings,... as in Appendix B." However, the reason is not described. While it is common to project embeddings onto the Poincaré ball, the paper should explicitly state the reason for doing so in this specific context, rather than simply referring to the appendix.
7. Figure 4 does not make sense since the author states that 4b is the best while 4b ignores the topology of the original tree. If we could ignore the topology of the original graph, we should randomly map them to the lattice in Euclidean space. Also, if we consider the hyperbolic distance, 4d seems more uniform than 4b. The paper should clarify why the topology of the original graph is not relevant for the evaluation of the embeddings, especially when the method is motivated by the hierarchical structure of the data.
8. The proposed method does not scale well with respect to the dimensionality, since it involves the determinant calculation. It might not be critical in real applications where the dimensionality is not large.

### Questions
1. Could you define contrastive learning formally so it is consistent with your proposal method's notation? Also, based on the explanation, could you explain which data in real applications can the contrastive learning apply to? 
1. What are $p_\\mathrm{pos}$ and $p_\\mathrm{data}$ in Equation (1)?
1. What does $\\mathcal{T}$ mean in $\\mathcal{L}_{U}^\\mathcal{T}$?
