## Abstract
Optimization over high-dimensional input space is inherently difficult, especially when safety needs to be maintained during sampling. Current safe exploration algorithms ensure safety by conservatively expanding the safe region, which leads to inefficiency in large input settings. Existing high-dimensional constrained optimization methods also neglect safety in the search process. In this paper, we propose Optimistic Local Latent Safe Optimization (OLLSO), which is capable of handling high-dimensional problems under probabilistic safety satisfaction. We first use distance-preserved autoencoder to transform the original input space into a low-dimensional continuous latent space. An optimistic local safe strategy is then applied over the latent space to efficiently optimize the utility function. 
Theoretically, we prove the probabilistic safety guarantee from the latent space to the original space.
OLLSO outperforms representative high-dimensional constrained optimization algorithms in simulation experiments. We also show its real application in clinical experiments for safe and efficient online optimization of a neuromodulation therapy.

### Summary
This paper develops a solution approach to the safe BO task on high-dimensional space. The key idea is to find a distance-preserving low-dimensional embedding on the original input space. This is achieved by adopting a previously developed Isometrically Regularized VAE (IRVAE). Once the IRVAE has been built, a previously established safe exploration variant of GP-UCB is applied.

Under certain assumptions, a certain probability of meeting the safety requirement can be theoretically guaranteed. The proposed method is applied on a variety of real-world, practical experiment. The key contribution here are the empirical studies on real-world dataset and the theoretical analysis.

### Strengths
The paper aims to address a very important problem. Existing literature has also been sufficiently reviewed.
Most importantly, I really appreciate that the paper features a pretty interesting set of very real-world, practical experiments.
There is also a result that helps translate the safety guarantee from the latent space to the original space.

### Weaknesses
Overall, I appreciate the strong empirical studies of this paper. All experiments are based on very real-world application & that is great.

However, I am also concerned that the algorithmic contribution of this paper is too incremental: if I understand this paper correctly, it comprises two separate phases (learning low-dim embedding & doing safe BO on the low-dim space) and each phase is a direct application of an existing algorithm. 

In addition, I am also not sure what the current theoretical analysis implies. I understand that Theorem 1 is established to translate a probabilistic constraint on the latent space to another on the original space. 

It seems the math suggest a translation on the UCB of the safety function prediction while in practice, we would want to establish a probabilistic bound on a user-specified constraint g(x) >= h where h is given. Theorem 1 does not provide any handle on this.

---

Minor point: 

The algorithmic exposition is also unclear at several points. For example, in Algorithm 1 (line 6), it is not clear how L_t is defined. Furthermore, how do we update it in line 6?

### Questions
Based on the above, I have two specific questions:

1. Could you flesh out Algorithm 1 mathematically in the rebuttal?
2. Could you elaborate on how Theorem 1 can be positioned to guarantee that with a certain algorithmic configuration, the proposed algorithm would induce P(g(x) >= h) >= alpha for a given h?
3. Based on 1. and 2., it would be good to highlight the non-triviality of putting together the ideas of safe exploration & BO on latent space. Otherwise, a simple loose coupling of these ideas is somewhat below bar for me -- I of course appreciate the practical empirical experiment -- I think the set of experiments is good but that alone is probably not enough to meet the acceptance bar.

### Summary
The paper proposes a comprehensive solution for efficient, high-dimensional, safe exploration. Essentially, it extends recent advancements in latent space optimization (LSO) and local optimization for global (constrained) optimization (SCBO) into the realm of Bayesian optimization with safety constraints. The paper offers theoretical justification for the proposed VAE-based dimension reduction method in safe exploration when assuming the regularized VAE could achieve $\epsilon$-subspace embedding.

### Strengths
1. The paper is well-organized, with sufficient visualization illustrating the key concepts and results. The design of the proposed algorithm is clearly demonstrated. The empirical study shows its improvement over baselines in various metrics.

2. The intermediate evidence substantiates the effectiveness of the proposed IRVAE over traditional VAE in uncertainty quantification in the latent space.

3. The theoretical analysis justifies safe exploration for optimization with Gaussian processes in the latent space.

### Weaknesses
1. Though the discussion involves random-projection-based dimension reduction methods, it lacks direct comparison with the proposed IRVAE, especially when the assumption is shared. Specifically, HESBO [1] offers a comprehensive discussion of the feasibility of $\epsilon$-subspace embedding and its impact on downstream uncertainty quantification when applying popular kernels. The recent follow-up work [2] further advances this direction by reducing the risk of losing global optimum in the embedding. A direct comparison could better motivate the proposed IRVAE, which lacks a similar theoretical guarantee and requires additional assumption 3 to proceed with the analysis. Furthermore, the paper does not address the potential for the IRVAE to introduce distortions in the latent space that could negatively impact the performance of downstream optimization, particularly in the context of safety constraints. The assumption of $\epsilon$-subspace embedding, while theoretically convenient, may not hold in practice, and the paper does not provide sufficient empirical evidence to support its validity in the context of the proposed method. The lack of analysis on the sensitivity of the method to the choice of VAE architecture and hyperparameters further weakens the justification for using IRVAE over simpler alternatives like random projections.

2. The related work part also misses a section dedicated to distance-preserving dimension reduction for uncertainty quantification, which is closely related and should have been compared to the proposed IRVAE. For example, [3] and [4] focus explicitly on distance preserving (feature collapse) in the latent space for uncertainty quantification. Additionally, a similar framework, BALLET [5], relying on superlevel-set identification on top of confidence bounds and deep kernel for high-dimensional Bayesian optimization, is missing in the discussion. There is potential for incorporating its regret analysis to enhance the significance of the proposed paper further. The absence of a discussion on the limitations of using a VAE for distance preservation, such as its tendency to produce blurry latent representations, is a significant oversight. The paper should also address the computational cost associated with training and using the IRVAE, especially in comparison to simpler dimension reduction techniques. The lack of a discussion on how the method scales with increasing dimensionality and data size further limits the practical applicability of the proposed approach.

3. Given existing work in distance preserving dimension reduction, local optimization for efficient global optimization, and safe exploration for optimization with Gaussian processes, the general novelty of the proposed method is very limited. The paper does not adequately demonstrate how the proposed method overcomes the limitations of existing approaches, and the combination of existing techniques is not sufficiently justified by either theoretical or empirical evidence. The paper also fails to address the potential for the proposed method to be outperformed by simpler baselines in specific scenarios, and the lack of a thorough ablation study further weakens the claims of novelty.

### Questions
Could the author further clarify the results shown in Figure 3? What are the legends in (b) stand for? Does the bar plots in (c) show the cumulative results after 500 evaluation corresponding to the results in (b)?

### Summary
The paper proposes Optimistic Local Latent Safe Optimization (OLLSO), a method for safe exploration in high-dimensional search spaces. The difficulty of high-dimensional Gaussian Process (GP) modeling is circumvented through the use of a distance-preserving variational autoencoder (VAE). Modeling is performed in the low-dimensional latent space produced by the VAE. Theoretical analysis is provided on the probabilistic safety of the algorithm. Lastly, OLLSO displays improved empirical performance over competing algorithms, and justifies the choice of VAE through ablations.

### Strengths
__A:__
__Figure 1:__ A very nice illustration of the proposed algorithm, which effectively summarizes it in a pedagogical manner.
__Figure 4:__ A welcomed ablation on the choice of model.
__Impressive results:__ OLLSO yields good results on all tasks considered.

### Weaknesses
 - __Probabilistic safety:__ Proposed as a novel concept, I find it confusing and believe it needs to be discussed further. 

Specifically, we seek to find the optimal value $x^* = \max f(x)$ under the condition that $x^*$ is safe, __probably__. Do we not observe whether $x^*$ is actually safe? Is the safety at $x^*$, or any other $x$ we have observed, stochastic? Since I have not completely understood this central aspect of the paper, I reserve judgement until it is further clarified, but the objective in Eq. 1 does not currently appear to be properly defined.

- __Assumptions of unclear validity & subsequent theorem:__ 
  - __Assumption 1:__ While this is a common assumption, _it is conventionally made on the original input space_. Assuming that the VAE latent space adheres to this assumption would entail that the projections from $\mathcal{Z}$ are sufficiently well-behaved. In vanilla BO, the modeling choices adhere to the assumption through the use of an appropriate kernel (Matern, RBF). However, it is not clear whether the decoding step is well-behaved (and due to its distortion of the space, I would be surprised if if was), so that _the assumption is adhered to_ in the proposed setup. I suggest the authors re-visit this assumption, since its correctness hinges on the continuity of the decoder. What makes them believe that the norm-bound $B$ is preserved through the decoding step? Since the theoretical analysis hinges on Assumption 1, which is decidedly _not_ common in latent space BO, the gap between the conventional assumption and the one made in latent space should be theoretically justified.  

  - __Assumption 3:__ The mapping $U$ is not currently properly defined, since it does not have an output. I believe you mean that $U$ is a _matrix_ or a map $R^D --> R^{d_e}$ (as in HeSBO). Further, wouldn't $g(\mathbf(x))$ imply that $g$ accepts D-dimensional input and $g(\mathbf(Ux))$ imply that $g$ accepts $d_e$-dimensional input?
  - __Subsequent subspace assumption (After A3, henceforth AA3):__ _"Here we assume that the latent space mapping is an ε-subspace mapping "_. Please re-state this as a proper assumption for clarity. Moreover, is there a fundamental reason to believe this holds true, i.e. can properties of the IRVAE shed light on this? In HeSBO, the construction of the algorithm ensure this holds true. I don't see why the VAE would satisfy this unless it employed only linear layers (which I assume it does not).
  - Lastly, the intermediary conclusion, _"we can properly choose $\beta_t$ that satisfies the probability safety guarantee, under the noise-free setting"_ does not mesh well with __Assumption 2__ - observations are perturbed by noise.

Due to the three (A1, A3, AA3) seemingly unverifiable and seemingly incorrect (A1, AA3) assumptions that are made, I do not attribute any value to the theory that is being presented. I encourage the authors to shed light on why these assumptions are valid. 

- __Novelty of method:__ OLLSO combines exisiting VAE architectures with trust regions, Thompson sampling and constaints. VAEs for BO have been extensively explored, and the other components are exactly SCBO (Eriksson and Poloczek 2021). While the combination is interesting, no novel building blocks for BO are proposed.

- __Brief methodology section:__ Section 4. is brief and too high-level. Thus, it leaves a few questions unanswered. These are all outlined in the _Questions_ below. I believe addressing these would add clarity to the paper. Moreover, Section 4.2 is related work and should, in my opinion, be moved to Section 2. 

- __VAE-related background:__ BO and GPs are well-covered in the background, but the VAE-related design choices are not. As it is a vital part of the algorithm, background on the IRVAE is integral to the paper.

- __Parsing of results:__ Plots are difficult to process due to the small fontsize, and text which overlaps with the rest of the plot (Fig. 4). Consider making it substantially larger, possibly at the expense of moving some of it to the Appendix.

__Minor:__
- _"estimates both the posterior and the confidence interval"_. The confidence interval comes for free after estimating the posterior, so saying that the posterior is estimated suffices.
- _"Follows the standard local Bayesian optimization algorithms ..."_ --> Following
- $u_t(z)$: If the $\max C$ is over $z$ (which it should be) then  $u_t$ is not a function of $z$.
- Fig. 1: Optimisticc --> Optimistic

### Questions
__Should be clarified:__
- _"Our approach resets l to its initial length, ensuring a different, safer trajectory sampling than the initial instance."_ Why does this action _ensure_ a safer trajectory?
- Algorithm 1, line 2: What is the _trajectory_ $\zeta_0$?
- For the trust region, how is $\ell$ set?

__General questions:__
- Why can unlabeled data be synthetized (in large quantities)?

### Summary
This paper introduces the Optimistic Local Latent Safe Optimization (OLLSO) method, designed to address the challenging problem of optimization in high-dimensional input spaces while maintaining safety during sampling. OLLSO leverages a distance-preserved autoencoder to transform the original high-dimensional input space into a continuous latent space, allowing for efficient optimization of utility functions. The paper provides a theoretical probabilistic safety guarantee from the latent space to the original space. In simulation experiments, OLLSO outperforms existing high-dimensional constrained optimization algorithms. Furthermore, the paper demonstrates OLLSO's real-world application in clinical experiments, where it efficiently and safely optimizes neuromodulation therapy for a paraplegic patient, showcasing its practical utility in safety-critical contexts. Overall, OLLSO offers a promising approach for addressing high-dimensional optimization problems while ensuring safety, with potential applications in various fields.

### Strengths
The paper's strength lies in its introduction of the Optimistic Local Latent Safe Optimization (OLLSO) method, tailored for addressing safety concerns in high-dimensional sequential optimization problems. OLLSO's innovation comes from its utilization of a regularized autoencoder to transform complex, high-dimensional input spaces into continuous latent spaces while preserving distances, enabling efficient handling of hybrid inputs. The algorithm then employs an optimistic local safe strategy within the latent space, distinguishing safe regions through the upper confidence bounds of the safety function. Furthermore, the paper provides a rigorous theoretical probabilistic safety guarantee that spans from the latent space to the original input space. OLLSO's practicality is demonstrated through its application to safety-critical scenarios, where it outperforms existing high-dimensional constrained Bayesian optimization algorithms in terms of both optimization efficiency and safety during sampling. Its successful deployment in real clinical experiments, optimizing lower limb muscle control for a paraplegic patient, underscores OLLSO's potential for impactful real-world applications in safety-critical domains.

### Weaknesses
- The assumptions limit the widespread application of the proposed algorithm.
- The presentation has the potential to be improved, especially Section 4.1.
- The contributions could be better summarized.

### Questions
- The presentation in Section 4 should be better polished. In my mind, the definitions of the acquisition function A and the local region are missed at least. It would also be helpful if the authors could make a plot to show what they (side length, local region...) are. 
- Considering the mapping from the original state space to the latent space is a key contribution, the author should explain more about why IRVAE is better in 4.1, and indicate where the related experimental results are.
-  Considering the assumptions, it would be quite helpful if the authors could have a more general description of how we can apply the methods in the real world. Besides, why does the real clinical therapy optimization in Section 6.1 satisfy the assumptions?
- After Equation (1), I do not think $\alpha$ smaller than 0.5 will make the solution safe. Maybe I misunderstand some things. In Algorithm 1, there is an extra half bracket in the line 9.
- Even though the work is quite different from the safe exploration in RL [1], it would be great if the authors could have some discussion about their differences in terms of problem setting, safety mechanism, etc. The researchers in Safe RL would quite appreciate these discussions.
