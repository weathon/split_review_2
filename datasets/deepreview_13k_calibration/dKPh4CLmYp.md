## Abstract
Set-based learning is an essential component of modern deep learning and network science. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and their edge-free counterparts Deepsets have proven remarkably useful on ragged and topologically challenging datasets. The key to learning informative embeddings for set members is a specified aggregation function, usually a sum, max, or mean. We propose Fishnets, an aggregation strategy for learning information-optimal embeddings for sets of data for both Bayesian inference and graph aggregation. We demonstrate that i) Fishnets neural summaries can be scaled optimally to an arbitrary number of data objects, ii) Fishnets aggregations are robust to changes in data distribution, unlike standard deepsets, iii) Fishnets saturate Bayesian information content and extend to regimes where Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) techniques fail and iv) Fishnets can be used as a drop-in aggregation scheme within GNNs. We show that by adopting a Fishnets aggregation scheme for message passing, GNNs can achieve state-of-the-art performance versus architecture size on benchmark datasets over existing architectures with a fraction of learnable parameters and faster training time.

### Summary
This paper proposes a scalable aggregator Fishnets for sets and graphs from the perspective of MLE. Fishnets can approximate score and Fisher matrix from data with arbitrary size with neural networks. It has comparable performance with DeepSets and Softmax Aggregation while using fewer parameters.

### Strengths
1. This model has good scalability as it simply keeps the summation form regardless of the size of data points.
2. The model architecture is simple and it has fewer parameters than the other counterparts.

### Weaknesses
1. The model requires to calculate the inverse of Fisher matrix in each iteration of the estimator. I am concerned with the computation complexity. I believe the complexity analysis and runtime comparison with other counterparts are needed. Specifically, the paper should provide a detailed breakdown of the computational cost associated with inverting the Fisher matrix, considering its dimensionality and the potential for numerical instability. The authors should also discuss the practical implications of this computational burden, especially for large datasets.
2. The proposed model has limited flexibility, as it is only permutation invariant. While its counterpart DeepSets have both invariant and equivariant formulations. This limits the applicability of Fishnets to tasks where permutation equivariance is crucial. The paper should more clearly define the types of tasks where this limitation becomes significant, and discuss potential strategies for extending the model to handle equivariant scenarios.
3. The proposed models are only compared with the mentioned two counterparts, which are not enough to demonstrate the effectiveness. More extensive experiments are needed. The empirical evaluation should include a wider range of baseline models, including those that are known to perform well on set and graph aggregation tasks. The evaluation should also consider a more diverse set of datasets, with varying sizes and complexities, to ensure the generalizability of the results.
4. The clarity of this paper needs to be improved. Many symbols have unexplained meanings and shapes. For example, the use of specific symbols in the mathematical formulations is not consistently defined, making it difficult to follow the theoretical arguments. The paper should include a comprehensive table of notations and provide clear definitions for all symbols used, including their dimensions and types.

### Questions
1. What makes the Fishnets robust to noise?
2. In section 5, why does the experiments only perform on deep GNNs? Edge aggregation can be also performed on shallow GNNs, such as GAT [1].

### Summary
The paper proposes an aggregation strategy for sets of data that aims to learn “information-optimal” embeddings. The approach resides around training neural networks to learn the score and Fisher information matrix for individual data points. This permits the construction of optimal embeddings by aggregating the scores and Fisher matrices and applying the Fisher scoring method iteratively. The paper reports the results of multiple experiments that demonstrate the potential applications of the methodology and and highlight its strengths - robustness to distribution shift, ability to saturate Bayesian information content, capability to take into account uncertainty.

### Strengths
S1: The paper proposes a principled approach for aggregation of set data to construct improved embeddings.

S2. Several experiments demonstrate the potential of the proposed methodology including (i) its ability to saturate Bayesian information content; (ii) its robustness to distribution shift; and (iii) its usage as an aggregation technique in GNNs.

### Weaknesses
W1: The presentation of the method could be improved. In particular, the key concepts of “information optimal” and “information saturation” are not clearly defined. Section 2 first explains that the Fisher scoring method can be used to “(iteratively) form a maximum likelihood estimator” and then transitions to a “pseudo-MLE”. Alsing & Wandelt (2018) provide a considerably more complete and clearer discussion. This paper should aim to be more precise. For example, it’s not clear what “(iteratively)” means here – Alsing & Wandelt spell it out that it converges in the limit and explain that after k iterations it provides a (clearly defined) quasi maximum-likelihood estimator. The paper doesn’t explain the transition to a “pseudo-MLE” later in the section. It doesn’t explain the concept of “saturating” the Fisher information; it doesn’t provide the Cramer-Rao bound. One could argue that some of this might be considered necessary background knowledge, but I would suggest that the paper should be accessible to practitioners who are interested in learning about a new aggregation method and perhaps do not have an information theoretic background.

W2: Although the experiments provide illustrations of how the approach can prove beneficial, none of them constitutes a thorough experimental study that demonstrates that the methodology is superior for a given application. In each case, the proposed approach is compared to one baseline, for one dataset or model. This is sufficient to illustrate the potential of the method, but it does not provide compelling evidence that the method can be a state-of-the-art choice for a particular problem. 

An example is the GNN aggregation experiment. Rather than providing a systematic and complete study over multiple datasets and comparing against multiple baselines to demonstrate how the proposed method acts as the best aggregator (in some sense) the provided experiments are for a single dataset, with essentially two variants of single baseline as comparison points. The selected baseline does not achieve close to the state-of-the-art performance – as asked below, it’s not even clear that the selected baseline is configured to achieve its best performance. So these experiments allow us to conclude that for one dataset the proposed method outperforms one questionably-configured baseline that is itself well behind the state-of-the-art (although one could make an argument that the leaders above it are not “pure” GNNs and are achieving outperformance through processing steps that are not related to graph learning or aggregation). The experiments definitely do not establish that the proposed aggregator can be reliably combined with multiple different GNN architectures and employed confidently for a new dataset. 

It's not essential that the paper provide such evidence for every application of the proposed method. Indeed, it is good to see the versatility via illustrations of how it could be employed in a range of settings. However, the paper would be much stronger if it provided compelling evidence for at least one of the suggested applications. The paper does not make a strong theoretical contribution, although the proposed technique is well-founded theoretically. As such, the bar for experimentation is higher; one expects convincing empirical evidence to support the claims.
W3. Related work: The Deep Sets paper was published in 2018 and has been cited over 2000 times. While many of these papers involve applications of the method, many others propose extensions and examine the aggregation process. As just one example, [R1] examines learnable recurrent aggregation functions. A related work section that discusses two papers and then cites three other examples with a single sentence (all dating from 2020 or earlier) is inadequate. This section does not cite any papers published in 2021-2023, making it highly questionable whether the paper is correctly positioning the proposed method in the context of existing research on the topic.

### Questions
Q1. Why does the AUC-ROC performance for the baseline differ so much from the value reported in Li et al. 2020 (where the best performing model is 0.855 for a 28 layer network)? Do the experiments avoid residual connections for some reason? (The description “out-of-the-box 28-layer GCN” is unclear to me). Li et al. explicitly state “residual connections significantly improve the performance of deep GCN models. PlainGCN without skip connections does not gain any improvement from increasing depth.” 

Q2. “Explicitly learning the $F^{−1}$ weights in addition to the score allows us to achieve 1) asymptotic optimality” – can the paper concretely define the nature of the optimality? is there a simple proof? Or is it considered obvious? Presumably there a reliance on a universal function approximation result for the neural networks learning the score and the Fisher? Does this combine obviously with the asymptotics of the Fisher method?

2: You are willing to defend your assessment, but it is quite likely that you did not understand the central parts of the submission or that you are unfamiliar with some pieces of related work. Math/other details were not carefully checked.

### Summary
In this paper, the authors propose Fishnets, a strategy that can better learn embeddings for sets of data, used in DeepSets environments or in graphs as well. The method is statistically-backed with solid motivation and organization behind the writing, and achieves solid performance boosts when it comes to the empirical tests.

### Strengths
The strengths of this paper lie in its rigor, novelty, and strong performance. The Fishnets strategy is well-motivated in the second section, with both intuition and theory combined. In addition, because of this it seems to be relatively novel compared to similar works, which also helps Fishnets achieve great performance empirically, no matter the dataset/task.

### Weaknesses
The main weaknesses of the paper lie in not that many empirical comparisons, as well as a slight decline in organization as the paper goes on. For example, there could be better organization between sections 4 and 5; perhaps differentiating a little bit more or talking about the experiments in the introduction. The sections do not seem to have a reasonable ordering to them, but rather are jumbled with one another, which also makes experiments much harder to conduct, given that there are so many applications and so many claims being made. For example, one key paradigm, being the graph learning, is only given one dataset to work with. For such an important aspect of the work, it would be expected to include performance on multiple graph-like datasets.

### Questions
1. The authors mention faster training time in multiple occurrences, but to the best of my knowledge data on computation time is not included in the paper. Would it be possible to shed a little bit of light on how much the improvement is on that front?
2. Why was the proteins dataset chosen in the first place over any other potential graph benchmark?

### Summary
This paper proposes Fishnets, an aggregation strategy for learning information-optimal embeddings for sets of
data for both Bayesian inference and graph aggregation.
The methods contribute to the general set aggregation problems.

### Strengths
- Good methodological motivations regarding optimal aggregation of independent heterogeneous data

### Weaknesses
 - The paper is poorly structured. The Introduction is too short to introduce and motivate the problem. The method and related work section is too limited. The experimental section appears on page 3. Overall, the paper does not appear to be properly written.
- The Bayesian Information saturation experiments are detached from graph neural network aggregation experiments. Why they should be separately discussed? And why the GNN aggregation experiments cannot share the same analysis from the Bayesian Information saturation experiments?
- Only experimenting on OGBN-Proteins seems to be too limited. Experiments on more graph datasets are needed.
- Only using deep GNNs is a weird setting. Why not experiment with shallow GNNs? The paper should at least include results regarding shallow GNNs for comparison.

### Summary
Paper proposes a way to aggregate a set of variable-sized feature vectors into a fixed vector. This is essential for set-based inputs (where the number of items in the set is variable) and graph neural networks (where number of neighbors changes per node). Paper models  data distributions, $p(d | \theta)$, using the Fisher information matrix $F = \sum_{d \in dataset} \nabla_\theta p(d|\theta) \cdot \nabla_\theta p(d|\theta)^T$ where the derivatives (**I think**) are calcuated at a given value of $\theta$. Then, the value of $\theta$ is iteratively updated (**I thnk**) by repeatedly updating with  $F^{-1} t$, where $t = \nabla_\theta \sum_{d \in dataset}   p(d|\theta) $. Paper claims that this yields an information-optimal representation of data.


# Update

I read the author's response and updated manuscript. I will keep my score as-is

## Response

Thank you for your hard work and quick turn-around.

Unfortunately, the paper still seems incomplete in my opinion. I will unlikely change my rating at this point. The following are points you may consider for future versions (e.g., resubmissions)

* Add some prelim section. 
* Equation 6: Please be clear on **iterate**. I expect to see something like parameter at $t$ versus $t - 1$,  etc.
* Above Eq.12: it is not clear what is meant by "draw data-parameter pair" -- does this mean, randomly draw subset of data, and on it, train a neural network (to convergence?)
* Please avoid using "$\cdot$" on LHS of Equations 14 & 15.

### Strengths
* **Direction**: The paper addresses an important general direction: Combining variable-length (orderless) information is applicable to many tasks, including graphs (social networks, biological networks, user-product interactions, etc), sets, or ordered sequences (text or video) if positional sinusoidal embeddings are added. Their *subdirection*, i.e., learning a neural net that output summary statistics for distributions, is also important and impactful (e.g., Neural Statistician, https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.02185) with many possible combinations: Given a set, whats the probability of an item given others in the set.

* **Practical**  (1)The method computes per-example a gradient term $J_i$ (and its outer-product $J_i J_i^T$), which can be computed in parallel. Then, the sum across all examples. (2) It can be used as drop-in replacement for GNN training. (3) Method trains fast and doesnt use many parameters

* **Pointing out primary weakness of related ( / previous) work.**: Computing $F^-1$ (where F is fisher matrix) gives "asymptotic optimality".

### Weaknesses
The primary weakness is that the paper does not stand on its own. While nicely written and makes important contributions (e.g., practical &  theoretical), the missing (preliminary) information makes this paper difficult to understand and reproduce, unless the reader goes in-depth into related work. I will detail this and ask the authors some clarification questions.

"**optimality**" is mentioned a few times. However, it is not clear from the text: "**optimal, from what sense?**". In my opinion, there needs to be a *clearly-stated (i) objective function or (ii) inequality, and showing that the method either recovers the (i) (unique) optimal or (ii) satisfies the inequality with equality. Currently, this discussion is skipped.

Experiments. The only real dataset is ogbn-protein. If you already integrated with PyG and have ogbn training setup, wouldn't it be straight forward to rerun your code while changing only the dataset name?

### Questions
# Please be more exact

* Define $\theta_{fid}$.

* What is the iteration in "(iteratively)" mentioned before Equation 3?

I think that all of the above should be incorporated in the paper

In Equation (9), please list-down the parameters which the objective function is optimized w.r.t., e.g.

$$\mathcal{L}(w_t, w_F)$$

The reason I am asking for this, because it is not immediately obvious if $\theta$ is a constant, though it is clear that $\hat{\theta}_{NN}$ is parameterized by $(w_t, w_F)$. Further, it is not clear if $\theta_{fid}$ is always fixed -- if not, please list in LHS of Eq.9.

# Questions 


1. What is $\theta_{fid}$? what is the what is the **iterate** in ``(iteratively)''  mentioned before Equation 3? Do the authors imply that $\theta_{fid}$ is the previous iteration value and $\hat{\theta}^{MLE}$ is the next iteration?

2. What is $\theta$ in Eq.9? 

3. In equation (9), $\theta_{NN}$ is defined in terms of $F_{NN}$ and $t_{NN}$ (see Eq.8).

4. What is the space / dimensionality of $d$ (the input examples). You can be general. Specifically, do Equations 11 and 12 have a range equal to space of $d$, or do they output scalars? -- this question is tied to next.

5. Eq.11 & Eq.12: Can you clarify the input argument? Is $\beta$ a vector or scalar?

If the rebuttal answers gives me a homework to "read the referenced papers well", then perhaps it is very much worth making a "Preliminaries" section to define missing expressions.

### Summary
This paper proposes a method of aggregation based on Fisher information. The authors show significant problems in existing aggregation methods such as mean or softmax, and conduct several experiments to show that the proposed method does not suffer like existing methods.

### Strengths
- The paper shows significant problems with using existing aggregation methods.

- The experiments seem to show that the proposed method does not suffer from the same issues as using other aggregation methods

### Weaknesses
 - The experiments are not very convincing. While I do appreciate the simple examples, I think that additional comparisons on real world benchmarks should be conducted to truly show the effectiveness of the proposed aggregation scheme, also given that the authors say the proposed mechanism can be implemented as a 'drop in' aggregation function. Therefore it should be shown on multiple datasets and multiple GNN backbones. 

- Also, in the experimental results on the ogb protein dataset, the authors should compare with more methods. The results of other methods are significantly better than just using GCN.

- It is not clear what is the computational cost of the method. It is not discussed and not reported in runtimes.

- The authors say both in title and in abstract that the method is optimal, but it is not proven anywhere, and again the experimental results are lacking.

### Questions
- The method itself seems to be more general than just to be applied to GNNs. Did you try to use it for other types of neural networks? what are the limitations of the method?

### Summary
The paper delves into set-based learning, emphasizing the importance of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and DeepSets for handling complex datasets. The authors introduce "Fishnets", an aggregation strategy tailored for Bayesian inference and graph aggregation. This strategy showcases adaptability, resilience, and superiority in capturing Bayesian information. Moreover, when integrated with GNNs, Fishnets enhances performance and efficiency. This research positions Fishnets as a potential game-changer in deep learning and network science.

### Strengths
A large number of experiments are carried out to prove the effectiveness of the method.

### Weaknesses
1. The logic of the introduction part is illogical and too short. The reader does not understand what problem this article is going to solve and what the shortcomings of existing methods are. The authors do not emphasize the main contribution of this article and what are the differences from existing methods.
2. "Fisher" is mentioned frequently in the paper. The author should add a "preliminary" section to introduce what Fisher are to make it easier for readers with different backgrounds.
3. There exist a large number of grammatical errors and spelling errors in the article, such as:

- In "GNNs can acheive state-of-the-art", "acheive" should be "achieve".
- In "On one hand, frequentist analyses", it's better to use "On the one hand" for clarity.
- In "In a deep learning context graph neural networks (GNNs) rely", a comma is needed after "context".
- In "for predictive or regression tasks", consider using "for either predictive or regression tasks" for clarity.
- In "Up until now, graph aggregation schemes", the comma after "now" is unnecessary.
- In "This paper is organised as follows:", "organised" might be considered a British spelling. You might want to use "organized", the American spelling.
- In "In this paper we built up", a comma is needed after "paper".
