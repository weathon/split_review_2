## Abstract
With the emergence of neural audio codecs, which encode multiple streams of discrete tokens from audio, large language models have recently gained attention as a promising approach for zero-shot Text-to-Speech (TTS) synthesis. Despite the ongoing rush towards scaling paradigms, audio tokenization ironically amplifies the scalability challenge, stemming from its long sequence length and the complexity of modelling the multiple sequences. To mitigate these issues, we present CLaM-TTS that employs a probabilistic residual vector quantization to (1) achieve superior compression in the token length, and (2) allow a language model to generate multiple tokens at once, thereby eliminating the need for cascaded modeling to handle the number of token streams. Our experimental results demonstrate that CLaM-TTS is better than or comparable to state-of-the-art neural codec-based TTS models regarding naturalness, intelligibility, speaker similarity, and inference speed. In addition, we examine the impact of the pretraining extent of the language models and their text tokenization strategies on performances.

### Summary
This paper introduces CLaM-TTS, a novel text-to-speech synthesis model. CLaM-TTS combines several ideas from the literature into a single model trained on several large-scale datasets and demonstrates high-quality speech generation. The input to this model is text and the output is mel spectrograms, which must then be converted to audio waveforms using a vocoder.

The model consists of the following components:

1. Audio quantizer: They introduce Mel-VAE, a model for encoding mel spectrograms into a sequence of multi-dimensional discrete codes. The Mel-VAE decoder is used to convert the discrete codes back into mel spectrograms during inference.
2. Autoregressive synthesis network: A conditional language model is used to convert text into discrete codes. The language model is conditioned upon text (encoded by a pretrained network) and autoregressively predicts discrete audio codes. 

The audio quantizer is based on residual vector quantization (RVQ). Unlike traditional language models which use a softmax output layer to predict discrete codes, the CLaM-TTS synthesis network instead uses a Gaussian mixture model (GMM) in order to predict a continuous output, which is then converted into a discretized output using the Mel-VAE RVQ quantizer.

This system is then trained on 100k hours in multiple languages and evaluated on a number of metrics, including speaker similarity, MOS, and ASR-based intelligibility and WER, demonstrating competitive performance.

### Strengths
This paper has clear and detailed presentation. The models are explained clearly, referencing prior literature appropriately while providing sufficient detail for readers unfamiliar with parts of it to understand the paper. Hyperparameters are stated in the appendix and reasoning for the architectural choices is included.

The key contribution of this paper, in my opinion, consists of using a Gaussian mixture model as the output distribution of the language model, using the RVQ quantizer to convert this output to a set of discrete codes at inference time. This approach elegantly avoids having to build a conditional multi-level sampling scheme, which is expensive at inference time. 

The baselines used for this paper are recent and strong, and the metrics used to evaluate the result are also thorough and varied. Additionally, the authors highlight both successes and failures of their method, including baselines which outperform their model on certain metrics.

### Weaknesses
One of the core claims of the paper has to do with two-stage pipelines for coarse-to-fine-grained audio token generation: "A shared characteristic among these neural codec language models is their two-stage pipeline; they autoregressively generate coarse-grained audio tokens and decode them into fine- grained representations .... we design a language model that generates from coarse to fine-grained tokens without needing a two-stage pipeline."

The paper makes the claim that the continuous modeling approach they apply avoids this and yields improved quality. However, there is no side-by-side comparison which shows that. To make this paper stronger, there needs to be a comparison of CLaM-TTS with and without the two stage system. This comparison would demonstrate their point effectively.

Does scaling the model to 100k hours improve model performance? It is unclear from the paper if this is actually helpful. Similarly, does scaling up the model improve performance? Although scaling characteristics are not the main purpose of the paper, it would be clearer if there were some comparisons with smaller and larger models, to demonstrate that the model is able to take advantage of the scale of the training data.

### Summary
This paper proposes Clam-TTS, a new method that learns discrete latent codecs at a much lower frequency of 10hz compared to common codecs at 50-100hz. To do so, authors propose training a Mel-VAE model that predicts several "RQ" codes at once. Once this part of the network is trained, the authors propose to train latent language model with a gaussian mixture based decoder that attempt to sample codes that would match the ground truth. The codes are then passed through a decoder which outputs mel spectrograms. The paper shows that this approach can yield good performance comparable to SOTA methods on continuations and cross-sentence speech generation.

### Strengths
- Interesting approach to generating low frequency residual vector codes suitable to modeling in language models
- good performance on a variety of tasks
- appears to be grounded in theory

### Weaknesses
 - voicebox significantly outperforms this work. while this not necessarily detracts from the contributions of this work, the fact that it includes duration predictions and works on phones is not a great excuse as many other tts systems use this recipe
- the paper is quite dense and difficult to follow. claims such as parallel generation of multiple tokens are seen in abstract and conclusion but finding how this is actually done is not straight forward and the description of "parallel predictors" is obtuse.
- Missing references: one of the first speech discretization and speech vector quantization techniques was proposed in Vq-wav2vec (https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.05453)
- section 5.2: ablation studty -> ablation study

### Questions
- One of the central claims of this paper is that it manages to describe speech with discrete tokens at much lower frequency than many other approaches. While there is discussion about how lower frequency may lead to worse performance, it would be nice to see empirical ablations study of how frequency affects accuracy and performance of the system
- why are mel spectrograms necessary to obtain the desired compression? can you not progressively downsample raw wave forms to acheive the same effect?

5: You are absolutely certain about your assessment. You are very familiar with the related work and checked the math/other details carefully.

### Summary
In this paper, the authors propose a TTS model(CLaM-TTS) with a probabilistic residual vector quantization. They achieve superior compression in token length and allow model to generate multiple tokens at once. They evaluate the proposed CLaM-TTS in continuation and cross sentence tasks on English and Multilingual respectively. The experimental results show the model can bring clear improvements compared to the base RVQ and show its ability on both tasks.

### Strengths
1.The paper is clear and well written. The article also offers a comprehensive mathematical analysis of using detailed mathematical derivation to illustrate the probabilistic residual vector quantization of the article.

2.The paper completed a good ablation experiment, not only verified the speech quality produced with the RVQ used in the model, but also make comparison of different T5 model to illustrate the importance of pretrained language model.

### Weaknesses
1. Novelty. The VAE or latent diffusion models are not something new, and thus the overall novelty could be questioned.

2. Experimental comparison. The authors mostly compare their work with the outdated model YourTTS in English Librispeech, or without comparison in multilingual TTS. Thus, some competing models are better to include. The demos are too limited, it is recommended to include demo audios from other work for comparison.

3. Results. In most tasks, the model cannot achieve state-of-the-art results but claims that in the paper, and thus the performance can be questioned.

### Summary
This work presents a language model based approach to generate multiple neural codec tokens for zero-shot text-to-speech. This work proposed a probabilistic residual vector quantizer, which allows the language model to generate multiple neural codes at the same time, which considerably reduces the sequence length in modeling and speed up the inference time. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, in terms of naturalness, intelligibility and speaker similarity.

### Strengths
This paper proposed a probabilistic RVQ quantizer, which enables the language model to emit multiple neural codes at each inference step. This address the long inference sequence issue in the previous methods like Vall-E and audioLm. The authors have provided a detailed derivation of how the RVQ and latent language modeling, which is very helpful to understand this method.

### Weaknesses
It is not very clear to me why the probabilistic RVQ can lead to much compressed token sequence. For example, audiolm uses the 50Hz semantic token, while this work use a 10Hz codeword rate. It would be great if the author can explain or provide experimental results showing the effect of codeword emitting frequency.

### Summary
This paper focuses on the LLM-based zero-shot TTS task. The authors introduce CLaM-TTS, which uses probabilistic residual vector quantization for two main benefits: it significantly compresses token length and enables the generation of multiple tokens simultaneously, eliminating the need for cascaded modeling. Experimental results show that CLaM-TTS performs on par with or better than existing zero-shot TTS baselines in terms of naturalness, intelligibility, speaker similarity, and inference speed. The study also explores how the pretraining extent of language models and their text tokenization strategies affect performance.

### Strengths
- The paper is commendably clear and straightforward, making it accessible to its readers. All the training details are meticulously presented, contributing to the paper's clarity and ease of comprehension.

- While the paper adheres to the conventional structure of token + language modeling (LM), the introduction of the CLaM approach marks a significant innovation. CLaM addresses two critical issues in the field, demonstrating sufficient novelty and contributing meaningfully to the existing body of research.

- The experiments conducted are comprehensive, effectively demonstrating the efficacy of the proposed methods. The completeness of these experiments lends credibility to the findings and supports the conclusions drawn in the paper.

- In terms of RTF, the CLaM-TTS model exhibits superior speed compared to the Voicebox and Vall-E TTS models. This enhanced performance highlights the advantages of the proposed approach.

### Weaknesses
It's commendable that the paper is well-organized and well-written, making it accessible and comprehensible to its audience. I don't have a comment on the weakness.

### Questions
- It's mentioned by the authors that different codeword rates can be compared. Including a detailed analysis of the tradeoff between RTF and performance in relation to varying codeword rates would greatly enhance the paper. Such an analysis would provide a clearer understanding of how changes in codeword rate impact both the efficiency and effectiveness of the model, offering valuable insights for optimizing model performance in practical applications.
