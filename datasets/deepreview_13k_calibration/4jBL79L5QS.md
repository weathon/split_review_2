## Abstract
Selecting efficient routes for data packets is an essential task in computer networking. Given the dynamic of today’s network traffic, the optimal route varies greatly with the current network state. Despite the wealth of existing techniques, Traffic Engineering in networks with changing conditions is still a largely unsolved problem. Recent work aims at replacing Traffic Engineering heuristics with Reinforcement Learning, but does not provide a reference framework for training and evaluating under realistic network conditions in a reproducible manner. We fill this gap by casting distributed Traffic Engineering as a Swarm Markov Decision Process, and introducing a training and evaluation framework powered by a faithful network simulation engine that implements it. We show the effectiveness and versatility of our framework on a variety of scenarios, including ones where the agents outperform popular shortest-path routing algorithms.

### Summary
The paper proposes a new benchmark for evaluating reinforcement learning (RL) methods for traffic engineering in computer networks. The key ideas and contributions are:
1.	Framing distributed traffic engineering as a Swarm Markov Decision Process (SwarMDP) where nodes collaborate to optimize network performance. This allows RL agents to generalize to new topologies.
2.	Introducing eleganTE, a framework for training and evaluating RL agents for traffic engineering using the ns-3 network simulator. The framework includes configurable topology and traffic generation, and interfaces for training RL agents.
3.	Evaluating common heuristics like OSPF and EIGRP routing as baselines, and comparing them to learned policies including MLP and graph neural network (GNN) architectures.

### Strengths
1.	The SwarMDP formulation described in section 4 provides a way to train policies that can generalize across network topologies, an important capability highlighted in Section 3. 
2.	EleganTE in Section 5 enables training agents using a configurable network simulator, facilitating repeatable experiments.

### Weaknesses
1.	The SwarMDP formulation in Section 4 lacks details on handling heterogeneous action spaces and scaling to large network sizes. Specifically, the action space definition needs clarification on how individual nodes with differing numbers of neighbors choose actions, and how this scales computationally with increasing network density. The paper does not specify if the action space is a discrete set of next-hop choices or a continuous space of weights, and how this impacts the learning algorithm.
2.	The eleganTE framework description in Section 5 needs specifics on the implementation, particularly how network state information is extracted into the monitoring graph representation. The description lacks details on the specific metrics used to represent node and link states (e.g., queue lengths, link utilization, packet loss rates), and how these metrics are aggregated and normalized to form the graph representation used as input to the RL agents. The process of converting raw network simulation data into a structured graph needs further elaboration.
3.	Experiments only evaluate small networks of up to 50 nodes in Section 7. Testing generalization performance to 500+ node networks is needed. The current evaluation does not demonstrate the scalability of the approach to more realistic network sizes, and it is unclear if the learned policies will generalize to larger and more complex topologies with different connectivity patterns.
4.	The GNN agent in Section 7.2 shows high variance in some experiments, indicating instability issues. The paper does not delve into the potential causes of this instability, such as sensitivity to hyperparameters, training data variance, or limitations of the GNN architecture itself. A more detailed analysis of the training dynamics and sensitivity to initialization is needed.

### Questions
1.	Is the SwarMDP formulation described in section 4 able to handle changes in network topology within an episode?
2.	Provide more specifics of neural network architectures used in section 6.1 
3.	Explore complex benchmark traffic patterns and dynamics in section 5.1 
4.	The authors should explore algorithm ablations like reward function, network architecture, etc.

### Summary
The paper introduces eleganTE, a framework for the efficient training and evaluation of routing algorithms that are learned via reinforcement learning RL). The framework relies on the ns-3 discrete-event network simulator, which provides a faithful simulation as opposed to other frameworks that assess routing performance based on the abstract network graph. Furthermore, it provide a rich generation process for various network topologies and traffic patterns. On the theory side, the authors cast routing optimization as a Swarm RL problem, which in principle allows them to train policies on the node level that can generalize to unseen network topologies. The authors assess their framework on various diverse scenarios, and claim that  in some cases the learned routing strategy via RL can outperform the popular shortest-path routing algorithms such as OSPF and EIGRP.

### Strengths
1. The authors correctly identify the necessity of faithful simulations based on state-of-the-art network simulators, since these can better take into account interference effects, protocol interplay, delays etc. Their framework is built upon such a realistic simulator, which can better and more accurately assess the relative performance of different routing strategies. The proposed framework can be of high value to researchers working in the intersection of ML and networking.
2. The proposed framework can generate a variety of random network topologies (BA, ER model and WS). Furthermore, it uses the gravity model for the traffic matrix, together with small random perturbations to cover a variety of traffic dynamics.
3. The authors provide in Appendix D various ablation studies, covering the policy architectural choice, the reward function choice, and even the actor component design.

### Weaknesses
I have various concerns about the current paper.
1. The extensive experiments conducted by the authors seem to universally suggest that the relatively simple shortest-path-based protocols OSPF and EIGRP generally outperform MLP and GNN, and usually by large margins. The authors claim that in some cases the RL-based methods can outperform the standard protocols; as an example, they mention the predef4s topology in Figure 4. However, even though the packet delay is indeed slightly lower for MLP in Figure 4, the drop ratio is visibly higher, effectively canceling out the packet delay benefit. Results do not look promising at all for random topologies, see, e.g., Figure 6, where the max delay as well as the drop ratio for GNN can be particularly high.
2. To me, the experimental evaluation fails to show how RL-based routing optimization makes sense in the first place. There is not a single setting, where MLP or GNN clearly beat the standard protocols in terms of both metrics. This inevitably casts doubt on the necessity of the framework. Is it for example possible that in practice shortest-path algorithms such as OSFP can easily adjust to the changing traffic by simply updating the shortest path based on the observed congestion, delays etc.? Demands contain a strong stochastic component, so is it possible that simply reacting to the changing network condition via the standard protocols is as effective (if not more effective) as complex and harder to deploy ML-based techniques? I do not think that the current work provides any encouraging answer (in favor of ML-based approaches) in this direction.
3. I am not sure that formulating routing optimization as a swarm RL problem is well justified. SwarmMDP typically assumes a swarm of homogenous collaborating agents. But is this assumption true in flow networks? One major concern is that for the relatively small network topologies (e.g., with 3-10 nodes) that the authors have experimented with, nodes may be better modeled as heterogeneous (unless the network topology is fully symmetric, as in the complete graph). For instance, a high-degree node is expected to behave very differently compared to a peripheral node. Using GNNs makes perfect sense, but the swarm assumption seems harder to justify in tis context.
4. The problem may be better modeled as a multi-objective RL problem, if we are interested in multiple metrics, e.g., packet delay and drop ratio. The authors employ a scalarized reward, but this seems quite ad-hoc. In Appendix B.4, for example, the authors mention that they set the reward scaling factors to specific constants, but it is not clear why that choice makes sense. Furthermore, in the ablation study in Appendix D.2, results are reported on a single network topology (predef5). This is not enough evidence to draw the conclusion that the reward function in the main text is generally better than the other reward functions. There may in principle be topologies where some of the other reward functions can achieve superior performance (with a good hyperparameter search).
5. It seems that no real network topologies are used. Furthermore, the random topologies have up to 50 nodes. I am not clear whether this is in accordance with the desideratum of scalability, or whether the framework should be assessed on even larger topologies for this purpose.

### Questions
1. Are there settings where RL-based techniques outperformed the standard protocols across both reported metrics by clear margins? If not, what does that suggest for the proposed framework but also for the necessity of RL-based routing optimization for communication networks?
2. Is SwarmMDP a meaningful approach, especially in the small network regime where nodes behave very differently (asymmetrically), depending on their position in the graph?
3. Would multi-objective RL make more sense? Can we be confident that the used hyperparameters and that the scalarized reward function in the main text are indeed the right choice for a wide range of networks? What about hyperparameter sensitivity?
4. Are the pre-defined topologies from real networks? If yes, maybe it would make sense to assess the framework on bigger real networks?
5. GNN seems to always suffer from bad performance. I am wondering if this contradicts the claim that the GNN has the advantage over the MLP that it can generalize to unseen topologies. In principle this may be true, but the results do not look encouraging.

### Summary
The paper targets the problem of selecting efficient routes for data packets, where optimal routes depend on the current network state which are very dynamic.

The paper contributes by framing the distributed Traffic Engineering as a Swarm Markov Decision Process, and contributes a training and eval framework - eleganTE supported by a reliable network simulation engine.Through simulation, the paper shows the effectiveness of the framework, and how it outperforms the popular shortest-path routing algorithms.

### Summary
The objective of this paper is to utilize a swarm reinforcement learning approach towards route optimization in networks.  The reward function is based on the delay incurred by packets, with a drop being considered as  maximum possible delay.  The paper presents empirical results over a simulator that shows good performance against existing approaches.

### Strengths
The  paper considers an important networking problem and tailors a ML approach towards its solution.

### Weaknesses
The multi-agent RL portion is poorly described.  It appears that the author simply utilize the multi-agent toolboxes available, with an appropriate state, action, reward functions.  As such, I am  not clear as to the level of ML related contributions in this paper.  It looks like a use case of an existing approach, with small modifications to the approach and the ns3 simulator appropriate the situation. The description of the state space, action space, and reward function lacks sufficient detail to understand the nuances of the approach. Specifically, the state representation seems incomplete, and the action space is not clearly defined in terms of how it maps to routing decisions. The reward function, while based on delay, does not specify how it handles the trade-off between different types of delays or how it is normalized to ensure stable learning. The lack of clarity makes it difficult to assess the novelty and impact of the proposed method.

It appears that the traffic, although dynamic, is essentially fixed for periods of time where routing optimization is performed.  Is this correct?

It is not clear what the full set of observations is.  Does it include the traffic demand on each node?  If so, how is it measured?

### Summary
This paper proposes an open-source framework named eleganTE, which aims to better solve traffic engineering (TE) with reinforcement learning (RL) methods in changing network states. The framework eleganTE fully uses the extension modules of ns-3 to provide realistic network environments. Based on this framework, the authors propose to use Markov Decision Process to formulate TE and use SwarMDP method to train RL agents for TE decisions. Evaluation results show that the proposed RL-based algorithm can outperform popular shortest-path algorithms.

### Strengths
1. In the proposed framework, eleganTE, authors use the GNN structure for RL-based TE framework, which can generalize to the previously unseen topologies, and it has the great potential to deal with some unexpected topology changes situations.

2. The authors use three extension modules in ns-3 simulator to monitor and capture the topology graph, generate realistic traffic, and simulate complex routing protocol situations, which seem to obtain more realistic network situations compared to other RL-based TE works using simulators.

### Weaknesses
1. Lack of novelty and insights. The authors use the RL-based method to solve TE and rely on discrete event-based network simulators (ns-3) to provide realistic network environment, which is widely explored in existing RL-based TE works, and it is not a new idea. Also, the authors list the requirements of TE that eleganTE solves in section 3, and they are also widely-known features in modern TE systems, which are not new insights. The three extension modules of ns-3 seem to be the new features in eleganTE compared to other RL-based TE works, but these features are only used to provide a realistic network environment, and they are irrelevant to the TE solution itself.

2. The motivation of the proposed methods is unclear. In section 4, the authors mention eleganTE uses MDP to formulate TE, but do not describe what this new formulation is and why it is superior to existing TE formulation ways. In addition, the time-slicing method that the authors proposed is also common in TE systems. Also, when the authors introduce SwarMDP to the framework, they do not mention the structure and advantages of SwarMDP, and the reason why it is superior to the existing methods.

3. Lack of comparison with the state-of-the-art RL-based TE works. The authors only compare eleganTE with the most naive TE methods, such as OSPF and EIGRP. As the authors have mentioned, there are a lot of recent RL-based TE works that have good performance, and authors need to compare them with these works to make the proposed framework more convincing.

4. Lack of exploration of common TE objectives. The TE objective explored in this work is the packet delay and packet drop ratio. There are more common TE objectives in modern TE systems, such as maximum link utilization (MLU) and throughput, and the authors need to add these evaluations.

### Questions
1. My first question is the novelty of the authors' work and what new contributions have been made to the RL-based TE. The authors claim that they propose a new open-source framework for RL-based TE, but the method is similar to most of the previous RL-based TE works, which use RL learning agents to make TE decisions and use network simulators (such as ns-3) to provide network environment. The three custom ns-3 modules seem different from common RL-based TE works, but in the evaluations, the authors do not show the superiority of these modules regarding solving RL-based TE.

2. In the abstract and the section of TE requirements (section 3), the authors aim to solve the challenges in networks with changing states, but this topic and the proposed challenges seem to be well solved by existing RL-based TE works. So the authors may need to gain new insights and propose relevant inspiring solutions.

3. I am also very confused about the formulation of the RL-based TE algorithm itself. First, the authors propose a new formulation for TE, named Markov Decision Process, without describing its detail and explaining why it is superior to existing TE formulations. Also, the advantages of SwarMDP over other RL algorithms are not explained in detail.

4. In the evaluations, I think the authors mainly need to compare other state-of-the-art RL algorithms or compare the realistic TE results with and without using the proposed framework, but they both lack in the authors' paper. Instead, the authors compare naive OSPF and state the proposed framework can outperform OSPF both in the abstract and conclusion. In addition, when it comes to the traditional TE method, MPLS methods seem to be superior to naive OSPF, the authors should also compare with it if they mainly want to compare traditional methods.

5. The last issue I want to mention is similar to what I have stated in the Weaknesses part, that is, minimizing MLU and maximizing throughput are more common TE objectives in modern systems. The authors may also need to evaluate these objectives.
