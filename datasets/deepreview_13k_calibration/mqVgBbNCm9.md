## Abstract
This work aims at decreasing the end-to-end generation latency of large language models (LLMs). One of the major causes of the high generation latency is the sequential decoding approach adopted by almost all state-of-the-art LLMs. In this work, motivated by the 
  thinking and writing process of humans, we propose \emph{\method{} (\methodshort{})}, which first guides  LLMs to generate the \emph{skeleton} of the answer, and then conducts parallel API calls or batched decoding to 
  complete the contents of each skeleton point \emph{in parallel}.
  Not only does \methodshort{} provide considerable speed-ups across 12 LLMs,
  but it can also potentially improve the answer quality on several question categories. 
  \methodshort{} is an initial attempt at data-centric optimization 
  for inference efficiency, and \revise{showcases the potential of eliciting high-quality answers by explicitly planning the answer structure in language}.

### Summary
This paper presents a very simple method for reducing the inference latency of LLM. Given a query, the LLM first generates a list of key points, referred to as the "skeleton" in this study. Subsequently, each point is elaborated in parallel via separate LLM executions. The simultaneous execution of these runs reduces the overall inference latency.

### Strengths
- This paper is extremely well-written.

### Weaknesses
 - The core idea is quite straightforward: first list the key points, then elaborate each point. I am afraid that similar ideas have been extensively studied in the literature of NLP (if the authors search hierarchical text generation or planning for text generation or long text generation). Yet this paper gives no discussion. Below I list several references [1][2] (but clearly not sufficient).
- The proposed method only makes sense when the answer is long, decomposable into several key points, and the interdependence of these key points is low (because the writing of each point only sees the skeleton). 
- As a result, the proposed method inevitably hurts the overall coherence of the answer. The experiments in this paper also confirm that the proposed method hurts the immersion and coherence judged by GPT4 (Section 3.2.4).
-  All evaluation is conducted by GPT4 or ChatGPT-3.5. The results could be biased or misleading, human evaluation is required.

### Summary
This paper proposes a parallelization for answering questions with large language models. The core idea is to formulate the answer as a list of points (the skeleton), and then elaborate each of them independently with parallel model calls. This is limited to answering a type of questions for which such independent elaborations of a list of points are suitable. The decision whether a question is suitable can be passed to a router, which is an extension that the paper proposes. The parallelization brings about a speedup compared to sequential decoding, and the authors argue that this also mimics the way that humans think.
The method is evaluated for 12 different LLMs on FastChat and LLMZoo, and the results are discussed under various perspectives.

Score was raised after author response.

### Strengths
- It’s a good idea and well executed. It will probably inspire future works, as there are a few ideas that could easily extend the proposed method, e.g. for improving coherence of the elaborated points.
- For some models there are efficiency AND quality improvements, which is very attractive for practical adoption in the cases where questions fall into the categories that are suitable for the method.
- The proposed methods are widely evaluated, covering multiple LLMs and benchmarks. Especially having a large number of LLMs tested is helpful for gaining insights into variability and sensitivity of the models and setting expectations for applying the method to other models. There’s also a large number of analyses and more results in the appendices, which overall give the impression that the authors have profoundly studied the effectiveness of their method.

### Weaknesses
 - The comparison with human thinking is merely intuitive and not founded by any references, hence speculation. I do not think this makes the method any more attractive, and would prefer to see a discussion with scientific evidence, if this should be a benefit of this method. It is clear that the inspiration comes from how humans draft a text or the like - but this does not result in humans and LLMs functioning in the same way. The phrasing that LLMs are made “thinking in the same way” just adds fuel to the pseudoscientific discussions around whether LLMs are “thinking” or not (especially the phrase “pushing LLMs to think more like a human”). In addition, there is no connection between the argument of efficiency and human thinking - is it for efficiency that humans derive a skeleton first?
Missing comparison to previous orthogonal methods proposed for speedups: Where on Figure 1b would they be located? This is necessary to understand the impact of this work in context of the previously proposed and adopted solutions. For instance, techniques like model quantization or knowledge distillation, which are commonly used for inference speedup, should be discussed and compared against, to properly contextualize the contribution of this work.
- The title is misleading and alludes to a new ability of LLMs (“LLMs can do”): The actual LLM decoding process is technically still sequential and there is no modification to the LLMs decoding loop (not to be confused with non-autoregressive methods), it’s just that the model is prompted to provide a decomposable answer to be elaborated in parallel. A more concise (but probably not great for selling the paper) reformulation of the title would be “LLMs can be prompted to provide decomposable answers”. The title should accurately reflect that the method is a prompting strategy rather than a modification of the LLM's core decoding mechanism.
- The limitations of the method are not clearly articulated in the introduction: until Section 3 it is not clear that this method is limited to specific types of questions and that there is prompt-specific sensitivity. It might be obvious to the authors, but for positioning the paper in the right scope, this should be mentioned in the introduction. The introduction should clearly state that the proposed method is not universally applicable and is sensitive to the specific prompt design, which can affect the method's overall effectiveness.
- An analysis of the effect of added length is missing: Since skeleton-of-thought prompting produces longer answers than the usual prompting (3.1.1), there might be a bias of certain evaluations to prefer more wordy answers even if they have the same contents. Similarly, it remains an open question how the length part (“3-5 words”/”3-10 points”/… see prompt examples) of the prompt should be optimally configured. The paper should investigate whether the increased length of the generated text is a confounding factor in the evaluation results. Furthermore, a systematic study on how the length parameters in the prompt affect the quality and efficiency of the generated answers is needed.

### Questions
- How would Figure 1b look like for the LLMZoo evaluation? This kind of plot is answering the question for the speed-quality trade-off at one glance, so it would be great to have as well for LLMZoo. It looks like the model with the largest wins (StableVicuna-13B) also has the lowest speed-up for LLMZoo (3.2.2), so it would be nice to see if this is a trend more than for FastChat.
- I do not think that Figure 3 is very expressive, as it is an accumulated result across all models, which in turn (3.2.2) vary largely. Perhaps this could be replaced with a deeper analysis of the loss cases? This would allow the reader to get a better idea of the potential risks.
- The method reminds me of the map-reduce paradigm, but the reduce step is a simple concatenation rather than a joint processing of the whole list of answers. How much would a final “summarize” decoding step add to the quality and remove from the efficiency? I could imagine this increasing the coherence of the answers.
- For 4.3.1 the most relevant question seems to be which ratio of questions the router decides to process with skeleton-of-thought. This directly affects efficiency, since speedups can only possibly be obtained if the skeleton-of-thought route is chosen. Quality and efficiency both seem to be a predictable combination of normal decoding and skeleton-of-thought decoding quality and efficiency once the ratio is known. It would be interesting to report this ratio by category in order to evaluate if it agrees with the categories that were identified to work well for skeleton-of-thought in 3.1.2.

### Summary
This paper is about a prompt-based approach to speeding up inference of LLMs.
The work tries to address the problem by generating "skeleton," which is a set of simple answer sketches, and then based on the skeleton, a model generates answers in parallel.
The main motivation of this generation procedure is that, even if the resulting answer is the same (i.e. the same answer with the naive sequential generation), since applying attention over all previously generated tokens takes a lot of time and accelerator memory (quadratic to the context length), it may be beneficial to split answers into multiple pieces each of which can be generated in parallel.
Each skeleton point is generated via an LLM, and the actual generation process from each skeleton point is done by calling generation queries in parallel (in the case of models that can only be accessed via API) or by batching multiple prompts.
From evaluation, it is empirically proven that the suggested algorithm speeds up generation speed of various models, from 1.13x to 2.39x, across multiple question domains.
To address the issue that the suggested SoT algorithm cannot perform step-by-step generation e.g. chain-of-thought, the authors add LLM or trained model called router to determine whether or not to use SoT, namely SoT-R. Nonetheless of its simple architecture, the router module reduced failure cases where SoT underperforms normal sequential generation, in exchange of reduced speedup.

### Strengths
- Good empirical motivation: sentences of generated text may be independent to each other and thus the generation can be done in parallel.
- Good use of LLM prompts: generating skeletons, (some) routing models, and actually generate text from skeleton with small disruption

### Weaknesses
 - The content relies too much on supplementary materials. The manuscript is preferred to be self-contained.
- Overall, throughput given a fixed amount of compute resource may decrease, due to additional overheads due to skeleton generation and repeated prompts in each parallel generation prompt, since each of which will consume resource even if they are done in parallel.


### Questions
- As mentioned in above, as far as I understood this algorithm may use more resource than normal sequential generation. Do you have numbers about overall resource time used for a single generation? i.e. for API-based experiments it would be (skeleton generation time + sum of all parallel execution times) and for batch-based experiments it would be (skeleton generation time + (batch generation time * sequences per minibtach * number of minibatches) ).
- For router experiments, do you have numbers about the ratio of each instance being classified as "capable of being generated via SoT"? For example in Figure 7, StableVicuna-13B with SoT-R experiments achieved ~1.0x speedup, which means that most of them would be generated via normal sequential generation.
- Is naturalness of generated text included in metrics of automatic quality evaluation? The prompt used feels not very natural for me; since as far as I understood each sentence should be always start the "skeleton point," according to Prompt 2 ("... do not continue with other points! [Assistant:] {point index}. {point skeleton}")

3: You are fairly confident in your assessment. It is possible that you did not understand some parts of the submission or that you are unfamiliar with some pieces of related work. Math/other details were not carefully checked.

### Summary
In this work, the authors propose a two-stage generation framework, utilizing an abstraction-generation paradigm for parallel generation, aiming to enhance the generation speed and efficiency of large-scale models. The SoT method demonstrates significant speed-ups across 12 Large Language Models, however, it appears to underperform in tasks such as code generation.

### Strengths
1. This paper is well-written and easy to follow.
2. The idea is simple and neat, and it is effective at some specific tasks, e.g., knowledge and role play.
3. The authors conducted extensive and detailed comparative experiments on different models, datasets, and tasks. Moreover, they did not conceal tasks where the performance was poor, such as coding. I think this is highly commendable.

### Weaknesses
1. The main contribution of this paper is on the experiments part rather than the idea. In other words, the idea of this article is not insightful because it is very straightforward. Although I believe that skeleton can be generated in different ways, such as through a tree, rather than directly prompting the LLM.
2. If the purpose of this paper is acceleration, then SoT is not universally applicable. The experiments in the article demonstrate it can lead to a decline in the quality of tasks such as code generation. More importantly, because the length (autoregressive steps) of each point the LLM needs to generate varies, the actual acceleration ratio in online-serving may differ from the test scenarios presented in the article, e.g., batch size=1 or batch size > 1
3. I  personally doubt how much parallel generation of n points (i.e., SoT) actually enhances the user experience. 
Considering that people read from left to right, generating n points in parallel may not significantly improve the reading experience for users. Instead, we should consider how to accelerate the generation speed of each point. As long as this speed is slightly faster than human reading speed, users might not perceive generation speed as a significant issue, because they also need time to understand the information from the LLM.

### Summary
This paper proposes a method for speeding up LLM decoding that is typically performed sequentially using a two-step procedure: a) generating the skeleton of the reply (e.g. bullet points) b) expanding the bullet points in parallel through batching or parallel API calls using separate prompts.  Experiments show that this approach can speed up decoding by up to 2.39x and improve the quality of answers in about half the prompt categories & models that they considered based on Fastchat and LLM zoo evaluation. In addition, they propose a backoff strategy that allows to combine the best of sequential decoding and the proposed procedure which leads to better quality overall albeit at the expense of lower decoding speed of up to about 1.8x.

### Strengths
- The problem of decoding in parallel is important and worth pursuing with the widespread use of LLMs. In terms of originality, the idea of sketching the reply before generating continuations in parallel is simple and intuitive and a good implementation could have a significant positive impact in the community.
- In terms of exposition and execution, the method is described clearly and the experimentation is thorough as it covers a large number of models & settings. 
- Results show that the proposed hybrid method with the backoff strategy to sequential decoding can increase decoding speed by up to 1.80x and improve the quality of the continuations for certain categories (common-sense, generic, counterfactual).

### Weaknesses
1. One key weakness of the proposed decoding method is that the generations happen for different bullet points of a reply are independent from each other, limiting its use to answers that require chain-of-thoughts. Hence, it is applicable to specific type of replies and is sensitive to the instruction following abilities of the model that is being applied to, which limits its generality. 
2. The proposed method requires prompting the model with a large number of additional tokens to generate continuations for each different bullet point per reply; the number of tokens increases linearly with the number of bullet points. This has both memory/inference cost and latency implications that are not clearly exposed when discussing the main results. Specifically, the prefill stage, which involves processing the lengthy prompts for each bullet point, could introduce significant overhead, especially when dealing with a large number of bullet points. The memory footprint of maintaining multiple KV caches for parallel decoding also needs to be considered. 
3. When the method is applied without the backoff strategy its quality benefit is not very clear as the improvement is observed in about half the models and categories according to FastChat and LLMZoo evaluations combined. Furthermore, the fact that quality degrades in the other half of the cases raises concerns about the robustness of the method.
4. There is no direct comparison to alternative methods that have been proposed for speeding up decoding in autoregressive models such as quantization, batch inference, and speculative decoding. For instance, a simple baseline would be to perform quantization and then apply multi-stage prompting to improve quality for certain categories.

### Questions
- From 3.1.1, it is not entirely clear what is the overhead in terms of memory and or latency introduced by the additional prompting required especially for replies that require expansion of many bullet points with and without preflls. Can the authors quantify this? It would show a more clear picture of the tradeoffs involved. 
- What is the speed up of the proposed method for different prompt sizes, especially the large ones? It would be useful to show the  improvement for replies that require an increasing number of bullet points to answer. 
- In hybrid model case, do you take into account the time required to query the LLM on whether to employ SoT or not? It would be useful to show if it introduces overhead and to what extent. 
- Have you tried prompting the model to generate arbitrary partial answer segments other than bullet points to perform continuations on them in parallel? That could potentially make the method applicable beyond answers that require specific bullet point structure.
-  For the quality results in section 3.2.1, what is the average absolute scores achieved per category and across all categories overall when showing quality per model?
