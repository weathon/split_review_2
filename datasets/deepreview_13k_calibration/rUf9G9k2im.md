## Abstract
Generative adversarial networks (GANs) have made great success in image inpainting yet still have difficulties tackling large missing regions. In contrast, iterative probabilistic algorithms, such as autoregressive and denoising diffusion models, have to be deployed with massive computing resources for decent effect. To achieve high-quality results with low computational cost, we present a novel pixel spread model (PSM) that iteratively employs decoupled probabilistic modeling, combining the optimization efficiency of GANs with the prediction tractability of probabilistic models. As a result, our model selectively spreads informative pixels throughout the image in a few iterations, largely enhancing the completion quality and efficiency. On multiple benchmarks, we achieve new state-of-the-art performance. \\ \vspace{-0.53in}

### Summary
This paper proposes a pixel spread model for image inpainting, which iteratively employs decoupled probabilistic modeling. Specifically, this work combines the optimization efficiency of GANs with the prediction tractability of probabilistic models and selectively spreads informative pixels throughout the image in a few iterations, improving the completion quality and efficiency. Experimental results show the proposed method achieves a state-of-the-art performance on several benchmarks.

### Strengths

Good performance is achieved on several benchmark datasets.

There are several unclear statements listed as follows.

1. Please explain in detail how the uncertainty is obtained in each iteration.
2. The third paragraph in Section 3.1.1 is inconsistent with Figure 2. The input image x_t at time t should be x_{t-1} at time t-1, right?
3. Please discuss in detail the effect of the learnable function F in Eq. (6).
4. The authors state several times that the proposed method improve the efficiency. Please demonstrate in detail, e.g., the comparison of inference time.

### Summary
In this paper, the authors propose the pixel spread model (PSM) to gradually fill the masked regions of an image. Specifically, the model learns the mean by GAN loss and the variance by negative log likelihood (NLL). In each iteration, the model first makes the prediction, then picks the most valuable pixels to fill the region and leave the others masked. Experiments show that the method works well.

### Strengths
- The idea is novel to gradually fill the regions through the computed mean and variance.
- The method is efficient by utilizing the optimized computational resource of GAN model and the thoughts of autoregressive model.

### Weaknesses
 - Some parts of the paper is not very clear. For example,
    - What's the meaning of $y^i$ in equation (1)? Is it the groundtruth?
    - More explanation is necessary for equation (5). What happens when $m_t=1$ and $m_0=0$ or vise versa?
    - Is the uncertainty map computed only in the mask region or the entire image?
    - Why $\sigma_t$ is in the range $[0,1]$?

- Comparison to Controlnet is necessary.
- It seems that sometimes the model is hard to grasp some structure of the image. For example, in the last row of Fig.4, the result of Model A cannot reconstruct the structure of stairs.

### Summary
Authors present an iterative model for image in-painting, aiming at
filling large-holes with realistic looking areas. The model uses a GAN
and a Gaussian model to estimate an uncertainty term, which as far as
I can understand aims to find a covariance matrix that will minimize
negative log-likelihood of real intensities with respect to a Gaussian
model that uses the GAN output as the mean. Thus, this model uses the
covariance to account for the synthesis error. Pixels with low
variance are added to the current prediction and the process is
repeated until the entire empty region is filled. Experiments with
large-scale data sets are given.

### Strengths
1. A very simple method that gives really good results.
2. Authors experimented with large-scale data sets.
3. Results are very impressive. The presented comparisons with
   state-of-the-art methods shows that the proposed iterative scheme
   yields better in-painting than all the rest. Furthermore, it does
   it in a fraction of the time compared to the most recent methods. I
   believe these results are extremely promising, and if they can be
   reproduced they may have a substantial impact.

### Weaknesses
1. The training strategy is not well explained. Authors should clarify
   whether and how the iterations are taken into account during the
   training.
2. There are some suspiciously accurate in-painting results in the
   appendix - particularly in Fig. M7. Can authors explain how the
   proposed model can be so accurate? I can understand being
   realistic, however, the third column shows that the generation is
   pretty much the same. Similar in-apinting results are given in
   Figure M8.

### Questions
1. The in-painting results are suspiciously good in some
   cases. Can authors explain how their model can be so accurate - not
   just realistic - in M7 and M8? May there be a problem with training
   and test data leakage? 

I am happy to increase my score, however, first I would like to wait authors' response to this question.

### Summary
In this paper, the authors propose a novel method to tackle high-resolution image inpainting problems using an iteratively decoupled probabilistic modeling approach. In particular, given a masked image, the proposed method iteratively inpaints masked pixels by a GAN model, as well as the variance of the generated pixel. By keeping the low variance pixels the masked area is reduced. Then this step is repeated until the entire masked area is filled. 

The authors did comprehensive evaluations with other methods and showed that the proposed method achieves the best performance and is more computationally efficient.

### Strengths
The originality of the proposed method mainly comes from the decoupling of mean and variance estimation for each pixel. In particular, at each iteration, the variance gives a metric to select the high-quality pixels as the input of the next iteration so that GAN artifacts are reduced. Also, since at each iteration, the entire image is generated, the whole process is scalable to high-resolution and large-hole inpainting problems. The experiments show strong numerical evidence of the performance of the method. Overall the paper is well-written and solid.

### Weaknesses
Overall the paper is well-written and sound. I have some specific questions regarding the math expressions (see the sections below).



### Questions
1. In Eq. 1, does $\mathcal(N)$ mean the density function of the Gaussian distribution?
2. In Eq. 1, what's the relationship between the $y$ being integrated and the $y$ in the integral bounds? Are they the same or different?
3. In Eq. 1, where does $y_i$ come from during training? Is it the ground-truth unmasked image or the GAN-generated one? If it is the latter, it also depends on $\theta$?
4. Above Eq. 9, there seems to be a typo: 'filed' -> 'field'
