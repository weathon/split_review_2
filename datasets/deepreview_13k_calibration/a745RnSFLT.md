## Abstract
Zero-shot learning in prompted vision-language models, the practice of crafting prompts to build classifiers without an explicit training process, has achieved impressive performance in many settings. This success presents a seemingly surprising observation: these methods suffer relatively little from overfitting, i.e., when a prompt is manually engineered to achieve low error on a given training set (thus rendering the method no longer actually zero-shot), the approach still performs well on held-out test data. In this paper, we show that we can explain such performance well via recourse to classical PAC-Bayes bounds.  Specifically, we show that the \textit{discrete} nature of prompts, combined with a PAC-Bayes prior given by a language model, results in generalization bounds that are \emph{remarkably} tight by the standards of the literature: for instance, the generalization bound of an ImageNet classifier is often within a few percentage points of the true test error.
We demonstrate empirically that this holds for existing handcrafted prompts and prompts generated through simple greedy search.
Furthermore, the resulting bound is well-suited for model selection: the models with the best bound typically also have the best test performance. This work thus provides a possible justification for the widespread practice of ``prompt engineering,'' even if it seems that such methods could potentially overfit the training data.

### Confidence
3: You are fairly confident in your assessment. It is possible that you did not understand some parts of the submission or that you are unfamiliar with some pieces of related work. Math/other details were not carefully checked.

### Summary
The paper constructs (PAC-Bayes) generalization bounds using priors constructed from joint vision-language models. The found bounds are tighter than common bounds used for image classification with neural networks from scratch, which are usually tight unless data-dependent.

### Strengths
- interesting and alternative perspective on prompting and construction of PAC-Bayesian bounds for modern deep learning methods
- theoretical development well-written and easy to follow
- find that prompt engineering for image classification provides relatively strong generalization guarantees and almost no overfitting in practice

### Weaknesses
 - introduction/abstract somewhat oversell the paper and contradict later factual statements made in the paper (see issues of presentation below)
- linear probe significantly better than using the greedy prompt search as shown in Tab. 3, which calls the performance of the greedy method into question and makes it unclear whether one should even use prompt engineering in such cases then despite the tighter bounds 

#### Issues of presentation
- introduction & abstract dwell on the issue of classical deep learning PAC Bayes bounds, which are usually vacuous, unless conditioned on data. However, pretraining on a massive data set is rather similar to conditioning on data so I find this a bit inconsistent. I suppose it would be good to define data-dependent clearly if it applies to standard bounds but not the proposed one. Especially considering the likely case of data leakage into clip embeddings, claiming that the proposed method is not data-dependent seems inappropriate.
- title claims "understanding" but the paper did not really provide a new understanding of prompt engineering, I would argue, and the authors seem to agree with this as can be seen in the 2nd paragraph of the conclusion. The 3rd paragraph of the conclusion is much more clear and honest given the results.

### Questions
I am mostly confused about the claims made in title, abstract, and introduction and otherwise found the paper interesting. The two things that bother me are the question of "data-dependence" and "understanding prompt engineering".
1. data-dependent PAC-Bayes bounds would learn a prior on parameters based on a small pretraining dataset. This is extremely similar to the approach of pretraining a vision-language model. Would you disagree with this or see this differently?
2. I did not have the feeling to improve my understanding of prompt engineering from the paper but rather has brought forward many interesting other aspects, especially that we can construct significantly tighter bounds for image classification for prompt-based classification than training from scratch.

2: You are willing to defend your assessment, but it is quite likely that you did not understand the central parts of the submission or that you are unfamiliar with some pieces of related work. Math/other details were not carefully checked.

### Summary
This paper proposes a new method to compute the generalization bound: by utilizing a language model to construct the prior and posterior distribution in the PAC-Bayes bound, the authors get a better generalization bound for prompt engineering for Vision-language models.

### Strengths
The problem is an important problem: understanding LLMs and other big models is an important problem. Computing or adding more insight into the generalization of these models is also important. The methodology seems interesting to me. The presentation is good.

### Weaknesses
It seems that the numbers between the UC and the PAC-Bayes, and I feel like there is not too much difference (most of them are within a factor of 2 or 3). I don't think the new generalization bound result is significantly different (although the method seems interesting to me), since scaling up the data by 4 to 9 times can reach nearly the same generalization error. Maybe more results with more scales helps.

### Questions
Please see the weakness section, which criteria should be considered to test that a new generalization bound is significantly better? Also, is it possible to use similar ideas to analyze the (hard) prompt tuning in natural language processing? Besides, using the pre-trained LLaMA can improve the PAC-Bayes bound, is it some form of transferring the ''generalization problem'' of the prompt engineering to the generalization problem of the pre-trained language model?

### Summary
This paper uses PAC-Bayesian theory to obtain generalization bounds for prompted classifiers, particularly prompted vision-language models like CLIP. By treating the space of (natural language) prompts as a parameter space, and using a generative pretrained language model as a prior over that space, with a posterior as the delta distribution on the prompt selected by some search procedure, very tight generalization bounds can be obtained for the prompted classifier. These bounds are tighter than other PAC-Bayes bounds in the literature, which were obtained for different model families.

### Strengths
- Combining PAC-Bayes bounds with the idea of treating prompts as tunable parameters is an interesting and original idea that seems promising for obtaining tight bounds, since the set of linguistically coherent task-specific prompts is a limited "parameter space", we know from existing empirical results that this set contains examples with low training error, and pretrained language models provide us with a natural choice of prior over this space.

- The bounds obtained by the proposed approach are tighter than the bounds obtained by uniform convergence over the space of possible prompts and tighter than other PAC-Bayes bounds in the deep learning literature, including data-dependent ones (though those papers all consider different hypothesis classes).

- Interesting results on non-vacuous generalization bounds for prompts in the very-low-data setting (20 samples per class). Since prompts are a hypothesis space with a strong prior, this model family seems like a very promising candidate for obtaining strong generalization bounds even in the few-shot-learning regime, which has been largely out of reach. These results push us towards such bounds.

### Weaknesses
 - The proposed bounds are only evaluated on image classification tasks, but prompting and prompt engineering are equally if not more common in NLP for text classification and other tasks.

- The abstract claims that "the bound is remarkably suitable for model selection: the models with the best bound typically have the best test performance." Based on Figure 3, it seems like the bound is no more useful than just looking at the training error. But it's hard to tell because the points in the plot are not paired. Are there examples where using the PAC-Bayes bound leads to a different and better model selection choice than just using the training error? 

- _extends to the methods proposed in Wen et al. (2023)._ That paper has a much more sophisticated search method than the greedy search here. How do we know the resulting prompts are competitive with other search methods? It's less interesting if we're getting generalization bounds for a suboptimal classifier.

- >both training and test accuracy drop monotonically in tandem as we flip these training labels (Figure 6), which suggests that the prompts cannot overfit the random labels.

    - Either that, or the greedy search procedure just can't find a good enough prompt. As far as I can tell, we can't decide based on the evidence in the paper.

- As far as I can tell, the analysis doesn't actually suggest a useful practical algorithm. Based on Figures 3 and 4, if I want to find the best prompt, it seems like my best bet is still to just pick the one that minimizes the training error (using whatever search method I come up with) and not bother with SRM.

### Questions
- Does prompting the language model differently induce a better prior? For example, if I prompt GPT-4 with "I'm trying to prompt a vision-language model like CLIP to classify between cats and dogs. Can you suggest a good prompt?" it replies: "This image contains a {cat/dog}." So intuitively it seems like using the likelihood of possible CLIP prompts under this LM prompt would give a much better prior than off-the-shelf LLaMA, and it might also help with fluency. In general, it would've been interesting to see more ablation on the prompt used for the prior.

### Summary
This paper provides a PAC-Bayes analysis of prompt engineering and a simple prompt search routine. The paper starts by proposing a simple greedy prompt search strategy that incrementally adds tokens that maximise the reward sequentially with a regularisation in terms of the probability of the next token as predicted by a language model. The authors then remark provide a PAC-Bayes bound for prompts by formulating the prompt search space as a hypothesis, the LM predicted token probabilities as priors and the posterior as a point mass. The authors show that the resulting bounds are surprisingly tight, and explain the observation that prompt engineering does not seem to overfit massively even though it is optimized on the training set only.

### Strengths
- This paper provides much-needed theoretical support for the increasingly popular paradigm of prompt engineering, which, as the authors described, is largely empirical up to this point. The use of PAC-Bayes theory in this context is intuitive and insightful and, to my knowledge, novel, and I'd even be a bit surprised that no one has tried this so far.

- The derivation of bound, which is the paper's main contribution, is easy to follow and seems sound. The resulting bound is a massive improvement over the literature (although I am not extremely familiar with the literature in this area -- I defer a more thorough assessment to another, more experienced reviewer), and the experimental validation also provides empirical evidence supporting the authors' argument.

### Weaknesses
I'd like to state that I reviewed and participated in the discussion of a previous version of this manuscript at an earlier conference. The critical weakness is that, as the authors acknowledged in the latest manuscript, the validity of almost all derivations hinges on the assumption that there is no data contamination and that the encoder was not trained on the data that it is asked to infer (i.e., the setting is truly zero-shot). As the authors acknowledged, this is something that cannot be fully proved and disproved, partially due to the fact that what was included in the training data is not fully transparent and publicly known.

However, as important as this weakness is, I think the dilemma is at least not only attributable to this work, and given the relative dearth of theoretical works on this area, I still think there is value in this paper to the community. I'd encourage the authors to emphasize more clearly and explicitly the limitations of their work and analysis throughout the paper. A possible remedy is to pre-train and fine-tune a comparable open-source model from scratch where one can fully control what data the model is trained on to investigate the derived bounds; I acknowledge this may require an enormous amount of compute and some qualitative discussions would suffice.

### Questions
Please address the concerns above.

--- **Post-rebuttal** ---

I thank the authors for responding to my review, and I remain positive about this work and its value to the community. I will stick to my original rating recommending acceptance (the reason I cannot give a higher rating is that this work, as mentioned in the original review, does have strong assumptions as also acknowledged by the authors).
