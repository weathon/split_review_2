## Abstract
Large Language Models (LLMs) are becoming increasingly smart and autonomous, targeting real-world pragmatic missions beyond traditional NLP tasks. 
As a result, there has been an urgent need to \textit{evaluate LLMs as agents} on challenging tasks in interactive environments.
We present \model, a multi-dimensional evolving benchmark that currently consists of 8 distinct environments to assess LLM-as-Agent's reasoning and decision-making abilities in a multi-turn open-ended generation setting.
Our extensive test over \num API-based and open-sourced (OSS) LLMs shows that, while top commercial LLMs present a strong ability of acting as agents in complex environments, there is a significant disparity in performance between them and OSS competitors.
We identify the typical reasons of failures in environments and LLMs, showing that poor long-term reasoning, decision-making, and instruction following abilities are the main obstacles for developing usable LLM agents.
Training on code and high quality multi-turn alignment data could improve agent performance.

### Summary
This paper proposes a benchmark for LLM as Agents. The paper selects a variety of text-based benchmarks and evaluates a series of models on this setting.

### Strengths
- The paper proposes a comprehensive benchmark with evaluation results on a wide-set of tasks

### Weaknesses
 - The contributions of the paper seem very limited -- the paper does not propose any new technical insights and simply applies a variety of LLMs on many existing environments.

- The analysis is not particularly insightful and I'm not sure if the conclusions are fully accurate from the analysis. For instance, task length exceeded may just be due to the fact that many LLMs are trained on short fixed context lengths. In setting such as this, it would be better to first summarize the long context to keep inputs in distribution to the input LLM.

- Similarily, the fact that code training helps models is relatively well known. Codellamma performing worse than llamma 2 may just be due to weakness in the original pretrained model that the model is fine-tuned on. Overall, the conclusions in the paper mostly just follow the general trend of the more capable the LLM, the better the performance on the benchmark

- In the related work section, it would be good to also add some references to multiagent approaches to reasoning such as multiagent debate. Also age 2023 seems to be incorrectly formulated.

- Some of the references in the paper are incorrectly cited. For instance, in the intro, Reed et al. 2022 does not use a LLM to learn an embodied policy, a better reference would be [1]. Similarily, Ahn et al 2022 does not use a complex multi-modal simulator based off games but rather a real robot.

### Questions
1) Have you tried seeing the results of each method assuming a small number of demonstrations to fine-tune each LLM to each domain?
2) What is the sensitivity of the performance of each LLM to chosen prompts? It seems like prompts used for evaluation are very complex and it would be good to understand how they were chosen and how prompts would effect the performance of each LLM.
3) Can the authors come up with a method to try tackle all of these benchmarks?
4) Can the authors explain more why the chosen set of text benchmarks comprehensively evaluate the ability of LLMs to act as agents? For instance, why isn't there a benchmark to test multiagent interaction between LLMs?

3: You are fairly confident in your assessment. It is possible that you did not understand some parts of the submission or that you are unfamiliar with some pieces of related work. Math/other details were not carefully checked.

### Summary
This paper proposes a new benchmark AgentBench to evaluate LLM as agents. The benchmark covers 8 environments in 3 categories, including some datasets curated or adapted from existing works. The authors benchmark 27 models and show that closed-source API-based LLMs are far better than open-sourced ones.

### Strengths
- The paper is well-written and easy to follow.
- The benchmark covers diverse tasks and includes a well-designed HTTP evaluation interface. Overall it seems well thought through.
- The experiment results over 27 models could be very useful reference for LLM development

### Weaknesses
 - The benchmark seems to use the same prompt for all models, which might give an unfair advantage to the model where these prompts were developed for. 
- There could be data leakage to the tasks selected from the pretraining data over the internet.

### Questions
- How is the success rate calculated with the runs failed to complete?
- Which model does table 4 correspond to?

# After Rebuttal

I appreciate the author's efforts at making the paper much better.

Overall, I think the work does have a contribution, despite the weaknesses I mentioned in the review still exist. I will retain my score for the paper.

### Strengths
1. This is quite a unique type of benchmark, and could have profound implications for future LLM research or LLM as agent applications.
2. The benchmark captures a variety of tasks.

### Weaknesses
1. The benchmark does not seem to offer any insights for improvement. (i.e. If my model is not doing well on web-browsing, what should I do?)

2. The embodied tasks seem quite contrived. AlfWorld drops all 2d/3d aspects of the environment and could be mastered by a fine-tuned GPT-2 [1].

3. The benchmark seems to be mostly coding based. Non-coding LLMs could potentially still behave as good agents, but would underperform on this benchmark.

Overall, I like the paper direction. All the below weaknesses should be considered `Minor Issues', but I feel strongly about these aspects and hope that the authors would address them.

1. The use of abbreviations. I find the abbreviations "OS DB KG DCG LTP HH WS WB" make little sense to me. It took me a long time to dig through different pages to understand the benchmark. I hope the authors would re-format the tables for better readability.

2. Figure (a) is really hard to read. I struggle to tell the colors apart. I suspect that this figure is not color-blind friendly.

### Questions
1. Is there a high-score for these benchmarks? For example, human expert score.

Please focus on the Weaknesses and improve the presentation of the paper. I have no questions otherwise.

### Summary
This paper presents AgentBench, a multi-dimensional evolving benchmark that currently consists of 8 distinct environments to assess LLM-as-Agent's reasoning and decision-making abilities in a multi-turn open-ended generation setting. Extensive evaluations over 27 API-based and open-sourced (OSS) LLMs are token by the authors. The authors found that 1) while top commercial LLMs present a strong ability of acting as agents in complex environments, there is a significant disparity in performance between them and OSS competitors; 2) poor long-term reasoning, decision-making, and instruction following abilities are the main obstacles for developing usable LLM agents; 3) Training on code and high quality multi-turn alignment data could improve agent performance. Improtantly, the datasets, environments, and an integrated evaluation package for AgentBench are released.

### Strengths
1. AgentBench is a multi-dimensional evolving benchmark (Including 3 types of and totally 8 environments).  
2. The authors do a lot of evaluations (27 LLMs on all environments), and demonstrate many useful insights for LLM-based Agents.  
3. The authors kindly give a weight for each environment for a fair comparsion.  
4. The authors releas the code and datasets.

### Weaknesses
I like this work very much, from presentation to the solid work.  

If I must point out some weaknesses, I would like to encourage the authors to add more related works about the DB tasks (since I found that there are many recent works are not mentioned). For example, the three papers mentioned in Section 3.1 are from 2017/2017/2021, but the are many recent works study SQL generation, e.g. DIN-SQL/DIAL-SQL/TPTU [1,2,3].  Besides, the authors mentioned that "However, few previous code evaluation frameworks consider multi-turn interactions", but as far as I know, DIAL-SQL and TPTU are also multi-turn interactions with sql database (possibly with error feedback).

### Summary
The paper proposes a novel benchmark for evaluating the effectiveness of a given LLM to act as an agent in a specified environment. In particular, the current benchmark consists of eight tasks belonging to three main categories, namely code generation, game playing, and web browsing. Generally, each environment corresponds to a sequential decision-making problem, and, in some cases, the problems are best represented as POMDPs. The paper then provides a pretty exhaustive evaluation of many state-of-the-art LLMs. The results provide some interesting insights, including showing the status of the applicability of current state-of-the-art LLMs as agents and tasks where GPT-4 lags behind its predecessor, GPT-3.5-turbo.

### Strengths
The obvious strengths of the paper are its timeliness and significance. The use of LLMs as agents is a hot topic, and there is a need for benchmarking methods. The authors have put together a reasonably diverse and practical set of tasks and have put thought into creating a scalable and useful benchmarking system that new LLM-based agents can easily use. I would also like to praise the authors on the current set of evaluations, which is pretty extensive, and the authors have covered a lot of publicly available LLMs.

### Weaknesses
Now, coming to my concerns about the paper, my current worries can be broadly categorized into the following groups

Problem Selection and Quantification: The first issue is with the selection of task domains. The main motivating factor for the authors behind their current selection seems to be potential example scenarios where such LLM-based agents are currently being considered for deployment. While this can be a helpful metric, this approach overlooks an opportunity to curate datasets or even create random problem generators where you can accurately tune the complexity of the tasks being considered (quantified in objective terms such as computational complexity). This could have been done over the current task set (for example, one could quantify the complexity of certain OS operations by looking at factors like the size of filesystems, the number of files, directory depth, etc.), but it is currently missing. The current method of scoring each task depends on the abilities of the current set of LLMs being considered and isn’t an objective measure. One potential source for finding task sets where you can objectively quantify task hardness may be considering classical planning and logical reasoning literature. There, you can find many benchmark problems with varying degrees of complexity.

Dataset Collection: I was a bit surprised to find out that many datasets used in the benchmark were prepared using large language models, including GPT-4 and GPT-3.5. Wouldn’t this potentially influence or bias the results? For example, in the database task, data augmentation was carried out using GPT-3.5-turbo. This was also one of the tasks where GPT-3.5-turbo outperformed GPT-4. Is there any possibility that this is correlated?

Evaluation and Feedback Generation: In the two previous points, I have already pointed out some concerns with evaluation results. Now, I would like to bring up some other points related to evaluation. For one, I don’t know how fair it is to make a blanket claim that, currently, open-source LLMs fall behind closed-source ones when, by the authors' own admission, they only considered OSS models with less than or equal to 70B parameters. I would strongly encourage the authors to rephrase the claim. The evaluation and the benchmark also don’t currently appear to allow any form of task-specific fine-tuning. I didn’t see any discussion with respect to that topic. I also found the authors' choice to do prompt omission a bit surprising. While in the most general POMDP case, the full history of actions and observations is important for fully observable cases, can’t you create a new prompt where the current state of the task (along with any task specification) is fully summarized?

Clarity: Finally, the writing of the paper requires a lot of polish. There are numerous typos and malformed sentences littered throughout the paper, and the paper could benefit from thorough proofreading. However, the bigger concern I have is how the authors use certain terms and whether they imply technical meaning to them. There are many examples throughout, but let me point a few instances out. At one point during the analysis, the authors refer to incompleteness. Incompleteness is a technical term used in many areas of AI and computer science, including proof systems and sequential decision-making and planning. Are the authors referring to it in that technical sense? But then the incompleteness is related to the task, which doesn’t make sense from the traditional use of the term. Similarly, the term ‘turn-taking’ is usually associated with multi-agent games. While this kind of makes sense in the context of chat-based models, the authors use this term pretty liberally, which makes me think the authors may have instead meant to use it in the sense of multiple-step or sequential decision-making problems.

### Questions
I would ask the author to please respond to each question raised in the weakness section. I am particularly interested in the authors' thoughts about using LLMs in dataset generation.
