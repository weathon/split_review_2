## Abstract
Counterfactual explanations often become invalid if the underlying model changes because they are usually quite close to the decision boundary. Thus, the robustness of counterfactual explanations to potential model changes is an important desideratum. In this work, we propose entropic risk as a novel measure of robustness for counterfactual explanations. Entropic risk is a convex risk measure and satisfies several desirable properties. Furthermore, we show several ways of incorporating our proposed risk measure in the generation of robust counterfactuals. The main significance of our measure is that it establishes a connection between existing approaches for worst-case robust (min-max optimization) and robustness-constrained counterfactuals. A limiting case of our entropic-risk-based approach yields a worst-case min-max optimization scenario. On the other hand, we also provide a constrained optimization algorithm with probabilistic guarantees that can find counterfactuals, balancing our measure of robustness and the cost of the counterfactual. We study the trade-off between the cost of the counterfactuals and their validity under model changes for varying degrees of risk aversion, as determined by our risk parameter knob. We examine the performance of our algorithm on several datasets. Our proposed risk measure is rooted in large deviation theory and has close connections with mathematical finance and risk-sensitive control.

### Summary
This paper studies the problem of robustness in counterfactual explanations under model shifts. The approach introduced in this paper leverages the entropic risk measure to assess the model's robustness. However, the entropic risk measure is not practically computable, as it needs sampling across the space of shifted models. Therefore, the authors derive an upper bound for the entropic risk measure, which can be feasibly computed by sampling the input space around the counterfactual. Subsequently, they generate counterfactuals by using a counterfactual generation algorithm similar to the one presented by Hamman et al. (2023).

### Strengths
The paper studies an important problem in counterfactual explanations literature.

### Weaknesses
 - My primary concern is about the novelty and significance of the proposed method.
- Experiments are not very comprehensive. More recent baselines and datasets are needed.
- The paper is relatively well-written. However, it is not clear about the novelty or significance of the proposed method compared to previous work. The authors have included some experimental details, but they have not provided code for the paper.
- It is not clear about the connection between the proposed method and Hamman et al. (2023). Can we directly substitute the entropic risk measure with the stability in Algorithm 1 and Algorithm 2 of Hamman et al. (2023)?
- In Theorem 1, I acknowledge that Lemma 1 is a result of previous work. Therefore, Lemma 2 seems to be the main technical contribution. However, its significance remains unclear to me.
- The probabilistic guarantees in Theorem 2 are based on the assumption of Lipschitz continuity, and it might limit the application of this paper.
- Regarding Theorem 2, we want $k$ to be large to keep a high probability bound. Then, how do you choose the number of samples $k$ in practice?
- The proposed method demonstrates superior performance compared to ROAR in the HELOC dataset. However, in the German Credit and CTG datasets, the cost of counterfactual with Entropic T-Rex is significantly higher than ROAR. In my opinion, it would be more beneficial to report the trade-off between cost and validity instead of reporting these metrics separately.
- The authors should compare to more recent baselines such as RBR (Nguyen et al. UAI, 23)
- Some citations should be mentioned:
1. Counterfactual Plans under Distributional Ambiguity, ICLR22
2. Provably Robust and Plausible Counterfactual Explanations for Neural Networks via Robust Optimisation, ACML23
3. Distributionally Robust Recourse Action, ICLR23

### Summary
The authors study counterfactual explanations which are robust against changes in the prediction model parameters. To this end they propose an optimization problem where the costs of changing a factual instance x to a counterfactual instance x' is minimized while the risk of remaining a CE after model change is constrained to be smaller than a user-chosen parameter tau. The authors derive theoretical results that their proposed risk measure can be adjusted by the risk parameter to navigate between the robustness constrained methods and worst-case robust methods. Furthermore they provide a relaxation based on point samples around the CE which can be applied e.g. when the underlying distribution is not known. Finally the method is compared to other state-of-the-art methods on several datasets.

### Strengths
The topic of the paper is highly relevant and well-studied in the literature. The authors replace the maximum expression used in the worst-case approach by a risk-measure which is a new and innovative idea. The paper is clearly written and the results are proved in detail and are not trivial. The property of controlling the risk of the risk measure by the parameter theta is a nice feature.

### Weaknesses
In my opinion the paper has several weaknesses. First, there is no argumentation why the chosen risk measure is useful and why it should be chosen above other risk measures or already used risk measures. Specifically, the paper does not provide a clear justification for using the entropic risk measure over other established risk measures in the context of robust counterfactual explanations. The theoretical connection to worst-case approaches is interesting, but the practical benefits of this connection are not clearly demonstrated. Furthermore, the paper is not able to convince the reader that using this risk measure is an improvement compared to the state-of-the-art methods. While the approach provides a nice theoretical connection to the worst-case approach the experiments actually show that the SNS method leads to a much better trade-off between costs and robustness. While the SNS method has only a small reduction in robustness the reduction in costs is significant. Furthermore in the experiments there is no comparison with the most related method T-Rex.

Minor Issues:
- p.4 first paragraph: l is defined on M\times X but takes only one input M(x)
- Example 1 and 2 need explanation (or citation)
- p.5. reduced the risk -> increases the risk by the same factor
- p.7, something is missing in the sentence "However, in cases where our setup permits us to assume
that both the distributions of m(X_i) and M(x') characteristics"

### Questions
- Why is the chosen risk measure an improvement regarding the state-of-the-art methods?
- How do I choose my risk-parameter theta as a user of your method? 
- Why should I use your method while the SNS method provides much better tradeoff between costs and robustness?
- How can the costs of the SNS method (with l2 norm) on the HELOC dataset be smaller than the closes counterfactual point? The latter should have the smallest costs by definition right?

### Summary
In this paper, the authors focus on the robustness of counterfactual explanations to potential model changes rather than the data perturbation or contamination. Instead of using the worst possible model to mitigate the issue in the existing literature, they adopt the idea of randomization of a certain model by introducing a prior probability distribution P over the set of possible models. They then
consider the application of the so-called entropic risk measure, as a quantification of robustness for counterfactuals, to hedge against the model’s uncertainty based on their probability of occurrence.

Due to the extreme value property of the entropic risk measure (with respect to the risk aversion parameter θ), they build the connection between their model and the existing worst-case robust model, i.e., model (P2), where the latter can be seen as the limit case of the former when θ Ñ 8. When the prior probability distribution of model uncertainty P is unknown or complex, they propose to use the sampling of the input data around the counterfactual to estimate the entropic risk measure of the model uncertainty. Under some condition that the MGFs of the model uncertainty at the counterfactuals and the output of the original model at points chosen randomly around the counterfactuals are sufficiently close, they derive the so-called “finite sample guarantee” of the estimation of
entropic risk measure for the model uncertainty. Finally, some numerical results are provided.

### Strengths
First, they propose entropic risk as a novel measure of robustness for counterfactuals, which establishes a connection between the worst-case robust and robustness-constrained counterfactuals. The new approach covers the worst-case scenario when the risk parameter takes extreme value. Second, they propose a relaxed entropic risk measure which is computable when the distribution of the output of the changed model at the counterfactual point is unknown. Third, the probabilistic guarantees are derived for the proposed robustness metric under a class of model changed based on their moment-generating function.

### Weaknesses
I feel that the idea of relating robust optimization to convex risk measures is not new. Thus, from the technical or theoretical aspect, the manuscript is not novel. 

The main limitations of the paper are threefold. First, there is the challenge of obtaining the prior probability distribution (P) of model changes. Second, it is difficult to validate the MGF $(\tilde{\epsilon}, \theta)$-equivalence condition as it is too complicated in general. The last limitation concerns the reliability of the counterfactual for the estimated model (P5).

### Questions
What motivated the choice of the entropic risk measure over other commonly used risk measures, such as conditional value at risk, as the latter is easy to estimate and compute? Could you elaborate on the advantages and specific scenarios where this choice proves most effective? How about the reliability result of the counterfactual for the estimated model?

When the distribution of the changed model M is unknown, an alternative approach is to construct an ambiguity set, such as a ball centered at an empirical probability under some distance (e.g. Wasserstein metric), and consider a DRO model which may have a good
out-of-sample performance. Can you give some comments on this

### Summary
The paper proposes a methodology for computing counterfactual explanations that are robust to model changes.

### Strengths
- Relevant research question
- Novel and promising approach based on entropic-risk

### Weaknesses
 - Describe exiting methods like SNS and ROAR in more detail
- Only Neural networks are considered in the experiments. What about other classes of models? => ROAR method seems to be strong competitor!
- Lipschitz Countinuity is a very strong assumption -- the authors acknowledge this though
- Readability and understandability could be improved by describing the final algorithm in more detail and in a more structured way (e.g. using pseudo-code). Right now it is only described in textual form in the paragraph "Algorithmic Strategy"

While reading the paper I had a few questions which got partially answered in the end. Maybe those could be addressed earlier in the paper:
- What about the computational complexity? How does it compare to the other methods? (this is only briefly mentioned in the end)
- Are true gradients always needed? This assumes access to the model. What about black-box models? (also only briefly mentioned in the end)

### Questions
- Plausibility and actionability are also very important aspects in recourse -- how could these be added to the proposed method?
