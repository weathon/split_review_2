## Abstract
Decentralized learning has gained popularity due to its flexibility and the ability to operate without a central server. A popular family of decentralized learning methods is based on random-walk optimization, which is easy to implement and has a low computation cost. 
However, random-walk optimization with adaptive optimizers can suffer from high communication cost. In this paper, we propose to address this problem from three directions. First, we eliminate the communication of auxiliary parameters, such as momentum and preconditioner, in adaptive optimizers. We also perform multiple model updates on the same client before sending the model to next client. Additionally, we extend sharpness-aware minimization (SAM) to random-walk optimization to avoid overfitting on local training data. Our theoretical analysis demonstrates that the proposed method can converge faster than existing approaches with the same communication cost. Empirical results on various datasets, communication networks, and network sizes show that the proposed method outperforms existing approaches while significantly reducing communication costs.

### Summary
This manuscript aims to improve the random-walk decentralized optimization by incorporating the idea of local SGD, keeping local optimizer states, and adding SAM optimization. Empirical results justify the effectiveness of the proposal.

### Strengths
* In general this manuscript is well-structured and the problem is well-motivated.
* Empirical results on various communication topologies with multiple decentralized optimizers are provided, in terms of computation cost and (relative) communication cost. Some ablation studies are also provided.

### Weaknesses
1. Limited novelty. The idea of using local SGD with local optimizer states is quite standard in the field of federated learning and distributed training. The same comment could be applied to include SAM for FL. See e.g., [1, 2] and the related work section of [1]. The manuscript does not adequately address the novelty of combining these techniques within the specific context of random-walk decentralized optimization, particularly given prior work in federated learning that utilizes similar concepts.
2. Limited theoretical contribution. The convergence analysis only considers the single worker case, and it cannot reflect the convergence of localized SAM for arbitrary decentralized communication topologies. The theoretical analysis fails to capture the complexities introduced by the decentralized nature of the algorithm and the localized updates, which limits the practical applicability of the theoretical results. Besides, the statement of theorem 3.7 should be more formal, with a clearer definition of the terms and assumptions.
3. Limited experimental evaluations.
    * Some advanced decentralized communication topologies were not considered for the evaluation, e.g., the exponential graph [3, 4, 5]. Besides, the considered relative communication cost could be questionable, as it counts each sending of the model parameter as 1, instead of taking the network bandwidth / wallclock-time into account. This approach to communication cost does not accurately reflect real-world scenarios where network bandwidth and latency are critical factors. The evaluation should also consider the impact of varying network conditions.
    * The hyper-parameter choice should be justified. The manuscript lacks a detailed discussion on how hyper-parameters were selected and their impact on the performance of the proposed method. A sensitivity analysis is needed to understand the robustness of the method to different hyper-parameter settings.
    * A carefully controlled evaluation should be provided. The considered baseline methods cannot guarantee a fair evaluation, as the community has a line of research on improving communication efficiency. It looks strange to directly compare an improved random walk decentralized optimizer with the other standard-form distributed optimizer. The comparison should include state-of-the-art decentralized optimization methods that are designed for similar communication constraints, rather than just standard distributed optimizers.

### Summary
This paper proposes a communication-efficient random walk optimization algorithm for decentralized learning. The key ideas are: 1) Eliminate communication of auxiliary parameters like momentum and preconditioner in adaptive optimizers like Adam; 2) Perform multiple local model updates before communication to reduce communication frequency; 3) Incorporate sharpness-aware minimization to avoid overfitting during multiple local updates. Theoretically, it is shown that the proposed method achieves the same convergence rate as existing methods but with lower communication cost. Experiments on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 demonstrate that the proposed method achieves comparable performance to Adam-based methods but with much lower communication cost.

### Strengths
* The method effectively reduces communication cost in decentralized learning without hurting convergence, which is important for bandwidth-limited decentralized applications.
* Convergence analysis follows standard assumptions and provides insights into how the hyperparameters affect convergence.
* Comprehensive experiments compare with reasonable baselines, evaluate different network structures and sizes, and study sensitivity to key hyperparameters.
* The paper is clearly motivated, easy to follow and technically sound overall. Figures are informative.

### Weaknesses
 * Each component (e.g. local updates, SAM) has been studied before in different contexts. The novelty lies more in the combination.
* Missing References
  * "Can decentralized algorithms outperform centralized algorithms? a case study for decentralized parallel stochastic gradient descent"
  * "Asynchronous decentralized parallel stochastic gradient descent" where multiple local model updates is used in asynchronous decentralized training

### Questions
* Have you experimented with more complex network topologies beyond ring and expander graphs? There is a "chord network" topology in "Asynchronous decentralized parallel stochastic gradient descent" that may be beneficial.
* Does the algorithm work with dynamic network topology where each iteration has a different communication topology?
* Is it possible to combine your approach with compression of model parameters for further communication reduction without making the convergence rate worse?

### Summary
This paper proposes a random-walk Adam-based optimizer for decentralized learning in the setting that only one agent is active at each communication round. The objective of the proposed algorithm is to reduce communication cost while still maintaining acceptable learning performance, which is achieved by removing the auxiliary momentum parameter, avoiding transmitting the preconditioner, and performing multiple local updates. To overcome the potential overfitting issue brought by multiple local updates, sharpness-aware minimization is adopted. Empirically and theoretical analysis are conducted.

### Strengths
The problem identified is of interest. The paper is in general well written and easy to follow. The proposed algorithm does save communication cost compared with the vanilla random walk Adam algorithm.

### Weaknesses
This paper mostly combines standard algorithms (random walk, Adam without momentum, SAM), although this is not a problem, the theoretically analysis needs to be improved. Meanwhile, the experimental part lacks new insights except for some expected results.  

Major comments:

1.	Theorem 3.7 looks like a direct combination of theoretical results obtained by Adam without momentum and SAM. Furthermore, the proof in Appendix does not consider the convergence guarantee that could be achieved by random walk method. That is, the Markov chain is not considered. Note that the last equation in Page 13 is almost the same as the convergence result (Theorem 4.3, Triastcyn et al., 2022)) except it does not have the compression part. The proof also follows exactly as Triastcyn et al. (2022). The perturbed model is not used, means that sharp awareness minimization is not analyzed, which makes me question the soundness of Theorem 3.7.

2.	Since SAM is integrated to prevent potential overfitting, the experiment should present this effect compared with its counterpart that does not have the perturbed model. The lack of this experiment comparison would question the necessity of incorporating SAM in the proposed Localized framework. 

3.	The simulation only shows the loss performance of the proposed algorithms and the benchmarks, however, in practical, we would be more interested to see the classification accuracy. 

4.	The proposed algorithm is compared with FedAvg, however, for FedAvg, not all agents are communicating all the time, which does not make sense in the setting that FedAvg does not need to consider communication. That means, I suppose that if all agents in FedAvg communicate all the time, the performance of FedAvg might be much better than all the other methods, since there exists a coordinator, although the communication cost would be very high. The figures presented, however, show that Localized SAM is always better than FedAvg in the random sample setting in both performance and communication, which is not a fair comparison.

Minor comments:

1.	In Page 2, first paragraph, Localized SAM is introduced first and then “sharpness-aware minimization (SAM (Foret et al., 2021))” is repeated again. It would be better to revise it.

2.	Page 2, second paragraph in Related Work,  the Walkman algorithm (Mao et al., 2020) is solved by ADMM, with two versions, one is to solve a local optimization problem, the other is to solve a gradient approximation. Therefore, it is not accurate to say that “However, these works are all based on the simple SGD for decentralized optimization.”

3.	Section 3, first paragraph, in “It can often have faster convergence and better generalization than the SGD-based Algorithm 1, as will be demonstrated empirically in Section 4.1.” The “it” does not have a clear reference. 

4.	In Section 3.1, you introduced $\boldsymbol{u}_k$, which was not defined previously and did not show up after Algorithm 3.

5.	Figure 6 seems to be reused from your previous LoL optimizer work.

### Summary
The paper "Communication-efficient Random-Walk Optimizer for Decentralized Learning" proposes a variant of ADAM to solve decentralized problems in which communication exchange happens via random walk agent selection. The main contribution is to propose a variant of ADAM that only requires the exchange of the iterate itself as opposed to requiring the exchange of ADAM's momentum terms. This effectively divides the communication cost by a factor of three. The authors establish convergence results and provide numerical simulations to illustrate the performance of the proposed scheme.

### Strengths
The proposed work reduces communication cost of the combination of ADAM and a random walk procedure for information exchange by a factor 3 by omitting the transmission of ADAM's momentum terms. Additionally, to further save communications the authors have each agent run a mini-batch of tunable length K to further save communications. To avoid that this leads to overfitting the authors add a slight perturbation when calling the gradient oracle. The introduction of these modifications allows the authors to claim that the incurred sub-optimality, measured via the gradient magnitude, as they are dealing with non-convex problems, vanishes at the appropriate rate.

### Weaknesses
The work combines existing understood tools to provide with a new scheme. While many times such a combination is non-obvious, I would suggest the authors point out in the main text  the challenges faced in the analysis to obtain the final result.

Given that a mini-batch is introduced to reduce the communication cost by a factor of K, why is it necessarily the case that using this variant of ADAM which costs "1" to communicate  as opposed to "3" (original ADAM-based random-walk), better than using ADAM + random walk with a mini-batch size of 3K? 

From the simulations, it seems that ADAM performs worse on the training data set (counting only computations). Can the authors explain why this seems to be the case?

I would suggest the authors comment on the scaling of the main result with network related parameters, and how these compare to the literature, i.e. local gradient variance, gradient heterogeneity, number of agents, etc.
