## Abstract
Fine-tuning is an effective approach for adapting a pre-trained language model to downstream tasks, but it incurs a high computational cost. To achieve an extremely efficient task adaptation, \citet{phang2022hypertuning} have proposed to use an auxiliary hypernetwork to generate task-specific weights without any backpropagation. A hypernetwork can generate weights for parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) modules, such as prefixes \citep{li2021prefix} and LoRAs \citep{hu2021lora}, for any unseen task based on a few task-specific demonstration examples, at the cost of a single forward pass. However, hypernetwork training is challenging. Firstly, it is sample inefficient due to the under-exploitation of the dependencies between PEFT weights across layers. Secondly, it exhibits training instability due to the high diversity of few-shot demonstration inputs. To address these limitations, we propose a novel hypernetwork training approach, named HART. It exploits layerwise dependencies by autoregressively generating weights for individual layers, and stabilizes the training by regularizing the consistency between weights generated based on different demonstrations. We train the hypernetwork on a diverse collection of tasks \citep{wang2022super,sanh2021multitask} and evaluate its performance on unseen tasks. HART notably outperforms \citet{phang2022hypertuning} on both T5-Large and T5-XL models.

4: You are confident in your assessment, but not absolutely certain. It is unlikely, but not impossible, that you did not understand some parts of the submission or that you are unfamiliar with some pieces of related work.

### Summary
The paper proposes HART, which improves HyperTuning with two components: autoregressive parameter generation and local consistency regularization. After training, the approach can generate the parameters of PEFT methods for unseen tasks without further tuning. The results show that the approach performs stronger than HyperTuning in some cases.

### Strengths
1. The approach considers the dependency of the generated parameters across layers, and this is a good observation in my opinion.

2. The performance of HART outperforms HyperTuning even though the latter approach requires further pre-training.

### Weaknesses
1. It's unclear to me (and somewhat counterintuitive) why using Fusion-in-Decoder performs better than the continual pre-training (the first and third row in Table 6), and have the authors explored the performance of HART + pre-training?

2. I am not fully convinced by the experiments that the methods are evaluated on the "unseen" tasks. In Tables 2 to 5, what is the separation between the training tasks and evaluation tasks? Are the tasks that appeared in training, not in the evaluation tasks? For example, question-answering is only used in training but not in evaluation. I found the paper didn't describe the dataset split in detail, but I think it is important in understanding the evaluation approach.

3. At the current content of the paper, the technical contribution is limited because most components are either used in HINT or HyperTuning (Table 1). The autoregressive generation part makes sense but only this contribution is not enough to make the paper big and novel. On the experimental side, I am still unsure if the method with pre-training can outperform HINT, and the current gap is not small either. Also, adding pre-training on top of HART would make the approach pretty similar to HINT, making the contribution unclear.

### Questions
1. In Table 3, do you have the accuracy of using FlanT5 to initialize the hypernetwork?

### Summary
This work introduces a variation of the HyperNetwork-based weight generation. In contrast to previous approaches, the proposed method, known as HART, employs layer-wise sequential generation. To enhance the generation process, the authors have applied a local consistency regularization, which serves as a kind of smoothing term to ensure temporal consistency. Additionally, the proposed method incorporates a fusion-in-decoder strategy to operate effectively without the need for HyperPretraining. The authors have demonstrated the strong performance of this method even in scenarios where HyperPretraining is not utilized, specifically for T5-Large and T5-XL.

However, I have some concerns as follows:

1)	The level of novelty in this work appears limited. The main novelty relies on the adoption of layer-wise autoregressive generation. The local consistency regularizer can be considered a smoothing term or a momentum, and the use of a fusion-in-decoder strategy has been observed in various prior works. To underscore the novelty, it is crucial to conduct more in-depth analyses that concretely demonstrate the advantages of the layer-wise autoregressive model. Figure 3 only illustrates the training loss improvement achieved by the autoregressive model. It would be beneficial to compare the performance of each layer in autoregressive and non-autoregressive models.

2)	I think that the order of layers is another significant consideration for autoregressive method. While the authors may have utilized layer indices, these indices may not accurately represent the network architecture, particularly in cases involving skip connections or parallel layers. The layer index alone may not capture the sequential operations of the model.

3)	The analysis of local consistency could benefit from further exploration. Figures 4 (in the main manuscript) and Figure 5 (in the appendix) offer limited insight into the effects and importance of local consistency. Among them, the t-SNE plot appears to provide some insight, but there is a need for a more detailed explanation of the meaning behind distinct scattering patterns in weight space. A clarification of the physical significance of these patterns is recommended.

4)	In the equation for updating the hypernetwork, it is worth considering the inclusion of weighting factors between L_pred and Lcst. In cases where a model has numerous layers or a hypernetwork features high-dimensional hidden states, the update term may have varying impacts. Introducing normalization or weighting factors could help address this issue.

5)	While the proposed method exhibits significant performance improvements over previous works in the case of T5-Large, the gains are somewhat diminished in the case of T5-XL. It is important to note that this is not a critique of the performance itself, as it is understood that the proposed method performs better. However, it would be valuable to investigate the reasons behind this difference in performance. My guess is that T5-XL's increased number of layers may lead to challenges related to the layer-wise autoregressive model, such as forgetting or the layer index issue mentioned earlier. Addressing these potential weaknesses or limitations would be beneficial.

Overall, the proposed work demonstrates superior performance compared to previous works and holds practical utility. However, the main novelty lies in the layer-wise autoregressive model, and there is a need for more comprehensive analyses in this regard. I encourage the authors to provide additional insights during the rebuttal period.

### Summary
The authors propose a novel hyper-network training scheme, which generates parameters for different layers using an autoregressive approach, thereby leveraging inter-layer dependencies and stabilizing the training process through local consistency regularization. They conduct experiments on multiple large-scale multi-task NLP benchmarks, demonstrating certain generalization abilities and efficiency.

### Strengths
- Using contextual conditions to generate parameters in hypernetworks is useful in practice, while the problem of low sample efficiency in parameter generation in hypernetworks is easily overlooked. The authors approach this issue from the perspective of parameter dependency between adjacent model layers. A simple yet effective parameter generation scheme is proposed, utilizing an autoregressive approach that enhances the expressiveness of the generated parameters. 
- The paper conducts extensive experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. The proposed method is compared with multiple strong baselines on the S-NI dataset consisting of 1616 tasks and the P3 dataset consisting of 62 tasks. The datasets with numerous tasks can better highlight how HART can generate task-specific parameters that are more expressive.
- The paper is well-organized and easy to follow.

### Weaknesses
 - Due to the use of the T5 model's weights to initialize the hypernetwork, the structure of the hypernetwork is subject to certain constraints and cannot arbitrarily change the parameter sizes. At the same time, the initialization parameters of the hypernetwork (such as from T5-Large/XL) might significantly impact its performance. I am curious to see what the results would be if training a completely new hypernetwork from scratch.
- The large number of trainable parameters in the transformer-based hypernetwork contradicts the original intention of PEFT. Compared to the typical PEFT method, it may require more computational overhead.
