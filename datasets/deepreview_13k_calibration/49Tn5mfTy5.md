## Abstract
Many machine learning applications are limited not by the accuracy of current models but by the inability of these models to assign confidence to their predictions – the models don’t know what they don’t know. Among methods that do provide uncertainty estimates, there remains a tradeoff between reliable yet expensive methods (e.g., deep ensembles) and lightweight alternatives that can be miscalibrated. In this paper, we propose a lightweight uncertainty quantification method with performance comparable to deep ensembles across a range of tasks and metrics. The key idea behind our approach is to revise and augment prior information bottleneck methods with a codebook to obtain a compressed representation of all inputs seen during training. Uncertainty over a new example can then be quantified by its distance from this codebook. The resulting method, the Uncertainty Aware Information Bottleneck (UA-IB), requires only a single forward pass to provide uncertainty estimates. Our experiments show that UA-IB can achieve better Out-of-Distribution (OOD) detection and calibration than prior methods, including those based on the standard information bottleneck.

### Summary
the paper introduces the uncertainty aware information bottleneck (ua-ib), an approach to quantify uncertainty in machine learning. the ua-ib is positioned as a method that integrates uncertainty estimation directly into the learning process. contributions include theoretical formulation, empirical validation, and comparative analysis with existing methods.

### Strengths
1. in my eyes, ua-ib's primary strength lies in its innovative blend of the ib ansatz with a new practical spin. the theoretical foundation is well-established, drawing from the classical information bottleneck principle and extending it in a novel direction. 
1. the paper goes beyond theory, providing empirical evidence that the ua-ib framework can be operationalized. the method's capability to quantify uncertainty is assessed through a series of experiments, ranging from noise-infused synthetic datasets to real-world data.
1. ua-ib's algorithmic formulation appears efficient and scalable within the bounds of the proposed experiments. the authors' approach to model complexity, as detailed in section 4, suggests some consideration for practical constraints.
1. the robustness to data anomalies, explored in section 5.2, hints at the method's potential to deliver when faced with data deviating from the training distribution, an essential feature for real-world applications.

### Weaknesses
1. despite the comprehensive nature of the ua-ib framework, the manuscript does not adequately tackle the question of computational efficiency in real-world scenarios. while the authors provide a cursory overview of the method's computational requirements, they stop short of a full exploration, leaving the reader to speculate about ua-ib's performance in larger, more complex environments. Specifically, the paper lacks a detailed analysis of the time and memory complexity of the UA-IB training and inference phases, particularly when compared to standard deep learning models. This is crucial for assessing its practicality in resource-constrained settings.
1. the treatment of hyperparameters, although mentioned, is insufficiently detailed. the paper would benefit from a dedicated section that delves into how hyperparameter affects the ua-ib performance. For instance, the paper does not explore the sensitivity of the uncertainty estimates to the choice of the information bottleneck's beta parameter or the codebook size, which are critical for the method's performance. A systematic study of these hyperparameters is needed to guide users in applying UA-IB effectively.
1. the scalability of ua-ib is not convincingly demonstrated. the experiments conducted are robust, yet they do not encompass the scale of data that would be encountered in many practical applications, such as large-scale image or language processing tasks. The paper does not provide any analysis of how the performance of UA-IB scales with increasing dataset size or input dimensionality, which is a significant concern for real-world applicability.
1. the potential for integration of ua-ib with other learning paradigms or frameworks is mentioned in passing but is not explored in depth. the ability to integrate ua-ib post-hoc with existing frameworks is critical for its adoption. The paper does not provide a clear methodology for integrating UA-IB with pre-trained models, nor does it discuss the potential challenges or benefits of such integration, which limits its practical applicability.
1. lightweight uq for dnns has a long and colorful history. while i appreciate the dense context provided by authors and in particular the original tie-in of tali tishby's ib concept, a range of lighweight uq methods are not mentioned. for example, gast's probout which also offers a layerwise propagation version (https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2018/html/Gast_Lightweight_Probabilistic_Deep_CVPR_2018_paper.html), quantile regression (https://www.jstor.org/stable/1913643) and conformal prediction (https://www.jmlr.org/papers/volume9/shafer08a/shafer08a.pdf), interval neural networks (https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.11566) as well as the classic direct variance prediction (https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper/1994/hash/061412e4a03c02f9902576ec55ebbe77-Abstract.html). The paper lacks a comprehensive comparison with these existing lightweight uncertainty quantification techniques, making it difficult to assess the novelty and advantages of UA-IB in the broader context of uncertainty estimation.
1. code is not provided, only after acceptance.

### Questions
1. could you provide a comprehensive analysis of ua-ib's computational demands, specifically addressing its performance with large-scale, complex datasets prevalent in real-world applications?

2. could you elaborate on how hyperparameter choices affect ua-ib's performance, especially considering computational constraints?

3. can you share additional experimental results or simulations that demonstrate ua-ib's scalability to the data sizes seen in high-dimensional image or language tasks?

4. could you discuss potential post-hoc integration strategies for ua-ib with trained models and the expected challenges or benefits?

5. could you situate the ua-ib's approach in the broader landscape of lightweight uq or explain why certain methods are not relevant in your view?

6. why are you not sharing the code for reviewing?

### Summary
The authors propose to compress the dataset using a codebook and compute the distances from the codebook. The idea is to turn the training points through parametric distributions. Those are compressed in order to identify the centroids. The expected distance from the centroids is then used to estimate the uncertainty on the test datapoints. The authors show a few experiments in out of distribution detection and misclassification detection.

### Strengths
- Despite the method induces a significant drop in accuracy, it seems to produce better AUROC for misclassification detection (which is interesting). 
- The conceptual aspect of the paper looks theoretically reasonable and is validated through a simple toy experiment ... (see weakness)

### Weaknesses
Factual errors:
- Classifying Guassian Process Models like SNGP as deterministic is not correct. 
- The fact DUMs that apply regularisation and obtain SOTA OOD detection need to harm calibration is false. Works like RegMixup [1], AugMix [2] and PixMix [3] clearly show this is not the case. 

Weaknesses:
- ... however good performance on toy experiments does not necessarily reflect in useful uncertainties in real datasets, and viceversa. 
- There are several deterministic techniques that induces better uncertainty estimation, that the authors neglect. Besides the already mentioned RegMixup [1], AugMix [2] and PixMix [3]. These techniques add no parameters to the model. Furthermore the authors should consider other fundamental baselines from [0]. 
- The paper trains on a single dataset, CIFAR-10, which is extremely simple. While some of the baselines the authors selected are known not to scale beyond that (e.g. DUQ, which shares a few conceptual similarities to the proposed work, becomes unstable when the number of classes increases), others (SNGP, Deep Ensemble) do scale and therefore the authors should show extensive comparisons on larger scale datasets (CIFAR-100, ImageNet are the bare-minimum; when evaluating on ImageNet-O, please be mindful about the caveat indicated in [4] about the data imbalance). 
- Especially compared to the deterministic baselines mentioned above, the method induces an accuracy drop.

### Questions
- Could the authors provide more extensive comparisons with state-of-the-art baselines? 
- Could the authors prove their method scales to datasets of increasing complexity? This is especially related to understanding whether convergence can be achieved for larger codebook size that is inevitably required for more complex datasets. 
- Could the authors show how the model behaves for distribution shift? The drop in accuracy on in-distribution test-sets is concerning. 
- Given newer and more powerful architectures exist, could the authors test the validity of their method on models like ConvNeXt, ViT etc.? As these models are becoming more and more relevant than WideResNet28-10 (which is, by the way, extremely overparametrised for the task at hand).

### Summary
In this work, the authors propose a lightweight uncertainty quantification method. More specifically, the approach accesses the bottleneck space and creates a codebook of centroids for the latent representation; then, depending on the distance from these centroids a hypothesis on the uncertainty estimation is formulated. This is achieved by a learning algorithm constituted of four different steps. The testing benchmark is performed on CIFAR10/100 and SVHN using a Wide ResNet 28-10.

### Strengths
- the problem of uncertainty estimation is certainly of great relevance for the deep learning community
- the idea of employing the bottleneck space  to perform uncertainty estimation is intriguing
- the authors will release the code for reproducibility

### Weaknesses
 - it is unclear how lightweight the approach effectively is (compared to other approaches)
- the determination of the codebook size can pose serious challenges to the proposed approach
- the evaluation is performed on small-scale datasets
- only one model is employed for the evaluation

### Questions
- how is UA-IB compared/applies to recent works like [1,2,3]?
- how is it performing with other architectures, like ResNet-50 or to Vision Transformers?
- is the approach scaling to approaches having a larger number of classes (like ImageNet)? An experiment on ImageNet-1k would clear this point.

### Summary
This paper develops a method for uncertainty quantification in deep networks. The proposed method uses the centroids of training distributions in a compressed feature space. It is based on the Information Bottleneck theory and it operates on a codebook of encoders. OOD experiments are on detecting images of CIFAR-10 from the CIFAR-100, and SVHN  datasets. Misclassification detection experiments are on CIFAR-10 dataset.

### Strengths
The approach seems sound and clear. In my view, it has the potential to have a broader impact.

Paper’s proposed method is intended to detect both OOD inputs as well as in-distribution misclassifications of the image classification models. So, one inexpensive method is proposed to perform two tasks that are usually studied separately in the literature.

Paper is well written.

I am generally positive about the paper, but there seems to be important shortcomings.

### Weaknesses
Experiments are thin only on small datasets. Specially, for OOD detection, the setting used in the paper is previously shown to be an insufficient indicator for generalization. 

The methods used for comparison do not appear to be the most recent methods in the literature.

Literature review is weak.

------

The reported accuracy of the models appear way below the standards in the literature. In Table 3, the ultimate accuracy of the calibrated model appears to be around 93% percent. Is that a model trained on the CIFAR-10 dataset? If yes, then this accuracy does not seem convincing. The testing accuracy of a standard ViT model on CIFAR-10 is around 98% -- with no extra computational procedure. The accuracy of the misclassification detection method by Zhu et al for WideResNet is +97%. Why would anyone use the authors’ proposed method to ultimately achieve an accuracy of 93%? Could authors extend their experiments to models with better accuracies and demonstrate that their calibration method can improve the accuracy of those models? I would suggest downloading pretrained models from the literature, e.g., the models available on HuggingFace, PyTorch library, etc.

-----

The paper below demonstrates the inadequacy of evaluating OOD detection methods on the CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, SVHN datasets. Specifically, this reference demonstrates that when broadening the range of datasets, most of the OOD detection methods fail to generalize. Based on this, I don’t find the authors' OOD experiments convincing. I suggest authors expand their experiments to the setting used in the paper below and consider more datasets, e.g., iWildCam, BREEDS, etc.

Experimenting on common benchmarks such as Imagenet would also be useful.

-----

I did not see any reference to the misclassification detection literature, but I might have missed it. See for example:

-- Zhu, F., Cheng, Z., Zhang, X.Y. and Liu, C.L., 2023. OpenMix: Exploring Outlier Samples for Misclassification Detection. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (pp. 12074-12083).

-----

Overall, because of the paper’s approach and its broad view, it appears to me that having this paper in the literature would be good, even if the proposed method does not outperform all the other competing methods. However, it would be necessary for the paper to demonstrate its capability in comparison to the most recent methods in the literature and on standard models with good accuracy, models that are freely available in the literature.

-----

I found the discussion under Limitations and Future Work frank and clear, and perhaps a better explanation of the contribution of the paper. The statement of “The main focus of this work is ….” seemed more on point to me than some of the early statements in the paper. Overall, I think introduction of the paper could be more on point, emphasizing the broad view of the paper early on.

### Questions
Please see questions under weaknesses.

Comparisons are made with methods that are not very recent (as summarized in tables 2 and 3). The most recent reference that authors have compared with is from 2021. Could authors please explain their choice of methods to compare with? Authors might have a reason for not considering the more recent methods of OOD detection and misclassification detection, e.g., methods from ICLR 2023 – it would be helpful to explain why.

In Figure 1, the location of points in subfigures (a) and (b) are exactly the same. Is that intentional? Paper makes a distinction between the d-dimensional Euclidean space and the distribution space denoted by P, but it is not clear to me what is the difference between these two spaces, if the depictions of points in (a) and (b) are exactly the same. What is the job of the encoder?

On the choice of k and other inputs for the method: When paper states: “For complex datasets, usually multiple centroids are needed.”, how many centroids are needed? For example, how many encoders and centroids would be needed to apply this method to models trained on Imagenet?
