## Abstract
Information retrieval involves selecting artifacts from a corpus that are most relevant to a given search query.  The flavor of retrieval typically used in classical applications can be termed as homogeneous and relaxed, where queries and corpus elements are both natural language (NL) utterances (homogeneous) and the goal is to pick most relevant elements from the corpus in the Top-K, where K is large, such as 10, 25, 50 or even 100 (relaxed).  Recently, retrieval is being used extensively in preparing prompts for large language models (LLMs) to enable LLMs to perform targeted tasks.  These new applications of retrieval are often heterogeneous and strict -- the queries and the corpus contain different kinds of entities, such as NL and code, and there is a need for improving retrieval at Top-K for small values of K, such as K=1 or 3 or 5.  Current dense retrieval techniques based on pretrained embeddings provide a general-purpose and powerful approach for retrieval, but they are oblivious to task-specific notions of similarity of heterogeneous artifacts.  We introduce Adapted Dense Retrieval, a mechanism to transform embeddings to enable improved task-specific, heterogeneous and strict retrieval. Adapted Dense Retrieval works by learning a low-rank residual adaptation of the pretrained black-box embedding.  We empirically validate our approach by showing improvements over the state-of-the-art general-purpose embeddings-based baseline.

### Summary
The paper focuses on heterogeneous strict retrieval that may have increased importance in the context of Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) with Large Language Models (LLMs). The retrieval is heterogeneous in the sense that the query may be in natural language while the corpus may contain code, documentation, structured, and semi-structured text, or artifacts. The retrieval problem is also said to be strict because of the increased importance of a few top candidates. The strict retrieval may be important because of the limited context window and positional bias of the LLMs in RAG. The proposed method involves using adapters that perturb the general-purpose embeddings of the query (and in one variation, the corpus) to achieve task-specific improvements. The adapters, whose parameters can be learned using a small task-specific training dataset, add residual terms to the lower rank of the general-purpose embeddings for task-specific adaptation. The parameters of the adapters are learned with a contrastive loss. The proposed approach is compared with general-purpose LLM-based embeddings on classical and heterogeneous retrieval tasks.

### Strengths
1. The paper proposes task-specific adaptation of general-purpose embeddings using low-rank adaptation, which can improve training efficiency and works with little task-specific data. The proposed approach shows some improvements in certain tasks on both classical and heterogeneous retrieval.
2. The authors formulate a new problem named heterogeneous strict retrieval and explain why it may be an important aspect of LLM-based RAG.
3. The proposed approach has been clearly described with extensive details, which potentially makes the work reproducible for the community.

### Weaknesses
1. One limitation of the paper is the lack of baselines with task-specific adaptation. The only baseline shown in the evaluation is based on general-purpose embeddings, which may not be a fair comparison. Specifically, the paper does not compare against other methods that fine-tune or adapt embeddings for specific retrieval tasks. This makes it difficult to assess the true advantage of the proposed adapter approach. For example, it would be beneficial to compare against methods that use contrastive learning or other techniques to adapt embeddings for retrieval.
2. The paper claims to enable improved heterogeneous and strict retrieval, but it was not clear to me from the experimental results whether the improvement in strict retrieval has been substantiated with evidence. While the paper argues that the method is designed for strict retrieval, the evaluation does not provide a clear analysis of how the proposed approach performs specifically on top-k retrieval, where k is very small (e.g., k=1, 2, or 3). The paper should include a more detailed analysis of the performance at very small values of k to support the claim of improved strict retrieval.
3. The improvements resulting from the proposed methodology appear limited in some instances, and it even underperforms compared to the baseline in the cases of FiQA and CONALA. The fact that the proposed method does not consistently outperform the baseline across all datasets raises concerns about its general applicability. The paper should provide a more detailed analysis of why the method fails in these cases and what factors might influence its performance.

### Questions
1. How does the proposed approach improve strict retrieval compared to baselines? How do the experimental results support this improvement?
2. How is the dimension size of h selected? It was mentioned that h ranges from 16 to 128, but I could not find a discussion on this in the experiments. What are the pros and cons of choosing higher or lower values for h?

### Summary
This work addresses the problem of highly accurate retrieval of a small number of text documents from a relatively small corpus when the query and the corpus are from different domains. It is motivated by the recent interest in retrieval-augmented generation applications involving LLMs where a small number of highly relevant documents are used to provide additional context to the generative task specified by the query. The work argues that classical document retrieval methods are not useful for such applications due to domain mismatch between the query and the corpus, task specificity of retrieval and stricter requirement for retrieval efficacy in the top retrieval results. The work assumes that in such applications, the target corpus is of small size (a few thousand documents) and that a limited number of examples of "good" retrievals (a few thousand) are available for this corpus.

It proposes a solution to the problem that consists of transforming pretrained embeddings for the query and corpus documents. Specifically, the work proposes to do a parameter efficient finetuning of pretrained embeddings without accessing the weights of the pretrained embedding model and using only a small sized tuning data set that consists of examples of "good" retrievals. Towards this the work proposes augmenting the pretrained embedding model with small adapter models that can learnt from the small tuning data set. Given the query (document), the adapters compute a perturbation vector by looking up a learnable dictionary which is then added to the pretrained embedding of the query (document). 

The dictionary used for softmaxed lookup is small in size and learnt from the tuning data set (consisting of examples of "good" retrievals). The dictionary is learnt by enforcing that the perturbed/adapted embedding of q is closer to that of c than to global hard negatives for q in the corpus.

The work presents results from an experimental study to evaluate the value added by the proposed method on  five relatively small BEIR Datasets. It employs OPENAI ADA embeddings as the baseline retrieval system as well as the pretrained black-box embedding for adaptation. Retrieval efficacy is measured using NDCG @1, 3, 5 and 10. Though adaptation seems to improve retrieval performance in some cases, there is no clear winner. In some cases adapting only query embedding seems to be better, in some other cases adapting both query and corpus embeddings seems to be better (SciFact) and in other cases not adapting seems to be better (FiQA). The differences in gains are attributed to the differences in alignment of the notion of semantic similarity learnt by OPENAI ADA with what is intended in the benchmarks." However, there is no detailed analysis of the errors to validate this hypothesis.

The work also presents results from another experimental study on retrieval tasks involving natural language queries and corpus of code fragments. The gains are impressive on one dataset (SMCALFLOW), positive but marginal on another (BASH) and negative on the third (CONALA).

### Strengths
1. The problem of task specific fine tuning of retrieval models is very interesting and important. The specific setting in which the problem is being attempted to solve, i.e. treating pretrained embedding model as black box is also interesting. The line of attack using learnable dictionary-based light weight adapters is very interesting. It doesn't need access to the weights of the pretrained embedding model and pretraining embedding model need not be retrained.

2. Adaptation is not computationally intensive and can be done on simple hardware.

3. Adaptation can be attempted with relatively small sized tuning data set.

### Weaknesses
1. Though the pretrained embedding model is treated as a black box, adaptation is still strictly tied to the specific pretrained embedding model and needs to be done separately for each pretrained embedding model. As the pretrained embedding model changes over time due to retraining/continual updating, the adapters also need to be retrained. 

2. The work assumes that in many applications, the target corpus is of small size (a few thousand documents) and that a limited number of examples of "good" retrievals (a few thousand) are available for this corpus. This is however a restrictive assumption. Typically the corpus is several orders larger in size than the available number of "good" retrievals. 

3. Improvements in retrieval efficacy is not impressive. The proposed approach is not a clear winner always. It is also clear what is the best improvement one can hope to get from this line of attack. Is the lack of large training data sets the major hurdle for significant further improvement or there are inherent limitations in the methodology? Even if large amount of training data were available, the global hard negatives idea employed would not work as is.

4. There is no study of the improvement brought by the proposed adapter-based retrieval approach to RAG tasks.

### Questions
1. What is the architecture for the adders? 


2. "current state of the adapted model" -> art


3. Several references are repeated. 


4. "The typical values we use for h range from 16 to 128."

5. What is the value of h in the experiments? Is it fixed for all data sets? How was the value chosen?

### Summary
The paper proposes to learn a residual term on top of the embedding obtained by a black-box model to steer similarity towards a task-specific notion. The residual term is obtained by a smooth dictionary lookup through a single-layer attention mechanism and trained using pairs of queries and relevant documents. Experiments show that this can improve nDCG over the original embeddings.

### Strengths
- The paper discusses the interesting problem of task-specific adaptation of pre-trained general-purpose embeddings with practical relevance due to the increasing popularity of proprietary black-box models.

### Weaknesses
 - The paper lacks a clear and consistent description of the experimental methodology, and many design choices are motivated at best by anecdotal evidence. In particular: 
  - There is no specification of the data sets used to tune the hyperparameters (e.g., the dimensions, but also $\gamma$, which I assume is part of the loss?) and the metric used for optimization during the grid search. It is unclear if a separate development set was used, or if the hyperparameters were tuned on the test set, which would invalidate the results. 
  - It is noted that using batch-local instead of global negative examples leads to worse results, but no performance number is given for this approach. Furthermore, it is not clear how the global negatives are selected, and if they are selected randomly or using a more sophisticated approach such as hard negative mining.
  - There is a high-level description of a loss function (should be zero if the positive example is closer than the negative), but no concrete instantiation in the form of a formula is given. It is also unclear if the loss is averaged over the batch or if a different aggregation method is used.
  - The subtitle of Table 2 mentions SBert, but its results are not shown further because they are "uniformly worse than those for OpenAI embeddings". It would be interesting (1) to see figures showing this, and (2) to find out if the presented method also works for worse base embeddings.
- The paper lacks a comparison of competing methods, and its distinction from related work is not very precise. In particular, I would expect
  - a baseline that trains the embeddings immediately after initialization with those obtained via the API. My intuition would be that this might lead to worse generalization, but since the evaluation datasets are narrow in domain, this might not be a problem at all.
  - Approaches from the field of learning to rank / neural rerankers, which are state of the art in information retrieval in similarly sized candidate ranking tasks (usually obtained from a first sparse retrieval stage), see e.g. [Craswell22]
  - A comparison with adaptive similarity methods as they are investigated in the field of similarity search, e.g. [Seidl97].

- The experimental setup seems to contradict itself.
>  We carried out our experiments on regular laptops and desktops, and used no special purpose hardware for training or inference except for the black-box rest API calls to the OpenAI embedding endpoint.

vs. 

> To be precise, for our experiments over ADDER & ADDER2, we use a virtual machine with a single Nvidia K80 GPU (with 24GiB of vRAM), 4 CPU cores and 28 GB of RAM

- The tables would be more readable if the numbers of competing approaches were next to each other (e.g. by having column groups for each k=1,3,5,10 value and the approaches next to each other).

- Minor comments:
  - page 7, first paragraph, there is a typo "retrivers"

### Summary
This paper proposes an adapter-based method to adapt the existing LLM for information retrieval. A small adapter is trained with a small number of examples. In addition, a transformation is applied to the query representation and to the document representation before calculating their similarity. The proposed method is tested on several small IR datasets as well as code-retrieval datasets. The results show that the adapter-based approach can improve the performance on some of the datasets, while degrades the performance on some others.

### Strengths
The paper is relatively well written. The idea of adapter-based approach is well motivated.
The paper presents an interesting idea of adapter for dense IR. Although adapter has been proposed in previous studies for other purposes, it has not been widely used for IR. An adapter can indeed be an interesting solution to create an adapted dense retriever without having to fine-tune a LLM.
The experiments show improvements on some datasets.

### Weaknesses
While the idea of adapter is interesting, a key problem of the paper is that it fails to demonstrate that it can improve IR performance. As the experimental results show, the method can only improve on some of the datasets. The advantage of the method is not demonstrated.
The experiments have been carried out on small datasets. The authors argue that retrieval on a small dataset is a particular problem that warrants more explorations. It is unclear why this is the case, and why a retriever that works on large datasets may not be directly applied to small datasets.
The authors also argue that the existing investigations in IR have focused on large ranked lists, and this paper target small ranked lists (considered to be more strict). Again, it is unclear why this size of output is a particular problem. In many previous studies, evaluations have looked at not only tok-K with large K, but also top-K with small K (NDCG@1, NDCG@5, ...). They are not so different from the measures used in this paper. In addition, the paper does not propose a specific method for retrieving only a few documents. So, the difference between large and small K is not so important, and the difference (if any) is not addressed in the paper.
The authors only compared the proposed method with a basic LLM-based retriever. The latter may not be a state of the art of IR. It would be interesting to compare with other baselines such as ANCE and DPR. It would be interesting to also compare the adapter-based method with a fine-tuning-based method. I understand that fine-tuning a LLM with limited examples may not be easy to do or may not be effective. However, to support the argument that adapter is a better solution than fine-tuning, the comparison may be useful.
There may be more analysis of the experimental results. The results are mitigated. Although some possible explanations are provided, one still wonder why improvements/degradations are produced in different cases. Would this be also related to the number of training data?
The concept of heterogeneous datasets is misleading. One could understand that the dataset contains several types of data. The case of NL queries and code dataset is not a real heterogeneous dataset. This is more similar to cross-media retrieval. The proposed method does not seem to be capable of handling truly heterogeneous datasets.

### Questions
How does the adapter-based approach compare to a fine-tuning-based method? Would it be possible to provide additional comparison between these methods?
How does it compare to the state-of-the-art IR methods?
What are the specific solutions proposed in the paper for: (1) retrieval on small datasets, (2) for top-K with small K?
What are the general characteristics of NL2X? The description is missing.

### Summary
This paper proposes a new task-adaptation method for dense retrieval. It takes off-the-shelf embeddings and learns a one-layer residual adapter using task-specific training data. This adapter will transform the embedding into a more task-specific one. The authors evaluated the proposed method on 4 text retrieval tasks from BEIR and 3 code retrieval tasks derived from NL2X.  Experimental results show that the adaptation method can improve retrieval quality for some tasks, especially at very high rank region (1 to 5).

### Strengths
- Paper is clearly written and well presented. 
- Though there are many existing work on task-adaption of retrievers, most of them change model weights. This paper treats the model as a black-box and directly transforms the embeddings, which is less-explored but very practicle. 
- Experiments show good improvements on some tasks.

### Weaknesses
 - The modeling choices need to be better justified. I wonder how a simple MLP adapter layer performs comparing to the proposed attention + residual approach.
- The paper can be stronger with more ablations and analysis. One important experiment is to test if the proposed method can work with different base embeddings models, not just OpenAI embeddings. Another interesting ablation is the global hard negative, as it brings much technical complexity. In addition, it would be nice to show the quality with various amount of training data. 
- Would be nice to report results on the rest of the BEIR datasets. 
- Section 4.2 is vague. Training and testing data size and training set up are missing.

### Questions
- Why using the attention + residual adaptation? Have you tried other options, e.g., a linear adapter or MLP?
- How important is the global hard negatives? What are the implementation details, e.g., do you refresh the index at every training step?

### Summary
- Authors propose to a transformation function on top of embeddings from a fixed model/API to adapt them to a task-specific notion of similarity. 
- The transformation function is learned using task-specific labelled data that contains positive (query, item) pairs marked as relevant, and hard negative mining strategies are used for finding negatives items while training the transformation function.

### Strengths
- The paper is fairly well-written and easy to follow.
- Well-motivated: I agree with the motivation for learning a small set of domain-specific parameter to learn some domain specific notion of similarity.

### Weaknesses
 - Limited novelty and limited empirical results  
  - The proposed approach has limited novelty and is similar to existing work of training task/domain specific parameters while keeping model parameters fixed. In this case, the model is actually served through an API and users can only access final embedding outputs from the model.
  - This proposed approach is similar to adding additional trainable parameters on top of final layer of a model. Even the choice of transformation function used in this paper is explored in prior work. 
  - In terms of the transformation function, only on formulation is tried. And no ablation/alternates are tried.
     - There can be other simple variations such as using a shallow multi-layer perceptron model, using trainable skip connection weight parameter etc. Adding such other choices can better further strengthen experiments in this paper. 

- Evaluation only on small-scale dataset and limited analysis:
   -  The domains used for evaluation are small-scale containing up to 57K items. This is rather small scale for information retrieval. 
   -  Why are large scale datasets from BeIR benchmark not used? It contains domains of the size of up to 8 million items. 
   - Even for these small-scale datasets, adding analysis such as effect of varying training data size, understanding effect of corpus size, effect of using pseudo-queries (released as part of BeIR benchmark) vs using actual train queries etc can further strengthen the paper.

### Questions
Some minor suggestion for writing:
- I would suggest using \mathcal{C} instead of \mathbb{C} for denoting corpus. (\mathbb{C} is typically used for complex numbers)
- I would use \paragraph{} instead of \subsection{*} for different subsections/paras in related work.
