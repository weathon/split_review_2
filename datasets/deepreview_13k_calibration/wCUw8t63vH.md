## Abstract
Across various science and engineering applications, there often arises a need to predict the dynamics of one data stream from another. Further, these data streams may have different statistical properties. Studying the dynamical relationship between such processes, especially for the purpose of predicting one from the other, requires accounting for their distinct statistics while also dissociating their shared dynamical subspace. Existing analytical modeling approaches, however, do not address both of these needs. Here we propose a path forward by deriving a novel analytical multi-step subspace identification algorithm that can learn a model for a primary generalized-linear process (called ``predictor"), while also dissociating the dynamics shared with a secondary process. We demonstrate a specific application of our approach for modeling discrete Poisson point-processes activity, while finding the dynamics shared with continuous Gaussian processes. In simulations, we show that our algorithm accurately prioritizes identification of shared dynamics. Further, we also demonstrate that the method can additionally model the disjoint dynamics that exist only in the predictor Poisson data stream, if desired. Similarly, we apply our algorithm on a biological dataset to learn models of dynamics in Poisson neural population spiking streams that predict dynamics in movement streams. Compared with existing Poisson subspace identification methods, models learned with our method decoded movements better and with lower-dimensional latent states. Lastly, we discuss regimes in which our assumptions might not be met and provide recommendations and possible future directions of investigation.

### Summary
This paper proposed a multi-stage algorithm based on method of moments and positive semidefinite programming to estimate a dynamical system, where the observations come from two processes with shared dynamics. The authors consider specifically the setting where one process is Gaussian and another is Poisson, and the latent state of the Gaussian process leads to better prediction of the Poisson process but not vice versa. Simulation results show that the proposed method can accurately recover the shared dynamic, and real data experiment shows that the proposed method has better prediction accuracies compared with prior work.

### Strengths
1. The paper provides an algorithm that is able to estimate the shared dynamics of two generalized linear process. Compared to previous work (Buesing et al 2012), the inclusion of another correlated process leads to better prediction.

2. By using second order moments, the proposed method can now deal with generalized linear processes instead of Gaussian.

### Weaknesses
1. The paper seems to be motivated by solid applications in neuroscience; but I am not sure if this is of interest to the more general machine learning community.

2. I am a little concerned about the structure of the dynamical system formulation. See questions.

### Questions
Why can you assume that the coefficients follow the block structure as in equation (6)? Is this something motivated by the application? If the true coefficient matrix $\mathbf A$ is non-zero on the upper right block, is the proposed method still going to work?

### Summary
The authors present a method for estimating latent dynamical processes observed through two distinct observations processes - one that delivers continuous-time observations (here Gaussian observation process) and one that produces discrete time observations (here Poisson process). This in a practical setting might be continuous-time behavioral trajectories (i.e. arm movements) and neuronal activity data recorded from relevant brain regions.
The authors follow a covariance-based subspace system identification method to estimate what they call both the shared dynamics observed through the Gaussian and Poisson observation processes, and the disjoint (residual) dynamics that are not observable by both processes, but only through the Poisson observation process. 

The proposed method follows a two stage approach for learning first the shared dynamics that are jointly observed by the two observation processes, and a second stage that identifies the residual dynamics only observed by the Poisson process. 
They demonstrate their method on a simulated linear model system, and on non-human primate dataset of discrete population spiking activity recorded during continuous arm movements.

### Strengths
- Under the assumption of linearity the authors can estimate the dimensionality of the latent process, and of the shared and residual subspace between the two observation processes.
- An issue with covariance-based sub-space identification methods is that there is no guarantee that a valid set of parameters that satisfy the positive semi-definite covariance sequence will be recovered. Here the authors optimise by ensuring the validity of noise statistics.

### Weaknesses
 - The main weakness is the strong assumption of latent linear dynamics, that nevertheless is essential for the development of the method. However for the applications the authors have in mind, most systems are nonlinear. Thus I would expect some comparison of the performance of the method when applied to observations generated by a latent nonlinear system (as also mentioned in the questions below). Specifically, the method's reliance on linear approximations for both the latent state evolution and the observation models raises concerns about its applicability to real-world scenarios where nonlinearities are prevalent. The authors should provide a more thorough analysis of how the method's performance degrades as the underlying system deviates from linearity. This could include simulations with known nonlinear dynamics and a quantitative assessment of the error in latent state estimation and dimensionality identification.
- The authors do not outline the difference of the proposed approach with recent similar approaches that use subspace identification method relying both on behavioural and neural data, i.e. [1], [2]. It is crucial to understand how this method compares to existing techniques, especially those that also leverage subspace identification for multimodal data. The lack of a detailed comparison makes it difficult to assess the novelty and advantages of the proposed method. Specifically, the authors should discuss how their approach differs in terms of the assumptions made, the optimization procedures used, and the types of data that can be handled. A clear comparison with methods such as [1] and [2] is needed to justify the contribution of this work.


### Questions
- The dimensionality of the shared and residual dynamics can be estimated from the singular value decomposition/low rank approximation of the Henkel matrices, as mentioned in Appendix A.1.5. However this estimation method will be accurate under the assumption that the observed latent dynamical system is indeed linear (instead of approximated by a linear system). Do the authors have any estimation on how the method will perform in cases where the latent system is nonlinear? In this case both the evolution equation of the latent process will be an approximation, but also importantly the dimensionalities of the shared and residual dynamics will probably be estimated inaccurately. I think it would be helpful to see systematic evaluations on how the method performs:
   - i) when the dimensionalities of the subspaces are misestimated, and 
  - ii) when the linearity assumption does not hold (assuming that the dimensionalities of the subspaces have been correctly assessed). For example In Figure 2 (where the method is applied on primate data) I wouldn’t say that the estimation of the dimensionality actually works (Figure 2 a and b).
- In Section 3.1 in mentioning the model parameters that the method identifies, the authors do not include the noise variance of the Gaussian observation process $z_k$ (I.e. the characteristics of the noise term $epsilon_k$). Similarly in Section 3.2.3. 
   - Does this mean that the noise variance of the Gaussian observation process does not influence the performance of the method. Can the authors comment on this? 
   - Moreover I would also include the dimensionality of the latent process and the dimensionality of the shared subspace dynamics in the model parameters that are estimated.
- How would the approach compare to estimation based on the Gaussian observation process? In Figure 1 the authors compare their framework with the PLDSID one, but I wonder how the method would compare to a method relying only on the continuous observations for identifying the shared subspace dynamics.
- In Figure 1 caption the authors mention: “PG-LDS-ID stage 1 used a dimensionality given by $\min(4, n_x )$ “. Can you explain what is meant with this phrase, and how the value 4 was chosen?

Minor comments on writing:

- In the first paragraph of the introduction the authors mention “Second, disjoint dynamics present in either observation can obscure and confound modeling of their shared dynamics”. Up to here in the text it is still unclear what “disjoint dynamics” is, and what “each observation” refers to. For the latter I would propose to replace with “each observation stream” or something along these lines. For the first, I would use something referring to “uncorrelated” part of the dynamics or residual as you call it later, but with a brief explanation what exactly is meant with this term.

- Similarly in Page 4 point 2., the authors mention the transition matrix presented later in the text without giving more detail at this point transition matrix of which of the processes they consider they refer to.
- In the introduction the authors refer to the part of the dynamics that is only observable through one observation process as “disjoint” part, while in the main text they refer to this part as residual dynamics. I would propose to stick to one of those terms (preferably the latter one) to avoid confusing the readers.

### Summary
The paper presents a novel analytical approach, the PG-LDS-ID algorithm, designed for modeling Poisson data streams while disentangling shared dynamics with Gaussian data streams. This capability addresses the challenge of predicting the dynamics of one data stream from another with different statistical properties. Through simulations and real-world data, the authors demonstrate the effectiveness of their method in accurately identifying shared Poisson dynamics with Gaussian observations. The proposed algorithm's flexibility extends to various generalized-linear models, making it a valuable tool for modeling shared and distinct dynamics in data streams across diverse application domains.

### Strengths
The paper's most notable strength lies in its innovative decomposition technique introduced through Equation (6). This decomposition significantly simplifies the modeling of shared dynamics between data streams with different statistical properties. By breaking down the problem into manageable components, the paper enhances the overall approach's ease of handling and implementation.

For practical applicability, the introduced decomposition technique, as demonstrated in the paper, holds practical applicability in real-world scenarios. By simplifying the modeling of shared dynamics, the method provides a valuable tool for researchers in different domains. This practical aspect strengthens the paper's significance as it offers a solution that can be directly applied to address challenging problems.

### Weaknesses
1. While the decomposition introduced in Equation (6) is a notable strength, it lacks clarity regarding the conditions under which it can be effectively implemented. The paper does not sufficiently discuss the scenarios where this decomposition may not be feasible, and whether alternative methods should be considered.

2.  After the system decomposition, it is evident that r depends on both x^1 and x^2. However, the paper does not sufficiently explain why, in Section 3.2.1, C_r^1 can be estimated independently without considering C_r^2. 

3. The experimental evaluation in the paper primarily compares the proposed algorithm with PLDSID, which was introduced in 2012. It is essential to explore whether newer and more competitive algorithms have been developed. A more comprehensive comparative analysis involving the most up-to-date methods would provide a clearer picture of the proposed algorithm's strengths and weaknesses in the current research landscape.

### Summary
This paper proposed a new method called PG-LDS with its corresponding inference and learning algorithm that can find both shared and residual dynamics from coupled observations. Experiments on both simulated and real-world dataset validate the effectiveness of the proposed model and corresponding algorithms. The provided algorithm can be generalized to other similar models with paired observationa and shared latent dynamics.

### Strengths
* The whole paper is clear in presentation. Method derivation is detailed with maths.
* The new model is interesting to me, since the usual way of treating the behavior data of a neural dataset is to treat it as external input, or some ground truth to be compared. This paper provides a new perspective of dealing this problem. Specifically, the Poisson spike train and behaivor data are treated as a coupled dataset with shared latent dynamics. By this way, we are able to use both the spike train data and the behavior data to find some common factors that accounts for the observations in an experiment.

### Weaknesses
 * First line of sec 2.2, typo: "Given an $H$". Page 3 -2 line, typo: "we need to".
* See questions.

* What is "either colored or white" in Sec 3.1. This is confusing.
* In Eq. 5, why Gaussian observations $z_k$ don't include a bias term? What's the distribution of $\epsilon_k$?
* What about the comparisons of the log-likelihood on test datasets?
* Are there any existing models or methods that can learn shared latent dynamics from the joint dataset: e.g. neural spike trains plus movement?
* Have authors tried other datasets? Is the proposed model widely applicable to similar tasks?
* Since authors claim that the algorithm is able to be genearalized to non-Poisson/non-Gaussian model, have authors tried that on at least some synthetic datasets from simple models, which are not Poisson+Gaussian?
