## Abstract
Existing vision-language models exhibit strong generalization on a variety of visual domains and tasks. However, such models mainly perform zero-shot recognition in a closed-set manner, and thus struggle to handle open-domain visual concepts by design. There are recent finetuning methods, such as prompt learning, that not only study the discrimination between in-distribution (ID) and out-of-distribution (OOD) samples, but also show some improvements in both ID and OOD accuracies. In this paper, we first demonstrate that vision-language models, after long enough finetuning but without proper regularization, tend to overfit the known classes in the given dataset, with degraded performance on unknown classes. Then we propose a novel approach OGEN to address this pitfall, with the main focus on improving the OOD GENeralization of finetuned models. Specifically, a class-conditional feature generator is introduced to synthesize OOD features using just the class name of any unknown class. Such synthesized features will provide useful knowledge about unknowns and help regularize the decision boundary between ID and OOD data when optimized jointly. Equally important is our adaptive self-distillation mechanism to regularize our feature generation model during joint optimization, \ie, adaptively transferring knowledge between model states to further prevent overfitting. Experiments validate that our method yields convincing gains in OOD generalization performance in different settings.

### Summary
The paper improves the out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization of vision-language models, especially CLIP, when they are finetuned on downstream tasks. The paper makes the following contributions:

- It reveals the overfitting problem of existing finetuning methods, such as prompt learning, that degrade the OOD performance of CLIP models.

- It proposes a novel method called OGEN, which consists of two components: a class-conditional feature generator and an adaptive self-distillation mechanism.

- The paper evaluates OGEN on various downstream tasks and datasets and shows that it consistently improves the OOD generalization of different finetuning methods for CLIP models.

### Strengths
- The proposed method addresses a novel and important problem of improving the OOD generalization of vision-language models, especially CLIP when they are finetuned on downstream tasks.

- The paper proposes a novel method called OGEN, which consists of two components: a class-conditional feature generator and an adaptive self-distillation mechanism. The feature generator synthesizes OOD image features given the name of an unknown class, by extrapolating from the most similar known classes. The self-distillation mechanism uses an adaptive teacher model that is an exponential moving average of past model checkpoints within a local time window. The teacher model guides the student model to avoid overfitting and maintain a good trade-off between in-distribution and OOD performance.

- The paper evaluates OGEN on various downstream tasks and datasets and shows that it consistently improves the OOD generalization of different finetuning methods for CLIP models. It also provides comprehensive ablation studies and analysis to validate the effectiveness of each component of OGEN.

### Weaknesses
 (1) The proposed method mainly compared with CoOp (IJCV'22), Co-CoOp (CVPR'22), and VPT (ECCV'22).
However, before the deadline of ICLR, the state-of-the-art methods are released here: https://github.com/muzairkhattak/PromptSRC
MaPle (CVPR'23) and  PromptSRC (ICCV'23) need to be discussed in this paper.

(2) In Tab 3 and Tab 4, the proposed class-conditional feature generator slightly decreases the performance of the base classes.
In the appendix Fig 5, there are some explanations regarding the performance increase in the new classes and performance variation in the base classes. These discussions need to move to the main script.

(3)	The first step of OGEN, novel class extrapolation, is problematic. It is unreasonable to utilize base features to extrapolate novel features, since there are usually large conceptual gaps between base and novel classes. The authors provide a special case, that is “cat, bear->raccoon”. But in CIFAR-10, for example, I think the “ship” class is not conceptual close to any other classes.

(4)	Another contribution of this paper, claimed by authors, is Adaptive Local Mean Teacher (ALMT), which I think is just a trivial trick of hyperparameter tuning. The difference between ALMT and conventional MT is just modifying the sliding window size. The novelty is quite low, and the performance improvement brought by ALMT over “No distillation” is insignificant (less than 1%), as shown in Table 6.

(5)	The performance of OGEN is too low and outdated. In existing prompt learning papers in CVPR’23 (such as [1,2]) and ICCV’23 (such as [3,4]), the “New” accuracy in base-to-novel generalization setting is already about 75%, but OGEN can only achieve around 70%.

(6)	The paper writing is quite poor and hard to follow. The objective function is missing in Sec 3.3.

### Questions
My main concern is the baselines selected to compare in this paper are too old (methods published in 2022). MaPle (CVPR'23) and  PromptSRC (ICCV'23) need to be discussed in this paper.

### Summary
This paper addresses the limited generalization capabilities of existing vision-language models, which struggle to handle open-domain visual concepts. The authors propose a novel approach called OGEN to improve the out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization of finetuned models. OGEN introduces a class-conditional feature generator that synthesizes OOD features using only the class name of any unknown class, helping to regularize the decision boundary between in-distribution (ID) and OOD data. Additionally, an adaptive self-distillation mechanism is employed to prevent overfitting. Experimental results demonstrate that OGEN achieves considerable improvements in OOD generalization performance across different settings.

### Strengths
* The forgetting problem is important in foundation models during fine-tuning.
* The over-fitting observation can support the paper's main claim.
* The proposed method is reasonable.

### Weaknesses
I believe it would be beneficial for this paper to include a comparison with relay-based methods, such as sampling a subset from Lioan-5B and using it for replay. The "class-conditional feature generator" seems to serve as a proxy for the replay data, so it would be valuable to directly explore the use of replay methods. As a result, I find the novelty of the proposed approach to be somewhat limited considering this concern.

### Summary
This paper proposes a method to regularize ERM for OOD generalization with CLIP models. The method uses a feature prediction network to hallucinate image features corresponding to unknown texts at training time. The resulting training procedure is more robust, since it takes into account synthesized features from unseen classes. The authors also propose a self-distillation mechanism to complement the method.

### Strengths
- I found the method interesting and novel.
- I found the paper easy to follow. Section 3.2 and Figure 2 are especially informative and organized very intuitively.
- The method seems like it could be useful.

### Weaknesses
 - the self-distillation mechanism is easy-to-think-of, but this is okay, since it is not the main innovation.
- My main concern with this paper would be the results. In particular, they are not state-of-the-art (see [Maple] and [Clipood]). Furthermore, the reported CoOp performance seems low. With some tuning, CoOp can be much better, e.g. [KgCoOp] reported a harmonic mean of 74.6 for CoOp on average, compared to 71.7 reported by the authors.  From personal experiments, I know that simply finetuning both encoders along with the prompt with cross-entropy can achieve much better results on these benchmarks, (80.3 % HM on the base-to-novel benchmark, average of 11 datasets). However, the authors seem to focus on just prompt tuning, so it might be ok.

### Summary
The paper works on improving the OOD generalization of finetuned vision-language models. Specifically, a class-conditional feature generator and adaptive self-distillation mechanism are proposed to serve the goal.

### Strengths
[$\textbf{Interesting Idea}$] The idea of generating unknown-class features is interesting.

[$\textbf{Presentation Quality}$] The presentation is clear and easy to follow.

### Weaknesses
[$\textbf{Unconvincing Statement}$] The work mentions that it is the first to unveil the pitfalls of finetuning VLMs by prompt learning can cause overfitting on base classes, resulting in poor performance on novel classes. However, CoCoOp “Conditional Prompt Learning for Vision-Language Models, CVPR 2022” has already observed this and proposed conditional prompt learning to address it.

[$\textbf{Unclear Model Design}$] This work uses known image and text features as K and V, while unknown text features as Q to generate unknown image features. The rationale behind this is not clear. It would be nice to explain this in more details.

[$\textbf{Missing Related Works}$] For finetuning methods, there are many works that need to be discussed, e.g., “CLIP-Adapter: Better Vision-Language Models with Feature Adapters”, “Task Residual for Tuning Vision-Language Models”, “Improving Zero-Shot Generalization for CLIP with Synthesized Prompts”, “MaPLe: Multi-modal Prompt Learning” and “Self-regulating Prompts: Foundational Model Adaptation without Forgetting”.

[$\textbf{Small Performance Gains}$] The results in Table 1 show the improvements from adding the proposed method are rather limited. Moreover, the performance is much worse than some SOTA methods, e.g., “MaPLe: Multi-modal Prompt Learning, CVPR 2023”, “Improving Zero-Shot Generalization for CLIP with Synthesized Prompts, ICCV 2023” and “Self-regulating Prompts: Foundational Model Adaptation without Forgetting, ICCV 2023”. It would be nice to see the performance of these SOTA methods by adding the proposed components.
