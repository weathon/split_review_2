## Abstract
Text generation models are notoriously vulnerable to errors in the training data. With the wide-spread availability of massive amounts of web-crawled data becoming more commonplace, how can we enhance the robustness of 
models trained on a massive amount of \emph{noisy} web-crawled text? 
In our work, we propose Error Norm Truncation (ENT), a robust enhancement to the standard training objective that truncates noisy data. Compared to methods that only use the negative log-likelihood loss over target words to estimate data quality, our method provides a more accurate estimation by considering the distribution of non-target tokens, which is often overlooked by previous work. Through comprehensive experiments across language modeling, machine translation, and text summarization, we show that equipping text generation models with ENT improves generation quality over standard training and previous soft and hard truncation methods. Furthermore, we show that our method improves the robustness of models against two of the most detrimental types of noise in machine translation, resulting in an increase of more than 2 BLEU points over the MLE baseline when up to 50\% of noise is added to the data.

### Summary
This work proposes Error Norm Truncation (ENT), a method to clean low-quality data in training text generation models. The proposed method measures the distribution of each token between the predicted distribution and the ground-truth distribution, which is more robust than previous works of measearuing loss or probability.

### Strengths
1. The first half of the paper is well-organized and clearly written. I enjoy reading this part, which provides me a clear understanding of your motivation and method.
2. The proposed method is technically sound, echoing your motivation, with theoritical proof and experimental studies.
3. The experiments, overall, provide a good evidence of the effectivenss of the proposed method.

### Weaknesses
1. The last half of the paper is not well wrtitten with some temrs not clearly explained:
1.1 In Figure 5, ENT (largest) and ENT (smallest) are not explained. I did not find where explains these two terms.
1.2 In Figure 6, what and how are the ENT threshold and ENT fraction set?
2. The authors claim that previous work would rely on hyper-parameter tuning (on fraction or threshold). But the proposed ENT method also requires these hyper-parameters. I am not sure the proposed method would be more efficient on hyper-parameter selecting.
3. In $5.2, apart from the two settings, another setting "Over translated" (noted by the authros in Figure 2) should also be included.
4. In $5.4, it is inadequate to draw such a conclusion on using which method for pre-trained model and using which method for from-sractch model, with only a summarization task. More downstream tasks should be conducted to draw such a conclusion.
5. Title of Section 4 could be re-considered to like "Analysis", as case studies always provide study on a few specific "cases" from the dataset. But this section is analyzing on the whole dataset. However, this is just a suggestion, and does not affect my rating.

### Questions
1. In Table 1, when the untranslated ration is 10%, MLE outputperforms all the methods with a relatively large margin. This is interesting and also confusing, comparing to other ratio. Do you have any explain or study on this? Moreover, in real scenoria, I think the untranslated ratio in the dataset is not as large as more than 20%, so does this result suggest that under common situation, using MLE is enough to beat other modifications?
2. In Table 2, the advantages of ENT and also the Loss Trunc. and TaiLr are not significant against MLE when ratio <=30%. Also in real scenoria, the misordered ratio might not be that high, which also raieses the same question as above.

### Summary
This paper proposes a method called Error Norm Truncation (ENT) to enhance the robustness of text generation models against errors in the training data. The Error Norm Truncation (ENT) method is to truncate training data with high L2 error norm. The comprehensive experiments show that ENT improves the robustness of language models and machine translation models against various types of noise and outperforms previous methods.

### Strengths
- This paper studies a fundamental issue in training neural models. 
- The proposed method is easy to implement and sounds appealing.
- Experiments show that the proposed method can outperform previous methods on some tasks such as machine translation and language modeling.

### Weaknesses
 - Even though the results have proven the effectiveness of ENT, I think the motivation of using error norm to estimate data quality can be further discussed and provide more insights about how do they correlate. Specifically, while the L2 norm might be sensitive to outliers, a more detailed explanation of why this sensitivity directly translates to identifying noisy data points is needed. It's not immediately clear that a high L2 norm always indicates a problematic training example, as it could also be a hard example that the model needs to learn from. The paper should elaborate on the specific characteristics of noisy data that cause a high L2 norm, and how this differs from hard but useful examples.
 - Theoretically, whether an example is helpful to train a model not only depends on the correctness of its label but also on the uncertainty (or entropy) of this example, according to the lessons from active learning. As uncertainty also takes into account of the prob of non-targets as ENT does. Therefore, it would be important to discuss the relationship between uncertainty and ENT in this paper. The paper should clarify how ENT's error norm truncation differs from uncertainty-based methods, especially in scenarios where high uncertainty might stem from complex but valid data points rather than just noise. A more detailed comparison, perhaps using visualizations of the error norm and uncertainty distributions, would be beneficial.
 - The proposed method achieves significant improvements on simulated training data with manually added noise (with two types of noise) but it only yields modest improvements on the standard benchmarks where training data may contain less noise. Therefore, it would be helpful if the proposed method works well on natuarally noisy benchmarks. Of course, it may be difficult to collect a large scale of training data and thus it is practical to apply the proposed method under the finetuning scenario, where a small scale of naturally noisy data is used for finetuning (for example, there is such a shared task in WMT).   

p.s. I know there is no time for authors to add new experiments into the paper, because I am an emergency reviewer and submit the reviews just before the deadline. However, I would be happy to see more experiments from the dialog box in the openreview system a couple of days later.

### Summary
This paper introduces a new method for noisy data truncation. It computes the l2 norm of the difference between the model's token distribution and the one-hot groundtruth. The error norm provides a measure of data quality. The Experiments on language modeling, machine translation, and summarization demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

### Strengths
- The proposed method is simple, effective, and robust.
- The analysis experiments are insightful.
- The experiment results on language modeling, machine translation, and summarization are comprehensive and the results are good.

### Weaknesses
 - The improvements over existing methods seem marginal in some experiments.
- The motivation of the proposed method is a bit unclear to me. See my question below.

- In my opinion, all non-ground truth tokens are treated in the same way in the proposed method. can you explain?

### Questions
One motivation of the proposed method is that previous works treat all non-ground truth tokens as equally incorrect. However, I do not see how the proposed method solve this problem. In my opinion, all non-ground truth tokens are treated in the same way in the proposed method. can you explain?

Following above, I think one potential improved version of the proposed method is to take into account the similarity between non-ground truth tokens and ground truth tokens when computing the l2 norm.

### Summary
This paper proposes a method for automatically identifying which data points are potentially noisy.
Specifically, this is done based on identifying points that have high L2 norms of the error and removing them from the loss function.

### Strengths
* Overall, I do really like the concept of the paper. It is simple and generally makes sense.
* The method seems to have strong empirical results in synthetic settings, and reasonable experimental results in less synthetic settings.
* Figure 4 is a nice analysis demonstrating that intuitively why the proposed method is better than log likelihood.

### Weaknesses
I have a few concerns about the paper:

* It seems that some hyperparameter tuning (detailed in appendix C) was done for all of the loss modification methods, but none was done for MLE. Because of this, perhaps some of the gains over MLE can be attributed to randomness in training, rather than to inherent goodness of the method.
* The results on real-world datasets (sections 5.3 and 5.4) are somewhat underwhelming. I see small gains (and perhaps small gains are a good result already given how simple the method is), but I'm also a little bit concerned whether these are interesting enough for practitioners to be excited and go back and implement/use this method. Overall, I feel like the paper lacks a big convincing results, such as  significant improvements to SOTA on a dataset that people care about.

Note that I am not saying that the work is solid, it seems to be done reasonably well, I'm just not sure how much impact it will have on the community given the current empirical evidence.

### Questions
1. How was the thereshold hyperparameter tuned in all experiments in the experimental section?
2. I was confused by the second equation in section 3, should it be a "less-than" sign rather than a "greater-than" sign?
