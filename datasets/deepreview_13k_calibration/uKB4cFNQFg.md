## Abstract
The genome sequence contains the blueprint for governing cellular processes. %, including the expression, sequence and function of proteins. 
  While the availability of genomes has vastly increased over the last decades, experimental annotation of the various functional, non-coding and regulatory elements encoded in the DNA sequence remains both expensive and challenging. This has sparked interest in unsupervised language modeling of genomic DNA, a paradigm that has seen great success for protein sequence data. 
  Although various DNA language models have been proposed, evaluation tasks often differ between individual works, and might not fully recapitulate the fundamental challenges of genome annotation, including the length, scale and sparsity of the data. In this study, we introduce \textbf{BEND}, a \textbf{Ben}chmark for \textbf{D}NA language models, featuring
  a collection of realistic and biologically meaningful downstream tasks defined on the human genome. %By providing a standardized evaluation framework, our benchmark aims to promote the development of more effective and tailored approaches to unsupervised representation learning on DNA. 
  We find that embeddings from current DNA LMs can approach performance of expert methods on some tasks, but only capture limited information about long-range features.

### Summary
Summary of the paper:
The paper presents BEND, a benchmark for DNA language models that focuses on biologically meaningful tasks defined on the human genome. The aim is to evaluate the ability of unsupervised language modeling techniques in annotating various functional and regulatory elements within DNA sequences. The results show that while current DNA LMs can rival expert methods in some tasks, they struggle with capturing long-range features in the DNA.

### Strengths
- The overarching motivation behind creating BEND, which emphasizes understanding the genome across longer ranges, is commendable.
- The efforts to collect the benchmark dataset are commendable, and the dedication shown in running benchmarks for so many language models and supervised baselines is admirable.

### Weaknesses
 - However, I feel that the task formulation for long sequences lacks depth and isn't entirely persuasive.
- When benchmarking DNA Language models, it's crucial to explore the intricacies of training at least one of these models from scratch. This would provide a comprehensive insight into their potential and the limitations of pretraining.
- A side-by-side comparison with a DNA Language model trained from scratch is essential. Such an analysis would give a more rounded perspective on the strengths and shortcomings of the existing methods.

### Questions
I believe this work has significant potential. If the authors address the concerns raised in my comments, I would be inclined to recommend a higher score for this submission. 

- Figure 1 appears to inaccurately represent the length of certain genomic features. For example, the majority of exons in the human genome are shorter than 200 base pairs, with an average length between $120-170$ base pairs. Furthermore, promoter lengths usually range from 100 to 1000 base pairs. The diagram should at least offer a rough indication of these lengths. It's also crucial to highlight that exons and introns alternate in their appearance, a detail that the figure should encompass.
- In the introduction, l'd suggest mentioning foundational works like DeepSEA alongside DeepBind when discussing supervised learning on DNA. These groundbreaking studies have left an indelible mark on the field.
- Concerning the enhancer annotation, there is some uncertainty regarding the authenticity of the ground truth. The ABC method is based on inference and might not reflect a direct experimental outcome.
- Clarity is sought on the dataset splitting methodology - why was the data from the pretraining phase included? What about considering a leave-chromosome-out approach to splitting? The methods to prevent data leakage should also be elucidated.
- The decision to categorize variant effect prediction as a binary problem raises questions. Given the intricate nature of genomic variations and the subsequent implications, framing this as a regression task might be more appropriate.
- It's crucial, especially with such intricate datasets, that downstream models be evaluated using a leave-chromosome-out strategy to guarantee robust results.
- Te absence of a simple CNN baseline for the variant effect prediction task is a notable omission. Such a baseline would not only validate the implemented supervised models but also provide an insight into the relative performance of more complex models.

### Summary
This paper presents a collection of benchmark tasks that are intended to measure the performance of a DNA language model.  The tasks are quite diverse, both in terms of the phenomena they cover and their difficulty level.  Providing such a benchmark is useful, though several recent studies have already done this. The main novel contribution here is including tasks that take very long sequences as input, such as predicting enhancer-promoter interactions.

N.B. I increased my score by one point after reading the reviewer response.

### Strengths
I really liked the section that provided biological background -- it was clear and concise.

The benchmark tasks are well described, and each one is important for a DNA language model to be able to address.

Some of these tasks are more challenging than the ones used in previous studies.

### Weaknesses
Including only tasks from the human genome is problematic.  It seems clear that a good language model of DNA should cover more than just one species.  The most recent competing benchmark (Gresova 2023) includes eight tasks from three different species.

This benchmark does not improve very much over the Gresova benchmark published this year.

minor:

It would be good to point out, in Section 2.1, that these descriptions are about eukaryotic genomes.

Introduce "secondary structure" before using the abbreviation "SS."

### Questions
Why are enhancers defined to be 128bp?  I think of an enhancer as minimally corresponding to a missing nucleosome, plus its linker, which would be 225-250bp.  Some are significantly larger.

Why did you choose to frame the enhancer task as annotation rather than matching?  It seems weird to refer to this as detecting "long-range interactions," since the task does not require that a given enhancer actually be operating on the gene at the center of the selected window.  I also don't understand in what sense this annotation framing of the problem can be considered "more stringent."

Why did you choose not to do fine-tuning for each task?  It's not clear to me that, in practice, anyone would adopt a fully unsupervised approach to this kind of supervised problem.

### Summary
The mansucript presents a set of benchmark datasets for evaluating DNA language models (DNA LMs) and establishes baseline performance for these datasets using existing DNA LMs.  It also compares the LM-based approach to a simple direct supervised learning approach.

### Strengths
Strengths:

- While there exist other recent benchmark datasets for DNA LMs, the authors' datasets are complementary to the existing ones.  In particular, the tasks are more realistic than those in the "Genomic benchmarks" paper (but see some caveats below).

- The authors provide a comprehensive comparison of existing DNA LM performance on the benchmark datasets; they also provide a comparison to a trained-from-scratch simple supervised model.

### Weaknesses
Weaknesses:

- The supervised learning baselines are useful, but are rather weak.  For example, in the context of histone modifications, a model such as Sei which is trained on much larger datasets has achieved much higher accuracy (although the results are not strictly comparable).  I expect such a model to perform much better than the DNA LM approach. The baselines used, such as Basset, while useful for comparison to the LM embeddings, do not represent the state-of-the-art in supervised learning for these tasks, which limits the conclusions that can be drawn about the absolute performance of DNA LMs. It would be beneficial to include a more competitive supervised baseline, even if it is not trained on the exact same data, to provide a more realistic performance comparison.

- Regarding the enhancer prediction task:  This is a case where additional forms of data such as DNA accessibility and DNA contacts are able to provide additional hints that make this problem more tractable, and likely provide much higher accuracy than reported here (see e.g. the EPCOT model from the Liu lab). The current approach only leverages the DNA sequence itself, which is a significant limitation. The authors should acknowledge that real-world enhancer prediction relies heavily on multi-omic data, and that the presented results only reflect the capacity of DNA LMs to capture sequence-based signals, not the overall performance achievable with other data modalities.

- The gene-finding task is somewhat contrived, as the resulting prediction need post-processing is required to convert those predictions into a coherent gene model.  Also, it's not clear how alternative splicing was handled, as it makes it difficult to assign a strict label to each position. The sequence-to-sequence approach, while common, does not fully capture the complexity of gene structure prediction, which often involves a more intricate state space as seen in HMM-based methods. The lack of clarity on how alternative splicing is handled is a significant concern, as it introduces ambiguity in the ground truth labels and makes the evaluation less straightforward. The authors should clarify how they deal with overlapping gene models and alternative transcripts.

### Questions
- In Table 3 the authors provide accuracy from the literature.  Not clear how relevant those numbers are since they are based on potentially very different datasets.  It should be noted in the manuscript that those numbers should be taken with a grain of salt.

- The authors note that "reasoning over very long contexts, as e.g. required for finding enhancers, is still challenging."  Is this too much to expect from these models?  (i.e expect them to reason over long sequence contexts). Perhaps we should be content with LMs producing representations that are based on short contexts, and leave long-range contexts for downstream models?

- The authors say the provide "An adaptable benchmarking framework for preparing embeddings and training lightweight supervised models."  This point requires some elaboration - I assume you are referring to the code in the (currently anonymous) github repository.

- You had noted that your benchmark's advantage is a mix of short and long sequence classification; however, I think you could have chosen better problems for long sequence tasks, e.g. gene expression prediction; also, the histone modification prediction task might have benefitted from longer sequence contexts.

Minor comments:

- A comment regarding splice site classification:  You note that "Moreover, there are cases in which a short-sequence task represents a simplification compared to real-world applications, as exemplified by SS-containing sequences. In genome annotation, classifying SSs is a subproblem of the gene finding task and would typically not be performed on its own."  This is mixing the issue of short sequences and how a splice site classifier would be used.  From my experience, SS classification is a relatively easy task that does not really need long sequences; while it is used in gene finding, it has other applications related to gene annotation; the condition-dependent version of the problem stands on its own (see e.g. the recent paper on the pangolin deep learning model).  

- "The availability of unlabeled genomic sequences and limited labeled data appear to make language modeling a natural fit for DNA."
There is actually a wealth of labeled data - models like Sei and Enformer are very successful at leveraging large scale labeled data.

- "Gene-adjacent regulatory elements are referred to as cis, and distant ones as trans."  The definition of cis and trans is not a matter of distance!

- Reference missing in 3.3:  and follows the methodology of ??.

### Summary
This paper is concerned with BEND, a Benchmark for DNA language
models, investigating several biologically down-stream tasks defined on the human genome.

It is a interesting to read, as it compares a number of frameworks on biological task of interest. The training data seems to mainly be human curated biological data sets. Is this correct? Although it should not be considered an important critique of the submission, I strongly believe that the future of computational biology will be analysis of more complex data sets having a more complete signal. That is, the annotated data is often not sufficient, and richer experimental datasets will facilitate more interesting analyses. The underlying reason is that the biological reality is more complex: there may be multiple start sites, etc. Nevertheless, the described models can certainly serve as a step in this direction

However, the paper contains quite a lot of background and it is a benchmarking study of several methods that only available as rxiv papers, according to the references. The call for papers does not spell out how focused the conference is on original research, which makes the fit of the paper  somewhat unclear. I would, however, not priorities this paper in a comparison with the average ICLR paper.

### Strengths
The paper provides an interesting comparison of the performance of several frameworks across 5-6 prediction task of relevance to modern biology.
