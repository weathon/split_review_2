## Abstract
Evaluating Large Language Models (LLMs) in open-ended scenarios is challenging because existing benchmarks and metrics can not measure them comprehensively.
To address this problem, we propose to fine-tune LLMs as scalable judges (\name) to evaluate LLMs efficiently and effectively in open-ended benchmarks. 
We first propose a comprehensive, large-scale, high-quality dataset containing task seeds, LLMs-generated answers, and GPT-4-generated judgments for fine-tuning high-performance judges, as well as a new benchmark for evaluating the judges. 
We train \name{} at different scales from 7B, 13B, to 33B parameters, and conduct a systematic analysis of its capabilities and behaviors. 
We then analyze the key biases in fine-tuning LLM as a judge and consider them as position bias, knowledge bias, and format bias.
To address these issues, \name{} introduces a bag of techniques including swap augmentation, reference support, and reference drop, which clearly enhance the judge's performance. 
\name{} obtains the state-of-the-art judge performance on both the existing PandaLM benchmark and our proposed new benchmark.
Our \name{} is efficient and the \name-7B only needs 3 minutes to judge 5K samples with 8 A100 GPUs.
\name{} obtains high agreement with the teacher judge, achieving an agreement exceeding 90\% that even surpasses human-to-human agreement\footnote{As a reference, the max agreement among humans in MT-bench~\citep{zheng2023chatbot-arena} is 82\%.}. 
\name{} also demonstrates extended capabilities in being judges of the single answer, multimodal models, multiple answers, and multi-turn chat.

### Summary
This work proposes a judge language model (JudgeLM) to evaluate open-end generations of LLMs on various tasks. Judge LM is trained to align his preference with a proprietary teacher LLM, tackling the issue of privacy disclosure of evaluating with a proprietary LLM. To train the JudgeLM, a new and larger dataset is curated to encompass the outputs of 11 open-source LLMs given instructions for various tasks. Furthermore, JudgeLM adopts three training techniques to mitigate the biases of finetuned judge LMs: swap augmentation for position bias, reference support for knowledge bias, and reference drop for format bias. The evaluation of the proposed dataset demonstrates the superior alignment with GPT-4 of JudgeLM compared to open-source baselines and GPT-3.5.

### Strengths
1. This work tries to tackle the critical problem of evaluating open-ended answers of LLMs and curate a large-scale dataset with annotation of GPT-4.

2. The proposed judge model is trained with two data augmentation tricks, i.e., answer swap and reference dropping, to be more robust to the answer position and the absence of ground answers.

3. The prompt design enables the extended application of JudgeLM on other tasks, e.g., grading a single answer.

### Weaknesses
1. One critical issue of the proposed method is its generalization ability to unseen tasks, which is important for an LM to be a general evaluation toolkit. A smaller LM, fine-tuned to distill the ability of a powerful proprietary LM, may experience a decrease in performance on unseen tasks.

2. The judge model lacks the granularity of its judgments and can only output an overall score. However, there may be many aspects to grade an open answer, e.g., factuality, fluency, novelty, and helpfulness. These fine-grained aspects are not considered in this work.

3. The writings related to efficiency are not very accurate. In “efficiency comparison”, the paper claims that JudgeLM’s superior efficiency is due to PandaLM “not support parallel running”. However, the parallel running is only a trivial implementation detail and should not be counted as a contribution. The main difference is that JudgeLM generates scores first followed by explanations and thus stopping generation before explanations can save time.

### Questions
1. Is there any results of the performance in judging multiple answers? The paper has mentioned the format bias resulting from mismatched prompt format. However, the prompt template of judging multiple answers also mismatch that of judging two answers.

### Summary
This paper proposed a way of fine-tuning LLMs to be judges to judge the output of other LLMs. 
The construction of the judge fine-tuning data is introduced, the judge is done by first rating the response of LLMs, and then gives a reasoning of the rating, and finally compare two models.
Techniques for avoiding biases in judging LLMs outputs are proposed, and experiments show that the proposed system is a better judge then previously proposed LLM judging systems.

### Strengths
1. How to evaluate open-ended generation systems is an important problem, and this work shows a step towards it.
2. The paper is detailed, and provides comprehensive ablations of the proposed system.
3. The proposed augmentations for fine-tuning judge systems could be useful for future researches.

### Weaknesses
 1. The use of GPT-4 generated judge for the fine-tuning data is the biggest weakness IMO, 1) using GPT-4 generated data could limit the usage of the proposed method (as the GPT-4 license), 2) the main evaluation of the judge system is the agreement with GPT-4, thus training on the GPT-4 generated judges may gives the proposed method a unfair advantage compared to other methods.
2. It could be nice if the paper could include some statistics of the type of question in the evaluation set? Like how many of them are on the topic of code generation or high school math?

### Questions
1. I would like to know the author's opinon on weakness 1.
2. Since LLMs are currently still bad at certain reasoning tasks (such as counterfactual[R1]), how can we trust the evaluation results of such a judging system built by LLMs?

### Summary
The authors proposed JudgeLM, a fine-tuned large language model (LLM) for LLM evaluation. They collected candidate answers with various LLMs and use GPT-4 to generate evaluation, then applied these data to fine-tune Vicuna models. On PandaLM *test* set, JudgeLM achieved better performance than GPT-4, regarding answer correctness.

### Strengths
1. The authors used a "grading, judging, and reasoning" form to increase the flexibility of JudgeLM. For example, when only asked to produce a score, JudgeLM cost less time/resource than PandaLM. The authors also argued that such flexibility can help JudgeLM adapt various evaluation scenarios.
2. The authors designed several data augmentation strategies during fine-tuning to help improve the robustness of JudgeLM. Using these methods, JudgeLM was more consistent than GPT-3.5 and PandaLM when chaning candidate answer order or task formulation. They also examined the scaling of JudgeLM, demonstrating that larger models with more fine-tuning data can achieve better performance.

### Weaknesses
1. The authors only compared the position bias between JudgeLM and GPT 3.5 or PandaLM, leaving the comparison on the two other biases to within the JudgeLM category. Moreover, They did not report these metrics on GPT-4, the teacher of JudgeLM, to examine if their proposed data augmentation strategies can also help JudgeLM supercede GPT-4 over these aspects.
2. The authors argued that providing external knowledge to LLMs can alleviate the lack of related pre-trained knowledge. However, in their experiments, these "references" are essentially reference answers. Such information might be too sufficient for any LLM evaluation model, greatly decreasing the difficulty of the task, and is usually not available in most real-life scenarios (with only a few exceptions like judging homework submissions). Although incorporating refenrence answers do improve JudgeLM on validation data without reference, it could be better to conduct experiments where knowledge is injected under their retrieved form, instead of a well-organized answer.
3. The authors proposed three data augmentation strategies during fine-tuning. Yet among these methods, "reference drop" is basically equivalent to controlling the amount of samples with reference support, and thus should be a hyper-parameter of the latter strategy instead of an extra method.
4. The authors fine-tuned JudgeLM so that the model provides scores before the explanation. This approach could speed up the evaluation when explanations are neglected. However, it could be better to compare the performance between this evaluation form and the explanation-first one *on JudgeLM itself* instead of with the original PandaLM.

### Questions
1. In Table 3, is the total evaluation time of PandaLM computed based on 1 GPU only? If so, why do you not consider such a scenario where multiple (e.g. 8) PandaLMs run parallely on multiple machines with 1 GPU on each machine? This could be more fair to PandaLM, as all models use the same amount of GPU resources (which is the major computation resource).
2. Why is the data in Table 4 not aligned with the ones in Table 1? According to the paper, it seems like the final JudgeLM was fine-tuned on 100k data, which happened to appear in Table 4. Are there other factors that cause the difference, for example the number of training epochs?
3. In section 6.1, Table 1 is referenced as "Table. 1", which is different from other table references.

### Summary
The paper proposes a judge model that works in multiple modes like single grading, multiple answer, etc. There is a related previous work PandaLM (under submission in ICLR as well) that have similar content and method. This paper present different sizes of models, and proposes some augmentation on the training data: swap augmentation and reference support/drop. They makes sense. In experiment section, the ablation study results demonstrate the improvement brought by each of the methods. The paper also builds larger datasets to train the judge model.

### Strengths
It is good to see that the JudgeLM-33B achieves higher results than its teacher GPT-4 from Table 2 when comparing with human annotation results, which might reveal the necessity of having a dedicated judge model.
The augmentation on the training data methods, i.e. swap augmentation and reference support/drop, do contains novelty to some extent.
Experiments in the paper are well conducted, and good ablation study to give some good insights on problems like effect of model size, augmentation methods, etc.

### Weaknesses
While the advantage of first generating scores for answer pairs then generate reasoning makes reasoning generation optional hence could save time, it is not clear whether this is a good strategy. It has been widely known that chain-of-thoughts reasoning can help improve model's reaoning performance. However, this strategy is against the pattern. Though in the experiment results, it doesn't seem to have big issues. It would be good to have comparison on training and testing with the old-fashion chain-of-thoughts style.

How can the paper claim it can judge multimodal model while the model itself cannot take vision data as input? This does not make any sense.

While the paper claims that the conversation capability is retained, it is likely that the training is on the demonstrated question and various model answers presented during training. From the conversation content in Figure 19, the model seems not having conversation on the model's judgement. I don't think this is a good point to emphasize for this paper.

Given there is already a PandaLM paper, while there are still good points and methods proposed in this paper, the novelty is a little weaker.

### Questions
It has been widely known that chain-of-thoughts reasoning can help improve model's reaoning performance. However, the paper adopts a different pattern that gives score first then reasoning. Could you explain why this doesn't cause any issue or would the other way works better?
