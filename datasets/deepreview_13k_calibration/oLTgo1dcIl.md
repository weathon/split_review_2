## Abstract
In minimax optimization, the extragradient (EG) method has been extensively studied because it outperforms the gradient descent-ascent (GDA) method in both strongly-convex-strongly-concave (SC-SC) and convex-concave (C-C) problems. However, stochastic EG (SEG) has seen limited success, as it is known to converge only up to neighborhoods of equilibria for C-C problems. Motivated by the recent progress in analysis of shuffling-based stochastic optimization methods, we investigate the convergence of shuffling-based SEG in finite-sum minimax problems, in search of improved convergence guarantees for SEG under minimal algorithm modifications. Our analysis reveals that both random reshuffling and the recently proposed flip-flop shuffling (Rajput et al., 2022) alone cannot fix the nonconvergence issue in C-C problems. However, with an additional simple trick called anchoring, we develop the SEG with flip-flop anchoring (SEG-FFA) method which successfully converges in C-C problems. We also show upper and lower bounds in the SC-SC setting, demonstrating that SEG-FFA has a provably faster convergence rate compared to other shuffling-based methods as well.

### Summary
The paper focuses on shuffling-based SEG for solving finite-sum min-max optimization problems. In particular, it studies the convergence of the method in a strongly monotone and monotone regime. The proposed analysis reveals that both random reshuffling and the flip-flop shuffling alone cannot fix the non-convergence issue of classical SEG in Convex-Cocave problems. By using anchoring on top of the algorithms, the authors develop the SEG with the flip-flop anchoring (SEG-FFA) method, which successfully converges in Convex-Concave problems.

### Strengths
The paper is well-written, and the main contributions are clear. To the best of my knowledge, this is one of the first papers that provides an analysis of random reshuffling variants for solving min-max problems. Existing variants of the random reshuffling method, as correctly pointed out by the authors, focus on the Gradient descent ascent method. Having an analysis of a shuffling-based SEG is a great next step in this literature.

### Weaknesses
However, I believe this work has some misleading statements, and the presentation of specific parts is unclear.

Let me provide some details below:

1) There are a few inconsistencies in the paper.  In my opinion, some parts and claims are not totally clear based on prior works.
For example, the authors claim that there is an example that SEG-US and SEG-RR diverge. However, the example that they select is a simple bilinear problem for which we know now that the SEG-US converges to the solution with a proper selection of step-sizes (see Hsieh et al 2020).  In particular, the authors claim that SEG-US diverges in expectation for any positive step-size selection. This comes in contradiction with existing known theoretical results. Why is that the case? Can the authors provide a detailed comparison with prior work?

2) In several parts of the paper, the authors claim that EG is a good approximation of PP. This was already disproved in Gorbunov et al. 2022b, where the authors emphasize a significant difference between EG and the Proximal Point method.

3) The section 5 had the potential to be very informative. In the first paragraph of this section, the authors mentioned that the section is where the underlying cause for non-convergence of SEG-RR is investigated, and the motivation of sing anchoring is explained . However, the section is not clear, and several important parts are missing. The presentation of the "SECOND-ORDER MATCHING" part is not robust, which makes the understanding and importance of the results in section 5 unclear. For example, there is no proper definition of what second-order means in EG update rules, and the results are not positioned in the literature. 

4)  #### On theoretical statements: 
The authors wrote the following in their work: "$O(\eta^3)$ for the approximation error turns out to be the key to the exact convergence to an optimum under the monotone setting". This sentence, unfortunately, was not adequately explained in detail in the main paper. Why this statement is necessary?

5)  #### On theory: 
Statement of the theorems do not include all necessary assumption. I imagine that Assumptions 3 and 4 need to hold for every theorem, but this is not precisely stated. 

6)  #### Important comment on Assumptions: 
The authors claim that Assumptions 3 and 4 are reasonable. They pointed out that the work of Golowich et al., 2020 uses Assumption 3(ii) to argue that this is a reasonable assumption. However, assumption 3(ii) is never used in any other paper on analysis for SEG (a first-order method). For example (Gorbunov et al., 2022b) remove assumption 3(ii) and still have nice convergence guarantees for SEG-US. In addition, Assumption 4 is also not reasonable to have. Of course, assumption 4 is more relaxed than bounded variance, but as explained in Gorbunov et al., 2022a this is not a necessary condition to show convergence. SEG-US does not require any bound on the stochastic gradient to guarantee convergence  (see Gorbunov et al., 2022a ),

7) #### On Experiments: 
I believe algorithms in the experiments are compared with wrong step-size selection, which led to unfair comparison. That is, even if in Appendix A, all pseudocodes use $\alpha_t$ and $\beta_t$ to denote the extrapolation and update steps, respectively.
 in the experiments, $\eta_k=\alpha_k=\beta_k$ is used for all methods. However, for the bilinear example, it is known that using the same step-size leads to no convergence of SEG-US. See (Hsieh, et al., 2020)

8) Finally, the paper needs further experiments for completeness. For example, what is the practical benefit of the proposed method compared to other RR algorithms for solving strongly monotone problems?

### Confidence
3: You are fairly confident in your assessment. It is possible that you did not understand some parts of the submission or that you are unfamiliar with some pieces of related work. Math/other details were not carefully checked.

### Summary
It is known that the random reshuffling can often improve stochastic gradient descent methods. The paper considers the case of stochastic extragradient method (SEG) for minimax optimization and proposes SEG with flip-flop anchoring as the random reshuffling counterpart. The methods are designed based on a second-order matching arguments. The paper proves that the method converges under general assumptions and has superior convergence rate than SEG.

### Strengths
I think the paper is good and has some novelties. The flip-flop shuffling is only analyzed in the basic quadratic case in the previous literature. So the analysis in this paper will be very useful for future extentions. The idea of using anchoring to improve the convergence is also quite impressive. I did not check all the prove details, but the results seem fairly reasonable for me.

### Weaknesses
See questions.

### Questions
The experiments section should be expanded or put into the appendix. Details of the experiments should be provided. The last sentence "suggest that the convergence rate derived in this paper may have room for improvement" is confusing. Can the authors elaborate on this?

My second question is that can the analysis of flip-flop shuffling be applied to other settings? As far as I know, this is the first time it is analyzed beyond quadratic setting, so I am interested if the analysis can be applied to usual convex optimization cases.

### Summary
The paper proposes to combine stochastic extragradient with flip-flop shuffling and anchoring for solving convex-concave finite-sum minimax problems. Under the assumption that the objective is smooth and Hessian is Lipschitz, the derived algorithm is claimed to have better performance in both theory and some preliminary numerical experiments on a test function, compared to vanilla stochastic gradient descent ascent and extragradient, measured by the gradient norm.

### Strengths
The paper studies shuffling-based stochastic extragradient for convex-concave minimax problems. This setting is new and not examined before to the best of my knowledge. The paper has a unified analysis for different sample schemes (Theorem 6.1 & 6.2). The numerical experiments align with the theory.

### Weaknesses
1. The paper does not explain why they use the gradient norm as the convergence measure and fails to mention a line of research studying that. In convex-concave minimax problems, the standard convergence measure is the duality gap $\max_y f(\bar x,y) - \min_x f(x,\bar y)$ or minty solution $F(x)^\top (\bar x - x)$ in the sense of variational inequality. This is natural since the optimal point of interest is the Nash equilibrium or the saddle point. There does exist a line of research studying monotone inclusion or gradient norm convergence in the same setting, e.g., Halpern iteration [arXiv:2002.08872, arXiv:2203.09436] or anchoring [arXiv:1905.10899, arXiv:2102.07922, arXiv:2106.02326], but the paper does not compare with them. Specifically, the algorithm in [arXiv:2203.09436] achieves $E\Vert F z_k\Vert^2 \leq 1/k^2$ (see Theorem 4.1) with less assumptions (no Hessian Lipschitzness). The idea of combining extragradient with anchoring is also not new [arXiv:2102.07922].

2. The paper keeps mentioning that GDA and stochastic extragradient do not converge for convex-concave minimax problems and claims that one important contribution is to fix the non-convergence problem. However, for convex-concave minimax problems, it is easy to show that the average iterate of (stochastic) GDA converges with the rate $1/k^{1/2}$ measured by the duality gap, without additional smoothness or Hessian Lipschitzness assumptions (even though the last-iterate does diverge). I am also confused by the statement that previous works (Mishchenko, 2020b & Diakonikolas, 2021) on stochastic extragradient only guarantee convergence to a neighborhood. To my best understanding, these works are able to show $E\Vert F(x)\Vert\leq\epsilon$ (Theorem 4.4 of Diakonikolas, 2021) or $E[F(x)^\top (\bar x - x)]\leq\epsilon$ (Theorem 3 of Mishchenko, 2020b). This paper can be misleading and overclaiming.

3. The paper seems to claim that the bounded domain assumption is strong and thus studies the unconstrained setting. However, according to the well-known von Neumann's minimax theorem, when the objective is convex-concave, the convex and compact domain assumption is necessary to ensure the existence of the Nash equilibrium. When the domain is $R^d$, Assumption 2 is questionable, and it's not clear what solution the algorithm finds when $\Vert Fz\Vert\to 0$.

4. The assumption that Hessian is Lipschitz seems to be too strong and unusual for the considered setting. The algorithm studied in the paper is neither high-order nor has a last-iterate convergence guarantee (Theorem 5.4).

5. The convergence of SEG-RR and SEG-FF is strictly worse than SGDA-RR in the strongly monotone setting. Could the authors explain why?

6. Proposition 5.2 says the reason why anchoring is also required to match (13). Then what changes after anchoring is introduced? How does each term in (13) match? Its LHS is of order $\eta_1\eta_2/n^2$ while the RHS is of order $\eta^2$. Does this mean $\eta_1 = \eta n$ also holds? Isn't $\eta_2=2\eta_1$ still true? Moreover, $z_0-\eta n F(z_0 - \eta n F(z_0))$ in Proposition 5.3 is just one step of EG from $z_0$. Does it suggest that $N$ steps of SEG-FFA are equivalent to one step of EG, up to a small error, where $N$ can be multiple of $n$? Is this specifically for $N=2n$?

7. The paper should also include SGDA-US/RR with anchoring and SEG-US/RR with anchoring, at least in experiments, to show that both ingredients of the algorithms are necessary. What if anchoring is the key step that makes everything converge? I do not fully believe that FF is something that should be done in practice, given that its computation is twice as much as the standard method in every epoch.

8. (Minor) Could the author comment on the dependence on the condition number when the operator is strongly monotone and compare it with existing works? It could be more clear if the author explicitly listed all the necessary assumptions required for each theorem. Are Assumptions 1(1'), 2, 3, and 4 necessary for every theorem? The paper should also clearly state that the benefit of shuffling-based methods over uniform sampling only holds when $K>1$, i.e., the multi-pass case.
