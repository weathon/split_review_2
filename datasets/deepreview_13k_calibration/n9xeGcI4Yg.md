## Abstract
When applied to question answering and other text generation tasks, language models (LMs) may be queried \emph{generatively} (by sampling answers from their output distribution) or \emph{discriminatively} (by using them to score or rank a set of candidate outputs). These procedures sometimes yield very different predictions. How do we reconcile mutually incompatible scoring procedures to obtain coherent LM predictions?
    We introduce a new, a training-free, game-theoretic procedure for language model decoding. Our approach casts language model decoding as a regularized imperfect-information sequential signaling game---which we term the \gamename---in which a \generator seeks to communicate an abstract \truthobj using natural language sentences to a \discriminator. We develop computational procedures for finding approximate equilibria of this game, resulting in a decoding algorithm we call \algo.
    Applied to a large number of tasks (including reading comprehension, commonsense reasoning, mathematical problem-solving, and dialog), \algo consistently, and sometimes substantially, improves performance over existing LM decoding procedures---on multiple benchmarks, we observe that applying \algo to \llamas outperforms the much larger LLaMA-65B and PaLM-540B models.
    These results highlight the promise of game-theoretic tools for addressing fundamental challenges of truthfulness and consistency in LMs.

### Summary
The paper introduces a new decoding strategy for LM's based on a game theoretic formulation. It is directed at tasks requiring objective, factual answers for which a clear notion of a generative version and a discriminative version can be applied. In such settings, the paper describes an adaptation of recent regularized equilibrium approaches that operate directly on the outputs of samples from the Generator/discriminator to produce final answers that do quite well in experiments over a range of challenging fact-seeking or reasoning-seeking benchmarks.

### Strengths
Originality: There have a lot of recent investigations into improved decoding strategies; this paper's approach is quite original in taking a game-theoretic formulation to (essentially) the problem of factuality from language models. This actually makes a lot of sense; human language as pointed out in one of the references is a strategic game between agents and thus we should be modeling it as such and not a pure optimization problem. This particular insight is not new, but this idea stands out to me because of its practicality. It should be noted that the idea could be said to be inspired by recent work on diplomacy and the core algorithm is an adaptation of the same. However, it takes a good deal of originality to make the connection to discriminator/generator as a game and present the particular formulation in the paper.

Quality: The approach has the strong benefit of simplicity in implementation, it requires no re-training of the LM itself. It does seem to require some degree of non-trivial post-processing in the form of running the iteration procedure of eq 1/2. The authors dont address this but I would expect that it would not affect overall latency of LM inference by much and also it scales zero with LM size (iiuc). The experimental evaluation is quite exhaustive and satisfactory, there are a range of datset types explored. the equilibrium methods don't dominate on every single dataset but they generally do quite close to the SoTA and in some instances far exceed. 

Clarity: The motivational sections, the presentation of the key insight and the experimental section are mostly quite clear and the paper was a pleasure to read. I appreciate the use of shading to visualize the relative improvement between the best and other methods in Table 1/2/3.

Significance: I think this could be an very impactful paper. The results are generally very good, it is easy to implement and does not require extensive tuning it seems to get to work, and it seems from my understanding to be scalable to very large LM sizes.

### Weaknesses
Clarity: The paper is actually written fairly well, but there could be some improvements: 
 a. sec 2.2 was far too short. readers without any Game theory background might not even know what regret means. You dont need to fully flesh out all the derivation and algorithm, but a better intuition I think should be built, which might require 2-3 paragaphs more. I think this can be taken from the experimental section, where although there is a lot of useful material, at a pinch some of it can be moved to appendix to make room. Further a couple of (minor) sources of confusion on my first read:

 a.  'reasonableness' is a bit of a misleading word for the concept you are trying to capture. Maybe 'alignment' ? bu that has other implications in the LM space.
 b. eq 1/2: i think it's helpful to clarify that this update does not result in a backprop to the params of the LM. The reason is that in the current RLHF literature that is generally what happens so it is easy to get confused.
 
c. Bit confusing to put ER-G and ER-D in the section on "Baselines".


Quality: I am not at all sure about the characterization of SC as significantly related to Contrastive Decoding. The idea of using a weaker LM as the contrastive seems quite significant to me as it enables the strong LM to "avoid" the weaker ones mistakes, which for reasoning problems often are systematic reasoning errors. So it is unfortunate that CD was not compared against (Though I guess the paper with strong results for CD on reasoning problems was quite recent?)

Significance:  The biggest challenge to the potential significance of this work is that it doesnt seem readily applicable for all use cases of LMs. You need a sort of fact-checking problem, where a set of candidate answers are present. This means it can't be used out of the box as a general decoder, which would be sort of a holy grail right now. Nevertheless, I think the set of applications it is relevant for is hugely important and it is likely to find application given its ease of use.

### Questions
1. Regarding the remark in the last para of sec 2.2, what is the difference between the convergence result of Anagostides (2022) and the one claimed earlier in the prev para?

2. I am wondering about a subtle form of bias that may creep in with use of this method. We "train" the model with both correct and incorrect answers at the root node, which is good. but then over time we are likely to model select on some dev set using only accuracy as our metric [since generally that's what we care about], which means we only care about the 'correct' branches. Is this a possible problem?

3. Both ER-G and ER-D are quite competitive and there is no clear winner between the 2. Is there some simple combination strategy you recommend? ensemble or averaging?

### Summary
In this paper, the authors present an interesting framework centered around a consensus game involving generators and discriminators within language models. They delve into the concept of equilibrium within this game and leverage the equilibrium states of the generator and discriminator to enhance output generation in language models. The efficacy of this approach is validated through rigorous experimentation across various question-answering (QA) tasks.

### Strengths
1. The game-theoretic formulation introduced for the interaction between generators and discriminators in language models is novel and interesting.
2. The experiments is comprehensive, covering an array of QA tasks, and the results presented are compelling.
3. The paper is generally well-written and easy to follow.

### Weaknesses
1. The paper could benefit from a more detailed explanation on the methodological. The process by which Equations (1) and (2) facilitate the attainment of the game's equilibrium is not sufficiently illuminated. Specifically, the paper lacks a clear explanation of how the iterative updates of the generator and discriminator policies, as defined by these equations, lead to a stable equilibrium. It is unclear what specific properties of these equations ensure convergence, and how the chosen update rule relates to the underlying game structure. A more rigorous analysis of the convergence properties is needed.
2. The reliance on the piKL algorithm for the learning dynamics of the consensus game may limit the methodological novelty of the paper. While piKL is a well-established algorithm, its application here appears to be a straightforward adaptation. The paper does not sufficiently justify why piKL is the most appropriate choice for this specific game, nor does it explore alternative learning dynamics that might offer better performance or theoretical guarantees. A deeper discussion of the algorithm's suitability and potential limitations in this context is warranted.
3. The pursuit of a no-regret dynamic steers the system towards a coarse correlated equilibrium. The paper could be enriched by an exploration into the feasibility and potential advantages of converging to stronger equilibrium constructs, such as pure Nash or mixed Nash equilibria. The current approach, while guaranteeing no-regret, might not achieve the most optimal solution. The paper should discuss the trade-offs between the computational ease of reaching a coarse correlated equilibrium and the potential benefits of converging to a stronger equilibrium concept. Furthermore, it is unclear if the current approach is guaranteed to converge to a unique coarse correlated equilibrium or if multiple such equilibria exist.
4. A notable performance drop is observed on the HHH dataset when transitioning from the LLaMA-7B to LLaMA-13B backbone model. An elaboration on this counterintuitive outcome would be beneficial. The paper should investigate potential reasons for this performance degradation, such as the model's capacity to handle the specific type of prompts in the HHH dataset or the possibility of overfitting to the training data. A more detailed analysis of this issue is needed to understand the limitations of the proposed approach.

### Summary
This work proposes a new answer reranking method for LLMs. The main objective is to reconcile the inconsistency between the model's response in the generator setting and its response in the discriminator setting. Specifically, this work designs a regularized imperfect-information sequential signaling game involving the generator and discriminator and finds the Nash equilibrium between them. To find the equilibrium, this work adopts the piKL algorithm proposed by Jacob et al., 2022. The overall method is a training-free method and can consistently outperform several baselines on a variety of QA tasks (also including open-ended and math reasoning tasks).

### Strengths
1. The inconsistent behavior of LLMs across different prompts is an annoying phenomenon. This paper proposes a principled method to reconcile such consistency via game theory.
2. The proposed method is evaluated on various tasks and consistently improves over popular baselines.
3. The proposed method is training-free, so it's applicable to even very large-scale models.

### Weaknesses
1. If we compare the proposed ER-based reranking method and previous baselines, there are actually two major differences. One is the process of finding the Nash equilibrium under the regularization part, the other is the combination of two normalized probabilities in Section 2.2. In the current evaluation, it is clear that the combination of these two can bring consistent improvement, but it's unclear what is the effect of each individual component. It would be helpful to have a baseline just combining the two normalized probabilities (e.g., via the MI approach). Specifically, it is not clear if the improvement comes from the equilibrium refinement process or simply from the normalization and combination of the generator and discriminator probabilities. A more thorough ablation study is needed to isolate the contribution of each of these components.
2. This paper can benefit from showing some intrinsic analysis of the inconsistency of the generator and the discriminator. Right now, while the evaluation shows the effectiveness of the proposed approach, it is unclear how severe the problem is, and in how many cases finding the equilibrium can help. It would be beneficial to quantify the disagreement between the generator and discriminator outputs before and after the equilibrium refinement. For example, what percentage of the time do the generator and discriminator disagree on the top answer, and how does this change after applying the proposed method? This would provide a clearer picture of the problem being addressed and the impact of the proposed solution.
3. I understand the piKL algorithm is from Jacobs et al., 2022, but I would still suggest the authors provide a slightly more detailed description in the appendix. The lack of related details makes it very hard to understand how important the hyper-parameters are, and if the method is sensitive to these values. Specifically, the paper should discuss the sensitivity of the method to the choice of the regularization parameter and the learning rate used in the piKL algorithm. Without this, it is hard to assess the robustness and generalizability of the method.

### Questions
1. I'm trying to understand equations (1) and (2) on page 5, but I can't really understand how the weights terms (i.e., $\lambda_{G}$  and $\eta_Gt$ part) work. Should there be an additional $1/t$ before the $Q$? This will also make it more similar to the algorithm in Jacob et al., 2022. Otherwise, can you explain why there is a difference?
2. Since this is a training-free method, I'm wondering if the authors have tried on even larger models.
3. This can entirely be future work for a separate paper, but I just wonder if the authors have tried to fine-tune the models (e.g., the smaller 7B one) using the same objective.

### Summary
The paper introduces a new decoding algorithm called EQUILIBRIUM-RANKING, which addresses the challenge of reconciling different scoring procedures in language models (LMs) for question-answering and text-generation tasks. EQUILIBRIUM-RANKING is a game-theoretic approach, where a generator aims to communicate a correctness parameter to a discriminator through natural language sentences. By formulating language model decoding as an imperfect information sequential signaling game, the authors develop computational procedures to find approximate equilibria of the game. The experiment uses a set of QA tasks to evaluate EQUILIBRIUM-RANKING, including MMLU, ARC, RACE, HHH, and TruthfulQA, and a math benchmark GSM8K. Across these tasks, EQUILIBRIUM-RANKING consistently improves performance compared to existing LM decoding procedures.

### Strengths
1. The paper demonstrates originality by introducing a novel approach to decoding language models through the consensus game framework. The idea of casting language model decoding as a game-theoretic problem and seeking approximate equilibria is innovative and provides a fresh perspective on addressing the challenge of reconciling different scoring procedures. 

2. The authors develop robust computational techniques for finding approximate equilibria in the consensus game, ensuring reliable and practical implementation of the EQUILIBRIUM-RANKING algorithm. The paper also demonstrates the quality of the research through its extensive evaluation across a diverse range of tasks, showcasing consistent performance improvements over existing decoding procedures.

3. The authors provide a concise and coherent description of the EQUILIBRIUM-RANKING algorithm, making it accessible to readers. The clarity of the writing facilitates the comprehension and replication of the proposed approach. The paper also presents the results and performance improvements in a straightforward manner, enabling readers to grasp the significance of the findings.

### Weaknesses
1. To improve the clarity of the proposed method, it would be advantageous to include a running example that demonstrates the step-by-step process. Specifically, it is unclear how the generator's actions are influenced by the discriminator's potential interpretations, and a concrete example would help illustrate this interaction. Furthermore, the paper would benefit from a more detailed explanation of how the equilibrium is reached in practice, including the iterative process and convergence criteria.

2. To enhance the quality of the paper, it is recommended to address minor typos and errors. For instance, in line 6 of the abstract, "a new, a training-free" should be corrected to "a new, training-free." Additionally, in section 2, line 6, "we may them" appears to be a typographical error and should be revised for clarity.
