## Abstract
Optimization problems are pervasive across various sectors, from manufacturing and distribution to healthcare. However, most such problems are still solved heuristically by hand rather than optimally by state-of-the-art solvers, as the expertise required to formulate and solve these problems limits the widespread adoption of optimization tools and techniques. We introduce OptiMUS, a Large Language Model (LLM)-based agent designed to formulate and solve MILP problems from their natural language descriptions. OptiMUS is capable of developing mathematical models, writing and debugging solver code, developing tests, and checking the validity of generated solutions. To benchmark our agent, we present NLP4LP, a novel dataset of linear programming (LP) and mixed integer linear programming (MILP) problems. Our experiments demonstrate that OptiMUS solves nearly twice as many problems as a basic LLM prompting strategy

### Confidence
3: You are fairly confident in your assessment. It is possible that you did not understand some parts of the submission or that you are unfamiliar with some pieces of related work. Math/other details were not carefully checked.

### Summary
The authors tackled a challenging task of helping the modeling part of optimization problems via LLMs: they try to collect data, give some solid examples and prompting concepts, and show the performance of using the concept.

### Strengths
- Well-motivated problem and explanations of the paper content.
- The dataset collection for the challenging task with the SNOP (structured natural-language optimization problem), with experimental evaluations of several aspects (GPT-3.5 and GPT-4, some ablation).

### Weaknesses
 - Although the LLM-based framework has good performance, the contributions in this paper seem to be experimental findings (rather than some new methods or theoretical analytics).

 - Please clarify or comment on the two metrics: success rate and execution rate. At first glance, the success rate seems to include execution rates (i.e., successes are only achievable when executable). Is this correct? In addition, in Fig. 5 of CPT4 + Prompt + Debug + Supervised Test, the execution rate coincides with the success rate. This bar is completely different from others. So, the authors are better to give some explanations (or intuitions).
- Some basic questions in the pipeline to follow the concept of OptiMUS:
    - In each part involving LLMs (e.g., the formulation in markdown, code generations, test generations), do LLMs (i.e., GPT-3.5, GPT-4) always succeed? Give some errors in practice.  Of course, I can believe that they `can` do them, but I’m interested in how we can believe their outputs and how often we should take care of them in the pipeline.
- Minor comments
    - I’m not exactly sure the reason, but some LaTeX links are not correctly inserted (some points are ??, maybe related to the appendix link). They should be fixed for readability.

### Summary
The paper proposes using large language model (LLM) to automatize optimization modeling and solving: formulate MILP from natural language description, generate the solver code and test the output. A package OptiMUS is developed, along with a new dataset NLP4LP as benchmark set. The experiments demonstrate the potential of large language model to help model and solve optimization problems.

### Strengths
This work poses an intriguing question: how can large language model help optimization modeling and solving, and makes an initial exploration on this topic. The paper demonstrates the potential of LLM to assist modeling and generating solver code. Compared with direct prompting as baseline, the augmentations developed, such as iterative debugging, are demonstrated to effectively increase the execution and success rates.

### Weaknesses
- Though the question posed is interesting, the contribution of this work is less significant. Basically, OptiMUS leverages LLM to generate the mathematical formulation and test code from the SNOP and to iteratively debug the solver code. If so, I'm afraid this work is kind of engineering without much novelty.
- The experiments are far from exhaustive. In the paper, only execution and success rates are reported but there are many aspects of solving optimization problems to discuss. See Questions for more detail on this point.
- The instances in the benchmark set NLP4LP are collected from optimization textbooks and lecture notes. They are more like toy examples (which means they are not representative of real problems) and typically with small sizes. And conclusions drawn on 40 instances can be unreliable.

### Questions
Major comments: I do have several concerns on OptiMUS from the optimization solving perspective.

- If I understand correctly, the mathematical formulation of the problem is generated from the SNOP provided by users. I'm wondering how to guarantee the correctness of the mathematical formulation. Moreover, the test code is also generated by LLM. It could happen that LLM misunderstands the SNOP, generates the wrong mathematical formulation and corresponding wrong test script. In such case the solver solves a wrong problem but passes the test. Is OptiMUS able to detect and circumvent such scenarios?
- Typically, modern solvers have many parameters and options to set. Different options can generate very different outputs. Is the output of OptiMUS stable or not?
- As mentioned in the paper, OptiMUS checks correct formatting and constraint satisfaction, namely feasibility. Does OptiMUS check optimality of the output?
- The instances in NLP4LP are collected from classic optimization textbooks and lecture notes. There are chances that these materials are included in the training data of LLM, which makes the numerical results here less convincing. Moreover, these instances can be very different with real problems and they have relatively small scale. My suggestion is that experiments on real-world problems should be conducted to further demonstrate the effectiveness of OptiMUS.

Other comments: 
- I find it difficult to read Figure 5. Why are success rates always higher than the execution rates? In other words, what is the definition of success rate? In Page 8, the authors write ``success rate (the ratio of outputs satisfying all constraints and finding the optimal solution)". Is it the ratio of success number and all instances, or the ratio of success number and execution count?
- In the abstract, there is a typo "MLIP" which should be "MILP".
- The references to the figures in the manuscript (without appendix) need double-check. For example, there are some missing references in page 7.
- I'm also concern about the reproducibility of the results because the output of LLM can sometimes be irreproducible. Can the authors comment on this point?

### Summary
The paper proposes a system to acquire the formal definition of an optimization
model from a natural language description using LLMs. The authors describe their
approach and evaluate it empirically.

### Strengths
The proposed system is very interesting and potentially makes solving technology
much more accessible.

### Weaknesses
The proposed system is very interesting and potentially makes solving technology
much more accessible.

The acquisition of MIP and similar types of problems from high-level
descriptions and examples of solutions has long been investigated, see for
example

This work should at least be mentioned, as it is highly relevant here.

There are multiple broken references (??) throughout the paper.

### Summary
This introduction highlights the wide-ranging prevalence of optimization problems in operations, economics, engineering, and computer science. It emphasizes their significance in applications like improving energy efficiency in smart grids, refining supply chains, and enhancing profits in algorithmic trading. The paper underlines the critical role of algorithm selection and problem modeling in achieving successful solutions.
The expertise required to navigate these challenges creates a barrier for many sectors, including supermarkets, hospitals, municipalities, solar farms, and small businesses, limiting their access to optimization benefits.
The paper proposes leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) to democratize access to optimization. LLMs have demonstrated proficiency in understanding and generating natural language, offering a means to simplify problem formulation and disseminate expert knowledge. However, their role in optimization remains underexplored due to their novelty and the lack of comprehensive benchmarks.
The paper introduces three key contributions:
1. The NLP4LP dataset comprises 40 expert-formulated linear programming (LP) and mixed integer linear programming (MILP) problems. It includes annotated solutions, optimality-checking code, and sample formulations in markdown and code formats. The dataset uses a standardized format for representing optimization problems in natural language.
2. OptiMUS, an LLM-based agent designed for formulating and solving optimization problems, was introduced.
3. Developing techniques to enhance OptiMUS's performance, including automated data augmentation through problem rephrasing and self-improvement of solutions via automated testing and debugging. These techniques lead to a 67% increase in the solve rate compared to direct prompting.
In summary, the paper's contributions aim to democratize access to optimization techniques across various domains, extending their reach and utility.

### Strengths
The strengths of this paper are as follows.
1. Proposed a new framework for solving optimization problems using natural language.
2. Proposed SNOP, a new format for expressing optimization problems in natural language.
3. This paper proposed NLP4LP, a new dataset of optimization problems expressed in SNOP.

### Weaknesses
The final sentence of the first paragraph on page 4 and the enumeration at the beginning of page 7.

Weaknesses regarding the content of the text are as follows:
3. The results of solving 32 different LPs and 8 different MILPs are summed for the experiment. This bais of problem types makes it difficult to compare whether the results of the experiments are more influenced by the nature of the problem (LP or MILP) or the nature of the method.
4. The experiment in Figure 6 should describe the problems used. It is difficult to determine whether the results are the average of multiple problems or the results of solving one problem.
5. There is no description of the solver used in the experiments. We believe that the choice of solver is important to improve the success rate and execution rate. Therefore, the experiment section should state what solver was used and, if OptiMUS selected it, how it was selected.

### Questions
In addition to the above weaknesses, I would like to have the following questions answered:
1. Is there any difference between different types of problems for variation in success rate and execution rate; please tell us about the experiment results in Figure 5, focusing only on LP (MILP).
2. What is the maximum number of iterations with debugging?
