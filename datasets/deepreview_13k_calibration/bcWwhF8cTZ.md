## Abstract
Estimating out-of-distribution (OOD) error without access to the ground-truth test labels is a highly challenging, yet extremely important problem in the safe deployment of machine learning algorithms. Current works rely on the information from either the outputs or the extracted features to formulate an estimation score correlating with the expected OOD error. In this paper, we investigate--both empirically and theoretically--how the information provided by the gradients can be predictive of the OOD error. Specifically, we use the norm of classification-layer gradients, backpropagated from the cross-entropy loss with only one gradient step over OOD data. Our key idea is that the model should be adjusted with a higher magnitude of gradients when it does not generalize to the OOD dataset. We provide theoretical insights highlighting the main ingredients of such an approach ensuring its empirical success. Extensive experiments conducted on diverse distribution shifts and model structures demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms significantly.

### Summary
The paper explores the use of gradient magnitude from the classification layer as an indicator of Out-of-Distribution (OOD) data, acquired via backpropagation from the cross-entropy loss following a single gradient step. The primary notion is that the model should be fine-tuned with greater gradient magnitudes when it struggles to generalize to the OOD dataset. Empirical evidence further validates this concept.

### Strengths
S1: The paper considers using the magnitude of gradients from the classification layer as OOD indicator, obtained through backpropagation from the cross-entropy loss following a single gradient step on Out-of-Distribution (OOD) data. 

S2: The main concept revolves around the notion that the model needs to be calibrated with larger gradient magnitudes in cases where it fails to generalize to the OOD dataset. Empirical evidences also supports the idea.

### Weaknesses
1. I am afraid the paper seems to have significant overlap with the published paper in terms of the idea of using parameterization norm as a measurement: "[A] Rui Huang et al., On the Importance of Gradients for Detecting Distributional Shifts in the Wild (GradNorm)", who both consider using the gradients norm of the parameters as an indicator of OOD data. Surprisingly, the name of the approches are even the same (GradNorm). The only difference is that this paper under review is considering backpropogating vanilla softmax loss, under which the parameterization norm is computed, whereas in paper [A], an KL is computed. But this is very minor difference, as both sotfmax and KL are just distinguishes in how the distribution discrepancy is measured. I am afraid this significantly limits the novelty of the paper.  Please compare the proposed method with [A].

2. Please compare empirically with the mentioned paper and illustrates why the proposed method should have any capacity to be more advantageous than [A].

### Summary
In this work, the authors focus on the problem of Out-of-distribution (OOD) Error Estimation, which aims to estimate the test performances under distribution shifts in an unsupervised manner. Inspired by the relationship between the gradient information and the generalization ability within the deep neural network, the authors proposed a novel approach to solve the OOD error estimation problem by leveraging the magnitude of the gradient. Specifically, by analyzing the fine-tuning process of a pre-trained model on the new test data, the authors showed that the gradient information is crucial for OOD error prediction. Then, a novel statistic, named GRDNORM Score, was proposed by calculating the vector norm of the gradient of the last layer through one-step backpropagation, under a confidence-based pseudo-labeling policy. With the empirical evaluations on different datasets, network architectures, and distribution shifts, the proposed method showed its effectiveness and efficiency for OOD error prediction.

### Strengths
1. The problem that this work investigated is interesting and valuable. OOD error estimation provides a novel perspective to study how the model performs under the distribution shifts, but without accessing the ground-truth test labels.
2. The usage of gradient information to perform OOD error prediction is novel. To the best of my knowledge, the role of gradient information was less explored in the field. This work provides another viewpoint to build the relationship between the OOD performance and test data, under a data-centric perspective. The proposed method also showed the advantage of the computational overhead.
3. The motivation is clear and reasonable. The theoretical analysis and empirical verifications are promising and smooth.
4. The experiments are extensive. The proposed method is verified under different datasets, distributional shifts, etc.
5. The presentation is clear. This manuscript is well-written.

### Weaknesses
1. Some steps of the proposed highly relied on some hyperparameters, such as the confidence threshold adopted for the pseudo-labeling in Eq.(5). However, the manuscript did not provide a detailed explanation about the choice of this hyperparameter.
2. It seems that an important baseline is missing in the comparisons with the proposed method.

### Questions
1. Discussion about the pseudo-label generation process. In Eq. (5), the authors proposed to apply a threshold $\tau$ to control the confidence-based label generation process. In my understanding, if we set too small values for this hyperparameter, it seems we will assign a determined pseudo-label even for less confident samples. In contrast, using too large values for $\tau$ can be viewed as discarding more information in this process. Here are my questions:

    - 1.1. How did the authors choose a proper threshold $\tau$ in this process? I did not find any discussion or analysis for this in the main body or the appendix. But I believe the choice of this threshold does matter for the final performance.

    - 1.2 About the low-confidence case. In Eq.(5), if the maximum probability predicted by the model is still lower than a threshold $\tau$, the authors proposed to assign a random label from the label space. Is this process reasonable and can it be replaced by other methods? For example, if we set $\tau=0.5$ and a sample is predicted with  $f_{\theta} (\mathbf{x}_{i})=[0.1,0.4,0.35,0.15]$  in a four-way classification scenario. If we adopt the label-generation strategy in this paper, we should randomly generate pseudo-label from the label space $\mathcal{Y}=${0,1,2,3}. 

However, even though the maximum probability $0.4< \tau=0.5$, we can still observe that the model tends to predict $\mathbf{x}_{i}$ into Class {1,2} with higher probabilities. Thus, will we discard too much information if we naively select a random label within the whole label space? And I guess there are other ways to deal with low-confidence samples. For example:

(a) randomly generate pseudo labels from the top-$K$ largest confidences, e.g., generating from $\mathcal{Y}^{\prime}=${1,2} rather than the full label space $\mathcal{Y}=${0,1,2,3}; 

(b) directly adopt the pseudo label $[0.1,0.4,0.35,0.15]$ for this low-confident sample. 

2. It seems that a recent work [1] was missed in the comparisons between the proposed method and the baselines. In that work, the confidence and the disperity of the prediction matrix on the test dataset were considered for OOD error estimation and the nuclear norm was adopted to predict the OOD error. Could the authors provide comparisons between the proposed method and this work, both in terms of estimation performance and computational efficiency?

3. Some typos. For example:
- After Equation (2),  $\mathbf{s}_{k}$ should be  $\mathbf{s}_{w}^{k}$ be for a consistent expression;
- Before Equation (3), $\mathcal{D}_{test}=\{\tilde{\mathbf{x}}\}_{i=1}^{m}$ should be $\mathcal{D}_{test}=\{\tilde{\mathbf{x}_{i}}\}_{i=1}^{m}$

### Summary
This paper introduces an approach that leverages gradients to predict OOD errors. The authors propose a "GRDNORM Score," which quantifies the magnitude of gradients after one gradient step on OOD data. The key idea is that a model should have higher magnitude gradients when it doesn't generalize well to OOD data. The paper provides theoretical insights, demonstrating the effectiveness of this approach through extensive experiments, outperforming state-of-the-art algorithms.

### Strengths
The authors support their proposed concept with a thorough set of experiments to validate its efficacy.

### Weaknesses
 - The problem is not well defined and authors provide more details in supp. material. This way, the reader can not follow the paper well.
- Lack of novelty: In my view, this paper bears a strong resemblance to the work presented in reference [1]. The only difference with [1] in my opinion is using pseudo labels in your method which is not a significant change.

 Furthermore, it is essential to note the existence of another research study in a similar direction, as evidenced by reference [2]. I kindly request that the authors perform a comparative analysis between their paper and these two references, elucidating the primary distinctions and novel contributions of their methodology.

### Questions
I appreciate it if the authors could conduct a comparative analysis of their paper with the references [1] and [2], highlighting the key distinctions and novel aspects of their approach.

### Summary
This paper considered estimating the error in out-of-distribution samples, which is crucial in OOD problems. Specifically, this paper considered a very simple yet effective estimator -- gradient norm w.r.t the down-stream models. I.e, a sample with higher gradient norm indicates an OOD sample. Based on these arguments, theoretical analysis is done in both toy and simple settings. Empirical results clearly support the proposed metric.

### Strengths
- In general, I like the proposed idea with simple but well elegant explanations. 
- The idea seems novel for me and reasonable in some settings. 
- Extensive empirical results

Based on these points, I would recommend a borderline positive.

### Weaknesses
 - About inherent assumptions. I noticed this paper requires that the model should be calibrated. In general, I would think this assumption may not necessarily be true in several settings. For example, it has been widely proved that deep learning models are poorly calibrated. Based on this, I would suggest (1) additional experiments on the calibration error on current IN-distribution test data (2) additional limitation section about this point. Specifically, it would be useful to see the Expected Calibration Error (ECE) on the in-distribution test set, as well as on increasingly corrupted versions of the in-distribution data to understand how the calibration degrades with distribution shift. This would provide a more nuanced understanding of the method's reliance on calibrated probabilities.
- About gradient norm detection. Using gradient norm as a detector can be novel in OOD detection. While this might not be sufficiently novel in border distribution shift related papers. For example, paper [1-3] discussed the role of gradient norm/flow in meta-learning, algorithmic fairness and domain adaptation. It can be great if additional discussion is done in border distribution shift related topics. It would be beneficial to see a more detailed comparison with methods that use gradient norms for OOD detection, such as GradNorm, and clarify the specific differences and advantages of the proposed approach in this context. The current discussion is a bit too high-level.
- About the pseudo labels in the test data. I agree this is generally a non-trivial task because we never know the calibration property of deep neural-network. I was wondering two alternative scenarios (1) if we use random labels (2) we compute the average on all labels. It would be helpful to see a more detailed analysis of the sensitivity of the method to the quality of the pseudo-labels. For instance, how does the performance degrade if the pseudo-labels are generated with a model that has lower accuracy or higher calibration error? This would help to understand the robustness of the approach.
- Based on the assumption it seems a scoring detector is a sufficient estimator. I.e, a higher gradient score should be OOD and not vice versa (because it depends on the data variance, in your toy example). What do you think about sufficient and necessary conditions in estimating OOD errors? The paper should discuss more about the limitations of using gradient norm as a sufficient condition for OOD detection. Specifically, are there cases where high gradient norms do not necessarily indicate OOD samples, and vice-versa? This would help to clarify the scope and applicability of the proposed method.
