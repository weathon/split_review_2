## Abstract
Positional and structural encodings (PSE) enable better identifiability of nodes within a graph, rendering them essential tools for empowering modern GNNs, and in particular graph Transformers.
However, designing PSEs that work optimally for all graph prediction tasks is a challenging and unsolved problem.
Here, we present the 
Graph Positional and Structural Encoder (GPSE), 
the first-ever graph encoder designed to capture rich PSE \textit{representations} for augmenting any GNN.
GPSE learns an efficient common latent representation for multiple PSEs, and is highly transferable: The encoder trained on a particular graph dataset can be used effectively on datasets drawn from markedly different distributions and modalities. We show that across a wide range of benchmarks, GPSE-enhanced models can significantly outperform those that employ explicitly computed PSEs, and at least match their performance in others. Our results pave the way for the development of foundational pre-trained graph encoders for extracting positional and structural information, and highlight their potential as a more powerful and efficient alternative to explicitly computed PSEs and existing self-supervised pre-training approaches. For convenience, GPSE has also been integrated into the PyG library to facilitate downstream applications.

### Summary
The paper introduces GPSE a method to extract position and structural encodings (pse) from graphs. It can also be applied to other graph modelling tasks without the explicit need to compute the pse. The methos adopts a self-supervision style to train GPSE comprised of an encoder module which extracts the features and then passes through the decoder (MLP) to obtain the final embeddings. The loss is calculated against each of the six pse which is the target. For training, they use the MolPCBA dataset and test it against different molecular and node classification datasets.

### Strengths
- The problem of solving for transferable position and structural encoding is of high importance and relevance in the graph machine learning area.
- The paper shows extensive experiments on a variety of different datasets to validate the method of transferability across different graph types.

### Weaknesses
 - The GPSE architecture is unclear in section 2.2, even after re-reading the appendix and the section multiple times. It would have been easier to follow if the approach was explained in a step-by-step manner and aided with equations. Specifically, the input features to the encoder are not clearly defined, and the exact operations within the GatedGCN layers and the final MLP are not detailed enough to allow for replication. The description lacks precise mathematical formulations, making it difficult to understand how the node features are transformed and how the final PSEs are generated.
- The contributions in the paper seem to be limited as many of the methods have been adopted similarly but is unclear how are they different from the existing approach. It is not clear what is novel about the specific combination of GatedGCN layers, virtual nodes, and the MLP decoder, as these components are individually well-established. The paper does not adequately articulate how the proposed method differs from existing techniques for learning graph representations, particularly in the context of position and structural encodings. The novelty of the approach needs to be more clearly justified.
- Section 2.2 talks more about the general effect of over-smoothing and squashing in graph neural networks, but it is not clear what this has to do with the method of learning effective position encoding for graphs. The connection between these issues and the specific design choices in GPSE is not well-established. While over-smoothing and over-squashing are known problems, the paper does not provide a clear explanation of how these problems specifically impact the learning of PSEs and how the proposed architecture mitigates these issues in the context of learning positional encodings. The theoretical justification for the chosen architecture is weak.
- In Table 4 GPSE shows better performance on MoleculeNet dataset where it is mentioned that GPSE is at a comparative disadvantage but is this due to the nature of the dataset or the importance of structural and position to the specific dataset? It will be interesting to observe what will be the effect of GINE+{LapPE/RWSE} vs GPSE. The paper does not provide a clear analysis of why GPSE performs better in some cases despite the disadvantage. A more detailed analysis of the dataset characteristics and their relation to the performance of different PSE methods is needed. The lack of comparison with GINE+{LapPE/RWSE} makes it difficult to assess the true advantage of GPSE.
- Why are results from other datasets like (ClinTox MUV HIV) not included in Table 4 as GraphLoG is evaluated on these datasets? The absence of these results makes it difficult to compare GPSE with other methods across a broader range of datasets. The paper should provide a more comprehensive evaluation of GPSE on all datasets where comparable methods have been tested.
- Why are GNN models used as a baseline for testing the extreme OOD node-classification benchmarks (table 6) instead it will be interesting to see how transformer+GPSE will perform on the dataset as they don't have the inductive bias of GNNs. The choice of baselines is not well-justified, and the paper should include a comparison with transformer-based models to assess the performance of GPSE in a broader context. The inductive bias of GNNs might be advantageous for the specific datasets used, but the paper should also explore the performance of GPSE with models that do not have this bias.
- The paper [1] has a similar research question and method to GPSE, can the authors help me understand the difference?
- For SSL the methods are generally pre-trained and then fine-tuned on down-stream tasks, whereas in GPSE the base model GINE is augmented with learned pse and trained from scratch, how does this comparison seem to stand out? The comparison to the baseline of GINE from Hu et al. (2020b) is fair, but how can it be compared to SSL techniques?

### Questions
- Section 2.2 talks more about the general effect of over-smoothing and squashing in graph neural networks, but it is not clear what this has to do with the method of learning effective position encoding for graphs. Why is it relevant to the problem?
- In Table 4 GPSE shows better performance on MoleculeNet dataset where it is mentioned that GPSE is at a comparative disadvantage but is this due to the nature of the dataset or the importance of structural and position to the specific dataset? It will be interesting to observe what will be the effect of GINE+{LapPE/RWSE} vs GPSE.

### Summary
The paper introduces the Graph Positional and Structural Encoder (GPSE), an approach for training graph encoders to effectively capture positional and structural encodings (PSEs) within graphs. 
These encodings are pivotal for identifying node roles and relationships, a challenge accentuated by the inherent absence of a standard node ordering in graph structures. 
GPSE shows the capability to learn and apply these PSEs across a wide range of graph datasets, with potential to match or even surpass the performance of explicitly computed PSEs. 
The encoder stands out for its adaptability and proficiency in various graph dimensions and types.


The paper details a method to train a Message Passing Neural Network (MPNN) as a graph encoder, focusing primarily on the extraction of positional and structural representations from query graphs based solely on their structure. 
This extraction utilizes a set of PSEs in a predictive learning framework. 
Post training, the encoder can adeptly apply these PSEs to augment models (both MPNNs and Transformers) across various datasets. 
The design includes diverse PSE types such as Laplacian eigenvectors and eigenvalues, electrostatic and random walk structural encodings, heat kernel structural encodings, and cycle counting graph encodings. 
These PSEs provide insights into a node's relative position (positional encodings) and the local connectivity patterns (structural encodings), enhancing the understanding of graph structures.

### Strengths
This study presents a noteworthy contribution to the field of graph neural networks, particularly in its architectural and methodological approach. 
The originality of the paper lies in its integration of PSEs within GNNs, targeting the specific challenges of graph representation learning. 
While the concept might not completely redefine the foundational theories of graph neural networks, it innovatively combines existing ideas to enhance the representation and processing of graph structures, demonstrating a balanced level of originality.

In terms of quality and clarity, the paper is methodically sound, though it might benefit from a more in-depth exploration of its theoretical underpinnings. 
The clarity of presentation is commendable, with technical details and concepts explained in a manner that strikes a balance between depth and accessibility. 
The significance of the research, while notable, appears more confined to immediate practical applications rather than setting a new paradigm. Nevertheless, its potential impact in improving model performance in various graph-related tasks.

### Weaknesses
The research primarily excels in engineering advancements for graph neural networks, focusing more on practical architectural solutions than on extending theoretical foundations. 
Although these innovations address key issues in GNNs, they potentially add complexity and computational overhead that aren't thoroughly examined.

The model's performance, when combined with GPSE, is less impressive, considering its complexity, which includes 20 MPNN layers, MLP heads for each PSE, a gating mechanism, and a virtual node.

For fair comparison in Table 2 and Table 3, GPSE should be compared not only with single combinations like GPS+LapPE or GPS+RWSE, but also with a more comprehensive set-up, including GPS+LapPE+ElstaticPE+RWSE+EigValSE+HKdiagSE+CycleSE, with simple projection layers for each PSE type.

In Table 4, GPSE appears to be less advantageous compared to the SSL `Self-supervised pre-trained (Hu et al., 2020b)` model. 
(Hu et al. outperform GPSE on 3 out of 5 datasets by some margins)

### Confidence
4: You are confident in your assessment, but not absolutely certain. It is unlikely, but not impossible, that you did not understand some parts of the submission or that you are unfamiliar with some pieces of related work.

### Summary
The paper proposes GPSE, a framework that can be used to pretrain an encoder in order to _learn_ a diverse set of positional and structural encodings, given an input graph augmented with random node features. The authors show good empirical results on a diverse set of downstream tasks when using the pretrained encoder to extract the encodings.

### Strengths
Results on some datasets are promising, like those obtained on ZINC.

### Weaknesses
The authors have __not__ shown the advantage of learning the encodings instead of computing them directly on the dataset of downstream task of interest. In each table the direct competitor should be the GNN predictor directly augmented with __all__ the positional and structural encodings (that are learned by GPSE). For example, Table 2 should include "GPS + LapPE + ElstaticPE + EigValSE + RSWE + HKdiagSE + CycleSE". Comparing only to "GPS + LapPE" or "GPS + RWSE" is unfair, and no conclusion can be drawn from it as it might be that simply using one of the other encodings lead to better results, so the role of the pretraining is less clear.

It is unclear how the authors deal with sign and basis ambiguity. Consider for example LapPE. When training GPSE, what is the sign of the target LapPE? What about the basis? The authors should clarify how they handle the sign ambiguity, as taking the absolute value of the eigenvectors can significantly degrade the expressive power of the encodings. Furthermore, the basis ambiguity is a well-known problem in spectral graph theory, and the authors should discuss how their method addresses or is affected by it.

### Questions
Please clarify the importance of learning the encodings. Otherwise the conclusion is that using all those encodings is better than using no encoding, and and it is unclear what is the impact of computing them directly on the input graph instead of learning them in a pretraining step that uses MolPCBA.
Also consider the problem of sign and basis ambiguity.

### Summary
This paper introduces the graph positional and structural encoder (GPSE), which is the first attempt to create a graph encoder that can generate rich PSE representations for GNNs. GPSE can learn representations for a variety of PSEs and is notably adaptable. When trained on a large molecular graph dataset, it can be applied successfully to different datasets, even those with differing distributions or modalities. The study shows that GPSE-enhanced models can either improve performance or match the results of models using explicitly computed PSEs. This contribution suggests the potential for large pre-trained models in extracting graph positional and structural information, positioning them as strong alternatives to current methods.

### Strengths
- The paper is well structured, easy to follow.
- The introduced GPSE model stands out for its simplicity, consistently delivering results either superior to or on par with hand-crafted PSEs.
- A commendable effort has been made in terms of the ablation studies, providing comprehensive insights into the proposed model.

### Weaknesses
1.  **Comparison with related work:** While the paper does touch upon the LSPE (Dwivedi et al. 2021) – which shares similarities in learning positional representations along with the prediction task – a more detailed comparison is crucial to identify the unique contributions of the present work. Specifically, the paper should clarify how GPSE's approach to learning positional encodings differs from LSPE's, particularly in terms of the architectural choices and the types of positional information captured. It is also important to discuss the limitations of LSPE that GPSE aims to address.
2.  **Clarity on computational complexity:** A major limitation of most hand-crafted PSEs is their high complexity on large graphs. The paper could benefit from a deeper dive into GPSE's computational complexity, particularly when compared against the often complex hand-crafted PSEs and other encoding strategies. The analysis should include a breakdown of the time and space complexity of GPSE, as well as a comparison with the computational costs associated with calculating various hand-crafted PSEs, such as shortest path distances or Laplacian eigenvectors. This is crucial for understanding the practical scalability of GPSE.
3.  **Missing baseline method:** Throughout the experiments, GPSE is compared against individual PSEs. Considering GPSE is designed to capture multiple PSE representations, a comparison against a combined baseline which concatenates various PSEs – akin to those used in GPSE's pre-training – would offer a more fair evaluation. This baseline should explore different concatenation strategies and potentially include a learned projection layer to ensure a fair comparison.

**Minor points**
- **Assumptions about Audience:** The introduction might be challenging for those new to the field, given the use of specific terms like "1-WL bounded expressiveness" and "over-squashing" without much elucidation.

### Questions
- Q1: For downstream tasks, is the pretrained GPSE kept frozen or is it finetuned? Would fine-tuning the GPSE improve its performance? It is noteworthy that, in other modalities like NLP and computer vision, fine-tuning pretrained models often outperforms freezing pretrained models.

I will be happy to increase my rating if the authors can address all my concerns and questions.
