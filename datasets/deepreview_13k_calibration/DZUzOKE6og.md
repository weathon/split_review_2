Hypergraphs are marked by complex topology, expressing higher-order interactions among multiple nodes with hyperedges, and
better capturing the topology is essential for effective representation learning.
Recent advances in generative self-supervised learning (SSL) suggest that hypergraph neural networks learned from generative self-supervision have the potential to effectively encode the complex hypergraph topology.
Designing a generative SSL strategy for hypergraphs, however, is not straightforward.
Questions remain with regard to its generative SSL task, connection to downstream tasks, and empirical properties of learned representations.
In light of the promises and challenges, we propose a novel generative SSL strategy for hypergraphs. 
We first formulate a generative SSL task on hypergraphs, \textit{hyperedge filling}, and highlight its theoretical connection to node classification.
{Based on} the generative SSL task, we propose a hypergraph SSL method, \method.
\method~learns {effective} general-purpose hypergraph representations, outperforming 16 baseline methods across 11 benchmark datasets.

### Summary
This paper introduces the first generative SSL methods, especially designed for hypergraph learning. The proposed self-supervised task is to fill in the missing node from an incomplete hyperedge. The authors show theoretically and empirically that, unde some conditions, this self-supervised task is well aligned with hypernode classification, achieving better results than other contrastive SSL methods from the hypergraph literature.

### Strengths
- The paper identify and fill in a gap existent in the hypergraph literature: designing generative SSL tasks for hypergraph representation learning. The proposed hyperedge filling task is intuitive and well-suited for hypergraph representation learning. The theoretical finding enhances confidence in the approach.
- The experimental section is comprehensive, demonstrating the individual contribution of each component.
- The paper is generally well written.

### Weaknesses
 - All the SSL-based results presented in the paper uses UniGCNII as a backbone. The authors motivate this decision by saying that this combinations achieves best overall performances. While I consider the comparison fair (since all the reported baselines uses UniGCNII as well), it is essential to conduct experiments that demonstrate the method's advantages when applied with various backbones. This additional experiments would clearly demonstrate the advantages of the proposed method. 
- While the authors did a good job in explaining the intuition behind this, it is somewhat discouraging to observe that the suggested approach performs noticeably worse when the feature reconstruction warmup is omitted (Table 3)
- Minor: It would be useful to include the UNIGCNII baseline (without any of the 3 component) as a line in Table 3
- Given the big improvement brought by the augmentation (masking) scheme (Table 6 in appendix), I am curious to know if the other baseline methods benefit from a similar augmentation step.

### Summary
The paper introduces a generative self-supervised learning task called "hypergraph filling"  and explores generative self-supervised learning on hypergraphs. The author focuses on addressing issues related to overemphasized proximity, dimensional collapse, and non-uniformity/alignment problems in learned representations. To tackle these issues, the author proposes the "HYPEBOY" strategy for hypergraphs, both in theory and through empirical experiments. Furthermore, the author demonstrates the effectiveness of this approach in tasks such as node classification and link prediction.

### Strengths
The author effectively identifies the issue of overemphasized proximity and demonstrates the beneficial impact of augmentation. Additionally, to address the problem of dimensional collapse, the author introduces a two-stage training scheme, which helps reduce the reliance on projection heads.

### Weaknesses
1. The rationale behind employing generative SSL for hypergraph representation is not convincingly established, and it confronts several challenges, including dimensional collapse. Specifically, the paper does not adequately justify why a generative approach is superior to other self-supervised methods for hypergraphs, especially given the known issues with generative models such as mode collapse and difficulty in training. The paper needs to provide a more rigorous argument for why the hypergraph filling task is a suitable pretext task for learning useful node representations, beyond empirical results.
2. The author devises a SSL strategy for hypergraphs by utilizing existing encoders and decoders such as UniGCNII, HNN, and MLP, without introducing any novel model designs. The concept of the projection head for hypergraph encoding is inspired by Deep Sets[1]. The lack of novel architectural contributions raises concerns about the originality and impact of the work. The method appears to be an application of existing techniques to a new domain, rather than a significant advancement in hypergraph representation learning.
3.The author utilizes UniGCNII[2] as an encoder for HYPERBOY, and primarily focuses on homogeneous hypergraphs. However, it's important to note that heterogeneous hypergraphs are also prevalent, and the embedding method for hyperedges is not discussed. The paper's limited scope to homogeneous hypergraphs significantly restricts its applicability, and the absence of a discussion on hyperedge embeddings is a notable omission, given their importance in many hypergraph analysis tasks.

### Questions
1. It's not straightforward to extend edge reconstruction methods to hyperedges in SSL. Considering this challenge, why did the author choose to employ SSL for hypergraphs without addressing the embeddings of hyperedges explicitly.
2. Could you elaborate on the real-world applications of the hypergraph filling task? How is this task practically relevant?
3. The author uses Gaussian distribution, Bernoulli sampling, and binomial distribution in the method. Could you explain the reasoning behind these choices and how they compare to more conventional methods like attention strategies and neural network approaches?

### Summary
The paper makes an in-time contribution to studying the generative pretraining strategy for hypergraph neural networks. Specifically,  a novel generative SSL task on hypergraphs, hyperedge filling, is proposed, with the sound analysis demonstrating its effectiveness for node classification tasks. Extensive experiments are performed to support the claim.

The main intuition behind the magic of hyperedge filling is that the hyperedge, when it satisfies the homophily assumption, is indicative of the node membership and eventually helps node classification. This analysis supports the intuition. Although there might be some inconsistency between theory and practice, I appreciate the analysis part a lot.

### Strengths
- Nice and reasonable intuition to motivate the algorithm: The forming of hyperedge indicates the nodes share the same (or similar) membership. This might be motivated by the stochastic block models. It is a great intuition and I think it fits many applications such as social networks.
- Sound theoretical analysis to support the intuition. This is done by analyzing how the representations change to optimize hypergraph filling loss can improve node classification results.
- Extensive empirical results are provided. More appreciatively, the numerical characteristics, such as proximity, are examined to reach certain conclusions.

### Weaknesses
I do not have major criticisms for this paper. I only have some questions regarding the analysis part, which might result from missing some points during reading.

-  In the hyperedge filling analysis, it seems to not relate to the neural network architecture. How do authors think the choice of the hypergraph neural networks would affect the performance?
- In the hyperedge filling process (F2), the representation is updated with a gradient w.r.t. the hyperedge filling loss and a step size $\gamma$. Per my reading of the proof, the value of $\gamma$ (only need to be greater than 0) seems to not affect the result, while in practice this might not be true. Do I miss some points here?
- Is the edge filling optimal to perform as it is in hypergraphs? Considering I am gonna perform clique expansion to get a graph and perform edge filling. How would the result be different?

### Summary
This article proposes a novel self-supervised learning (SSL) task, hyperedge filling. The authors also give the relationship between hyperedge filling and node classification. Based on the SSL task, the authors propose HypeBoy, which is composed of 3 steps, hypergraph augmentation, hypergraph encoding, and hypergraph filling. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of HypeBoy under multiple SSL tasks on multiple datasets.

### Strengths
1. The article proposes a novel SSL task, hyperedge filling, which is a supplement to the general node classification task.
2. The hyperedge-filling task proposed in the article can obtain more accurate node features, thereby helping other tasks.

### Weaknesses
1. In the hypothesis, the premise of the article is that each hyperedge contains most of the same category vertices. However, there are hyperedges that do not satisfy this situation. For example, a hyperedge of size 10 contains 5 nodes of category A and 5 category B.
2. One of the main contributions of the paper is hyperedge filling, but using only hyperedge filling (v1) in the ablation experiment is the worst among v1-v4. The effectiveness of using hyperedge filling alone is questionable, or it needs to be bound to feature reconstruction and projection heads.

### Questions
1. In BASIC SETTING, one of the assumptions is that the homophily ratio of each hyperedge is in [0.5, 1]. In graphs, the homophily rate is defined as the proportion of intra-class edges to all edges. So how does this definition apply to the hypergraph? Do all datasets in the experiments satisfy this assumption?
2. I noticed that in section 5.1, the article uses a setting of 1% of the training set, which is different from most articles. Most other papers use fixed division or 5/10 nodes per category. I'm curious about what the considerations are for such an experimental setup?
