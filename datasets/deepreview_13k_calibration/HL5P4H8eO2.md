## Abstract
This paper introduces DiffTOP, a new policy class for reinforcement learning and imitation learning that utilizes differentiable trajectory optimization to generate the policy actions. Trajectory optimization is a powerful and widely used algorithm in control, parameterized by a cost and a dynamics function. The key to our approach is to leverage the recent progress in differentiable trajectory optimization, which enables computing the gradients of the loss with respect to the parameters of trajectory optimization. As a result, the cost and dynamics functions of trajectory optimization can be learned end-to-end, e.g., using the policy gradient loss in reinforcement learning, or using the imitation loss in imitation learning. When applied to model-based reinforcement learning, DiffTOP addresses the “objective mismatch” issue of prior algorithms, as the dynamics model in DiffTOP is learned to directly maximize task performance by differentiating the policy gradient loss through the trajectory optimization process. When applied to imitation learning, DiffTOP performs test-time trajectory optimization to compute the actions with a learned cost function, outperforming prior methods that only perform forward passes of the policy network to generate actions. We benchmark DiffTOP on 15 model-based RL tasks, and 13 imitation learning tasks with high-dimensional image and point cloud inputs, and show that it outperforms prior state-of-the-art methods in both domains.

### Summary
The paper introduces DiffTOP, a novel policy class for reinforcement learning (RL) and imitation learning (IL) that employs differentiable trajectory optimization to generate policy actions. This approach leverages recent advancements in differentiable trajectory optimization, allowing end-to-end learning of cost and dynamics functions through gradient computation. DiffTOP addresses the "objective mismatch" problem in model-based RL by optimizing the dynamics and reward models to directly maximize task performance. For imitation learning, it outperforms previous methods by optimizing actions with a learned cost function at test time.

The authors benchmark DiffTOP on 15 model-based RL tasks and 13 imitation learning tasks with high-dimensional inputs like images and point clouds. The results show that DiffTOP surpasses prior state-of-the-art methods in both domains. The paper also includes an analysis and ablation studies to provide insights into DiffTOP's learning procedure and performance gains.

In summary, the contributions of the paper are:

1) Proposing DiffTOP, which uses differentiable trajectory optimization for RL and IL.
2) Demonstrating through extensive experiments that DiffTOP achieves state-of-the-art results in both RL and IL with high-dimensional sensory observations.
3) Providing analysis and ablation studies to understand the learning process and performance improvements of DiffTOP.

### Strengths
The paper presents a robust and technically rigorous study, bolstered by a comprehensive suite of experiments and ablation studies. Some of the experiments are performed in notably challenging environments, showcasing the strength of the proposed method. It addresses the complex "objective mismatch" problem inherent in model-based reinforcement learning. The overall style of the paper is commendable, with clear and detailed descriptions of the experimental setup, network architectures, and hyperparameters, as well as well-structured pseudocode.

### Weaknesses
No big weaknesses overall. It would be good to see the comparison of the computational efficiency of given algorithms and plots for return vs wall-clock time in addition to the number of samples.

### Questions
1) Are there any cases when TD-MPC performs or could theoretically perform better than DiffTOP?
2) What’s the computational cost of using Theseus for differentiable trajectory optimization vs MPPI?
3) Could you share the training plots of returns vs wall-clock time at least for some of the environments? It would be useful to compare not only the sample but also the computational efficiency of the different algorithms.

### Confidence
3: You are fairly confident in your assessment. It is possible that you did not understand some parts of the submission or that you are unfamiliar with some pieces of related work. Math/other details were not carefully checked.

### Summary
The paper proposes DiffTOP an algorithm that extends TD-MPC to include additional losses for imitation learning and reinforcement learning. The proposed algorithm is evaluated on many examples including the standard RL benchmark tasks as well as many imitation learning tasks.

### Strengths
The paper has a lot of evaluations on many standard benchmark tasks. The number of evaluations is very impressive in both the RL as well as the imitation learning domain. Furthermore, the algorithm seems to perform comparable or better to the TD-MPC baseline.

### Weaknesses
While the number of experiments is very impressive, the amount of content condensed into 9 pages is a bit too much. It seems like the authors wanted to press every little piece of information into the limited pages which drastically reduced readability. It would be great if the authors would go back to the drawing board and prioritize what is the important information and elaborate on these parts. For example, the algorithm is still very unclear to me, which model parameters exist and are optimized together. It would be great if the authors could introduce their algorithm more slowly and rely on less knowledge from the TD-MPC paper. While mentioning the relation to TD-MPC is important, requiring excellent knowledge of TD-MPC to read the paper is very limiting.

I am a bit torn on whether to score marginally above or below the acceptance threshold. While contribution and experimental evaluation are appropriate, the clarity of the presentation clearly lacks significantly and for me personally the clarity of the research is a major evaluation criterion.

### Questions
I have questions regarding the additional PG loss for the RL case. Does it make sense to optimize the model parameters w.r.t. the Q-function? Wouldn't this loss let the dynamics model prefer to hallucinate to obtain a high q-function? Learning the dynamics and reward model is a supervised learning problem while learning the q-function is not. Therefore, I would expect that the supervised learning problem is much easier and imagine that the additional information flowing through this additional PG loss is not that important. What is the intuition of the authors for the additional PG loss? For imitation learning, the motivation for the additional bc loss is much clearer.


**Post Rebuttal Comment:**

All good with me. I think the authors could still drastically improve the paper by reworking the writing. However, as the other reviewers are happy with the writing, it is fine with me. In the rebuttal the authors mainly added small band-aids to the text without rethinking the structure of the paper but I mean that is quite common for all rebuttals. I increased my score to weak-accept.

As there will inevitably be errors in the learned dynamics model, the additional PG loss regularizes the dynamics model to have low error in states and actions that lead to high rewards, i.e., those that are important for maximizing the task performance, instead of driving the dynamics model to hallucinate. Besides, we keep the dynamics prediction loss term when training the dynamics model, which should also prevent hallucination.

The sentence is quite good and should be added to the paper.

### Summary
This paper leverages sensitivity analysis capabilities of trajectory optimization in order to differentiate the optimal solution with respect to problem parameters. This allows trajectory optimization to be used as a differentiable policy architecture, and the authors show that this has use cases in model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL) and imitation learning (IL). In MBRL, the latent-space encoder, latent-space dynamics, and the reward function parameters are learned within DiffTOP. In IL, the output of DiffTOP is forced to match the provided actions and DiffTOP carries out efficient inverse RL. The authors show that the proposed policy class outperforms baselines such as diffusion policies and IBCs.

### Strengths
1. Overall, the paper is well-written and the methods and results are easy to follow for people familiar with the existing methods.
2. The authors carry out extensive empirical testing across many baselines, the diversity of the considered benchmarks and baselines is quite appreciated. 
3. The authors convincingly tell a story of objective mismatch in MBRL, and point out that DiffTOP is able to learn a representation that is not only better for minimizing dynamics error but also better for control. The contribution in the space of MBRL is quite strong.

### Weaknesses
1. How do the authors ensure that a reasonable answer is found in the process of nonlinear trajectory optimization with gradients? If the cost and dynamics was learned to formulate a convex trajectory optimization problem, this would not be a problem as the encoder is forced to learn a representation of that form. However the authors propose to use a fully nonlinear formulation and it's not clear how the training pipeline would be robust against finding bad local minima.

2. The contribution in the IL seems a bit weaker compared to MBRL. In the setting of imitation learning, it seems that the authors are performing a version of inverse RL (which similarly does not assume access to rewards, but learns rewards and dynamics from demonstrations). Making connections to previous methods within inverse RL would be good.

3. "For DiffTOP, we always use a base policy to generate the action initialization for the trajectory optimization problem" - this makes the comparison between other methods a bit unclear as other methods did not start with an informed initial guess. The experiment results make it seem like DiffTOP cannot be used as a standalone tool for IL, but rather a tool for the purposes of refinement; yet the method section is proposing a standalone IL algorithm.

### Questions
1. The introduction of CVAE to generate multimodal samples is reasonable, but there are many other routes that might potentially handle the multimodality problem. For instance, it seems cheaper and more efficient to consider a differentiable stochastic trajectory optimization framework where a small amount of noise can be added to the action at every step, which forces trajectory optimization itself to be a stochastic procedure that will generate multimodal actions. Have the authors considered this formulation?

2. CVAEs tend to be harder to train compared to recent diffusion-based generative models. Is it possible to train a diffusion model instead of address the multimodality problem? Maybe it is difficult since the author's framework requires latent states?

3. How does DiffTOP perform without informed initial guesses in the RoboMimic experiment?

### Summary
The paper proposes DiffTOP, a novel policy class for sequential decision problems that is applicable to both reinforcement and imitation learning. The main idea is to use differential policy optimization to find efficiently a sequence of actions for a fixed starting state, given current estimates of the parameters that parameterize the observation-to-state encoder and the reward function and system dynamics in learned state space. The policy gradient is used to improve the estimates of the parameters, and because the computation of the action sequence is differentiable with respect to the parameters, the policy gradient ends up being differentiable with respect to the parameters, too.

### Strengths
The ability to compute policy gradients directly with respect to the parameters that describe the observation and transition model is a major advance, eliminating the need to do sample-based estimates. Another major strength, shared with the TD-MPC algorithm on which DiffTOP is based, is that model learning does not have to be done ahead of time, thus alleviating the model mismatch problem that is central to model-based reinforcement learning. A third strength of the paper is the very solid empirical verification of the approach on many control problems, both in the reinforcement and imitation learning setting.

### Weaknesses
It appears that the trajectory optimization solver the authors are using, Theseus, does not support constraint optimization, so they have to manually unroll the dynamics, instead of presenting it as a constraint to the optimizer, as is the usual practice in trajectory optimization. This does not look very convenient, and it also raises concerns about the scalability of the approach to longer horizons. Manually unrolling the dynamics can lead to very large computational graphs, which might become difficult to handle as the planning horizon increases. Furthermore, this manual unrolling might make it harder to incorporate more complex constraints in the future, such as collision avoidance or other safety requirements, which are often formulated as constraints in trajectory optimization.

### Questions
Is the inability of Theseus to solve a constraint optimization version of the problem a fundamental limitation of how it works, or simply something not implemented yet? Maybe it solves non-linear least-squares problems analytically, and adding constraints would make this impossible?
