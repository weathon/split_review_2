## Abstract
Idempotence is the stability of image codec to re-compression. At the first glance, it is unrelated to perceptual image compression. However, we find that theoretically: 1) Conditional generative model-based perceptual codec satisfies idempotence; 2) Unconditional generative model with idempotence constraint is equivalent to conditional generative codec. Based on this newfound equivalence, we propose a new paradigm of perceptual image codec by inverting unconditional generative model with idempotence constraints. Our codec is theoretically equivalent to conditional generative codec, and it does not require training new models. Instead, it only requires a pre-trained mean-square-error codec and unconditional generative model. Empirically, we show that our proposed approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods such as HiFiC \citep{Mentzer2020HighFidelityGI} and ILLM \citep{muckley2023improving}, in terms of Fréchet Inception Distance (FID).

### Summary
This paper studies the relation between the idempotence and perceptual image compression and find that the two are highly correlated. Specifically, the authors theoretically prove that: (1). conditional generative model-based perceptual codec satisfies idempotence; (2). Unconditional generative model with idempotence constraint is equivalent to conditional generative codec. 
They also propose a new paragidm of perceptual image codec by inverting unconditional generative model with idempotence constraints, based on the above findings. The proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of perceptual quality metric, such as Frechet Inception Distance (FID).

### Strengths
-  This paper is the first to study the relation between the idempotence and perceptual image compression methods.
-  The findings are very interesting and motivating, the high correlation between the idempotence and perceptual image compression may benefit both above compression areas.
-  The theoretical analysis is rigorous and solid.
-  The proposed new compression method achieves better perceptual quality than the competing methods.

### Weaknesses
 - I admit that the findings of high correlation between  the idempotence and perceptual image compression are intersting and meaningful. However, the  subsequent idea of "perceptual image compression by inversion" does not bring new insights or knowledge. Apply generative model inversion on the low-level tasks such as super-resolution has been well studied for several years. The proposed method seems to just change the task from super-resolution to image compression. Applying a proven methodology to a similar task is, in my opinion, hardly meets the ICLR's bar. The core idea of inverting a generative model to perform compression lacks novelty, as the methodology is directly borrowed from super-resolution techniques. While the authors demonstrate that this approach works for compression, the fundamental concept remains the same as existing inversion-based methods. The adaptation to a new task, while technically sound, does not provide a significant conceptual advancement. The paper does not sufficiently explore the unique challenges and constraints of image compression compared to super-resolution, and it does not provide sufficient justification for why this approach is particularly well-suited for compression beyond the empirical results. The paper would benefit from a more thorough discussion of the differences between these tasks and how the proposed method addresses them.

### Questions
- In the experiments, a MSE optimized codec is used as the base model. Have the authors tried other codecs (perceptual optimized or mixed)?
- Could the authors provide more results on other metrics, such as KID, LPIPS?

### Summary
This paper reveals the relationship between idempotence and perceptual image compression. There are two important theorems derived in this paper: (1) Perceptual quality (i.e., conditional generative model) brings idempotence. (2) Idempotence brings perceptual quality, with unconditional generative model. A specific idea in this paper is a new paradigm to achieve perceptual image compression by applying generative model inversion with pretrained models, which is conceptually simple but useful in practice. Experimental results also demonstrate the effectiveness of this idea  (Table 1 and Figure 3).

### Strengths
The relationship between idempotence and perceptual image compression revealed in this paper is surprising and insightful. The conclusion would be unintuitive before I successfully follow all the derivations in this paper. In fact, the derivations in this paper are not difficult. Theorems 1&2 well summarize the main conclusions of this paper. If there is no technical errors regarding the derivations (at least I didn't find), the proposed idea in this paper, i.e., using generative model inversion to improve perceptual image compression (Section4.1), may form a new paradigm in this field, which is sound in theory and useful in practice. The pratical implementation can be summarized as: first use pretrained generative models to produce an image $\hat{X}$ and encode it into $f_0(\hat{X})$, then constrain the idempotence between $f_0(\hat{X})$ and Y using gradient descent-based inversion. These steps are easy to implement with a pretrained codec and a pretrained unconditional generative model.

Experimental results clearly demonstrate the effectiveness of this idea. Also, the presentation of this paper is great. Overall, I would be happy to accept this paper although I have two major concerns as written in the weaknesses part.

### Weaknesses
Despite the above strengths of this paper, there are two main issues especially after I ran the code provided as supplementary material.  
(1) The time complexity of generative model inversion should be considered in practice (Table 4), which I personally believe there is space to improve it in the future. For example, now the authors are using DDPM with 1000 steps. There are some latest unconditional generative models largely reducing the number of generation steps.   
(2) The issue regarding the image resolution should be paid with more attention. We can imagine that the gradient descent-based inversion would be hard to be implemented on high-resolution images. In the experimental section of this paper, it is stated like "central crop image by their short edge and rescale them to 256 × 256", which means almost all experiments are performed on this scale. On the one hand, some baseline models are trained for high-resolution generation or generative compression, and it may be unfair to directly compare with their pretrained models. On the other hand, it implies that the current method is hard to be applied to high-resolution images without cropping.

### Questions
See the abovementioned weaknesses.    
In addition, the approach proposed in this paper can utilize pre-trained unconditional generative model for compression at different bitrates. In Figure 9, it seems the advantage of the proposed method is more significant at 0.17bpp, compared with original ELIC. However, the result at 0.11 bpp seems to be weird, which is definitely what we do not want in practice. Is there is potential solution or idea to solve this issue?

### Summary
The paper proposes a theoretical justification for consideration of idempotence in the task of generative image compression. This includes a couple of theoretical results: the first is that a perceptual codec is idempotent, and the second is that an MSE-optimal codec paired with an unconditional generative model is optimal in terms of rate-distortion-perception theory. The paper includes a suite of empirical studies to justify the theory, showing that the inclusion of an idempotence constraint in the sampling process of a generative model (on top of a pretrianed MSE codec) gives better rate-distortion-perception performance than the previous methods considered when using a DDPM+DPS diffusion model sampler.

### Strengths
This paper makes contributions on a number of areas to the field of generative image compression.

1. It presents a theoretical justification for why generative codecs should be idempotent.
2. It presents a theoretical justification for why an MSE-optimal codec paired with an unconditional model. This is an approach considered by other works in the field such as (Hoogeboom, 2023) and (Ghouse, 2023).
3. Empirical results further justify the insights of theory, as the presented method is optimal among all generative codecs considered.
4. Empirical results include ablations over the base MSE autoencoder, which allows fair comparisons to both the ILLM and HiFiC methods of previous work (which use older autoencoders).
5. Qualitative results of the images are compelling.

### Weaknesses
1. The primary weakness is a lack of comparison to other diffusion-based methods. The only diffusion method considered is CDC, which may be relatively underpowered vs. DIRAC. CDC is almost certainly underpowered vs. the work of (Hoogeboom, 2023). Furthermore, the authors do not compare against the released images from (Agustsson, 2022) which would provide a more comprehensive evaluation. The absence of these comparisons makes it difficult to assess the true performance of the proposed method relative to the state-of-the-art in diffusion-based generative compression.
2. The x-domain constraint seems identical to that of (Hoogeboom, 2023), which raises concerns about the novelty of this aspect of the method. A more detailed explanation of the differences, if any, is needed to justify this contribution.
3. The paper uses a third-party implementation of HiFiC with a different training set that may give divergent results from the original paper. This makes direct comparisons less reliable. The authors should use the official models provided by the authors of the HiFiC paper to ensure a fair comparison. The availability of these models at https://github.com/tensorflow/compression makes this a readily addressable issue.
4. Only two metrics are considered: FID and PSNR. Most other compression works include more metrics, such as LPIPS, to gauge model performance across a variety of axes. The lack of these additional metrics makes it difficult to fully understand the strengths and weaknesses of the proposed method, especially in terms of perceptual quality and image fidelity.

### Questions
1. The failures of many of the generative models to give good results suggests a divergence between theory in practice, i.e., although the theory suggests any unconditional generator will do, the generators that we have available to us and their various samplers exhibit widely different properties. Did the authors consider discussing this in the Discussion?
2. Could you clarify why you used the OASIS FID implementation as opposed to the FID/256 method that is more standard in the compression community?
3. The rate-distortion-perception tradeoff is portrayed in a confusing way in Figure 8 of the Appendix. Is the reason that you could not match bpps between methods as done in Figure 1 of (Muckley, 2023)?
4. Would you consider to use language other than "perception" to describe distributional divergence? "Perception" is an overloaded term in the compression community and does not intuitively describe the phenomena of the paper. Although it is true that "perception" is the term of Blau/Michaeli to describe divergence phenomena, others in the community have adopted more specific teams such as "realism" or "statistical fidelity" that lead to less confusion with human perception.

### Summary
This text introduces a new concept of idempotence within image codec stability, revealing its unexpected relationship with perceptual image compression. By leveraging this understanding, the proposed method utilizes idempotence constraints to invert unconditional generative models, presenting an equivalent and improved paradigm for perceptual image codecs.

### Strengths
This paper presents a new paradigm of perceptual image codec, which could bring new insight to the community. The approach doesn't necessitate new model training but rather utilizes pre-trained mean-square-error codecs and unconditional generative models.

### Weaknesses
However, I also have some concerns as follows:

1) The relationship between idempotence and image compression is hard to understand in the current version.

2) Authors should provide more evidence to support the points that Idempotence brings perceptual quality in Section 3.

3) I can't see the superiority of the proposed method in the visual comparison with HiFiC and ILLM, especially in Fig 1.

4) In BD-FID, the proposed method is better. But in BD-PSNR, others may be better. Could authors provide more evaluation metrics, such as MSSSIM and VMAF.
