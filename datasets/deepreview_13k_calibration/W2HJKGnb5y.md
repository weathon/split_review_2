## Abstract
First-order gradient descent has been the base of the most successful optimization algorithms ever implemented.
On supervised learning problems with very high dimensionality, such as neural network optimization, it is almost always the algorithm of choice, mainly due to its memory and computational efficiency.
However, it is a classical result in optimization that gradient descent converges to local minima on non-convex functions. Even more importantly, in certain high-dimensional cases, escaping the plateaus of large saddle points becomes intractable.
On the other hand, black-box optimization methods are not sensitive to the local structure of a loss function's landscape but suffer the curse of dimensionality.
Instead, memetic algorithms aim to combine the benefits of both.
Inspired by this, we present Population Descent, a memetic algorithm focused on hyperparameter optimization.
We show that an adaptive $m$-elitist selection approach combined with a normalized-fitness-based randomization scheme outperforms more complex state-of-the-art algorithms by up to 13\% on common benchmark tasks.

### Summary
This paper proposes a memetic algorithm, Population Descent, which combines the benefits of gradient descent and black-box optimization methods. POPDESCENT is based on population-based evolution, helping to explore more space in the loss function and performing better than existing frameworks. Experiments on FMNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets demonstrate its effectiveness.

### Strengths
1. The considered problem is important.
2. The idea of combining first-order optimizer and black-box optimizer is sound.

### Weaknesses
1. The problem formulation in this paper is rather unconventional. To enhance the overall coherence of the paper, I recommend commencing with an overview of Black-box optimization and leveraging the context of evolutionary algorithms to guide the logical progression.
2. The introduction of the problem is overly simplistic and fails to provide an in-depth explanation of non-convex optimization and saddle points. Additionally, it lacks essential references on these topics, which are crucial for a comprehensive understanding.
3. The novelty of the proposed method appears to be limited in comparison to existing approaches.
4. The experimental section is notably inadequate in terms of datasets and compared methods. It is essential to incorporate a comparison with advanced optimizers, such as the Sharpness-aware optimizer, to provide a more comprehensive evaluation and gauge the effectiveness of the proposed method against state-of-the-art techniques.
5.  Furthermore, the experimental results exhibit mediocre performance and lack clarity in demonstrating significant effects.

### Summary
The paper proposes population descent, or PopDescent - a memetic algorithm that combines local gradient-based search with a global population-based search. Local search is applied to traverse the parameter space (per individual in a population), and global search is applied to traverse hyper-parameters. The method is deliberately simple, and designed to not be sensitive to its own hyperparameters. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed method effectively optimizes both the problem and the local algorithm search parameters (regularisation, learning rate).

### Strengths
In the gradient-dominated field of neural network optimisation, it is refreshing to see an approach that attempts to bring global-search algorithms to the table without severe efficiency trade-offs.

**Originality:** The proposed method seems reasonably novel, although I would have appreciated a more critical comparison to other memetic algorithms of similar kind.

**Quality and clarity:** The paper is easy to follow, pseudo code is provided for the proposed algorithms. Authors also provide an anonymised link to their code, which is a big plus.

**Significance:** On two benchmarks (FMINST and CIFAR-10), the proposed method is shown to outperform both random parameter search and a competing memetic algorithm.

### Weaknesses
 **Literature review:** The authors propose a new memetic algorithm, but fail to sufficiently discuss existing state-of-the-art memetic algorithms in their literature review. ESGD is briefly mentioned in the “Benchmarks” section, but its workings are not described or critically compared to the proposed approach. Evolutionary/population-based algorithms are plenty, and without a critical discussion of existing methods, it is hard to evaluate the originality of the proposed method. I am also not certain why authors decided to move related work discussion to just before the conclusions - this does not make for a good narrative structure, and should be moved to the beginning of the paper.

**Experimentation:** In the experiments, all methods employ Adam except for ESGD. This seems like an unfair comparison: perhaps the superiority of the proposed method is due to the superior performance of Adam as compared to SGD? Adam is known to converge faster than SGD, which might also explain why the proposed method converged quicker than ESGD. The choice of optimizer significantly impacts convergence speed and final performance, making this a crucial experimental detail that needs careful consideration. Furthermore, the authors should have included a more thorough ablation study, systematically varying the optimizers used by both the local and global search components to isolate the impact of each. This would provide a more nuanced understanding of the proposed method's strengths and weaknesses.

Authors list the total number of parameters, but do not specify the architectures of the CNNs use (how many channels p/layer etc.).

### Questions
Authors use cross-validation error to perform genetic evolution of the hyperparameters. Isn’t this going to leak information about the test set? The final errors reported - are they calculated on some hold-out set that is not seen during the evolutionary process?

Formatting issues:
1. Citations are not enclosed in parenthesis - for example, “…Large Language Models Cheng et al. (2023)” - should rather be “…Large Language Models (Cheng et al., 2023)”
2. Acronyms: there is no need to capitalize every word that is going to be abbreviated. I.e., instead of “Neural Networks (NNs)” one can simply write “neural networks (NNs)”.
3. “when the magnitude is at 0, None” -> when the magnitude is at 0, none
4. “as see with a lower” -> as seen with a lower
5. “One iteration defines one local and global update together. gradient updates the algorithm takes before performing a mutation.” - the two sentences seem malformed.

### Summary
This paper introduced a new simple evolutionary algorithm to support hyper-parameter tuning while training deep neural networks. Preliminary experiment results show that the new algorithm may be useful to some extent in practice.

### Strengths
Hyper-parameter tuning is important for many deep learning systems and many real-world applications. It is important to develop effective and efficient hyper-parameter tuning techniques. This paper presented a new attempt along this research direction.

### Weaknesses
This paper does not have strong technical novelty. The literature review was brief and did not cover many advanced tools and methods for hyper-parameter tuning or meta-learning in general. For example, the IRACE package is getting increasingly popular for hyper-parameter tuning. It remains largely questionable why it is necessary to develop a new evolutionary algorithm for hyper-parameter tuning, instead of using existing tools or technologies.

The design of the new evolutionary algorithm lacks technical novelty. It is common to use normalized fitness for individual selection in many evolutionary algorithms. It is also common to replace the worst individuals with mutated individuals. Controlling the randomness in mutation based on the performance/fitness of each individual is not new either. Furthermore, according to Algorithm 1, all individuals in the population need to be trained separately in each generation. This is computationally expensive and may not be as efficient as other gradient-based meta-learning techniques that can also fine-tune some hyper-parameters.

Besides the major concern on the technical novelty, the experimental evaluation is not sufficiently strong. Given the ever-expanding literature on hyper-parameter tuning techniques, the competing methods examined in the experiment appear to be quite limited, insufficient to show that the new algorithm can achieve state-of-the-art performance in both efficiency and effectiveness. Moreover, only two relatively simple benchmark datasets were utilized in the experiment. Results obtained on the two benchmark datasets cannot conclusively show the performance advantage of the new algorithm.

Some statements seem to be confusing. For example, I don't understand what the statement "actively choosing how much to explore the parameter and hyperparameter space" on page 2 means. It is also hard to understand the statement "struggle against fine-tuned local search solutions" on page 2.

The authors mentioned several limitations with the new algorithm in Subsection 2.3. It is not clear why they don't try to address these limitations, which appear to be closely relevant to the practical usefulness of the new algorithm and cannot be simply declared as future works.

Typos and grammatical errors can be spotted frequently throughout the paper. The authors are highly recommended to conduct more rounds of proof-reading to significantly improve the presentation quality and clarity of this paper.

### Questions
Why is it necessary to develop a new evolutionary algorithm for hyper-parameter tuning, instead of using existing tools or technologies?

Compared to other hyper-parameter tuning and meta-learning techniques, how efficient is the newly proposed evolutionary algorithm and why?

Can the new algorithm achieve state-of-the-art performance in both efficiency and effectiveness and why?

Why didn't the authors try to address the limitations discussed in Subsection 2.3?

### Confidence
2: You are willing to defend your assessment, but it is quite likely that you did not understand the central parts of the submission or that you are unfamiliar with some pieces of related work. Math/other details were not carefully checked.

### Summary
This paper propose a new algorithm combined with a fitness-based randomization scheme.

### Strengths
The algorithm is descried very detailedly.

### Weaknesses
1. The language used in this paper is not good. I recommend the author to use large language models (e.g. ChatGPT) to go through your work.

2. Too many tables, algorithms, and subjective comments in the paper. You should use more rigorous statements.

3. Based on the current version. I think the paper is more suitable for evolution journals like TEVC/Soft computation.

4. Too many irrelated sentences in the introduction. Everyone knows the property of global opt... Should make it more compact.

5. Fmnist and cifar10 are just too simple. Since it is a algorithm-like paper. Just doing such weak experiments are not enough.
