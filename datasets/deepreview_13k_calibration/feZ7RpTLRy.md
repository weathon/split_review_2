## Abstract
Hyperbolic embeddings are well-studied both in the machine learning and algorithm community. However, as the research proceeds independently in those two communities, comparisons and even awareness seem to be currently lacking. We compare the performance (time needed to compute embeddings) and the quality of the embeddings obtained by the popular approaches, both on real-life hierarchies and networks and simulated networks. In particular, according to our results, the algorithm by Bläsius et al (ESA 2016) is about 100 times faster than the Poincaré embeddings (NIPS 2017) and Lorentz embeddings (ICML 2018) by Nickel and Kiela, while achieving results of similar (or, in some cases, even better) quality.

### Summary
The research work made the following contributions:

It compares hyperbolic embedding methods from the machine learning community (Poincaré and Lorentz embeddings) with methods from the algorithms community (BFKL embedding and DHRG improvement).

It finds that the BFKL embedding method is significantly faster (around 100x) than Poincaré and Lorentz embeddings while achieving competitive results on common evaluation metrics like Mean Rank and Mean Average Precision.

It shows that discretizing the embeddings using DHRG can further improve results for the BFKL method in some cases. DHRG also helps avoid numerical precision issues.


Overall, it demonstrates the potential for faster hyperbolic embedding methods from the algorithms literature to be competitive with popular machine learning approaches. More cross-pollination between communities could be beneficial.

### Strengths
This work highlights the potential for faster algorithmic hyperbolic embedding techniques to be competitive with popular ML methods.

### Weaknesses
The set of real-world networks tested is relatively small. Evaluating on a larger and more diverse set of networks could strengthen the empirical results. 

The statistical analysis relates network factors like size and temperature to embedding quality, but the impact of other structural properties like clustering coefficient, degree distribution, etc., could also be enlightening.

The visualization analysis is limited. A more thorough qualitative analysis of the different embedding layouts and their strengths/weaknesses could provide additional insights.

### Questions
The discrepancy between your WordNet noun results and those reported in Nickel & Kiela 2017 is quite large. Could there be differences in the dataset/preprocessing used? Please investigate potential reasons for this discrepancy.

For the ACM and MeSH hierarchies, you note inconsistencies in the number of nodes/edges compared to Nickel & Kiela 2018. Can you clarify the source of the data used in your experiments? Is it possible you are using different versions of these hierarchies?

What is the largest network size you have managed to embed using the different methods? At what scale do you expect issues with the slower methods like Lorentz embeddings?

### Summary
This paper reviews some classic hyperbolic embedding methods in the ML and algorithm community. The paper then compares these methods and claim that a classic (and earlier) method from the algorithm community achieves better performance than other methods, with a much faster computation speed.

### Strengths
This paper includes a very good review of the literature and investigated methods. It also makes effort to connect two different communities.

### Weaknesses
While this paper has some nice review and interesting comparison, it does not propose any novel idea and therefore the contribution is limited. 

I cannot agree with the authors for their conclusion. Different algorithms are suitable for different tasks and data. While BFKL is faster, it is suitable for scale-free networks. The Poincaré and Lorentz embeddings, in contrast, are suitable for data with specific data structures, and their outputs can be further used for clustering or classification. They are also able to capture complex relationships in the data that go beyond the geometric structure of a scale-free network. In addition, using an embedding dimention $=2$ is unfair because Poincaré and Lorentz embeddings may have better performance at higher dimensions.

### Summary
This paper is about the lack of interaction between the ML community and TCS community. Specifically, that the ML community seems to be missing comparison to prior work on Hyperbolic Embedding and that these methods have some advantages over methods in the ML community.

### Strengths
The paper does a good job of thoroughly comparing Nickel and Kiela 2017 and 2018, with BFKL with and without the post processing step of DHRG. Specifically it shows the strengths of the TCS work. 

The paper also does a very good job of listing related works and putting their work into context.

### Weaknesses
My main concern is that the paper does not present any new algorithmic methods, nor does it prove any theory results, nor does it obtain significant new insights into hyperbolic representation learning. It primarily serves as a benchmark paper that compares two classes of methods that have not been compared before. 

I would suggest either submitting this to benchmarks track at NeurIPS or the new JMLR journal DMLR (Data-centric Machine Learning Research). I think this paper would be received very well in both of those venues.

### Summary
This paper aims to bridge the gap between two communities that have recently focused on hyperbolic embeddings: the algorithmic and the machine learning communities. It emphasizes that, surprisingly, there are few cross-references between them, even though the machine learning community could benefit from these algorithmic developments. The paper compares the timing of the contributions, the specificities (such as speed) of the algorithmic solutions, and the datasets on which the methods are benchmarked. It provides a comprehensive analysis in terms of formulations and presents an extensive experimental comparison, demonstrating that solutions provided by the algorithmic community are often faster while delivering similar performances.

### Strengths
The strengths of the paper are as follows:
- A focus on certain works that are mostly ignored by the machine learning community while relying on the same tools.
- A comprehensive analysis and comparison of the solutions, covering everything from formulation to experimental behavior.

In my opinion, the paper sheds light on somehow unknown works that exhibit interesting behavior in some cases. Consequently, the paper provides valuable insights into a topic that is of growing interest within the ML community.

### Weaknesses
The primary weakness of the paper is that the solutions are primarily benchmarked against 2D Lorentz and Poincaré embeddings. Although the content of the paper is intriguing, it is excessively specific, and I am not convinced of its overall significance. The paper fails to demonstrate how these results could enable the development of more efficient and faster solutions in general, especially in cases where higher-dimensional embeddings can be built. If there are some cases on which this should be done only on 2D, it should be emphasized. 

The paper is sometimes difficult to follow, especially for readers like myself who come from the ML community. The explanation of the modeling of scale-free methods lacks clarity, and the experimental section is dense, making it difficult to grasp the big picture of the setup and the main conclusions.

### Questions
- What prevents benchmarking the solutions against higher dimensional Poincaré and Lorentz embeddings?
