## Abstract
Flood modeling is an important tool for supporting preventive and emergency
measures to mitigate flood risks. Recently, there has been an increasing interest
in exploring machine learning-based models as an alternative to traditional hydrodynamic models for flood simulation to address challenges such as scalability and accuracy. However, current ML approaches are ineffective at modeling early stages of flooding events, limiting their ability to simulate the entire evolution of the flood. Another key challenge is how to incorporate physics domain-knowledge into these data-driven models. In this paper, we address these challenges by introducing a physics-inspired graph neural network for flood simulation. Given a (geographical) region and precipitation data, our model predicts water depths in an autoregressive fashion. We propose a message-passing framework inspired by the conservation of momentum and mass expressed in the shallow-water equations, which describe the physical process of a flooding event. Empirical results on a dataset covering 9 regions and 7 historical precipitation events demonstrate that our model outperforms the best baseline, and is able to capture the propagation of water flow better, especially at the very early stage of the flooding event.

### Summary
The paper presents a novel graph neural network (GNN) model, named ComGNN, designed for early-stage flood simulation. The model innovatively incorporates physical laws, specifically the conservation of momentum and mass from the shallow-water equations, into its framework. It operates on real-world, spatially distributed rainfall data to predict water depth over time, addressing the shortcomings of traditional hydrodynamic models and previous ML-based methods. ComGNN stands out for its two-stage approach, which first accounts for water retention at the rainfall site and then simulates the water's propagation throughout the region. The model demonstrates superior performance over existing methods, particularly in early flood stages, which is critical for timely flood risk mitigation. It's trained on real-world data from nine regions and seven historical precipitation events, showing promising results, especially in reducing root mean square error (RMSE) when predicting water depths.

### Strengths
1.	Using graph neural network method to successfully operates(models) in a two-stage paradigm for early-stage flood simulation given a rainfall event
2.	A message-passing mechanism on the flow direction graph has been proposed for water propagation. The experiments show that the proposed approach outperforms current approaches
3.	It is trained directly on real-world data rather than synthetic data, which may enhance the model's applicability and generalization to real-world scenarios

### Weaknesses
1.	The author asserts the novelty of the ComGNN model; however, the distinctiveness of its design beyond the described pipeline remains unclear. It would be prudent for the author to provide a more detailed account of the model's architecture or to draw comparisons with existing frameworks to more effectively underscore the innovative aspects of ComGNN. Specifically, the description lacks a clear explanation of how the two-stage process is implemented within the GNN framework. The interaction between the water retention and propagation stages, and how these are modeled as distinct graph operations, is not sufficiently elaborated. A more granular description of the node and edge features used in the GNN, and how these features are updated during the message-passing process, would be beneficial.
2.	Within Equations 1 to 4, the manuscript appears to describe the application of a learnable multilayer perceptron (MLP) for predicting or learning the solutions of partial differential equations in the context of the conversation process. This approach does not seem to offer substantial theoretical advancement to the field. Could the author provide a more in-depth explanation of the theoretical underpinnings to clarify the contribution? The use of an MLP to approximate solutions to PDEs is a common practice; the authors should clarify what novel aspects, if any, are introduced in their specific application. The connection between the physical equations and the MLP parameters is not clearly established, making it difficult to assess the theoretical contribution.
3.	The message passing scheme, a prominent feature in the title, does not convey extensive information. Would the author kindly provide relevant references for this scheme? It appears to resemble standard data flow in GNN architectures. Additionally, a precise initial definition of 'message' along with a more comprehensive explanation would be beneficial for clarity. The description of the message-passing mechanism is too high-level, lacking details on how the messages are constructed, aggregated, and used to update node states. The specific mathematical operations involved in the message passing, and how these relate to the conservation laws, are not clearly defined. A more detailed explanation of the message-passing function, including the specific equations used, is needed.
4.	Too much experimental figures in page 8 and 9 which makes main contents too short, author could move them in to appendix and leave more room for theoretical analysis.
5.	The current formulation of the problem may be overly simplistic for readers not well-versed in the field. It would be advisable to include the mathematical model within this section to enhance comprehension. The description of the shallow-water equations is too brief and lacks the necessary detail for readers to understand the underlying physics. A more thorough explanation of the equations, including the meaning of each term and the assumptions made, is needed. The limitations of the shallow-water equations and their applicability to the specific problem should also be discussed.

### Questions
In summary, the paper offers ComGNN, a graph neural network that simulates early-stage flood progression by accounting for rainfall retention and water propagation based on conservation principles. The authors claim that their method shows superior performance in comparison to existing approaches, especially for early flood stages, validated through empirical results on historical flood data. However,  it put too much contents in application and exrimanetal explanation and results but overlook the theoretical part, which is not suitable for ICLR. Moverover, the novelty of ComGNN didn’t revealed sufficiently in the method part.

### Summary
The authors identify the challenges of current deep learning models in scientific applications, i.e., flood simulation here. Currently these DL models are inaccurate at modeling the early stages of flooding events and do not incorporate physical knowledge from numerical methods. The authors propose using a physics-inspired GNN to predict water depths autoregressively. Their method, ComGNN, similar to MeshGraphNet's message-passing framework is inspired by the conservation of mass and momentum in the shallow-water equations (simplification of Navier-Stokes). The proposed method is tested on real-world data covering 9 regions and 7 historical precipitation events and the results show that the model outperforms the baslines and is better at early stage flooding detection.

### Strengths
- It is nice that the authors try to incorporate physical information from PDEs, in this case, conservation of mass and momentum from the shallow water equations into the MeshGraphNet model.
- Nice physical motivated problem for deep learning models to improve early flood detection.
- The background on PDEs including relation between Shallow-water equations and Navier Stokes is nice.
- Nice overview of how the discretization of the PDE that the model is trained on impacts the accuracy and how CNN or pure DL models are not guaranteed to respect physical laws.
- Interesting use of directed graphs.
- Incorporating conservation of mass and momentum from the shallow water equations is critical.
- Experiments on real-world dataset LISFLOOD-FP, version 8 (Shaw et al., 2021)

### Weaknesses
 - This method is highly related to MeshGraphNets (Pfaff et. al, "Learning Mesh-Based Simulation with Graph Networks", ICLR 2021) and needs to be compared to but adding physical information to it is beneficial.
- Numerical solutions of the shallow water equations should be added as an additional baseline. Specifically, a finite volume or finite element method should be used as a baseline since these are standard numerical techniques for solving the shallow water equations and would provide a good comparison to the proposed method.
- It should be made a bit clearer in the second paragraph of the introduction that numerical methods are still state-of-the-art in terms of accuracy compared to DL models.
- Overview of Neural Operator methods is missing from the introduction and related works.
- The first paragraph of related works reads more like a list of the works rather than describing the limitations and why further work is needed.
- When introducing GNNs in the related work section, the authors mention the GNNs can handle irregular graph data whereas image-based CNNs assume a regular grid, it would be nice to make the connection between mesh from the numerical discretization and the graph more explicit since these methods incorporate the spatial connectivity information from the mesh.
- This would be another nice reference on the connections between GNNs and finite element methods to add to the related work section ( F. Alet, A. K. Jeewajee, M. B. Villalonga, A. Rodriguez, T. Lozano-Perez, and L. Kaelbling. Graph element networks: adaptive, structured computation and memory. In International Conference on Machine Learning, pages 212–222. PMLR, 2019.).
- Also on the connection between the directed graph Laplacian operator and finite difference methods for the linear advection equation (Maddix et. al, "Modeling Advection on Directed Graphs using Matérn Gaussian Processes for Traffic Flow" (https://arxiv.org/pdf/2201.00001.pdf).
- Use of the first order Forward Euler method for the time-stepping scheme even though it has challenges to stay numerically stable (Krishnapriyan et. al, "Learning continuous models for continuous physics", 2022) and more advanced schemes such as RK4 may perform better. The underlying numerical scheme used within the DL model and truncation error analysis is quite important. Please also see Onken et. al, "Discretize-Optimize vs. Optimize-Discretize for Time-Series Regression and Continuous Normalizing Flows", 2020.
- "Since ∆t, ∆x, ∆y, and g remain constant during the entire simulation, they are simply multiplicative factors and therefore can be set to 1" - this is a major limitation. For methods such as Forward Euler to converge there is a CFL condition which bounds ∆t by ∆x and 1 is too large. The authors should clarify how they are handling the CFL condition and what the actual values of these parameters are.
- The loss function also seems hard-coded to 
- Generalization of the method - seems quite specific for the shallow-water equations and flood detection but how can the method be effectively extended to more broader PDEs?
- Application of method but no theoretical or convergence properties
- The baselines are extremely limited and compared to a CNN-based U-net method from 2015 rather than the recent state-of-the-art methods in SciML, e.g., MeshGraphNets (which is essential to compare to since I don't see how the proposed method ComGNN differs other than possibly in the loss function), MP-PDE, DINO, PINNs and Neural Operators. The lack of comparison to these methods makes it difficult to assess the true contribution of this work.
- My main concern is the novelty since the method is quite similar to MeshGraphNets (Pfaff et. al, ICLR 2021) just applied on the shallow water equations.

Minor
- Start Section 3 with an overview section before going to 3.1.
- Punctuation in Eqn (1) should not have a period before it and should have a comma after it and similarly all equations should have punctuation following them.
- The references start before some of the results and a lot of the plots can be moved to an appendix to make room for more main text.

### Questions
- Were ablation studies conducted on why GNN architectures were chosen?
- How can this method generalize outside of flood detection and to arbitrary PDEs?
- Is there a reason why GNNs have not been explored for flood simulations? In most of the MeshGraphNet papers, they are solving Navier-Stokes equations and shallow water equations, so it isn't clear to me why it cannot be directly applied here. See also the DINO method (https://arxiv.org/pdf/2209.14855.pdf, ICLR 2023) that solves the 3D shallow water equations and compares to state-of-the-art MP-PDE Johannes Brandstetter, Daniel E. Worrall, and Max Welling. "Message passing neural PDE solvers". In
International Conference on Learning Representations, 2022 and Neural Operator methods
- Why was the forward Euler and Verlet schemes used? Were there ablation studies done on the type of numerical discretizations used, which can cause discretization errors that are propagated into the training data.
- How are the values or ∆t, ∆x, ∆y chosen and why are they all set to 1? This is far too coarse of a spatial and temporal grid. Numerical choices like this are important for stability and convergence and cannot be chosen without convergence testing.
- Why is there a mix of L1 and L2 losses in the loss function? Is this just empirically observed as stated in Appendix A.4?
- What makes ComGNN "physics-inspired" and differ from training on shallow-water simulated data with MeshGraphNets (Pfaff et. al, ICLR, 2021)?

### Summary
The authors propose a graph neural network (GNN) model for forecasting the spatio-temporal 
evolution of flooding in a geographical region based on the region's height profile and registered 
precipitation data. To facilitate modeling, the region is discretized into sub-regions, each 
represented as a graph node. The GNN comprises multiple sequential message-passing (MP) layers 
designed to process and propagate local information, drawing inspiration from the physical 
principles of mass and momentum transport as described by the shallow water equations (SWE). In 
addition to this, two other physical inductive biases are considered: (i) the orientation of graph 
edges between nodes follows the steepest descent direction, with only one outgoing edge per 
node/sub-region, and (ii) a retention layer is applied before each MP layer to account for water 
accumulation at each sub-region due to local precipitation. The model produces temporal rollouts by 
recursive evaluation.

This model was trained and tested using empirical precipitation data and corresponding simulated 
flooding data. The performance of the model was compared against that of an MLP, a U-Net, two 
popular GNNs, and a baseline GNN previously proposed for flood modeling. The proposed model 
outperforms the baselines, particularly in early-stage flood simulations.

### Strengths
1. The paper is well written, the concepts are clearly explained, and the figures are helpful.

2. The retention layer and the proposed MP aim to mimic the underlying physics without over-
constraining the model. While the general idea is similar to Bentivoglio et al. (2023), the key 
differences are explained.

3. The model has been compared a wide range of models, including a baseline GNN model 
recently proposed for flood modelling.

### Weaknesses
1. The reason for using the proposed GNN instead of a conventional numerical solver are not 
clear. It seems not to be the goal to improve the accuracy, since the model is trained with simulated 
flooding data. Is it accelerating the simulation? Runtime comparisons with numerical solvers are 
not included in the paper.

2. Solely from a deep-learning viewpoint, the contributions are not significant. Another "species" 
of message passing is added to an already vast range of options.

3. The term "physics-informed" used in the title is not well chosen in my opinion. This may lead to confusion 
with Physics-Inspired Neural Networks (PINNs), where the governing equations are included 
in the loss function. Instead, something along the lines of "physical inductive-bias" would be more suitable.

4. The use of a single out-going edge per node assumes that the information is only propagated 
downhill. This may not be true for later-stage flood simulations. The authors should verify 
and indicate if this inductive bias is actually helpful for test case here considered. Its possible 
drawbacks should be discussed. It seems like a clear limitation for other settings without such
a strongly biased transport.

5. The authors mention the previous work of Bentivoglio et al. (2023) and Kazadi et al. (2022), 
however, other similar research is missing. E.g.,
* Oliveira Santos V, Costa Rocha PA, Scott J, Th JVG, Gharabaghi B. A New Graph-Based 
Deep Learning Model to Predict Flooding with Validation on a Case Study on the Humber 
River. Water. 2023; 15(10):1827. https://doi.org/10.3390/w15101827
* Farahmand, H., Xu, Y. & Mostafavi, A. A spatial-temporal graph deep learning model for 
urban flood nowcasting leveraging heterogeneous community features. Sci Rep 13, 6768 
(2023). https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-023-32548-x
In these two articles, the flooding models account for past states as opposed to the model 
proposed here. The authors should discuss if that is needed or not. It may happen that only 
the current state is relevant for inferring the water depth at the next time-point due to the 
deterministic nature of the problem.

6. Whilst the model is compared to other GNNs and the GNN proposed by Bentivoglio et al. 
(2023), it is not compared against the Interaction Networks (Battaglia et al. 2016), which were 
shown to very suitable for Lagragian and Eurlarian simulations of fluids (Pfaff et al. 2021, 
Sanchez-Gonzalez et al. 2020).

### Questions
1. The loss term in equation (8) penalizes the prediction of negative water depths, however, is 
not better to enforce the satisfaction of this condition by the use of ReLU activation after the 
last layer?

2. What is the number of parameters of each model? This is a crucial factor that usually directly determines the performance.

And 2 minor points:

3. Wrong formula for the Pearson correlation coefficient, it seems to repeat NSE?

4. Other research has considered back-propagating through multiple evaluations of the model. Could this be beneficial for the flood forecasting and long-term stability?

________

Post-rebuttal:

I'd like to thank the reviewers for the detailed update.  It is good to see that it outperforms a series of popular MP algorithms in early flooding stages. It would be important, however, to make sure all models have the same number of parameter. It seems the current comparison uses significantly different sizes.

So overall, I think the submission is improving, but I believe there are still quite a few open questions: beyond a thorough baseline comparison, the runtime would be interesting, and potentially a more detailed derivation of the method or a demonstration of broader applicability. As such I will keep my score, I'm still leaning towards the rejection side.

### Summary
This paper discusses a Graph Neural Network based model to simulate the progress of a flood over a heterogenous region due to a rainfall event. The Digital Elevation Map (DEM) of the region is provided as an input. The model is based on the laws analogous to conservation of mass and momentum to govern the flow of water from one region to another, depending on the height and amount of water already accumulated. It is shown that this model can simulate the spreading of flood more accurately than other ML-based models, especially in the early stages of the flood.

### Strengths
The strength of the paper lies in its application - flood simulation is an important and difficult task, and the Earth System Modeling community is looking for ML-based solutions for it. This work indeed adds to it, with its interpretable, physics-based approach of representing water retention and flow as a function of elevation, along the lines of shallow water equation which forms the backbone of many hydrological models.

### Weaknesses
The weakness of the work, at the current stage, seem to be lying in the following:
1) The GNN-based model, including the message-passing mechanism, is not described very thoroughly.
2) The results show that CommGNN-, a variant of the final proposed model, is not able to outperform the baseline models comprehensively. The difference between CommGNN- and CommGNN is in the water retention capacity. Does it then indicate that it is this aspect, and not the model itself, which has most impact? If that is the case, then shouldn't we be trying to incorporate the water retention aspect in the existing architectures rather than proposing a new architecture?
3) We have no results on how the proposed approach compares with the hydrological/hydrodynamic models used by domain scientists for flood simulation.

### Questions
1) Fig 1 shows how water from two adjoining nodes at higher elevation can flow into one node at lower elevation. But how can water from a higher region divide itself into two lower locations?
2) Is elevation the only factor that influences the dispersion of water? What can be other factors and can they be taken into account in the proposed model?
3) Do the competing models take DEM or any other auxilliary information as input?
4) Is it possible to have an experimental result that shows the water retention and dispersion stages separately?
5) Can the retention abilities be different in different regions? Which factor in the model takes the retention capacity into account?
6) In the experiment, has it been assumed that each region is of uniform elevation? What is the spatial resolution of the DEM, rainfall and flood water depth map?
