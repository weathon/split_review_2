## Abstract
The success of many RL techniques heavily relies on human-engineered dense rewards, 
  which typically demands substantial domain expertise and extensive trial and error.
  In our work, we propose \textbf{DrS} (\textbf{D}ense \textbf{r}eward learning from \textbf{S}tages), a novel approach for learning \textit{reusable} dense rewards for multi-stage tasks in a data-driven manner. 
  By leveraging the stage structures of the task, DrS learns a high-quality dense reward from sparse rewards and demonstrations if given. The learned rewards can be \textit{reused} in unseen tasks, thus reducing the human effort for reward engineering. 
  Extensive experiments on three physical robot manipulation task families with 1000+ task variants demonstrate that our learned rewards can be reused in unseen tasks, resulting in improved performance and sample efficiency of RL algorithms. The learned rewards even achieve comparable performance to human-engineered rewards on some tasks. See our \href{https://sites.google.

### Summary
The paper presents a method, Dense reward learning from Stages (DrS), for learning reusable dense reward functions using only sparse task reward signals and task-family-specific “stage indicators”. DrS learns to classify the stage reached by each trajectory and adds the discriminator score to the index of the stage reached, leading to a reward function that increases both across stages and within progress along a stage. Prior adversarial imitation learning approaches to reward learning do not lead to reward functions that can be reused because the discriminator cannot distinguish policy trajectories from demonstrations at convergence. Experiments show that DrS-learned rewards can be reused for test tasks and can even compete with human-engineered rewards in some cases, despite requiring much less manual engineering (just the stage indicator function).

### Strengths
* As far as I am aware, the overall design of the algorithm (exploiting stage indicators) as well as the form of the learned reward function are novel.
* The method significantly reduces the amount of engineering required to learn reward functions when the task can be broken down into identifiable stages.
* DrS handily outperforms several reasonable baselines and competes with the hand-engineered reward in some cases.
* In addition to the ablation study in the body of the paper, the appendix includes extensive additional experiments, such as varying the number of training tasks, input modality, dynamics, action space, robot morphology, and form of the reward function. The authors also verify the claim that GAIL-generated rewards are not reusable.
* The paper is clear, easy to read, and well-motivated.

### Weaknesses
 * The paper states that demonstrations are optional, but it sounds like they were used in all experiments. I imagine that sample efficiency would deteriorate substantially if no demonstrations are provided and the first stage cannot be solved easily by random exploration, or more generally if any stage cannot be easily solved by a noisy version of a policy that solves the previous stage.
* It is not clear that all sparse-reward tasks can be broken up into stages, and as shown in the ablation study, the method struggles when there is only one stage. So DrS is not universally applicable to sparse-reward tasks. Furthermore, the method's reliance on well-defined stage indicators raises concerns about its applicability to tasks where stage transitions are ambiguous or continuous. The need for a separate discriminator for each stage also increases the computational overhead and memory requirements, which can be a limiting factor for complex tasks with many stages.

### Questions
Did you try running DrS without providing demonstrations? Or varying the number of demonstrations?

### Summary
This paper proposes a method for learning reusable dense rewards for multi-stage tasks using binary stage indicators. The idea is to train a discriminator that distinguishes successful trajectories from unsuccessful ones for each stage, and then use the discriminator output as dense reward. The authors demonstrate that the learned reward functions generalize to thousands of tasks across three Maniskill domains, resulting in policies that perform nearly as well as those trained from human-designed rewards. This is a step towards automating reward design, which is a long-standing problem in RL.

### Strengths
- This paper makes a contribution towards automating reward design, which is of paramount importance in the field of RL. Having access to dense rewards takes the burden off of exploration, which in turn reduces the number of samples required to solve a task.
- The method is a niche application of contrastive discriminator learning, which is well-established in the literature.

### Weaknesses
 - The method requires success and failure trajectories for each stage in the training data, which can be expensive to collect.
- The scope of the method is limited to a family of tasks that can be divided into stages. This prevents it from being applied to other tasks such as locomotion. It also means the method is less general compared to LLM-based rewards with external knowledge [1, 2].
- Similarly, the need for stage indicators prevents the method from scaling to real-world problems, which would arguably benefit more from automated reward design than simulated domains.
- The experiments do not demonstrate new skills that are unachievable by human-designed rewards.
- It is evident that state abstraction enables generalization of learned reward functions. For example, in the pick and place task, a reward based on the distance between the end effector and object center of mass (COM) for the first stage, and the distance from object COM to the target for the second stage, can generalize to different object shapes if the state includes end effector position and object COM. Similarly, for the cabinet task, using handle position and cabinet hinge angle, or handle position and knob angle for the faucet task, allows simple human-engineered rewards to generalize. The paper's experiments also provide low-dimensional states as inputs to the reward function, meaning the reward function can ignore the point cloud and still generalize, thus there is no evidence that the learned reward functions can generalize from other modalities than states.
- There is no obvious reason to omit the pixel experiments. It is suspected that pixel-based reward functions don't generalize well, and the addition of point cloud already hurts performance, so higher-dimensional pixels might affect the performance even more.

### Questions
- Does the method work with pixel observations?
- If the method only works with states, does generalization come as a result of state abstraction or the method itself?
- Do the learned dense reward functions resemble hand-designed rewards?

### Summary
This paper proposes `DrS` (Dense reward learning from Stages), an approach for learning reusable dense rewards for multi-stage tasks, effectively reducing human efforts in reward engineering. By breaking down the dask into stages, this method learns dense reward from sparse ones using human demonstrations, where the focus is to learn reusable representations that can potentially by used on unseen tasks with similar structure. An example of structure is illustrated using the `Open Cabinet Door` which can be naturally divided into stages, such as approaching the handle, grasping and pulling, and then releasing it. Recognizing which stage an agent is in can be done using simple binary indicators. By applying these indicators, this work cultivates a dense reward for every stage.

Experiments are `PickNPlace`, `TurnFaucet`, `OpenCabinetDoor`.

Baselines are `dense reward`,  `VICE-RAQ`, `ORIL`

### Strengths
- The goal of this work is deriving a dense reward function from an array of training tasks to be repurposed for new, unseen tasks.
- The notion of capturing representations for a `task family` is important for enabling RL agents to learn multi-purpose policies.
-  Operating on the understanding that tasks can be broken down into several segments is also logical.
- I like this paper because I think it's important to move away from engineered dense rewards, to more tangible methodologies for learning rewards, specially in stage-drived manner, using demonstrations.

### Weaknesses
 - Some ablation study of the robustness of this method against bad demonstrations (i.e. suboptimal, noisy etc) could be nice.

### Questions
- I did not understand what Figure 3 is presenting and there is no reference in the paper. Does this plot mean that `DrS` is learning a sigmoid liked function of the sparse reward?
- In the limitation section, the authors talk about the usage of language models such as ChatGPT and I think some discussion can be built around methods such as say-can[1]. I think the goal of both frameworks are aligned.

### Summary
This paper considers learning reusable dense rewards for multi-stage tasks and proposes a method named as DrS. DrS classifies each collected trajectory by its stage and relabels them into failure and success ones. It then defines the learned reward function as the stage index plus the output of the corresponding discriminator. Extensive experiments from three task families showcase the effectiveness of DrS.

### Strengths
1. This paper is clearly written and easy to follow.
2. Authors conducted extensive experiments over 1000 task variants from threes task families to empirically evaluate their proposed method.
3. Learning reusable rewards is an interesting and important topic for RL.

### Weaknesses
1. The experimental results are all from the ManiSkill benchmark. Considering other domains such as navigation (say, the Minigrid benchmark) would make the results more convincing.
2.  Lack of discussion on some related work, such as [1, 2].
3. The proposed method heavily relies on the stage structures of the task (see Figure 6, 1-stage fails), but there may exist tasks hard to specify stages (e.g., locomotion tasks of mujoco).
4. Classifying the collected trajectories into success and failure ones and learning a corresponding reward function may not incentive the agent to finish the task optimally since no matter how sub-optimal the trajectory is, as long as it reaches the highest stage, it will be regarded as the most successful one. This is a critical limitation, as the learned policy might not prioritize efficient task completion. For example, given two trajectories that both reach the goal, the method may not distinguish between a direct path and a circuitous one, potentially hindering the learning of optimal policies. Furthermore, the reliance on a single success/failure classification for an entire trajectory, based on the maximal stage reached, ignores the nuances of individual transitions within that trajectory. This could lead to a reward function that is not well-aligned with the actual task requirements, especially in complex scenarios where partial successes or failures are common.

### Questions
1. The authors asked "can we learn dense reward functions in a data-driven manner?" But what kind of dense reward do we really need? Say, there are three reward function $r_1$, $r_2$ and $r_3$, where $r_1=1$ if reaching the goal state, otherwise $r_1=0$; $r_2=0$ if reaching the goal state, otherwise $r_2=-1$; $r_3=2$ if reaching the goal state, otherwise $r_3=1$. Are $r_2$ and $r_3$ your considered dense reward functions and better than $r_1$? Why?
2. How is the training time? DrS has to classify each collected trajectory based on the maximal stage index of all the transitions' stage indexes, which seems to be quite time consuming.
3. Why is GAIL unable to learn reusable rewards? I understand that at convergence, the discriminator outputs 1/2 for every expert state-action transition, but correspondingly, other state-action pairs will be assigned lower values. It seems to be a reasonable dense reward function. In Figure 12, the authors compare DrS with "GAIL w/ stage indicators", but what if GAIL? 
4. In line 17 of Algorithm 1's pseudocode, we need to calculate the reward for each transition. But there are multiple discriminators, so which one should we select? Based on the stage index of the trajectory? If so, the same next state may get different rewards because of being in different trajectories. Will it cause the training process unstable?

I am willing to raise my scores if you could sovle my concerns.
