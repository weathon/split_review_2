## Abstract
Our paper presents a Bayesian adaptation of Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) designed to capture the characteristics of each user, encompassing factors such as their educational background and professions. We model each individual's characteristics using specific perturbations of the local metric of the embedding space. This perturbation introduces a crucial shift in the distance evaluation between the query's and the document's embedding, leading to different pertinent rankings of the retrieved documents. We propose a Bayesian learning procedure that assimilates user feedback and continuously enhances our estimation of the user-specific  metric. In the beginning, when there is no information about the user, we use a diverse retrieval method for generation. After this burn-in phase, we learn a Bayesian posterior estimate of the metric, and inject this metric into the nearest neighbor search for document retrieval. This additional layer of metric information acquisition leads to empirical improvement in the retrieval quality and in the performance of the generated text on multiple concept explanation tasks.

### Summary
The paper presents a new method for information retrieval by combining recently developed retrieval models with large language models (LLMs). Their proposed approach is a two-task iterative technique which is particularly consisted of a task where LLMs are utilised to refine information about relevant to user's query documents are refined and of a task where retrieval models are employed to refine information in LLMs  and thus a refined query of the user's original query can be constructed. The method that the authors propose iteratively applies these tasks in a procedure consisted of 4 steps clearly listed in Section 4.3 of the paper. Finally, the authors utilise several publicly available datasets to compare their approach with existing methods in the related literature.

### Strengths
I think that the paper is of good quality, well-written and is original enough in the sense of combining efficiently existing well-established approaches to construct a new method that outperforms the existing ones.

### Weaknesses
It is very nice that the authors explain clearly the limitations of their approach at the end of Section 6. I think however, that they should provide some recommendations on the LLMs that should be used to avoid some of the problems they mention.

### Questions
Since the authors recognise the limitation of their approach they should be more specific about the characteristics of the LLMs that should be integrated with their approach in order to end up with a technique with the metrics presented in Section 5.

### Summary
This paper introduces a Bayesian approach to modeling user preferences for document retrieval to be used in RAG, outperforming a few baselines on a generated dataset.

### Strengths
The paper tackles a timely and interesting problem of user preferences in RAG. The bayesian approach is reasonable and thoroughly described. The multi-phase setup is logical. The paper is generally well-written.

### Weaknesses
I have two main issues with the manuscript: The overly complex modeling procedure and the synthetic dataset.

While I am a fan of Bayesian approaches, there is no appropriate ablation to validate the inherent complexity. Why not just fit a simple linear model to the user preferences? 
Many of the design choices in the proposed model are not justified. Why are we modeling the user preference as a a Wishart probability distribution? Why do we need a determinantal point process? How would that compare to random sampling? Et cetera.

The other issue is the dataset: it's entirely synthetic. There is no evidence that the proposed model would be useful at reflecting real users preferences. If the evaluation had fake data and real users, that would be interesting and such a user study would be illuminating to the proposed work. If the evaluation had real data and fake users (as imagined by an LLM), that might be okay too as LLMs have shown signs that they can model generic user behavior. Ideally the proposed model would be used on real data with user. And as I have yet to see the combined use of synthetic data and synthetic users in a promising fashion that represents real users/data, I cannot recommend accept.

### Questions
What happens when you fit a simple linear model to users original preferences and update in an online fashion?

### Summary
The paper proposes an approach for learning a personalized ranking model followed by generation of personalized summaries using an off the shelf summarization model. The paper proposes a probabilistic model for learning user preferences where user preferences are modeled as a perturbed Mahalanobis metric. The paper proposes a 2 stage method for learning user preferences: in Phase 1 a detreminantal point process is used to retrieve diverse documents and gather user preferences for the documents given queries, in Phase 2 gathered feedback is used to make an update to the user preferences. In Phase 3 the learned user preferences are used for ranking documents for the query and generating summarizations of the ranked documents. The proposed approach is evaluated on 3 synthetic datasets generated with gpt-3.5-turbo with 50 concepts (queries), 100 user types (users), resulting in retrieval over 5000 documents.

### Strengths
- The paper proposes an interesting Bayesian framework for learning personalized ranking models.
- The experimental evaluations seem to indicate the value of the proposed framework.
- The paper is largely well-written.

### Weaknesses
 - Simplistic synthetic data: The only data used for experiments are synthetic with the conceived form of user preference being somewhat simplistic (different user types seeking stylistically different concept definitions).
- Weak baselines: The baselines compared against are non-personalized and don't use user type information, one would expect to see poorer performance from such methods given the setup of the paper.
- Unclear experimental setup.
- The paper is ungrounded from prior work making it hard to see what aspects of the contribution are novel.

### Questions
- Am I understanding correctly that the 5000 large document collection contains the 50 concept definitions rephrased in 100 different ways?
- Am I understanding correctly that the proposed approach never uses the pre-trained summarization model in learning user preferences?
- Is the user feedback for Phase 2 obtained from labelled data? Eg if the document corresponds to the correct concept+user it is a positive document and negative if not?
- Please clarify in greater detail what data is used for training and evaluation. "For each user type, we systematically exclude all documents associated with that user type from the database, treating them as reference documents" -- its not clear what this means? Is this implying that no documents corresponding to the user type are available for training?
- Sec 6.1: What reference documents are used for summarization evaluation? Eg in computing metrics like rouge.
- The paper could benefit from inclusion of examples for concept, user type, positive document and negative document for concept and user type - perhaps in Fig 1.
- If the experimental setup contains as input a query + positive document for user type - It would be illustrative to have a simple personalized ranking baseline which computes a score based on a simple linear interpolation concept-document score and a concept-user_type score. Perhaps a user_type could be represented with the average of document embeddings for that user and the weight for the two components tuned on a dev set. Alternatively, please consider formulating an appropriate, simpler personalized ranking baseline and comparing to it in addition to the ones in the paper.
- The paper contains no context on related work from personalized search, it would be useful to make some connection to related prior work. Starting points may be: https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/1076034.1076111, https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3357384.3357980, https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/2124295.2124348.

### Summary
This paper proposes a hybrid of Bayesian Learning and Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) framework to capture the characteristics of each user using specific perturbations of the local metric of the embedding space.
Authors aim to construct a comprehensive three-phase solution package for RAG-based conversational systems. 
Its primary aim is to enable the retrieval of documents that closely align with human preferences, 
ultimately enhancing the quality of text generation.
They demonstrate that their approach captures the user’s preference, and consequentially improve the retrieval and text generation quality under a llimited number of queries.

### Strengths
**Bayesian Learning and Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) framework is simple and reasonable**
* Proposed solution system is simple and reasonable for adapting the retrieval mechanism to the the user’s preferences.
* To capture the user’s preference, encompass factors such as their educational background and professions,and consequentially improve the retrieval and text generation quality, authors model these preference through the metric drift of the embedding space, which governs the ranking of the documents for each input query.
* Learning a Bayesian posterior estimate of the metric as the addtional layer is designed to empirical improvement in the retrieval quality and in the performance of the generated text on multiple concept explanation tasks.

### Weaknesses
 **The authors have considered and designed their system well, but their effectiveness, advantages and claims are weak.**

- While authors aim to capture the characteristics of each user,  they show that experimental results are search and textual quantitative evaluations, which do not lead to determine the level of achievement for this objective.

- The performance increase in Table 1 and 2 appears marginal and weak to support the claim.

- Since there is no ablation analysis, it is not possible to determine the effectiveness of the authors' proposed elements such as perturbed Mahalanobis metric, and Bayesian posterior estimate.

- This solution is a kind of RAG frameworks, but there is no comparison with other RAG based framework, so its superiority cannot be determined.

### Questions
* Did you not conduct a qualitative evaluation?
* Did you perform statistical tests on Table 1 and 2? If soIf so, please provide details.
* Please see Weaknesses.
