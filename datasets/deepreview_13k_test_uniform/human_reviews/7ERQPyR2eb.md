- Decision: Accept
- Scores: 8, 8, 1, 8

## Abstract
One-shot 3D talking portrait generation aims to reconstruct a 3D avatar from an unseen image, and then animate it with a reference video or audio to generate a talking portrait video. The existing methods fail to simultaneously achieve the goals of accurate 3D avatar reconstruction and stable talking face animation. Besides, while the existing works mainly focus on synthesizing the head part, it is also vital to generate natural torso and background segments to obtain a realistic talking portrait video. To address these limitations, we present Real3D-Potrait, a framework that (1) improves the one-shot 3D reconstruction power with a large image-to-plane model that distills 3D prior knowledge from a 3D face generative model; (2) facilitates accurate motion-conditioned animation with an efficient motion adapter; (3) synthesizes realistic video with natural torso movement and switchable background using a head-torso-background super-resolution model; and (4) supports one-shot audio-driven talking face generation with a generalizable audio-to-motion model. Extensive experiments show that Real3D-Portrait generalizes well to unseen identities and generates more realistic talking portrait videos compared to previous methods\footnote{Video samples and source code are available at \url{https://real3dportrait.io}

### Summary
This work describes a method for single-shot 3D reconstruction and animation of a given 2D facial image. It uses an image to plane method to lift a 2D face into the tri-plane of a 3D GAN. It then morphs the triplane by adding a delta tri-plane which encoded the target expression via an PNCC encode image to animate the face. Differently from prior work the proposed method provides a solution for both video and audio driven animation of the face and also provides a super-resolution module for correctly morphing the torso and in-filling the exposed background regions. The proposed method is compared to several existing baseline video and audio-driven methods and shown to be superior them.

### Strengths
The paper addresses a fairly novel problem of single-shot joint 3D reconstruction and animation of facial images. Differently from prior work it seeks to inject the animation information directly into the 3D representation versus the dominant approach of animating in 2D first and then lifting into 3D. As the authors correctly point out animation in 3D versus 2D results is more correct handling of large head poses and less warping artifacts. So this is an important problem to address towards enabling large head pose facial talking head generation. 

In comparison to the existing works on the topic, this work introduces a joint framework for both video and audio driven animation of 3D facial representations by encoding the audio signal into a PNCC representation. It also does a nice job of proposing to handle the torso and the background as a part of the overall solution thus enabling a more production-ready complete end-to-end framework. This is an often neglected detail in many works that treat the head in isolation from the backgrounds in which it exists requiring additional pre and post processing steps to deal with the torso and background.

### Weaknesses
1. The method by design requires the canonicalization, i.e., removal of the source image's facial expression, for the driving expression to be successfully applied to it. This is because the PNCC code is derived purely from the target driving video/audio's expression and hence cannot contain the information to erase/neutralize the source image's facial expression. I think the proposed method achieves this canonicalization during the fine-tuning phase with the Celeb-V-HQ video dataset. However, in my experience without any further stronger constraints, the proposed method cannot fully remove the source image's original facial expression. Can the author show examples of these canonicalized 3D face reconstructions of the input images without applying the target expression? Related to this is the question of how robust is the proposed method to the presence of large facial expressions in the source image. Does it work for expressions where the source image has a wide open mouth and lowered jaw or nearly closed eyes, for example?

2. Overall the proposed methods is an obvious combination of several existing ideas from prior works on the topic to culminate in a successful large engineered end-to-end solution. For example, the idea of using I2P was previously proposed in LP3D; the idea of using rendered target expression images from a 3DMM was proposed in Li et al., 2023b, the audio to PNCC code predictor is borrowed from prior work; and the torso warping module is also borrowed from Wang et al., 2021. While the proposed combination of existing ideas results in an effective solution, from the research perspective the overall solution is light on significant novel or surprising insights.

3. The authors don't specify the dataset/protocol that they used for evaluation.

4. Comparisons of the proposed method to several of the newer (than Face-Vid2Vid) and better performing video-driven 2D facial animation methods are missing. Below I list several of them.

### Summary
This paper proposes a method to create a reanimatable avatar from a single image. Leveraging the latent space of EG3D, the method learns to generate a canonical tri-plane from a given input image. This canonical triplane is then deformed using motion module conditioned on projected normalized co-ordinate code (PNCC). Finally, the deformed triplane is volume rendered to generate the final image. The motion conditioned tri-plane representation generates good results and outperforms some prior art, but the overall architecture and design is very similar to HiDe-NeRF.

### Strengths
1) The paper is well written.

2) The qualitative results on reanimation are good, even when driven by audio.

3) The quantitative results show that the proposed method out-performs prior art.

4) The background is rendered well and merges seamlessly with the foreground.

### Weaknesses
1) Given that the overall architecture is very similar to HiDe-NeRF, it is unclear where the improvement of the proposed method is coming from. Is it because a pretrained Tri-plane is a better representation than the multi-resolution tri-plane features of HiDe-NeRF? It would be great if the authors could clarify this

2) The addiction of background and torso modelling, while important, is relatively incremental.

### Questions
It would be great if the authors could clarify why the proposed method works better than HiDe-NeRF despite having a very similar architecture and set-up. Is pretraining the only reason?

### Summary
This paper proposes a novel method for synthesizing photorealistic talking portraits from a single source image coupled with either a speech signal or a driving facial video. The method generates a 3D avatar from the source image and then animates it based on the speech signal or the driving video. Apart from the talking head synthesis, the method pays attention in the realistic synthesis of torso movements and backgrounds. Regarding the module of 3D face reconstruction, the method adopts an image to plane model. Regarding the module of animation, the method introduces a novel facial motion adapter. The paper presents detailed experiments (qualitative and quantitative evaluations, user studies and ablation studies) that show the advantages and promising performance of the proposed method.

### Strengths
+ The proposed method is interesting and its pipeline has sufficient novelty, especially in terms of the combination of the large-scale image-to-plane backbone, the motion adapter and the Head-Torso-Background Super-Resolution model, which results in particularly realistic results. 

+ The paper includes an in-depth experimental evaluation that provides sound evidence about the promising results of the proposed method. In more detail, the proposed method is compared with several recent SOTA methods (despite the fact that some additional methods should have been included - see comments below). The evaluation includes qualitative and quantitative comparisons, as well as user studies that are important to judge the perceived quality of the results. The ablation studies are also detailed and clearly show the importance and benefits of the different modules of the pipeline. Finally, the supplementary videos are informative and help to appreciate the visual quality of the results, as well as the advantages of the proposed method over the previous SOTA techniques.

### Weaknesses
- The paper has omitted citing some important related methods of the field: 

J. S. Chung, A. Jamaludin, and A. Zisserman, “You said that?” in BMVC, 2017.

Ye, Z., Xia, M., Yi, R., Zhang, J., Lai, Y.-K., Huang, X., et al. (2022). Audio-driven talking face video generation with dynamic convolution kernels. IEEE Transactions on Multimedia.

In addition, the method is based on the projected normalized coordinate code (PNCC) representation but it has not cited one of the most important works of the field that is also based on the same representation:

Kim, H., Garrido, P., Tewari, A., Xu, W., Thies, J., Niessner, M., Pérez, P., Richardt, C., Zollhöfer, M. and Theobalt, C., 2018. Deep video portraits. ACM transactions on graphics (TOG), 37(4), pp.1-14.

Also, the method supports the conditioning of the animation based on a speech audio signal but it does not cite another important and seminal work of the field that does something similar: 

Kim, H., Elgharib, M., Zollhöfer, M., Seidel, H.P., Beeler, T., Richardt, C. and Theobalt, C., 2019. Neural style-preserving visual dubbing. ACM Transactions on Graphics (TOG), 38(6), pp.1-13.


- In the part of the Audio-driven talking face generation of the experimental comparisons, some additional recent works should have been added in the comparisons. For example, the paper should have cited and included in the comparisons the following methods that solve the same problem:

Yi, R., Ye, Z., Zhang, J., Bao, H. and Liu, Y.J., 2020. Audio-driven talking face video generation with learning-based personalized head pose. arXiv preprint arXiv:2002.10137.

Yao, S., Zhong, R., Yan, Y., Zhai, G. and Yang, X., 2022. DFA-NeRF: Personalized talking head generation via disentangled face attributes neural rendering. arXiv preprint arXiv:2201.00791.

### Questions
- In the methodology, the paper does not clarify how the per-frame head pose is predicted from the audio, in the case of audio-driven talking face generation. More details and clarifications about that should be provided. 

- In terms of the realism of the final synthetic video, one can observe that the method has some limitations regarding generating realistic background. Considering the general quality and realism of the results, this is an acceptable limitation, but the authors should openly discuss these limitations and link them with potential directions of future works.

### Summary
The paper proposes a method for realistic one-shot 3D talking face generation driven by videos and audio. Given an input source image, the method first reconstructs a canonical 3D face in the tri-plane representation with an Image-to-Plane (I2P) model. The I2P comprises 1. a ViT branch with a stack of SegFormer blocks to handle the canonicalization and a VGG branch to capture the high-frequency appearance features. The driving motion is represented by the projected normalized coordinate code (PNCC) [Zhu et al. 2016]. Instead of using the deformation field to animate as in previous papers, the method proposes to have a motion adapter composed of a shallow SegFormer to output the residual motion diff-plane given the PNCC. The sum of the canonical tri-plane and the motion diff-plane are volume-rendered and upsampled by a super-resolution module to end up with the source image driven by the given motion. Lastly, the background and the torso are composited with the Head-Torso-Background supersampling model. The driving PNCC can come from audio using an audio-to-motion model using a flow-enhanced VAE or video by fitting 3DMM to the reference video. The method is compared against Face-vid2vid [Wang et al. 2021], OT-Avatar [Ma et al. 2023], HiDe-NeRF [Li et al. 2023a] for the video-driven animation, and MakeItTalk [Zhou et al. 2020], PC-AVS [Zhou et al. 2021], and RAD-NeRF [Tang et al. 2022] for the audio-driven animation.

### Strengths
Out of the contributions that the authors claim, the motion adapter generating the residual motion diff-plane to animate the canonical tri-plane given the target PNCC seems to be the most interesting part of this work.

### Weaknesses
Some design decisions may not be well-supported. See my questions.

### Questions
Can authors clarify which 3DMM they use? Is it BFM2009 as referred from section 3.4, or is it [Blanz and Vetter 1999] as referred from B.2? Note that while they both use PCA, their bases are not compatible because they are computed from different data.

(Related to my question above)
In 3.4, authors say:
> 3DMM basis is a nonhomogeneous linear equation and has multiple solutions (e.g., BFM2009)...

At least for PCA-based 3DMMs like BFM2009 and [Blanz and Vetter 1999], this is incorrect. Because PCA bases are orthogonal, a unique least squares solution can be found by simply multiplying the principal components and the data (target 3D mesh vertex positions in this case). Because of this misunderstanding, the paper may have an over-complex setup in its audio-to-motion model.

How does the I2P model handle an input image with a non-neutral face? I.e., if the model is given an image with an extreme facial expression as the source image, what happens? Have authors thought about canonicalization in this respect? I believe a concurrent work, "Generalizable One-shot Neural Head Avatar," canonicalizes the input expression as well. Perhaps this should be clarified as a limitation.

Can authors actually show results if the deformation field is used instead of the residual motion diff-plane? The paper just says "bad quality," but this is never properly compared. The comparison video says the main issue with HiDe-NeRF (which uses the deformation field) is the temporal jittering. However, the temporal jittering is mitigated in this paper by the temporal Laplacian loss, not by the residual motion diff-plane.

Can authors provide results from multiple views to show how good the 3D reconstruction is?

Can authors consider comparisons to Next3D [Sun et al. 2023]? I understand that Next3D is an animatable 3D GAN model requiring a GAN inversion to reproduce an identity. A discussion on a concurrent work, "Generalizable One-shot Neural Head Avatar," is not required but much appreciated to understand the novelty of this work.
