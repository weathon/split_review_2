# Topology Matters in Fair Graph Learning: a Theoretical Pilot Study

- Decision: Reject
- Scores: 5, 5, 3

## Abstract
Recent advances in fair graph learning observe that graph neural networks (GNNs) further amplify prediction bias compared with multilayer perception (MLP), while the reason behind this is unknown. In this paper, \reviseb{as a pilot study, we provide a theoretical understanding of when and why the bias enhancement happens in GCN-like aggregation within contexture stochastic block model (CSBM)\footnote{We leave more general analysis on other aggregation operations and random graph models in future work. See Appendix~\ref{app:future} for more discussions.}. Specifically, we define bias enhancement as higher node representation bias after aggregation compared with that before aggregation. We provide a sufficient condition related to the statistical information of graph data to provably and comprehensively delineate instances of bias enhancement during aggregation. 
Additionally, the proposed sufficient condition goes beyond intuition, serving as a valuable tool to derive data-centric insights. Motivated by data-centric insights,} we propose a fair graph rewiring algorithm, named \textit{FairGR}, to reduce sensitive homophily coefficient while preserving useful graph topology. Experiments on node classification tasks demonstrate that \textit{FairGR} can mitigate the prediction bias with comparable performance on three real-world datasets. Additionally, \textit{FairGR} is compatible with many state-of-the-art methods, such as adding regularization, adversarial debiasing, and Fair mixup via refining graph topology, i.e., \textit{FairGR} is a plug-in fairness method and can be adapted to improve existing fair graph learning strategies. The code is available in {\color{blue}\url{https://anonymous.4open.science/r/FairGR-B65D/}}.

### Confidence
3: You are fairly confident in your assessment. It is possible that you did not understand some parts of the submission or that you are unfamiliar with some pieces of related work. Math/other details were not carefully checked.

### Summary
This paper investigates fairness in GNNs focusing on the topology. The authors explore when and why the bias enhancement occurs in GCN-like aggregation both theoretically and empirically. Theoretically, they derive the bias-enhance condition. Empirically, they generate synthetic graphs and explore the impacts of various metrics. Based on the findings, they propose a rewiring algorithm to learn an unbiased typology that is close to the original graph and has a high label homophily coefficient and a low sensitive feature homophily coefficient. Experiments show that the proposed preprocessing rewiring improves fairness when applied to the base GNNs and can be utilized along with other fairness methods to achieve a better fairness-accuracy tradeoff.

### Strengths
S1. Originality: This work is the first work to theoretically investigate the reason for bias enhancement in GCN-like aggregation. This provides novel perspectives.

S2. Quality: In general the work is of good quality. The theoretical and empirical analysis of when and how the bias enhancement occurs are convincing under the assumptions for the node feature and graph generations. Experiments validate the effectiveness of the rewiring method.

S3. Clarity: The paper is largely clear and well-structured with the logic flow being smooth and easy to follow. However, related to W3 below, there are some areas for improvement. 

S4. Significance: This work will be interesting to the fair graph learning community. The theoretical analysis could potentially inspire future works to propose other fair methods in the topology aspect. The proposed rewiring broadens existing preprocessing methods and can help improve fairness in GNNs.

### Weaknesses
W1. Concerns about Table 1 result (GAT): as observed by the authors, GAT-GR suffers a lot in its accuracy. In addition to the mentioning of “For GAT backbone, although the bias can be mitigated, the accuracy drop is significant due to the fact that GAT is more sensitive to graph topology rewire.” How to tune the fairness-accuracy tradeoff if we want to obtain better accuracy and slightly worse fairness? The ablation study reported in Figure 4 and Figure 5 in the appendix does not reveal a comparable accuracy with the base GAT model.

W2. Discussion about the theoretical analysis is encouraged: The bias enhancement condition is derived based on some assumptions related to node features and graph models. Although the empirical results have shown that the proposed method, which is designed based on insights from the theoretical analysis, is effective. Whether the theoretical analysis can generalize to more general cases is unclear.

W3. Clarity can be further improved: The paper organization can be adjusted for a better reading experience. (1) Some figures are far away from the text that mentions it. For example, Figure 1 is on top of page 6 and its analysis is at the end of page 7; a similar thing happens for Figure 2. Aligning figures more closely with the text that references them would enhance readability. (2) Some notations are confusing (refer to Q1 and Q2)

### Questions
Q1. it is not clear in definition 3.4 “the average connection degree for the node with the same sensitive attribute is the same” where the average connection degree is first mentioned here. Additionally, why introduce another notation l to represent sensitive attributes that are originally denoted as s?

Q2. What is the meaning of n-1 in theorem 3.5?

Unfortunately, the authors did not attempt to address the weaknesses or questions. Thus, I have updated my score from 6 to 5.

### Summary
In this paper, the authors provide a theoretical understanding of when and why the bias enhancement happens in GCN like aggregation within contexture stochastic block model (CSBM) and propose a fair graph rewiring algorithm, named FairGR, using topology-related fair loss to achieve fairness for node classification tasks.

### Strengths
This paper theoretically analyzes when and why bias enhancement happens in GNNs and provides a condition provably for GCN-like aggregation under CSBM. Motivated by the derived data-centric insights, this paper develops a graph rewiring method to achieve fairness for node classification tasks.

### Weaknesses
1. The literature reviews in this paper is not exhaustive, as recent relevant studies were not thoroughly discussed and summarized. The authors need to add a discussion and summary of recent relevant works, which includes but is not limited to [1-4].
2. Experiments are insufficient and are lack of comparison with related representative methods, such as [1-2]. The authors need to add comparison experiments with methods from most recent years, which related to this paper.
3. There are several works about theoretical understanding of fair in graph ML, such as [5]. The authors need to analyze the differences from them, which relates to the contribution of this paper.

### Summary
In this paper, the authors study the problem when and why the bias enhancement happens in GCN-like aggregation within the context of CSBM. The authors relate and define the bias enhancement with mutual information and show conditions when the bias enhancement occurs within the CSBM. In addition, the authors propose a modified learning objective that can adjust this bias enhancement.

### Strengths
+ It is an interesting and important problem to study
+ there are some plausible ideas in the theoretical analysis

### Weaknesses
-There exists quite some gaps with respect to the claims and the results. The authors define and measure the topology bias of GCN as the "similarity" in the learnt representation. As representation/embedding is just an intermediate product of GCN, and the focus here is not the expressiveness, it is not sure how this measure should be related to other measures of interest, e.g., how it effects the prediction of GCN.

-The results are not novel and a bit self-evident from the setting. The authors start with a setting of homophily dataset where nodes with similar features are more likely connected. As GCN adopts a subgraph/neighbour aggregation, it is not suitable to further magnify such similarity (as input contains more similar features).

-The analytical setting has some strong weakness for it to be practical. For example, it does not consider the effect on model weight.  It is not clear how the proposed result would influence the learning process of GCN and vice versa.

### Questions
— How is the "similarity in the learnt representation" measure of the topology bias of GCN related to other measures of interest, e.g., how it effects the prediction of GCN?

—How would the proposed result influence the learning process of GCN and vice versa?
