- Decision: Accept
- Scores: 6, 8, 8, 6, 3, 5

## Abstract
Zeroth-order (ZO) optimization has become a popular technique for solving machine learning (ML) problems when first-order (FO) information is difficult or impossible to obtain. However, the scalability of ZO optimization remains an open problem: Its use has primarily been limited to relatively small-scale ML problems, such as sample-wise adversarial attack generation. To our best knowledge, no prior work has demonstrated the effectiveness of ZO optimization in training deep neural networks (DNNs) without a significant decrease in performance. To overcome this roadblock, we develop \textit{\DeepZero}, a principled ZO deep learning (DL) framework that can scale ZO optimization to DNN training from scratch through three primary innovations.
\textit{First}, we demonstrate the advantages of coordinate-wise gradient estimation ({\CGE}) over randomized vector-wise gradient estimation in training accuracy and computational efficiency. 
\textit{Second},  we propose a sparsity-induced ZO training protocol that extends the model pruning methodology using only finite differences to explore and exploit the sparse DL prior in {\CGE}. 
\textit{Third}, we develop the methods of feature reuse and forward parallelization to advance the practical implementations of ZO training.
Our extensive experiments show that DeepZero achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) accuracy on ResNet-20 trained on CIFAR-10, approaching FO training performance for the first time. Furthermore, we show the practical utility of DeepZero in applications of certified adversarial defense and DL-based partial differential equation error correction, achieving 10-20\% improvement over SOTA. We believe our results will inspire future research on scalable ZO optimization and contribute to advancing  DL with black box.

### Summary
This is the comments from the fast reviewer. The paper presents a well-constructed framework introducing a sparsity-induced, BP-free optimization method for ML tasks that lack explicit first-order information, such as  black-box prompt learning and adversarial attack and defense. The method adeptly balances query efficiency and training effectiveness, outperforming existing techniques while also extending the scalability of zeroth-order optimization.

### Strengths
[Strengths] 

  -[1] The paper provides a comprehensive and well-designed comparison between CGE and RGE, demonstrate CGE becomes increasingly advantageous as model depth increases.

  -[2] They find one valuable property of CGE is the disentanglement of finite differences across coordinates, which suggests that reducing CGE’s query complexity is aligned with pruning the model weights that are being optimized. And the ZO-GraSP method leverages the flow of gradient signals to determine the sparsity prior of model weights at initialization.

### Weaknesses
[Weaknesses] 

  -[1] While the paper is generally well-explained, certain components of the proposed method could benefit from further elucidation for increased clarity. For instance, formalizing the derivation process for the layer-wise pruning rate, even if based on a pre-existing method, would significantly enhance the method's understanding and reproducibility. This improvement would fortify the paper's pivotal contribution, ensuring its effective delivery to the audience.

  -[2] In the paper, the introduction of improved inductive biases for ZO deep model training is mentioned, and the authors may need to carefully balance to ensure that these biases do not overly constrain the model's generalization performance. This may involve appropriately controlling the strength of inductive biases during model training to strike a balance between performance on specific tasks and generalization. Considering the advantages and disadvantages of inductive biases in the context of specific application scenarios and tasks is crucial.

### Questions
refer to the weakness.
In general I would expect the authors to explain the results:

[1] whether the results in Fig. 4 is SOTA or not. Shall we expect ZO is comparable or better than FO in full weight network? (not only sparse network). 

[2] How should we expect ZO v.s. FO with sparsified weights/gradients? do the authors think this is SOTA or not.

[3] How's the ZO applied to other CNNs or even other variants of ResNet beyond resent-20, and resnet-18? This shows that the ZO is not speficially tuned for Resnet-18 or resent-20. It can be applied to various structure/dataset.

### Summary
This paper shows that zeroth-order optimization methods (where gradients are calculated using finite differences) can be applied to deep neural networks. They prune the network at initialization using GraSP but use finite differences to compute the Hessian. They only sparsify the gradients and not the weights so that they can train a dense model while reducing the training cost. They apply their method to non-differentiable applications such as black-box defense against adversarial attacks, and simulation-coupled DL for discretized PDE error correction.

### Strengths
Zeroth-order optimization methods can be applied to non-differentiable problems, and are a powerful tool for such applications that would otherwise untrainable. There is increasing interest in incorporating PDE-based simulations into deep neural networks, and zeroth-order optimization is an effective tool for training such non-differentiable networks. The description of their approach is clear, and the paper is easy to follow.

### Weaknesses
The experiments on differentiable networks like ResNet-20 is distracting and seems unnecessary. If CGE is used with a small enough mu, the gradient should match that of backprop, so it is obvious that the accuracy will match that of first order methods as shown in Figure 2. If the goal of this comparison is to show the effect of sparsification and approximation errors in the finite difference, the authors should perform a thorough ablation study for the values of mu, q, and the sparsity ratio. Otherwise, I recommend removing the experiments on differentiable networks, since the aim of this paper is not to show how zeroth-order methods compare to first-order methods for differentiable problems. Having this comparison at the beginning of the experiments section may lead the readers to think about this comparison and get distracted from the true message of this paper.

### Questions
I don't quite understand the rationale behind the comparison of CGE vs. RGE for q=d. Random sampling is a compromise you make when an exhaustive search of the whole space (q=d) is prohibitive. It is obvious that CGE would be better if you can afford to sample the whole space with orthogonal directions (e_i). It is also obvious why RGE is less efficient when q=d. Since the random vectors (u_i) are not orthogonal, the samples are not independent. The real question is how you can increase the accuracy   of estimating the gradient when q << d.

In the experiments the smoothing function mu is set to 5e-3, which seems fairly large. Since the gradient is exact at the limit of mu -> 0, it would seem like a smaller value would be better. How was this value chosen, and what is the motivation for not using a smaller value?

If I understand correctly, both the “black-box defense against adversarial attacks” and “simulation-coupled DL for discretized PDE error correction” involve deep neural networks where part of the forward function is non-differentiable. If so, would it be possible to use finite difference just for the part that is non-differentiable, while using automatic differentiation for the modules that are differentiable? Theoretically, you just need to compute one of the chained Jacobians during backprop for the non-differentiable part using finite difference. I know such an implementation would be practically very painful, but if you could limit the number of parameters that you need to differentiate with finite difference it would result in a much larger reduction than pruning the whole network with GraSP.

### Summary
This paper proposed to improve Zero-Order optimization in deep nerual network learning. It first points out that Coordinate-wise Gradient Estimation (CGE) is better than Randomized Vector-wise Gradient (RGE). Then due to the query complexity of CGE is related to the parameter dimension, it propsed to introduce sparsity during ZO training. It used a combination of ZO and GraSP to measure the importance of parameters for pruning.

### Strengths
1. Connection between motivation and corresponding method is clear and sound: the fessibility of a better ZO algorithm leads to a sparse solution.
2. Combination of GraSP and ZO is interesting.

### Weaknesses
1. Sparsity acts as a tradeoff between performance and fessibility: to get faster training speed require more sparse neural network. A more ideal method is to update portion of parameters at a time while keeping model dense.
2. Author should consider combination of ZO and other sparsity-inducing method, such as OBD [1] and OBS [2] (approximated by ZO). It would add novelty if the proposed method is disentangled with specific pruning method, or it can be provided that ZO take effect only with GraSP,

### Summary
This paper proposes DeepZero, a framework that aims for scalable training from scratch with ZO. The main contributions are in 2-fold: 

(1) the authors demonstrate that coordinate-wise gradient estimation (CGE) would outperform randomized gradient estimation (RGE) under the same number of model queries, and CGE is more computationally-efficient and performs better under the same number of model queries than RGE. In addition, the authors propose to reuse the layerwise features before the perturbed parameter's model layer, and parallelize the forward computation in multiple processes. 

(2) the authors propose the ZO-GraSP algorithm that uses ZO to estimate Hessian-gradient product for each parameter for the GraSP algorithm, and select a subset of parameters to perform the ZO update with CGE. 

The authors perform experiments on ResNet-20 (and 8-layer CNN) on CIFAR10, black-box defense against adversarial attacks with DnCNN and ResNet-50 on ImageNet-10, and corrective NN with iterative PDE solver for simulating unsteady wake flow. In the image classification task, the authors also perform comprehensive scaling experiments with different sparsity ratio, parameter size, dataset size, batch size, and number of GPUs, and demonstrate the performance and scalability of deepzero framework.

### Strengths
The motivation of this paper is good as the problem is interesting for the wider optimization community: traditional ZO methods do not focus on training a large NN from scratch due to a dependency over $d$. 

The method of reusing intermediate features is effective in accelerating CGE. This method is also tailored to CGE instead of RGE as RGE would perturb all layers, and therefore change the intermediate features of all layers per each query. 

Choosing a sparse set of indices to perform ZO update would be computationally-efficient to the ZO-CGE method. I also believe the DeepZero could be more general than only the ZO-GraSP method. In this case, DeepZero could be a general framework for training deep models with ZO from scratch. 

The scaling experiments in the image-classification task are quite comprehensive.

### Weaknesses
- Although the authors make a good comparison of CGE vs. RGE with the same number of queries in Figure 2 and Table A1 and argue the computational efficiency of CGE when $q = d$, the authors do not propose a variant to CGE that would require the number of model queries sub-linear to the parameter size (the linear relationship still holds even we have sparse subset of parameters and parallelization). This issue could be fatal as if we have a model with more than 1 million parameters, DeepZero will still take significant wall-clock time to pretrain even under 90% sparsity (in fact, it already takes 28 hrs with 12k parameters in Figure 3).

- An ablation study missing in this paper is to show the performance of RGE versus the number of queries. We should expect such curve to plateau quickly, and still below the performance of CGE across multiple tasks to show the competitiveness of CGE. Ideally, this comparison should be done across models and tasks, as the statement on the advantage of CGE over RGE when $q$ = $d$ is quite strong and we will need a strong evidence to justify this argument.

- The authors claim the idea of "forward parallelization" for ZO-CGE as the novelty of this paper. Prior research (e.g. the last sentence of section 3 in Ruan et al., 2019; the second paragraph of section 1.2 in Cai et al. 2021) have indicated that the gradient estimator of ZO (both CGE and RGE) is parallelizable. However, I did not find any prior literature indicating the intermediate feature reuse of CGE, and I would accept this novelty claim at this moment.

### Questions
- Is it possible to use other pruning methods to select sparse subset with ZO than only GraSP method?

Balancing the strength and weakness of this paper, I am inclined to give a weak accept score. But I am happy to raise my score if the above concerns are addressed.

### Summary
The authors proposed a zeroth-order neural network training method that combines forward-parallelized coordinate-wise difference evaluation and zeroth-order signal-based sparsification at initialization.  They presented experimental results on Resnet-20 trained on CIFAR10.

### Strengths
- Zeroth-order optimization holds promise in explaining the biological plausibility of gradient-free learning.  Combined with network pruning, which is another biologically prominent feature, it might be useful for computational neuroscientific work.  
- Coordinate-based finite difference estimation coupled with forward parallelization is potentially useful in achieving practicality.

### Weaknesses
- Chosen model for experimentation is not complex enough to make a convincing demonstration of the effectiveness of the method.  How does it perform on training transformer architectures of larger size?  
- How much sparsification and CGE individually contributed to closing the gap between dense-FO training and sparse-ZO training is not systematically studied.  Independent ablation studies.
