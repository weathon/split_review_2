# Individual Fairness as an Extension of Group Fairness

- Decision: Reject
- Scores: 3, 3, 3

## Abstract
Since its formal definition in 2011, _individual fairness_ has received relatively little attention from the machine learning community in comparison to _group fairness_. The reasons for this are several-fold. In order to implement it, one must define a similarity metric; obtaining this is a non-trivial task and an active research area. According to individual fairness, discontinuity in modelling, and thus deterministic classification, is inherently unfair. To achieve individual fairness we must turn to probabilistic models in which predictions are randomised. For many, this flies in the face of logic. Perhaps most importantly, researchers have conflicting views on its compatibility with group fairness.

In this work we present arguments which resolve conflicting research on the nature of individual fairness. We clarify important defining features of individual fairness, framing it as an extension of group fairness, rather than acting in opposition to it. We review empirical evidence of the trade-off between group and individual fairness and derive a new representation for the associated individual fairness metric (which we term _individual cost_). With this new representation we prove that individual cost is strongly related to utility. We conclude that empirical evidence does not support the existence of a trade-off between group and individual fairness but rather, likely demonstrates the well known trade-off between fairness and utility.

### Confidence
4: You are confident in your assessment, but not absolutely certain. It is unlikely, but not impossible, that you did not understand some parts of the submission or that you are unfamiliar with some pieces of related work.

### Summary
The paper considers individual fairness (Dwork et al., 2011), and attempts to draw comparison between individual fairness and individual cost (Speicher et al., 2018), and that between individual fairness and group fairness. The paper presents how one can view individual fairness as an extension of group fairness, argues that individual fairness is orthogonal to utility in terms of definition.

### Strengths
The strength of the paper comes from the attempt to draw connection between several important considerations in algorithmic fairness research, including individual fairness, individual cost (as one type of individual fairness definition), group fairness, and utility.

### Weaknesses
The weakness of the paper comes from the unclear presentation of the problem formulation, and a lack of thorough literature review on the central topic. In particular, clarifications on the presented definition of individual fairness, which is different from the one formulated in Dwork et al. (2011), would be very helpful to understand the approach of analysis (detailed in Section __Questions__). Further discussions on other individual-level fairness notions, e.g., causal fairness notions, would help present a more comprehensive picture of the individual fairness studied in the literature.

### Questions
__Question 1__: the difference between the presented formulation of individual fairness, and the original definition presented in Dwork et al. (2011)

In the original individual fairness definition (Dwork et al., 2011), the prediction mapping is from input features to target variable ($M: V \rightarrow \Delta(A)$, where $V$ are features, and $A$ denotes outcome in their notation). In this work, the authors consider a generative modeling $\mathcal{X} \times \mathcal{Y} \rightarrow [0, 1]$, as in the definition of Lipschitz Continuity presented in Section 3. The definition claims to consider the mapping from "individuals to probability distribution over" outcome $Y$, then why $\hat{y} = f(x, y)$ take both $x$ and $y$ as input? If instead $f(x, y) \in \mathcal{P}$ (as specified in the paper), the output of $f(\cdot)$ is a distribution over outcome, instead of predicted value? The mathematical formulation is very confusing.

__Question 2__: the analyzing approach of individual fairness, where "error in features" are introduced

In Section 3.1, individual fairness as error damping, a Taylor expansion is presented. Following the above question, I am not sure how to parse this expansion. On the one hand, only the slight variation in features $x$ is included and only the partial derivative $\frac{\partial f}{\partial x}$ is included in the expansion, which seems to suggest that a discriminative (instead of generative) modeling is of interest. On the other hand, when both $x$ and $y$ are considered in the multivariate function $f(x, y)$, it is not reasonable to assume $\frac{\partial f}{\partial y}$ to always be 0 for any $(\tilde{x}, y)$ combination. I am having difficulty parsing the analyzing approach, especially considering the fact that randomness/error $\epsilon$ plays an important role in the presented discussion on individual fairness.

__Question 3__: what are the implications of the presented theorems?

Readers can benefit from more discussions on the implication of presented Theorems 1 -- 3. How to parse them and connect them to the discussion of individual fairness?

__Minor typo__:

### Summary
This paper investigated the connections between group fairness and individual fairness. The main motivation is the stated inconsistency between the empirical evidence about the trade-offs between individual and group fairness, and the theoretical argument for the alignment between the two notions. This paper resolved this inconsistency in two ways. First, the authors showed that individual fairness can be framed as an extension of group fairness. Second, the authors looked into the early work providing empirical evidence, and clarified that the individual fairness notion studied in the early work captures fairness with respect to individual cost. Moreover, through detailed mathematical analysis, they argued that the empirical trade-off between group and individual fairness actually reflects the trade-off between fairness and utility.

### Strengths
Section 3 highlights useful properties of individual fairness. Section 5 provides detailed and clear mathematical examination of the generalized entropy index in terms of accuracy and mean benefit. These results reveal interesting patterns about the trade-off between accuracy and inequality.

### Weaknesses
The main weakness is that majority of this paper is about analyzing one early work, Speicher et al. (2018) Considering the large volume of fair ML literature, I am not convinced about the general usefulness of providing further explanation of results from one single paper. In addition, the current paper uses the conflicting empirical trade-off from Speicher et al. (2018) and the philosophical argument from Binns (2019) as the main motivation. I disagree with the claimed conflict. Binns (2019) adopted the individual fairness notion from Dwork et al. (2011), but Speicher et al. (2018) discussed in their Section 2.4 that their individual unfairness measure follows different principle from Dwork et al. (2011). Therefore, it is not surprising that the two papers concluded different results about individual-group fairness trade-offs. 

About the analysis done in the current paper (Section 5), I see a disconnection between the derivation and the conclusion. The conclusion mentioned utility-fairness trade-off, but the utility definition is never clearly stated in the paper. It is therefore unclear what the utility-fairness trade-off is. 

For the other set of contributions about connecting individual and group fairness, I find the observation that individual fairness can be interpreted as an extreme case of group fairness as group size approaches 1 to be straightforward.

### Questions
1.	How to define utility in the analysis of Section 5? 

2.	The analysis in Section 5 uses the same model as the early paper. Do the techniques generalize to other formulation, e.g., different benefit definition, different inequality index? 

3.	Are there other papers providing empirical evidence of the individual-group fairness trade-offs? If so, why did the authors study the results from Speicher et al. (2018) in particular?

### Summary
This paper re-examines the definitions of individual fairness and individual cost. The authors claim that individual fairness can be considered as individual fairness by taking each individual example as a sole group. Then the authors proceed to formulate expressions for individual cost based on the cost utility. Through the visualizations the authors suggest the trade-off is between fairness and accuracy, rather than between individual fairness and group fairness.

**Update after rebuttal:**
Though the authors did not respond the reviewers separately, I read the authors' revisions and will retain my rating.

### Strengths
- This paper seems to be a comprehensive analysis for the relationship between individual fairness and individual cost. I appreciate it that the authors make very detailed interpretation of the notions of generalized entropy index and how they are derived in terms of the utility.
- I went through the derivation of the index functions and they seem to be correct.

### Weaknesses
- The paper is not well written. Notably, there is an overuse of possessive pronouns ("our features," "our model," "our xxx") throughout the text in the paragraph located at the end of page 3.
- Although the title “individual fairness as an extension of group fairness” is eye-bowling, this statement seems to be only related to Section - The rest of this paper is more than articulating the difference between individual fairness and individual cost.
- The definition of individual cost is deferred to the Appendix, making it hard to follow the main idea of the paper.

### Questions
- [Q1] How is the damped model output (the last equation at page 3) useful in Section 3.1? What is the error damping in your individual fairness problem?
- [Q2] How to interpret the conclusion at the end of page 4, i.e., individual fairness does not allow us to ignore uncertainty and choose the most probable response in all cases; it demands representation in model outputs. What is the representation referred to in this context?
- [Q3] In section 5, what is the implication of the variable $\alpha$ in the generalized entropy index?
- [Q4] Why is the index $I$ asymmetric for false positives and false negatives? Does that make sense?
