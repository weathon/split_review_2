## Abstract
The inductive bias of a graph neural network (GNN) is largely encoded in its specified graph. Latent graph inference relies on latent geometric representations to dynamically rewire or infer a GNN's graph to maximize the GNN's predictive downstream performance, but it lacks solid theoretical foundations in terms of embedding-based representation guarantees. This paper addresses this issue by introducing a trainable deep learning architecture, coined \textit{neural snowflake}, that can adaptively implement fractal-like metrics on $\mathbb{R}^d$. We prove that any given finite weighted graph can be isometrically embedded by a standard MLP encoder, together with the metric implemented by the neural snowflake. Furthermore, when the latent graph can be represented in the feature space of a sufficiently regular kernel, we show that the combined neural snowflake and MLP encoder do not succumb to the curse of dimensionality by using only a low-degree polynomial number of parameters in the number of nodes. This implementation enables a low-dimensional isometric embedding of the latent graph. We conduct synthetic experiments to demonstrate the superior metric learning capabilities of neural snowflakes when compared to more familiar spaces like Euclidean space. 

Additionally, we carry out latent graph inference experiments on graph benchmarks. Consistently, the neural snowflake model achieves predictive performance that either matches or surpasses that of the state-of-the-art latent graph inference models. Importantly, this performance improvement is achieved without requiring random search for optimal latent geometry. Instead, the neural snowflake model achieves this enhancement in a differentiable manner.

### Summary
The authors leverage the representation power of a snowflake metrics using learnable neural snowflake activation in a neural network-based model. In doing so, they prove that neural snowflake permits universal representation for learning latent graphs, which is not the case for simpler previous state-of-the-art geometric embeddings. This is demonstrated theoretically via Theorems 1-2, with particular examples provided to motivate a learnable, non-Riemannian metric. This is also demonstrated empirically with a comprehensive comparison to alternative latent graph inference methods which use more typical metrics, clearly outperforming these baselines in some cases, and performing competitively in others.

### Strengths
1. The benefit of the extension to quasi-metric spaces and a learnable neural snowflake activation is clearly explained, as the authors provide both theoretical findings and concrete examples to demonstrate the utility.
2. The experiments are thorough and well-controlled. The striking improvement in applying neural snowflake in the synthetic setting is convincing, and the marginal benefit in the "input graph" experiment of Table 3 demonstrates that this advantage is present in real data as well.
3. The universal representation power in conjunction with the fact that the model provably needs not to use a large number of parameters is a very strong theoretical result.

Overall, this is a very well-written and convincing work. While I am not entirely knowledgeable on the topic of latent graph inference, I think that the theoretical and empirical arguments of the authors provide a very clear explanation of the novelty of their approach and how it fits in the context of the current state of the field.

### Weaknesses
While the majority of the experimental results are convincing, the results of Table 4 are slightly underwhelming. It is certainly a good finding that neural snowflake is competitive in all cases, which cannot be said about any of the other approaches, but the fact that it is usually outperformed by some other method limits the applicability of this approach to real data.

Maybe there is some experiment to evaluate the method in a way that provides more initial information than the experiment in Table 4, but not entirely the original input graph as used in Table 3? However, I don't believe this is entirely necessary to convey the utility of the approach.

### Questions
While you note that this is mainly tangential to the primary focus of this paper, you mention that the suboptimality of the Gumbel Top-k edge sampling algorithm may be a reason why the improved performance of your method in the real data settings is not as pronounced. However, would this not affect all methods equally? That is, why do you suggest that an improvement in this regard might better differentiate the neural snowflake model from the baselines?

### Summary
This work studies learning latent structures from pure point clouds (a set of points without graph structures) or graph-structured data (a set of points with observed structures). The authors present rogirous analysis into the property of latent structure learning models and how to conduct latent graph inference that satifies the metric properties. Experiments on several benchmark datasets verify the proposed approach.

### Strengths
1. The paper studies an important and interesting problem

2. The theoretical analysis is rigorous and with technical depth

3. The overall writing is good though some parts can be improved to increase the readability

### Weaknesses
1. One concern lies in the clarity of the proposed model. The paper title describes the model as a "universal" method, but the main paper does not justify this point very well. For example, how universal the model is and to what extent? What is the advantage of the proposed model compared with prior art? Also, the algorithm for the model is missing, which makes the reader hard to understand what is precisely done in the model implementation.

2. The implication of the theoretical results needs to be made more clear. How can the theory apply to practical problems and what is the insight behind the analysis? 

3. The experiments are limited with four small datasets. For the Cora and Citeseer, it seems that the common benchmark settings are not used for evaluation. Can the authors provide more reasons on this and what precisely the data splits are used for the present experiments? The baselines for comparison are not sufficient, and some of the typical graph structure learning models are missing, e.g., LDS [1] and the state-of-the-art NodeFormer [2] (that also considers the Gumbel trick).

### Questions
See some of the questions in the weakness section. Besides, there are some further questions:

1. Can the model handle more difficult datasets, e.g., heterophilic graphs and graphs with incomplete edges?

2. How does the model compare with recent graph structure learning models LDS [1] and NodeFormer [2]?

3. What is the impact of the informativeness of node features on the model performance when not using the input graph?

4. Can the theoretical results be applied to graph Transformers whose attention networks can be seen as latent graph inference?

### Summary
The paper presents and analyzes a trainable metric termed "neural snowflake", which is a combination of a bounded gaussian kernel distance , a fractal component $\vert a-b \vert^\alpha$ with $\alpha \in (0,1]$ and an *irregular* fractal component in log space $\log\left(1+\Vert a-b\Vert^\beta\right)^{1+\vert p \vert}$ with $\beta \in (0,1],p\in \mathbb{R}_0^+$. This distance function is used to learn *latent* graphs from data, wherein the graph structure of a dataset or sample is inferred from the features, instead of being constructed by a human annotater.

The paper proves that

1. parametrized with an MLP as embedder and the neural snowflake and distance function, we can learn a $d$ dimensional embedding for any finite weighted graph
2. There are finite weighted graphs which are *not* similarly representable if using a euclidean distance
3. the depth and hidden width of the MLP depends favourably on the number of nodes and embedding dimensions (order $(n\log n)^{1.5}$ and linearly, respectively)
4. For specific graphs (e.g. trees) even more favourable guarantees are possible

The method is evaluated on Cora, CiteSeer (standard GNN benchmarks) and Tadpole and Aerothermodynamics (used in the paper which introduced the latent graph approach.)

### Strengths
The paper is very accessible for such a technical topic and presents its story clearly and convincingly.


Novelty/Originality: Moving from euclidean and Riemanian metrics to quasi-metric spaces is an idea which I haven't seen a lot in the literature ...and I checked because I was actually thinking about going into this direction myself but hadn't properly started working on this due to previous projects. Happy to be "scooped" in this manner!

Significance: Having provable representation power in this sense for arbitrary graphs will be an important ingredient as we move towards building less supervised relational ML models

Quality: derivations, expositions and experiments are well presented and clean. Proofs look sane to me as well, although I did not step through them in detail

### Weaknesses
1.  There is relatively high variances in most of the tables, could you please perform suitable significance tests (e.g. with a bonferonni correction) and mark those that are significant to aid the viewer?
2. I might have missed it, but what is the STD across? Evaluations or trainings? E.g. in table 7
3. Nitpick, but explicitly discussing the memory constraints and other concerns in a limitations section in the appendix helps the readers judge potential pitfalls

### Questions
Aside from Q2 in weakness, no questions

### Summary
The authors present Neural Snowflakes, a latent graph inference method. Neural Snowflakes are iterative representations that use a trainable activation function to refine input distance values $\|x - y\|$. The authors present theoretic justification for their model as well as compelling empirical results on latent graph inference tasks.

### Strengths
* The authors present compelling empirical results for their method
* Theoretical analysis underpins these empirical results
* The fact that Neural Snowflakes can break the curse of dimensionality and don't need exponentially many parameters is a very nice property

### Weaknesses
* The paper does not state the loss function the Neural Snowflake models are trained on
* There is no mentioning of the computational complexity/ scalability of the approach: does it scale to hundreds of thousands/ millions of data points? Why (not)?

### Questions
Admittedly, I am not an expert on latent graph inference, so I'm doing my best to judge the quality of the work based on the description by the authors and the results produced.
