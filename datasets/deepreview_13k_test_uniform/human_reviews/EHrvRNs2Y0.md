- Decision: Accept
- Scores: 8, 8, 8

## Abstract
Neural fields, a category of neural networks trained to represent high-frequency signals, have gained significant attention in recent years due to their impressive performance in modeling complex 3D data, such as signed distance (SDFs) or radiance fields (NeRFs), via a single multi-layer perceptron (MLP). 
However, despite the power and simplicity of representing signals with an MLP, these methods still face challenges when modeling large and complex temporal signals due to the limited capacity of MLPs.
In this paper, we propose an effective approach to address this limitation by incorporating temporal residual layers into neural fields, dubbed ResFields. It is a novel class of networks specifically designed to effectively represent complex temporal signals. 
We conduct a comprehensive analysis of the properties of ResFields and propose a matrix factorization technique to reduce the number of trainable parameters and enhance generalization capabilities. 
Importantly, our formulation seamlessly integrates with existing MLP-based neural fields and consistently improves results across various challenging tasks: 2D video approximation, dynamic shape modeling via temporal SDFs, and dynamic NeRF reconstruction. 
Lastly, we demonstrate the practical utility of ResFields by showcasing its effectiveness in capturing dynamic 3D scenes from sparse RGBD cameras of a lightweight capture system.

### Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of modeling non-static scenes with NeRF, where introducing a temporal dimension 't' significantly increases the required model capacity. A method for temporal information modeling is proposed, which by employing a low-rank representation, controls the amount of parameters to be learned. This approach enables temporal modeling without affecting the network size. Alongside, this paper innovates by integrating temporal residual layers in neural fields, dubbed ResFields, showcasing an effective way to represent complex temporal signals without increasing the size of Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs), thus offering a promising solution to the capacity bottleneck for modeling and reconstructing spatiotemporal signals.

### Strengths
Strengths:
The method proposed in this paper is simple and effective, with clear and easy-to-understand writing, and ample experiments.
Novelty:
This paper introduces a lightweight, plug-and-play module to enhance NeRF's  capability for dynamic objects.
Generalization:
This paper applies ResFields to various base models and downstream tasks, achieving a certain performance improvement across the board.

### Weaknesses
The main issue is that this paper lacks references to and comparisons with closely related methods, such as [1][2][3][4]. These works all address the problem of modeling non-static scenes, which is closely related to the theme of this paper. These methods primarily model a normalized space, then model the relationship between the 3D expression at each moment 't' and the normalized space. The absence of this comparison leads to (1) unclear performance advantages, and (2) uncertainty about whether ResFields could also be applied to these methods to further enhance temporal modeling capability.

### Questions
1. The symbols in Equation 5 are not explained.
2. Why are the results of NGP plus ResFields not shown in Table 1?
3. Can ResFields, like LoRA[5], provide further dynamic modeling capabilities to a pre-trained NeRF?

### Summary
This paper propose a way to extend MLP-based neural fields to have the capability to model time-dependent signals. The key ideas is to modulate the residual of the MLP weights by a time-dependent matrices decomposed into a vector matrix. This decomposition share a right basis, which allows reusing structures between time steps, providing regularity and potentially helping with generality. The paper shows good quantitative results that support the claim. I believe this idea is simple and effective, and it’s can be a good contribution for the community.

### Strengths
- The idea is very simple. The simplicity of such idea allows it to be combined with different design of neural fields as long as the main training parameters are parameterized by matrices.
- The quantitative results shows that it’s also effective to certain degree. The ablation studies also seems to support the effectiveness of techniques.

### Weaknesses
- (minor) The paper provides little intuition of why this particular factorization is chosen rather than some alternative ways to factorize these matrices. For example, can we make v(t) to be N_ixR_i and M_i to be R_ixM_i? Is there any intuitive reason why this is not a good choice? Maybe this is addressed in the ablation study in Section 4.4, but providing some more intuition is good.
- (minor) While the idea seems to support any matrix-like weight parameterization, the specific factorization might provide different interpretation depending on the way the network use the weight matrix. Maybe the specific design choice is limited to MLP architecture.
- Concern about long sequence. The sequence weight at time t is modeled as W_o + \Delta W_t. When t is very far from the original frame, then the weights \Delta W_t can have significant weights, so it’s not clear to me whether sharing the same matrix M across all time steps is a good idea. Maybe the author can consider periodically updating the weight W_o once a while?

### Summary
The paper proposes a method for improving the performance of coordinate-based network representation of various temporally varying signals. The key contribution of the method is that rather than having the network learn to represent temporal variation in a completely unstructured way, the temporal variation is instead modeled by a low-rank weight matrix which is added to a base weight matrix that is shared across all time instances. This exploits the temporal consistency in the underlying signals being represented, and results in a more parameter efficient and high-quality representation of the underlying signal. This is benchmarked across various tasks in which coordinate-based networks are used, such as video overfitting, dynamic SDF fitting, and dynamic neural radiance field fitting, where ResFields (the contribution) demonstrate consistent increased performance.

### Strengths
In my opinion the strengths of the paper are as follows:
1. The paper is described exceptionally clearly, and the method makes intuitive sense on why it would improve performance for representation on temporal signals. The relative simplicity of the method and lack of reliance on a number of complex hyperparameters makes it more likely that future methods will be influenced and use the contributions.
2. The evaluations are thorough, across three different temporal signal representation tasks, all demonstrating clear improvements from the ResField contribution. In each of these domains, a number of baseline methods are all compared against. I found that the comparisons on dynamic NeRF especially are thorough, using many different state-of-the-art methods and all showing that ResFields leads to increased performance.
3. The method is ablated well, and various ablations show the contribution of the method is actual source of the improvements.

### Weaknesses
In my opinion, the main weaknesses of the paper are:
1. To me, it is unclear how much capacity the low-rank representation has to model various dynamic components. While this may not be a problem in something like dynamic NeRF or dynamic SDF where the signal remains relatively constant over time, for overfitting a 2D video, where there may be cuts or completely different scenes, I would be interested to see how the method performs. In this case, it seems like the low-rank weight matrix approximation would be required to model all of the signal, as there is little consistency shared in the underlying signal over time and thus less information to store in the shared weights. Could this potentially be a limitation of the method?
2. One additional minor weakness is that the method seems like it may add significant amount of computational overhead. For every iteration, the weight matrix of the underlying representation needs to be changed. Does this result in significant slowdown in optimization? It would be an insightful comparison to include this in the baseline comparisons, especially in the dynamic NeRF scenario where speed of fitting is very important. If this adds a significant amount of computational overhead, it is possible that the amount of gains is not worth it, and could be achieved by simply training a standard representation for longer.

### Questions
I do not have any additional questions on the manuscript. Overall, as described in the strengths section, I see the paper as a good paper: the method is described well, simple, and makes intuitive sense, and then it is evaluated well across a number of tasks and ablated to show that the improvement comes from the proposed contribution. For this reason I am positive on the paper and leaning towards acceptance. I see some minor weaknesses in the potential capacity of the model, and especially in the potential computational overhead of the method in training speed. Addressing these weaknesses would incline me to raise my scores for the paper.
