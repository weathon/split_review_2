# VFLAIR: A Research Library and Benchmark for Vertical Federated Learning

- Decision: Accept
- Scores: 8, 3, 8

## Abstract
Vertical Federated Learning (VFL) has emerged as a collaborative training paradigm that allows participants with different features of the same group of users to accomplish cooperative training without exposing their raw data or model parameters. VFL has gained significant attention for its research potential and real-world applications in recent years, but still faces substantial challenges, such as in defending various kinds of data inference and backdoor attacks. Moreover, most of existing VFL projects are industry-facing and not easily used for keeping track of the current research progress. We also benchmark $11$ attacks and $8$ defenses performance under different communication and model partition settings and draw concrete insights and recommendations on the choice of defense strategies for different practical VFL deployment scenarios.

### Rating
8

### Rating Number
8

### Confidence
4: You are confident in your assessment, but not absolutely certain. It is unlikely, but not impossible, that you did not understand some parts of the submission or that you are unfamiliar with some pieces of related work.

### Summary
The paper presents a research library and benchmark named VFLAIR for vertical federated learning. VFLAIR contains 9 datasets, 29 models, 2 communication protocols, 3 data partitioning, 11 attacks, and 8 defense methods. Model performance, attack and defense performance, and communication protocol comparison are comprehensively evaluated.

### Strengths
1. While vertical federated learning is a promising research direction with many real-world applications, it is less exploited compared with horizontal federated learning. Unlike horizontal federated learning systems, there is a lack of a comprehensive vertical FL library. This work is a significant contribution to the FL community.

2. The library is comprehensive and includes many models, attacks, and defense methods.

3. Experiments are extensive, especially for the attack and defense part.

### Weaknesses
1. The writing needs to be further improved. The paper claims that VFLAIR is a lightweight and extensible framework but does not demonstrate why it is. The introduction of the framework is limited. Besides introducing the components of VFLAIR in Figure 1, the paper should also introduce what is the systematic design of VFLAIR and demonstrate why it is very easy to use and extend.

2. The insights in Section 6 should be highlighted. Currently, the paragraph is too long (especially Section 6.2) and readers are hard to find interesting results from the experiments. I suggest the authors put the insights at the beginning of each subsection.

3. It seems that the paper divides the datasets into multiple subsets equally. Non-IID data partitioning is an important factor in FL and would be good to be included in VFLAIR. Also, it’d be better to include real-world vertical federated datasets besides partitioning a centralized dataset.

4. The communication protocols in the library are not rich. Only two methods are considered.

### Questions
1. Can you demonstrate how to use VFLIR and how to extend it? 

2. Can you summarize and highlight interesting findings at the beginning of each subsection of Section 6.1?

3. Will you consider including more communication protocols, real-world vertical federated datasets, and data partitioning methods in the library?

### Summary
This paper proposed a benchmarking framework for vertical federated learning. It proposes new evaluation metrics such as defence capability score (DCS)

### Strengths
This paper aims to propose a framework that can provide universal benchmarking solution for vertical federated learning. 

The literature review is commendable, especially on the attack and defence part.

### Weaknesses
- The paper predominantly centers on evaluating attacks and defence strategies. But the paper title implies a broader scope – VFL in its entirety. The paper title could be more specific to align with the focus of the paper. 

- A notable contribution is the introduction of new evaluation metrics such as defence capability score (DCS). However, the experiments did not validate the effectiveness of the proposed metrics. What is the evidence that shows that the proposed metrics indeed work, representing the real ability of the evaluated algorithms?

- The paper claims to “implement basic VFL training and evaluation flow under multiple model partition, communication protocols and attacks and defences algorithms using datasets of different modality”. But it lacks a clear exposition of the workflow. What is the training and evaluation flow in VFLAIR and how does the workflow facilitate the benchmarking? 

- Following on the above point, the evaluation section is not organised systematically according to model partition, communication protocols, and attack and defence algorithms. The current evaluation section only amounts to a compilation of experimental results, which 
requires a more structured, systematic and coherent organization. 

There is only one paragraph in related work. There is no need to employ a bullet point at the beginning

### Summary
This paper aims to develop a lightweight vertical federated learning (VFL) platform (VFLAIR) framework consisting of multiple model partitions, communication protocols, and attack and defense algorithms using datasets of different modalities. Under this platform, the unified evaluation metrics and benchmark defense performance with various attacks are introduced,  which sheds light on choosing defense techniques in practical deployment.
Although this paper summarizes most of the VFL settings, some advanced model partition and communication protocol algorithms are missed. In this way, I suggest authors should add these missed algorithms. In addition, I think some evaluations of this platform should be developed to show how it is lightweight. Some recommendation tasks should be considered, such as Criteo, Avazu, etc.

### Strengths
This paper can provide a VFL platform for researchers to evaluate the performance and efficiency of their proposed algorithms. This platform from five aspects, i.e., model partitions, communication protocols, attacks, defenses, and dataset modalities, which are very significant for VFL studies. The strengths of this paper are as follows: 
1. Most of the VFL settings, e.g., model partitions, communication protocols, attacks, defenses, and dataset modalities, are included in this platform.
2. This platform provides unified evaluation metrics and benchmark defense performance with various attacks,  which can guide the selection of defense techniques in practical deployment.
3. The analysis of experimental results is sufficient and insightful.

### Weaknesses
Some weaknesses are shown as follows:
1. Although this paper summarizes most of the VFL settings, some advanced model partition and communication protocol algorithms are missed.  In this way, I suggest authors should add these missed algorithms, such as quantization, federated graph neural networks, etc.
2. I think some evaluations of this platform should be developed to show how it is lightweight.
3. VFL is usually adopted in recommendation tasks instead of image classification. The authors apply too many image classification datasets in the experiments.
4. As discussed in limitations, the cryptographic techniques that are significant, are not included in this library. 
5. The communication and computation efficiencies are also very important. The metrics should include the evaluation of the communication and computation efficiencies.

### Questions
1. Please add some advanced model partition and communication protocol algorithms, such as quantization, federated graph neural networks, etc.
2. Add some compassion and discussion on how this platform is lightweight.
3. The authors apply too many image classification datasets in the experiments. Some recommendation tasks should be considered, such as Criteo, Avazu, etc.
4. As discussed in limitations, the cryptographic techniques that are significant, are not included in this library. 
5. The communication and computation efficiencies are also very important. The metrics should include the evaluation of the communication and computation efficiencies.
