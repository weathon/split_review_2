- Decision: Accept
- Scores: 8, 6, 8

## Abstract
We propose Hyper-Dimensional Function Encoding (HDFE). Given samples of a continuous object (e.g. a function), HDFE produces an explicit vector representation of the given object, invariant to the sample distribution and density. Sample distribution and density invariance enables HDFE to consistently encode continuous objects regardless of their sampling, and therefore allows neural networks to receive continuous objects as inputs for machine learning tasks, such as classification and regression. Besides, HDFE does not require any training and is proved to map the object into an organized embedding space, which facilitates the training of the downstream tasks.  In addition, the encoding is decodable, which enables neural networks to regress continuous objects 
by regressing their encodings.  Therefore, HDFE serves as an interface for processing continuous objects. 

We apply HDFE to function-to-function mapping, where vanilla HDFE achieves competitive performance with the state-of-the-art algorithm. We apply HDFE to point cloud surface normal estimation, where a simple replacement from PointNet to HDFE leads to  12\% and 15\% error reductions in two benchmarks. 
In addition, by integrating HDFE into the PointNet-based SOTA network, we improve the SOTA baseline by 2.5\% and 1.7\% on the same benchmarks.

### Summary
This paper proposes Hyper-Dimensional Function Encoding (HDFE), which encodes a continuous object (eg, functions) into a fixed-size explicit vector representation without requiring training. While it maintains the benefits of vector function architecture (VFA), satisfying sample invariance and decodability, it relaxes the strict assumption on the function form in VFA into Lipschitz functions by introducing a novel iterative refinement process. While HDFE serves as a general interface for a continuous object encoder without training, substituting HDFE for domain-specific algorithms in experiments on mesh-grid data and sparse data shows comparable performance. 
The main contributions of the papers are: 

(1) The authors propose a novel function encoding method that satisfies key properties of VFA while relaxing the strict assumption on function space to  Lipschitz continuity. 

(2) Theoretical foundations and empirical analysis support the validity of HDFE on key properties. 

(3) Experimental results confirm that replacing domain-specific algorithms with HDFE maintains competitive performance and robustness to the noise perturbation.

### Strengths
- The paper is well written and easy to follow. 

- The formulation of the decodable encoder and iterative refinement process for sample invariance seems interesting and convincing. Also, theoretical analysis on each component is clear and supports the claims.

- Despite the general and straightforward formulation, empirical results demonstrate the effectiveness of HDFE.

### Weaknesses
Method

- One concern is the computational cost of HDFE induced by the iterative refinement process. In order to employ function representation for the downstream tasks, computational costs of HDFE is important. it may hinder application to large-scale tasks. 

Experiment

- Overall, it’s convincing that HDFE is a reasonable and general interface for processing continuous objects, supported by the experiments. However, it’s less convincing why we should use HDFE instead of other domain-specific encoding methods. The authors claim that sample invariance is a crucial property for the machine learning tasks throughout the paper, but it lacks the supporting experiment revealing HDFE’s efficacy in those scenarios (i.e., sample distributions are different in training and test dataset). It would make the paper stronger if it presents the experiments with scenarios having disparate sample distributions between training and test datasets and compares the performance of HDFE compared to the baselines. 

- In the experiment section, it lacks the analysis why HDFE is more beneficial than the counterparts (e.g., PointNet) in terms of the performance. It would improve the understanding of HDFE if analysis on which component leads to the performance gap even when the noise is absent is provided.

### Questions
- How long does the HDFE take compared to the baselines (eg, pointNet in Experiment 3.2)? Is the iterative refinement process applicable to a large number of samples? How long does it take for convergence in the process? 

- In the formulation on decoding, (i.e., equation between eq. (2) and eq.(3)), can you please clarify on why orthogonality property ensures that $E_X(x_i) ⊘ E_X(x_0) $ will produce a vector orthogonal to $E_X(x_0)$ when the distance between two samples is large? Also what does the noise mean? Does it mean that it’s near zero so that it is a negligible component?

- In the formulation on decoding, (i.e., equation between eq. (2) and eq.(3)), it seems it misses $w_i$. 

- For an unbinding operation, element-wise division of complex vectors is used. But I don't think this operation is commutative, which violates the assumption. Can you please clarify on this? 

- In experiment 3.1, how does the function prediction error is measured? Is it measured in embedding space? And the paper states that “when decoding is not required, our approach achieves lower error than FNO”, but how can we compare to FNO, which directly predicts the solution? 

- While the authors claim that HDFE is robust to point perturbation, the experiments on  [PCPNet - PointNet + HDFE] in Table 1 shows that the performance boost becomes much less as the noise level increases. Can you please elaborate on this?

- [Possible Typo] In the last sentence in section 2.1, “appendix F.1” should be “appendix E.1”.

### Summary
This submission propose a module, namely Hyper-Dimension Function Encoding (HDFE), to map a continuous object (data sample) into a fixed-dimension vector without any training.
The author asserts that the proposed approach possesses four key characteristics: (1) sample distribution invariance (2) sample size invariance (3) explicit representation (4) decodability.
To obtain the fixed-length vector representation, the input data for HDFE must adhere to Lipschitz continuity and will be transformed into a high-dimensional space, where a weighted average will be computed.

### Strengths
1. The manuscript demonstrates excellent organization, a well-defined research problem, clear logic, and skillful writing.

2. The topic holds significant importance: a method that can map data samples with varying distributions and sizes to fixed-length sequences may be highly appealing for pre-training models that utilize cross-domain data.

3. The theory effectively connects with the experiment: the utilization of a weighted average operation has the potential to reduce noise effectively.

### Weaknesses
1. It is necessary to provide a clear definition of "implicit representation" and "explicit representation" in the manuscript. Some reviewers may intuitively refer to the fixed-length vector representation of a data sample as "implicit representation" since it may not be human-friendly. However, in this manuscript, the fixed-length vector representation is referred to as the "explicit representation."
2. The proposed method (HDFE) relies on the assumption that the input data follows Lipschitz continuity. While the reviewer agrees that point cloud data intuitively follows Lipschitz continuity, it would be beneficial for the manuscript to include an analysis of the types of input data that adhere to Lipschitz continuity.

3. As a module that doesn't require any training, it is important to provide detailed guidance on selecting hyperparameters. This includes guidance on choosing the size of the fixed-length vector representation (denoted as $N$) and determining the hyperparameters $\alpha$ and $\beta$ in Equation 5, which are influenced by the receptive field $\epsilon_0$ and the Lipschitz continuous constant $c$.

4. 2The selection of weights ($w_i$ in Equation 1), hyperparameters ($\alpha$ and $\beta$), and the mapping functions $E_X$ and $E_Y$ are highly dependent on the dataset. This means that if the task or input data changes, all these variables need to be carefully decided and tested.

5. There is a small concern regarding the experimental results on the PCPNet dataset. The proposed HDFE method is demonstrated to outperform the PCPNet model (the baseline in 2018) simply by replacing PointNet with HDFE. However, it is only comparable to the current state-of-the-art (SOTA) method, outperforming it in four out of twelve metrics, albeit with a slight drop in average performance. It would be valuable to provide insights or explanations for these observations and discuss any potential limitations or implications of the results.

### Questions
1. In line 7 of page 2, why is the representation learned by PointNet (Qi et al., 2017a) not easily decodable? For instance, in their original paper (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1612.00593.pdf) in Figure 2, it seems possible to set m=3 and obtain normalized point clouds. Additionally, other works like [1] may also be able to 'decode' the input from the vector representation. Is there any difference between this manuscript and those works?

2. When experimenting with batches, should the model visit all data samples to decide hyperparameters? According to Equation 3, the decoding step should visit all $\bm Y$.

3. By curious: why a high-dimensional input does not affect the size of the fixed-length vector representation $N$. Could the author provide further explanation, possibly an extension of the paragraph on 'Scale to high-dimensional input'?

4. in Section 2.3, the manuscript only shows the picking of $E_X$ and $E_Y$ when the function output y is scalar. Are there more cases that can be considered?

5. Although HDFE is a deterministic function, is there any empirical result available to estimate the information loss from the raw input to the fixed-length vector representation?
