## Abstract
Transformer architecture search (TAS) has achieved remarkable progress in automating the neural architecture design process of vision transformers. Recent TAS advancements have discovered outstanding transformer architectures while saving tremendous labor from human experts. However, it is still cumbersome to deploy these methods in real-world applications due to the expensive costs of data labeling under the supervised learning paradigm. To this end, this paper proposes a masked image modelling (MIM) based self-supervised neural architecture search method specifically designed for vision transformers, termed as MaskTAS, which completely avoids the expensive costs of data labeling inherited from supervised learning. Based on the one-shot NAS framework, MaskTAS requires to train various weight-sharing subnets, which can easily diverged without strong supervision in MIM-based self-supervised learning. For this issue, we design the search space of MaskTAS as a siamesed teacher-student architecture to distill knowledge from pre-trained networks, allowing for efficient training of the transformer supernet. To achieve self-supervised transformer architecture search, we further design a novel unsupervised evaluation metric for the evolutionary search algorithm, where each candidate of the student branch is rated by measuring its consistency with the larger teacher network. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the searched architectures can achieve state-of-the-art accuracy on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet datasets even without using manual labels. Moreover, the proposed MaskTAS can generalize well to various data domains and tasks by searching specialized transformer architectures in self-supervised manner.

### Rating Number

### Confidence
4: You are confident in your assessment, but not absolutely certain. It is unlikely, but not impossible, that you did not understand some parts of the submission or that you are unfamiliar with some pieces of related work.

### Summary
This paper incorporates the MIM based self-supervised learning with the NAS framework for vision transformers. It also introduces a siamesed teacher-student architecture for the NAS search space to distill knowledge from pre-trained networks, which shows better convergence. 
It also develops a novel unsupervised evaluation metric for the evolutionary search algorithm, where teacher networks guide the student branch search. 
Experimental results show competitive results to STOA accuracy supervised and unsupervised model results.

### Strengths
1. This paper introduces the self-supervised learning framework into the NAS framework for vision transformers. 
2. This paper also introduces a siamesed teacher-student architecture to facilitate the supernet training convergence. 
2. Experimental results show competitive results to STOA accuracy supervised and unsupervised model results.

### Weaknesses
1. There are some statements in the paper which needs further clarification (see details in the Question section)
2. It's not clear the impact of the self-supervised learning and teach-student distillation framework individually. Is it possible to add some ablation studies?
3. It's not clear on the overhead and tradeoff of training another teacher encoder-decoder network.

### Questions
1. Could you clarify how does MaskTAS "which completely avoids the expensive costs of data labeling inherited from supervised learning"? How does MaskTAS perform classification tasks? Will labels be need for fine-tuning the classification heads?
2. Is there any evidence to support MaskTAS can "generalize well to various data domains and tasks by searching specialized transformer architectures in self-supervised manner"?

### Confidence
5: You are absolutely certain about your assessment. You are very familiar with the related work and checked the math/other details carefully.

### Summary
This paper proposes to combine masked image model with transformer architecture search in a self-supervised setting. The author designed a new metric to measure the searched results from the supernet. The proposed method achieves competitive results on ImageNet.

### Strengths
The experiments are comprehensive, including imagenet/cifar/ade20k. 
The writing is good, the motivation is clear, and the method is sound.

### Weaknesses
The only concern is the unfair comparison in the experiments. It is unclear whether the performance gain is coming from knowledge distillation or training with the reconstruction objective. 

Therefore, I suggest the author report the experimental results using only masked image modeling on ImageNet & Cifar & ADE20K, since the baseline that MaskTAS compares did not use KD in their approach.

### Questions
I will raise my rating if the results using only masked image modeling can outperform SOTA methods.

### Summary
This paper presents a self-supervised NAS method for vision transformers (ViT). Specifically, the proposed method applied masked image modeling as the self-supervised method. The transformer supernet is composed of two models, a fixed-arch teacher model and a student super-network which were optimized simultaneously. The knowledge distillation strategy was used to allow for efficient self-supervised training of the supernet, and an unsupervised evolutionary search algorithm was designed to achieve self-supervised transformer architecture search. The paper is well written and easy to understand. The authors have conducted quite extensive experiments which show that the proposed method achieves good results in general. In particular, the searched architectures can achieve state-of-the-art accuracy on benchmark dataset without using manual labels.

### Strengths
+ The proposed method designs the first self-supervised NAS technique for vision transformers (ViT). The shining point is that It proposes the first unsupervised evolutionary search algorithm, in order to achieve self-supervised transformer architecture search.
+ The experiments are quite solid and demonstrate SOTA performance without using manual labels.
+ The paper is well written. The motivation and problem statement are clear and easy to understand.

### Weaknesses
- I was not able to find the architecture of the final searched model in the paper. I would like to see the entire architecture of searched models, rather than a single number that indicating the final performance. This is particularly important in the NAS literature.
- Typically, in a NAS paper, the final output is the architecture, which should be trained again from scratch to test the "true" performance. In this work, the weights that are distilled during training are preserved and used for fine-tuning in the downstream tasks. It would be better if the authors could provide an explanation on this. 
- Some of the experimental details are missing, for instance, where do all the numbers in Table 1 come from?

### Summary
In this paper, the authors propose a masked image modelling (MIM) based self-supervised neural architecture search method specifically designed for vision transformers. The paper avoids the expensive costs of data labeling inherited from supervised learning. The paper can generalize well to various data domains and tasks by searching specialized transformer architectures in self-supervised manner.

### Strengths
1. This paper is written in a clear and accessible manner, making it easy to comprehend.
2. The utilization of mask image modeling for the search of efficient Transformer structures significantly mitigates the high costs associated with supervised learning
3. This paper formulates the configuration of MaskTAS's search space as resembling a teacher-student framework, and the notion of extracting knowledge from pre-trained networks is indeed a noteworthy proposition.

### Weaknesses
1. The authors mentioned that experiments were conducted on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 for assessing the transferability of self-supervised architecture search methods. However, it should be noted that the paper does not provide the corresponding experimental results.
2. In Table 1, it is evident that the approach introduced in this paper underperforms when compared to the use of a CNN model, across multiple dimensions, including performance, parameter size, and FLOPs. What is the rationale behind the author's decision to employ the Transformer architecture?
