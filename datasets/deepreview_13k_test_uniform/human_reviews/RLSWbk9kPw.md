- Decision: Accept
- Scores: 6, 6, 6, 6

## Abstract
Sorting is a fundamental operation of all computer systems, having been a long-standing significant research topic. Beyond the problem formulation of traditional sorting algorithms, we consider sorting problems for more abstract yet expressive inputs, e.g., multi-digit images and image fragments, through a neural sorting network. To learn a mapping from a high-dimensional input to an ordinal variable, the differentiability of sorting networks needs to be guaranteed. In this paper we define a softening error by a differentiable swap function, and develop an error-free swap function that holds a non-decreasing condition and differentiability. Furthermore, a permutation-equivariant Transformer network with multi-head attention is adopted to capture dependency between given inputs and also leverage its model capacity with self-attention. Experiments on diverse sorting benchmarks show that our methods perform better than or comparable to baseline methods.

### Summary
The main content of the paper is the proposal of a generalized neural sorting network with error-free differentiable swap functions. The authors introduce scaled dot-product and multi-head attention and provide proofs for several propositions related to their network. They also discuss the effects of multi-head attention in the problem they are addressing and present empirical studies on the performance gains achieved by their proposed methods.

### Strengths
1. Generalization: The proposed neural sorting networks with error-free differentiable swap functions provide a general framework for solving sorting tasks on various types of data, including multi-digit images and image fragments.

2. Performance Improvement: The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed methods outperform the baseline method in terms of sorting performance, as measured by accuracy metrics.

3. Numerical Analysis: The authors provide a thorough numerical analysis of the effects of their methods, compared to the baseline method. This analysis validates the effectiveness of the proposed methods in sorting tasks.

4. In terms of writing, it is explained quite clearly, and one can generally follow the author's train of thought.

### Weaknesses
1. Since the methods proposed in the paper are based on sorting networks, they are not applicable to solving general problems in computer science, such as combinatorial optimization. This implies that it may not be easy to devise a neural network-based approach for solving these types of problems using the ideas presented in this work.

2. In terms of the results, it can be observed that as the sequence length increases or the number of segments grows, the performance decreases significantly.

3. I find it somewhat challenging to grasp the practical significance of this work. I believe that this work lacks practical significance to some extent.

### Questions
1. I hope the author can provide a detailed explanation of the practical significance of this work.

### Summary
The paper introduces a new approach to sorting through neural networks. The authors extend traditional sorting mechanisms to handle more abstract and high-dimensional data types like multi-digit images and image fragments. The core contribution is an "error-free differentiable swap function," which allows the network to learn a mapping from complex inputs to sorted sequences effectively. This work aims to broaden the applicability of sorting algorithms by making them more versatile for dealing with intricate data types.

### Strengths
- Novelty: The paper introduces a novel "error-free differentiable swap function" to generalize sorting algorithms for more complex data types.
- Mathematical Rigor: The paper employs rigorous mathematical formulations to define the sorting problem and its extension for high-dimensional data.
- Methodological Approach: The use of a permutation-equivariant Transformer network with multi-head attention is a strong methodological choice for capturing dependencies between elements in the sequence.
- Clarity and Organization: The paper is well-organized and clearly written, making it accessible to readers who are familiar with the domain.

### Weaknesses
- Insufficient Discussion on Limitations: While the paper mentions that its methods are limited to sorting algorithms, it doesn't provide a thorough discussion on other potential limitations, such as scalability or conditions under which the method may not work well.
- Hyperparameter Sensitivity: The paper discusses various hyperparameters like steepness and learning rate but does not provide a comprehensive analysis of their impact, which could be a concern for practical implementations.
- Complexity of the Model: The use of a permutation-equivariant Transformer network with multi-head attention could make the model computationally expensive, which is not addressed in the paper.
- Missed Opportunity for Theoretical Analysis: While the paper is empirically driven, a more in-depth theoretical analysis could strengthen the paper by providing bounds or guarantees on the performance of the proposed methods.

### Questions
How sensitive is the model's performance to the choice of hyperparameters like steepness and learning rate? Could the authors provide more insights into this?
Could the authors provide a more comprehensive discussion on the limitations of their approach, particularly in terms of scalability and conditions where the method may not be applicable?

### Summary
This paper examines an error-free differentiable swap function, which enables the creation of trainable sorting networks which do not accumulate errors as multiple applications of this function are performed. The authors evaluate the sorting network created using their swap function, and demonstrate improvements over previous differentiable sorting techniques.

### Strengths
- The proposed method is simple and easy to understand. The function used is equivalent to using the soft version of the maximum / minimum functions during the backward step, and the exact functions during the forward step. This allows for differentiability, without accumulating errors.  I especially appreciated the presentation of the samples in Figure 3, as it helped me understand how the method precisely works.

- The authors perform experiments on a variety of architectural choices and sequence lengths, which affect the accuracy of sorting algorithms. They show how incorporating an attention based part in the architecture is the better choice for sorting large sequences of data, since it provides a way to incorporate the entire sequence of data to sort and contextualize the output for each sample.

### Weaknesses
- Overall, while interesting, the applicability of the method seems limited at first glance, since one can in principle learn the function that maps samples to ordered objects first and then perform the sort using standard methods. I believe that the authors should either better motivate the need for this sort of method, or demonstrate in their experiments why learning the ordinal value directly does not perform as well.

- I think there is a gap in the proof of Proposition 2. Namely, the fact that the soft minimum and the soft maximum are the same as $k \to \infty$ seems like it is missing a step in how it is derived. I believe that it should hold, given the differentiability of the function, but filling in the missing step here is needed.

- I believe that certain parts can be improved with respect to the clarity of the paper. More specifically:

  - It seems to me that the paper assumes that the function used to soften the maximum is the sigmoid, and some of its properties are listed in Section 2 - however, it is not clear if the sigmoid is the only choice, or if these properties are sufficient for a function to satisfy. I would appreciate it if the authors could clarify this point.

  - Again in Section 2, I had some trouble understanding the wire-based construction of the permutation matrix, especially since the associated Figure is in the Appendix. I believe that the point of the authors would be clearer if they moved the Figure in the main paper, as well as simplify the explanation for the construction (saying, e.g., that each wire is a step to fix a single wrong ordering, and iterative application of these steps results in a sorted set).

  - I believe that Figures 1 and 2 can be simplified / combined, since they are essentially showing similar things - namely, that the function is error-free, which is not surprising given that it is not softened during the forward pass.

  - In Section 7, the paragraph “Utilization of Hard Permutation Matrices” is not very clear to me. I would appreciate it if the authors could rephrase the point they are trying to make here.

- As a minor point, in Section 6, the authors should rephrase how they refer to previous works, for example: “The work (Petersen et al., 2021) has suggested …” -> “Petersen et al. (2021) have suggested…”.

Overall, I think this is an interesting work, but I believe that the authors should improve upon the clarity of the paper and the motivation of their technique.

### Questions
As mentioned above, I would be grateful if the authors could clarify the paragraph “Utilization of Hard Permutation Matrices” of Section 7.

### Summary
The authors investigate the properties of differentiable swap functions for neural sorting. They conclude that the existing methods shrink the difference between different elements at each application of the swap function. This has a negative effect on the performance of such networks. To alleviate this problem, the authors propose an Error-Free Differentiable Swap Function, based on the straight-through estimator. Also, they propose to use transformers without positional encodings for processing the raw inputs before they are fed to

### Strengths
- Simple method
- Better performance on long sequences
- Motivated by analyzing existing methods

### Weaknesses
- No clear distinction between the Transformer-based network vs the differentiable swap function. These are two orthogonal changes, and the Transformer seems to have much more performance impact than the swap function itself. Yet, the paper focuses mostly on the swap function.
- The method uses both the soft and the hard sorting network for training. Also, Tab 15 shows that training with $\lambda = 0$ has basically no effect on the quality of the trained network. As the standard deviations are not shown, it is unclear whether there is any effect here, but $\lambda=1$ seems to hinder accuracy. This begs the question if the Error-Free Differentiable Swap Function has any contribution to training, or just during inference, in which case there is no need for the straight-through estimator. It would be worth evaluating the baseline Optimal Diffsort with hard min/max during inference, to see this.

Based on the 2 points above, I'd like to see two sets of experiments:
- the best optimal diff sort models with identical transformer architecture to those of the Error-Free DSF
- The same architecture as the best Error-Free DSF with \lambda=0 (thus, being equivalent to using hard min/max during inference, but being trained as "Diffsort Optimal")

### Questions
Why are the results on 4-digit MNIST with a seq length of 32 significantly better in Tab 1 than in Tab 15?
