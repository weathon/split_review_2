# Continual Nonlinear ICA-Based Representation Learning

- Decision: Reject
- Scores: 3, 3, 3

## Abstract
Unsupervised identification of disentangled representations remains a challenging problem. Recent progress in nonlinear Independent Component Analysis (ICA) provides a promising causal representation learning framework by separating latent sources from observable nonlinear mixtures. However, its identifiability hinges on the incorporation of side information, such as time or domain indexes,  which are challenging to obtain adequately offline in real-world scenarios.  In this paper, we develop a novel approach for nonlinear ICA that effectively accommodates continually arriving domains. We first theoretically demonstrate that model identifiability escalates from subspace to component-wise identifiability as new domains are involved. It motivates us to maintain prior knowledge and progressively refine it using new arriving domains.  Upon observing a new domain, our approach optimizes the model by satisfying two objectives: (1) reconstructing the observations within the current domain, and (2) preserving the reconstruction capabilities for prior domains through gradient constraints. Experiments demonstrate that our method achieves performance comparable to nonlinear ICA methods trained jointly on multiple offline domains, demonstrating its practical applicability in continual learning scenarios.

### Summary
This paper considers the identifiability of nonlinear ICA in the continual learning setting i.e. under a changing and partially changing domains. The identifiability theorems show that under a sufficiently large number of domains with significant changes, the latent components can be identified up to component-wise nonlinearity. For a lower number of domains, subspace identifiability is still guaranteed as long as there are more domains than changing variables. A learning algorithm based on VAE and GEM (method for continual learning) is introduced and its performance (on identifiability) is presented on simulated data.

### Strengths
The paper's idea to identify nonlinear ICA in terms of sequential learning is novel. The authors nicely show how as the number of domains increases, the identifiability improves which is an interesting, albeit expected, result.

### Weaknesses
There are some major weaknesses and questions.

**1. Contribution is not clear since relevant previous work is ignored:**:

a). You claim that *"[Nonlinear ICA] still relies on observing sufficient domains simultaneously..."*. -- Not true necessarily: for example [1], shows the identifiability of hidden Markov nonlinear ICA. As is well known, HMMs can be learned sequentially / in online fashion with the latent states analogous to different domains. Authors have not covered relation to this work.

b). Related to above: [1] and [2] give a broad identifiability theorem that applies to situation with a changing latent variable that can be interpreted as the changing domain that alters the probability distributions i.e. it seems to already to cover mostly what is considered in the identifiability theorems here, and provides stronger results in a more general setting. It is therefore important to contrast to this work and explain what is novel here. Note that I understand that the sequential learning is different, but here I am only talking about the identifiability theorem. Other important and similar work is also ignored and need to be discussed such as [3]-[6]. Note also that most of these works *do not* assume auxiliary variables.

c). The paper is frames itself as "Causal Representation Learning" but it seems like it's much more related to nonlinear ICA and doesn't learn latent causal relationships -- see [6] and [7]. I recommend the authors to reconsider the use of this term.

**2. Experimental evaluation is lacking**

a). The author's only evaluate their model on synthetic data, no real data is used and the importance of this method to practicable applications is not clear

b.) Baseline does not include any of relevant previous works e.g. [1] could be reasonable adapted to this data


**3. Several issues on theory and estimation algorithm**

a.) The identifiability theorem appears not to consider observations noise -- yet the estimation method VAE clearly includes that. This mismatch and its impact on identifiability can be significant (Theorems 1, 2 in [2]) but this is ignored here

b.) The identifiability theorem does not appear to consider dimension reduction into the latent space, which is in practice very important. Without that you are usually stuck with high dimensional latent space -- and the theorems presented here are unlikely to hold with high dimensional latent variables making it unclear how useful the work is in practice. 
 

**Other issues:**

a). You use "component-wise identifiability" but really this is inaccurate, you do not identify the elements component-wise, rather you identify them up to component-wise *nonlinearity*. This needs to be fixed in order to make sure the reader doesn't misunderstand and think that you can exactly identify each components. 

b). "Importantly, the guarantee of identifiability persists even when incoming domains do not introduce substantial changes for partial variables". Please clarify what is meant by partial variables -- the term has not been defined by this point.

c). It is not explained clearly enough that the conditions in Theorems 1 and 2 are *sufficient* conditions, not *necessary* and I feel there is some confusing writing related to this. You for example say that "However, when considering domains u0, u1, u2, the component-wise identifiability for z1 disappears, and instead, we can only achieve subspace identifiability for both z1 and z2." This is not necessarily true -- according to your own theorems you can only *guarantee* subspace identifiability (sufficiency) but since theorem 1 does not give *necessary conditions* you can not say that "the component-wise identifiability for z1 disappears," it could still be component-wise identified,

misc.:
- the z in Figure 2 should not be bold if I'm correct
- poor grammar: "will contribute to both domains and we remain the direction.", "where no loss increment for previous domains."
- Figure 5 coming before Figure 4 is extremely confusing
- "We evaluate the efficacy of our proposed approach by comparing it against the same model trained on sequentially arriving domains and multiple domains simultaneously, referred to as the baseline and theoretical upper bound by the continual learning community." Could you please clearly define "joint" and "baseline" so that the reader can understand them.
- I dont see "Table 1" mentioned anywhere in the text, making it hard to understand

### Questions
Q1. You write that "Thus, a fully identifiable nonlinear ICA needs to satisfy at least two requirements: the ability to reconstruct the observation and the complete  consistency with the true generating process. Unfortunately, current research is far from achieving this level of identifiability." Could you please explain what you mean by "far from achieving this level"?

Q2. Could you please explain how realistic the assumption in equation (3) is? After all, the method here is somewhat heuristic so we can not expect MLE-style guarantees

Q3. Am I correct understanding that this model does not allow dimension reduction into latent space?

Q4. The two paragraphs relating to Figure 2 are very hard to understand. In fact, the paragraph break between "Given our subspace identifiability theory, z1 can achieve subspace identifiability." and "As there is no change in the other variables in those two domains, this subspace identifiability is equal to competent-wise identifiability." doesn't seem to make sense. Why is there a paragraph break here? Further why is there $u_3$ if it's not mentioned in the text?

Q5. You write "Contrasted with the traditional joint learning setting, where the data of all domains are overwhelmed, the continual learning setting offers a unique advantage. It allows for achieving and maintaining original identifiability, effectively insulating it from the potential "noise" introduced by newly arriving domains." I think this is really a key, and very interesting if true, but as far as I understand, there is no theoretical way of proving this exactly? Am I correct in understanding this is more what you believe Theorem 1 implies? 

Q6. "Assuming the function is invertible, we employ a flow model to obtain the high-level variable"-- Supposedly this high-level variable is not identifiable however? What is the impact of its unidentifiability?

Q7. What does the apostrophe in eq (6) mean?

Q8. I am bit confused by the lack of detail in the experiments section -- how is the experiment in Figure 5 different from the top-right one in Figure 4. 

Q9. "We evaluate the efficacy of our proposed approach by comparing it against the same model trained on sequentially arriving domains and multiple domains simultaneously, referred to as the baseline and theoretical upper bound by the continual learning community." Could you please clearly define "joint" and "baseline" so that the reader can understand them. 

Q10. "model achieves the component-wise identifiability and the extra domains (from 9 to 15) do not provide further improvement." How can you be sure it really is component-wise identifiable? Are all the components around similarly identified or is there a lot of variance?

Q11. why is there so much variance in the other methods in Figure 5b.)?

### Summary
This paper studies identifiability of VAE models trained on a stream of different data domains. The ground truth generative model assumes that one part of the latents is domain-dependent, and another part domain-independent.

### Strengths
I really enjoyed reading the paper. I think the motivation is clear, the problem interesting and relevant. Some theoretical and algorithmic innovation is given, and the theory is validated by synthetic experiments (but see weaknesses below).

### Weaknesses
The biggest weakness by far is the empirical investigation. The theory, while interesting and relevant, seems too incremental to justify acceptance just based on the theoretical contribution --- more empirical validation and comparisons to prior work is needed. The main weaknesses are:

- There is no discussion of potentially competing ICA approaches in the literature, and no comparison to baseline algorithms. The evaluation is only with regards to the proposed setting, no external validation takes place. Especially the joint training setup is applicable to a variety of non-linear ICA methods, so a better empirical comparison would greatly enhance the positioning w.r.t prior work.
- It is a bit tricky to connect the sections in the appendix to the theorems/proposition of the paper. It would enhance readability if there are clear headings in the appendix, and/or the authors would re-state the results from the paper.
- In the derivation in A1 and the following sections, the arguments to the Jacobians, e.g. $J_h$, are dropped. I find it not always clear from the context to infer the arguments. I am especially wondering (but might be wrong) whether the Jacobian $J_h$ depends on $\mathbf u$, see my question below. In any case, stating the argument of $J_h$ would improve readability of the proof.
- between Eqs (21), (22), is it necessary to keep the $\mathbf 0$ argument? I find this more confusing/uncessary than helpful, but might overlook something.
- The method is purely validated on synthetic toy datasets. There's a wealth of e.g. image datasets available (dsprites and the like) to validate the approach on more complex distributions, without drastically increasing the number of latent factors. Such an exploration would improve the paper a lot, I would be happy to discuss a choice of datasets with the authors before running experiments. This could be especially interesting to "convert" an existing benchmark into the continual ICA setting.
- There are a lot of typos in the appendix and proofs, in general more care could be taken with spellchecking and typesetting. A common typesetting issue is missing spaces, or inconsistent upper/lowercasing (assumption / Assumption, etc). This should be fixed.
- A2, Proposition 2, typesettng errors ($<\le$ etc).

My current assessment is based on the current state of the paper, which can be improved in terms of clarity in the theory (esp. in the appendix) and the experimental results (comparisons to more baseline methods from the literature, scaling beyond synthetic data). I think with good execution and improvement along these dimensions, the current paper story and problem setting could easily get a 6 or even 8 in score, and I expect to re-adapt my evaluation during the rebuttal phase based on the the improvements made.

### Questions
- Figure 5: The error bars are quite large between baseline and joint --- did you run a test whether the improvements observed are signficant?
- Performance of the empirical validation is far from optimal, MCCs are substantially smaller than 1. What would it take to observe a result close to the "theoretical limit"? Have you considered how different components (number of latents, number of samples in the dataset, ...) influence the final result?
- In A1, does $J_h$ depend on $\mathbf u$?
- "the distribution estimate variable $\tilde z_j$ doen't change across all domains" -> Can you clarify why this is? That statement is not obvious to me in the context of the proof.
- "Similarly, $q_i \dots$ remainds the same for ...$ -> same concern, not obvious, maybe a ref is needed.
- Is there a reason why $\mathbf u$ is assumed to be a vector? for the purpose of the proof, isn't it sufficient to assume an integer value? (the function $f_u$ might still map it to a vector internally, I am just not sure why that assumption is needed).

### Summary
This paper studies an interesting topic: causal representation learning. Recent works in nonlinear Independent Component Analysis (ICA) provide a promising causal representation learning framework by separating latent sources from observable nonlinear mixtures. This paper introduces a new approach that optimizes the model by satisfying two objectives: (1) reconstructing the observations within the
current domain, and (2) preserving the reconstruction capabilities for prior domains through gradient constraints. Experiments show that the proposed approach can achieve good performance.

### Strengths
1. This paper is well-written.
2. The research topic in this paper is interesting.

### Weaknesses
1. It is not clear how you address continual learning.
2. What is the actual form for the domain variable u?
3. This paper only considers a general continual learning setting, which relies on the task information. However, the proposed approach can not be used in task-free continual learning.
4. The theoretical framework is based on the existing work (Kong et al., 2022).
5. The number of baselines in the experiment is small and more continual learning experiments should be performed.
6. Since this paper employs the generative model. The lifelong generative modelling experiments should be provided.
