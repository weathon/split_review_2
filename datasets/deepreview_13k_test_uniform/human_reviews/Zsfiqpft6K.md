# Diffusion Model for Dense Matching

- Decision: Accept
- Scores: 8, 8, 8, 8

## Abstract
The objective for establishing dense correspondence between paired images consists of two terms: a data term and a prior term. While conventional techniques focused on defining hand-designed prior terms, which are difficult to formulate, recent approaches have focused on learning the data term with deep neural networks without explicitly modeling the prior, assuming that the model itself has the capacity to learn an optimal prior from a large-scale dataset. The performance improvement was obvious, however, they often fail to address inherent ambiguities of matching, such as textureless regions, repetitive patterns, large displacements, or noises. To address this, we propose \ours, a novel conditional diffusion-based framework designed to explicitly model both the data and prior terms for dense matching. This is accomplished by leveraging a conditional denoising diffusion model that explicitly takes matching cost and injects the prior within generative process. However, limited input resolution of the diffusion model is a major hindrance. We address this with a cascaded pipeline, starting with a low-resolution model, followed by a super-resolution model that successively upsamples and incorporates finer details to the matching field. Our experimental results demonstrate significant performance improvements of our method over existing approaches, and the ablation studies validate our design choices along with the effectiveness of each component. Code and pretrained weights are available at \href{https://ku-cvlab.io/DiffMatch}{https://ku-cvlab.io/DiffMatch}.

### Summary
The paper presents DiffMatch, a novel framework for dense matching that explicitly models both the data and prior terms. DiffMatch leverages a conditional denoising diffusion model to address inherent ambiguities of matching, resulting in significant performance improvements over existing techniques. The paper argues that recent approaches have focused on learning the data term with deep neural networks without explicitly modeling the prior, but these approaches often fail to address inherent ambiguities of matching. DiffMatch addresses these issues by explicitly modeling both the data and prior terms using a diffusion model, which is trained to denoise the input image conditioned on the output of the matching network. The paper provides experimental results demonstrating the effectiveness of DiffMatch on several benchmark datasets, achieving state-of-the-art performance in terms of accuracy and efficiency.

### Strengths
The paper presents a novel framework for dense matching, DiffMatch, and shows significant performance improvements over existing techniques. I believe this is one of the first work to apply diffusion model to solve dense correspondence (flow estimation) tasks and the results are very encouraging. The proposed approach tries to address inherent ambiguities of matching, such as textureless regions, repetitive patterns, large displacements, or noises. The approach also seems to be efficient and scalable, making it suitable for real-world applications. Overall, the paper's contributions are significant in advancing the field of dense matching.

The paper is well-written and clearly demonstrates the proposed approach and experimental results. The authors provide a detailed explanation of the diffusion model and its application to dense matching, as well as a thorough evaluation of the proposed approach on several benchmark datasets. The paper's contributions are supported by the experimental results, which demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. The paper is well-organized and easy to follow. The authors provide a clear explanation of the proposed approach and its application to dense matching, as well as a detailed evaluation of the approach on several benchmark datasets. The paper's contributions are clearly presented and supported by the experimental results.

### Weaknesses
I do not have major concerns on the paper less lacking some details. One notable improvement will be adding more discussions to diffusion based dense prediction networks, especially methods like DDP [1]. It is questionable to me why DDP is not directly applicable to the task of dense matching. Another possible improvement is to add diffusion-based dense prediction models as baselines to the method (\eg a DDP model trained on dense flow supervision).

### Questions
1. It is common for dense matching models to also test on various tasks such as optical flow estimation (KITTI) and two-view geometry estimation (ScanNet / YFCC100M). Are there specific reason your model cannot achieve these similar tasks?
2. Adding more discussions / baselines to some diffusion-enabled dense prediction networks would further strengthen my recommendation.

### Summary
This paper proposes a new technique for finding dense correspondences between two 2D RGB images, using a generative rather than discriminative model, specifically a conditional diffusion model. The key insight is that this allows optimizing the full posterior (data and prior terms in the Bayesian formulation) instead of the likelihood. The authors propose additional technical components to get the pipeline to work robustly and accurately.

### Strengths
With the caveat that this is not my precise area of specialization: I enjoyed reading the paper and think that the proposed method is elegant and interesting. The idea of treating the correspondence field as an image to be synthesized is compelling. The additional components in the pipeline (e.g. for super-res) seem appropriately chosen. The results are good -- even if they don't always beat state-of-the-art baselines -- and definitely good enough given that the technique is of independent methodological interest.

### Weaknesses
"These approaches assume that the matching prior can be learned within the model architecture by leveraging the high capacity of deep networks"

For the argument in the paper to be more compelling, the above statement needs to be clarified. Exactly how is the prior "learned within the model architecture"? Can we say something more precise about how the prior is captured, and how much of it, in these earlier methods?

How many samples were used to compute the MAP estimates used for statistics in the tables, as per Section 4.6? And were these samples chosen i.i.d. from the standard normal distribution?

### Questions
Minor:
- Please don't write $1e^{-4}$ when (I assume) you mean $10^{-4}$. $e$ is the base of natural logarithms. If you must use scientific number formats (please do it only in code, not papers!), do note that it's written $1e-4$, not $1e^{-4}$.

### Summary
This work proposes to use a diffusion model to model a data prior for dense correspondence matching. In particular the authors use a standard feature extraction and dense matching stage to have an initial guess for a dense matching field, then they refine it using a diffusion model trained to predict the residual over the initial guess and finally upsample it using a second diffusion model. With this structure they are able to achieve competitive results compared to the SOTA in dense correspondence matching. The use of a diffusion model to model the data prior of their system implies that the proposed solution is actually a generative system that given an initial dense matching field can sample plausible output ones; as a by-product of this formulation the authors propose to model matching uncertainty as discrepancies in the sampling process with some preliminary interesting results.

### Strengths
+ **Novel formulation of the problem**: to the best of my knowledge I have not seen a diffusion model used in this context to refine a matching field. 

+ **Possibility to model uncertainty**: the proposed formulation models a distribution of plausible matching fields given an initial guess and therefore models implicitly the uncertainty of the matching process. Fig. 6 in the supplementary shows some preliminary analysis of the modeled uncertainty. I found this emerging property of the formulation extremely interesting although only a preliminary exploration is reported in the paper.

### Weaknesses
a) **Possible generalization concerns and limited experimental evaluation**: modeling a prior on what a good matching field looks like using a diffusion model exposes the proposed solution to generalization problems since the prior will only model the type of matching flows seen during training. For example in the extreme case where the method is trained only with match fields coming from homographies it will probably not generalize well to other types of non-rigid transformations between frames. The competitors have this type of limitation in a less pronounced way since they focus on improving feature extraction and matching rather than modeling a global prior on what a “good matching field” should look like. Whether this problem arises in practice is hard to estimate from the current paper since the experimental validation is rather limited compared to the main competitors.T he proposed method is evaluated only on two datasets for dense correspondence matching and on two corrupted versions of the same datasets. Competitors like GOCor, PDCNet and PDCNet+ are evaluated on other datasets (e.g., MegaDepth and RobotCar) and additional correspondence tasks (e.g., Optical Flow on KITTI, Pose Estimation on YFCC100M and ScanNet).

b) **Inference time concerns**: Tab. 5 of the paper compares the inference time of PDCNet(+) vs the proposed method with 5 sampling steps and shows that the two proposals are comparable. However in Sec. 4.6 the authors mention that in practice they sample multiple times and average the diffused fields to get the final performance. Depending on how many samples are drawn it will have an impact on the runtime making it grow significantly. From the current paper it is unclear if this multiple sampling strategy is used in the experimental validation ro only in Appendix C.2 and whether the inference time of Tab.5 are taking this into account or not. If not (as it seems like from the text) the inference cost will be significantly higher than competitors.

c) **More ablation studies and unclear dependency on the initialization**: the core of the work is the use of a diffusion model to refine an initial estimation of a matching field ($F_{init}$). From the paper it is unclear how much the prior is able to recover in case of a bad initialization or not and whatever, if possible, the model will need more diffusion steps to recover from a bad conditioning. I would have liked these aspects to be discussed as part of the ablation study. Another interesting ablation that would have nicely complemented the work would have been using the dense cost volume as conditioning to the diffusion process. If the concern is around hardware limitations a test should still be possible at lower resolutions.

### Questions
### Questions

1. Can you comment on weakness (b.) and clarify whether the reported numbers are with/without multiple sampling?

2. Could the proposed conditional denoising diffusion module be plugged on top of other dense correspondence methods to enhance their performance (possibly with retraining)? For example could step (b) of this method be combined with PDCNet+ to further boost the performance? 


### Suggestions

* Tab. 6 in the appendix is a repetition of Tab. 1 in the main paper
* I would suggest using a more obvious color map for Fig. 6 in the appendix, right now is a bit hard to parse.
* I would also suggest rename DiffMatch to PDCNet+ for the qualitative comparison in Fig. 4-5 since that’s the anime used in the table?

### Summary
The authors propose a framework for dense matching for a pair of images using conditional diffusion models. In particular, the framework consists of 2 stages. In the first stage an initial cost volume is computed from the features of the source and target images. The cost volume is used to calculate initial global and local flow information. In the second stage, the initial flow field is refined using a multiscale conditional diffusion model to predict dense correspondence between source and target models. Comparisons are provided with recent baselines and state of the art performance is demonstrated.

### Strengths
1. **Paper quality**: The paper is well-written and clearly presented, with attention to detail. The authors have clearly put a lot of effort into making the paper easy to read and understand.
2. **Comparisons**: The paper provides adequate comparisons to several baselines, on two different datasets, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed approach.
3. **Ablation**: The ablation studies clearly highlight the need for all of the introduced components, which provides additional evidence for the effectiveness of the proposed approach. The appendix also provides an insightful ablation on the effect of matching quality for number of sampling steps. 
4. **Related Works**: An adequate and detailed treatment of related works has been provided to place this work in the context of literature related to dense correspondence computation. 
4. **Approach** The proposed approach is simple and elegant, which makes it easy to understand and implement. Represents a good demonstration of the correspondence matching algorithm.
5. **Design of Prior** Computing initial value from a cost volume constructed from a pre-trained VGG-16 network and only learning residual is an efficient strategy as the displacement to be learned is smaller than what would need to be learned otherwise.
6. **Reproducibility** : All the details of the feature extraction network to compute the cost volume and the details of the diffusion model is provided in detail, aiding in the reproducibility of the proposed approach. 
6. **Appendix** The authors provide a clear and detailed appendix section, which is helpful for readers who want to learn more about the proposed approach.

### Weaknesses
1. **Novelty** : The novelty is somewhat limited to the specific design of the conditioning to the diffusion model. Computation of cost volume using pretrained network have been used in many flow computation networks (as in Glu-Net). In particular, the main novelty is the smart choice of inputs and outputs for the diffusion model. Elaborating a bit more on the challenges of the design will help highlight the novelty of this approach. 
3. **Generalization**: The framework shows impressive performance on dense matching for the given datasets, but providing a sense of how generalizable this is to in-the-wild captures, is potentially helpful.
4. **Performance limits**: The qualitative example demonstrated show dense correspondence matching for relative simple transformations between source and target. Providing some insights about how the framework performs for wide baselines or for settings with large viewpoint changes would be helpful.

### Questions
1. In this setting is $F_{init}$ extracted from VGG-16 considered the prior term ?
2. What is effect of choice of feature extractor on $F_{init}$. Do features extracted from different extractors like ResNet variants still provide reasonable $F_{init}$ for further optimization? In particular, since this is only used as initialization, would the downstream performance be fairly agnostic to this choice?
