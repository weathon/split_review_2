# Learning Unorthogonalized Matrices for Rotation Estimation

- Decision: Reject
- Scores: 3, 6, 5

## Abstract
Estimating 3D rotations is a common procedure for 3D computer vision. The accuracy depends heavily on the rotation representation. 
One form of representation -- rotation matrices -- is popular due to its continuity, especially for pose estimation tasks. The learning process usually incorporates orthogonalization to ensure orthonormal matrices. Our work reveals, through gradient analysis, that common orthogonalization procedures based on the Gram-Schmidt process and singular value decomposition will slow down training efficiency. 
To this end, we advocate removing orthogonalization from the learning process and learning unorthogonalized `\textbf{P}seudo' \textbf{Ro}tation \textbf{M}atrices (PRoM).
An optimization analysis shows that PRoM converges faster and to a better solution. By replacing the orthogonalization incorporated representation with our proposed PRoM in various rotation-related tasks, we achieve state-of-the-art results on large-scale benchmarks for human pose estimation.

### Summary
This paper claims that a popular rotation estimation technique (6D representation) for deep learning has a critical flaw, i.e., ambiguous gradient. The paper tries to demonstrate this with some derivations, and the authors propose to use the pseudo rotation matrix technique (using a plain 3x3 matrix directly, with an additional loss that makes it similar to the ground truth rotation) to overcome this issue. This pseudo rotation matrix is orthogonalized in the test phase. Experiments show that the proposed method has less variation in the gradient, and it shows somewhat better performance in several downstream tasks, including 3D body/hand pose and shape estimation.

### Strengths
The topic of the paper (rotation estimation in deep learning) has some importance in the field.

### Weaknesses
- To tell the truth, I was one of the reviewers of this paper in a previous venue. I see that the authors have removed some wrong derivations, but there are still many vague and wrong claims in the paper.

- Most claims in the paper are either vague or not surprising (not showing what the authors intended to show). Most importantly, the proposed method (using a plain 3x3 matrix without any orthogonalization and instead guiding it to a rotation matrix using an additional loss, i.e., soft constraint) is a somewhat basic technique that has been frequently used in the literature. Accordingly, I'm afraid the paper has little merit to the research community. The detailed errors (or concerns I have) are listed below:

- Section 3.4.1 (and Appendix A.3) basically says that (5) has two more terms other than the first term, so the gradient can be scrambled. The claim itself is vague, but before that, what the authors need to show is not that there are two more terms, but that these two terms do not die out (and actually steer the overall gradient towards funny directions) in the majority of the input space. In (12)-(16), we can actually see that there are many duplicating expressions, as well as many terms related to cross-product, inside those three terms. This suggests that the two terms (related to $r_2$ and $r_3$) might actually be canceled, either by themselves or by combining the two. I actually showed this in my previous review for a specific case provided in the previous manuscript. This might hold for larger regions in the input space if we do the manipulation. The authors must explicitly derive against this to justify their claim, not suggesting them as in the current paper.

- Theorems in Section 4.2 are not surprising, and most importantly, they do not prove anything. What they are showing are (specific) upper bounds of losses for orthogonalized and unorthogonalized cases. This does not guarantee anything. They do not guarantee that the actual loss will be lower for the unorthogonalized case, and moreover, there is no proof that they are the best upper bounds we can have (so it is not correct to say that the unorthogonalized case has a better chance of a lower loss).

- The meaning of Fig. 3 is vague. It simply shows that the correlation between the gradient and $t_{11}$ is not apparent in Euclidean space. This has nothing to do with the stability or ambiguity of the gradient. More importantly, it is obvious that the relation between the gradient and the parameter is more complex for orthogonalization than for plain identity mapping.

- What if we do not have ground truth rotations? Without $L_\theta$, it is possible that PRoM deviates too far from the rotation space, and this can be detrimental to having a correct solution. What should we do then?

### Summary
The work studied the rotation representation for rotation estimation and other downstream tasks, such as human body and hand shape/pose estimation. An issue with orthogonalization in learning was pointed out: this could lead to explosive gradient and hence harm the training stage stability. To overcome this, this work proposes to get rid of the step of orthogonalization during learning, and only including this step during inference step. Theoretical proofs are derived to support the claim of the proofs and evaluations on multiple tasks verify the effectiveness of the proposed rotation representation.

### Strengths
1. The work focus on the choice of rotation representation, the very basic but vital ingredient in rotation estimation task. This is in contrast to most work in 3D pose estimation, and has the potential of larger impact in the field. 
2. The method is simple yet effective. The motivation for the method is put clear. Gradient update is affected by the extra step of orthogonalization. By simply removing it, the baseline method could be improved. 
3. Evaluations tasks are very extensive. These include human body, hand, and pure rotation estimation tasks. Three cases are considered with respect to the availability of intermediate rotation ground truth / end-task supervision.

### Weaknesses
1. The evaluations consider two baselines (Zhou et al., 2019; Levinson et al., 2020). Both methods use 6D representations with differences in normalization. A comparison to more recent methods [1,2] should be more convincing. 

2. The proposed method chose to base on CLIFF (Li et al., 2022). Since the proposed method is not a novel framework, it is generally applicable to any existing methods for pose estimation. Hence, I assume that PROM could be used together with baselines to also improve learning. 

3. In the area of camera pose regression, it has been shown that predicting pseudo rotation matrix during training works in [3] and quantanion without orthogonalization is also possible [4]. As a result, the novelty of this work might be reduced to introducing the simple idea to other tasks.

### Questions
1. There may be a typo in Sec 3.4.1. In Eq.5, the gradient is respect to $t'_1$, but the text refers to $t'_2$ and $t'_3$ to show the column-gradient will be in different directions. Please confirm this. 
2. This method seems to be very simple, simply removing the $r$ and $g$. why is removing $r$ possible? If I understand correct, $r$ is the mapping from input to rotation representation, and should not be identity mapping. 
3. My biggest concern is: if orthogonalization can be safely removed as suggested by this work, why the previous work adopted GS or SVD to make the rotation representation valid?

### Summary
The paper presents PRoM, a method to learn pseudo-rotation matrices. The motivation is that the paper claims that learning rotation matrices in a deep learning framework suffers from imposing orthonormality constraints by means of SVD or Gram-Schmidt. The proposed method removes these orthogonalization methods and apply the estimated rotation matrix. The paper presents a mathematical analysis discussing the reasons about why SVD or Gram-Schmidt suffer when applied in a deep learning framework. The paper presents experiments on various applications (e.g., human pose estimation and point cloud pose estimation) showing that PRoM outperforms the included baselines.

### Strengths
S1. I think the paper does a good job analyzing the problems that orthogonalization methods introduce when used in the learning frameworks.

S2. I find the experiments interesting because they show the improvements PRoM can bring to human pose estimation, cloud pose estimation, among other applications.

S3. The paper is well written and is easy to follow  and understand. Clarity thus is high and should be easy to replicate.

### Weaknesses
While I think the paper touches a very interesting topic (i.e., rotation estimation in deep learning frameworks) and shows interesting results, I have several concerns that make me a bit skeptical about the approach:

1. Lack of discussion about other possible ways to constrain orthonormality in learning problems. While the problems of orthogonalization in the learning problem may bring issues as described in the paper, there are other possible solutions that the paper does not discuss. For example: 

i) In 3D computer vision, some camera-pose estimation solvers constrain the rotation with $I - M^{\intercal}M$ and $\text{det}(M)=1$ pose problems and showing good estimation results (see Reference [A]). Why couldn't this trick replace the SVD or Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization procedures? Although, the paper does not discuss a learning approach, the trick is applicable to any learning problem. Unfortunately, the paper lacks discussion about these tricks and if they also present problems when learning.

ii) Learning rotation with neural networks does not need to follow the pipeline shown in Figure 1. One can easily use a quaternion parametrization, remove $\mathcal{L}_{\theta}$ and thus remove the orthogonalization, and simply add a regularizer term that enforces the norm of the quaternion be one.

2. The continuity issues discussed in the submission and that are used to motivate the problem are questionable. One of the main claims of the paper in Learning for Rotations in Section 2 states that the parametrization of 3D rotations with four or fewer dimensions is discontinuous and non-ideal for learning (according to Zhou et al. 2019). However, Zhou et al. 2019 defines the continuity concept from an intuitive example and lacks solid theorems showing that these definitions and observations strictly apply to learning rotations. Subsequent works using quaternions show that they work well with neural networks (see Reference [B] below). Reference B conflicts with the observations of Zhou et al. which is the foundation of this work and explore pseudo-rotation matrices. Thus, this puts into question the main assumptions stated in Section 2.

3. The paper would've been more solid if they included the discussed methods in 1 (see above).

### Questions
Given the rationale described in the Weaknesses above, I don't find the proposed method of using pseudo-rotation matrices that convincing. It marries to the pipeline of learning rotations to that one described in Figure 1 of the submission. However, I think there are other ways to learn rotations that are not discussed in the submission.
