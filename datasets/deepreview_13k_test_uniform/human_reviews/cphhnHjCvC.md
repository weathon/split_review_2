## Abstract
\vspace{-0.1cm}

Most recent work in goal oriented visual navigation resorts to large-scale machine learning in simulated environments. The main challenge lies in learning compact representations generalizable to unseen environments and in learning high-capacity perception modules capable of reasoning on high-dimensional input. 
The latter is particularly difficult when the goal is not given as a category (``\textit{ObjectNav}'') but as an exemplar image (``\textit{ImageNav}''), as the perception module needs to learn a comparison strategy requiring to solve an underlying visual correspondence problem. This has been shown to be difficult from reward alone or with standard auxiliary tasks.
We address this problem through a sequence of two pretext tasks, which serve as a prior for what we argue is one of the main bottleneck in perception, extremely wide-baseline relative pose estimation and visibility prediction in complex scenes. The first pretext task, cross-view completion is a proxy for the underlying visual correspondence problem, while the second task addresses goal detection and finding directly. We propose a new dual encoder with a large-capacity binocular ViT  model and show that correspondence solutions naturally emerge from the training signals. Experiments show significant improvements and SOTA performance on the two benchmarks, \textit{ImageNav} and the \textit{Instance-ImageNav} variant, where camera intrinsics and height differ between observation and goal.

### Confidence
4: You are confident in your assessment, but not absolutely certain. It is unlikely, but not impossible, that you did not understand some parts of the submission or that you are unfamiliar with some pieces of related work.

### Summary
The authors introduced pretext tasks and a dual visual encoder for ImageNav and Instance-ImageNav navigation in 3D environments, which provide rich geometric information and make it possible to address the challenging mono-view setting with end-to-end trained methods. Via experiments it is shown that peformance on competing methods and SOTA on both benchmarks is better.  The idea of cross-view completion and goal direction computation as pre-text for ImageGoal in contrast to ObjectGoal is the philosophical novelty in the work. Apart from that, the pipeline and architecture presented will aid future scope of research in the benchmark challenges.

### Strengths
Fig. 3 is well described to give the view of the problem scope being breaked into cross view completion, relative pose estimation and visual navigation.
This is a well written paper with clear explainations and technical soundess.
The results sections and ablation studies uphold the claims.
This paper will help the ImageGoal community - hence recommended.

### Weaknesses
The last portion of supplementary video in terms of correspondence needs better representation and also that is the core focus.
The analyis of time complexity for doing correspondances in the benchmark and the distribution of work load should have helped understand the bottlenecks for a near real time system like robotic agents, even in embodied setups.
A practical deployment in robotic setup should have confirmed the real world transfer applicability.
I think Fig. 1 image you ahve search to related the chair with big picture - can any other image or better reoslution be used?
Same with panaromic and mono view - please help in making sense of the image if at all included in body. If space contsraint, appendix referral is there for later sections, but introduction setup has to be clear.
I think related work can only focus on the core related work, getting rid of object goal and general visual nav in such detail - this space can be used elsewhere in explaination later.
No limitations of the work is presented. Future gaps should be explained well.

### Questions
"we split this path into 5 parts cor" - any logic regarding the discreet steps evenly spaced?
Instead of Active Neural SLAM, anything else has been tried out in the pipeline?

### Summary
This paper is concerned with image-goal navigation and proposes a new end-to-end method for this task. The main contribution of the work is the inclusion of a pre-training stage of two auxiliary tasks that help in learning relevant visual features to be used as a state representation to a recurrent policy. The method achieves state-of-the-art performance on publicy available datasets.

### Strengths
The paper is well written and easy to follow. The authors show that they understand the underlying challenges of this problem well and clearly explain their thought process behind the proposed approach.

I agree with the authors that the bottleneck for these navigation problems is perception. I think the pretext tasks being proposed help in learning relevant representations for this task which would be otherwise very difficult to learn in typical end-to-end methods. Overall I think the paper proposes  a novel and sensible approach and moves the needle forward on this subject and improves the sample efficiency of these methods.

### Weaknesses
The title is somewhat misleading as the emergence of correspondences is really not the focus of the work, but more of an afterthought. The content of the paper might be mistaken as an investigation into this phenomenon that is carried out in this paper: 
[A] Tang et al, Emergent of Correspondences from Image Diffusion, arXiv, 2023.
In fact the emergence of correspondences from the learned representation is not really that surprising, given that the pre-training task is relative pose estimation. Even before the introduction of transformers, monocular pose estimation methods have shown that the representation learns to identify meaningful keypoints on objects. One example:
[B] Mousavian et al, 3D Bounding box estimation using deep learning and geometry, CVPR 2017

I appreciate the inclusion of the experiment where DEBiT was integrated with ANS for a direct comparison to a modular approach. However, I am surprised by the large performance gap to the proposed method. It seems unintuitive that a method that tries to map pixels directly to actions would outperform an approach that uses a map and de-couples the planning from the control. I think this should be looked more carefully to ensure fair comparison. Was the global policy of ANS finetuned with the frozen binocular encoder b and using the AdaptFormers? ANS was trained for object-goal so probably the Neural SLAM and global policy components need to be re-trained for the ImageGoal task. As it stands, the experiment is not convincing that end-to-end methods are better than modular approaches.

### Questions
Why is using panoramas treated as unrealistic with regards to robotic applications? RGB sensors (and even RGB-D) are relatively cheap and can be easily mounted on robots to cover a 360 degree field-of-view.

The authors cover some of the literature on pre-text tasks for improving sample efficienty but I think these are also worth discussing:
[C] Ye et al, Auxiliary Tasks and Exploration Enable ObjectGoal Navigation, ICCV 2021
[D] Sax et al, Mid-Level Visual Representations Improve Generalization and Sample Efficiency for Learning Visuomotor Policies, CoRL 2019
Especially regarding [D], shouldn't a representation trained on a multitude of vision tasks be more task-generalizable to just pre-training on relative pose estimation?

### Summary
This paper improves the view correspondence encoding in image-goal navigation by pre-training a large binocular ViT model (DEBiT) with cross-view completion (CroCo) and relative pose estimation and visibility prediction (RPEV) from images in photorealistic indoor scenes. Specifically, the dual encoder in DEBiT takes binocular images as input, and the encoded features are merged with a decoder to model the correspondence between the two images. DEBiT is pre-trained with CroCo, followed by RPEV to estimate the relative distance, relative rotation, and overlap between two images. When addressing downstream Instance-ImageNav and ImageNav tasks, DEBiT takes the goal image and agent's observation as inputs, its network is adapted in tuning, and the output representations will be passed to the policy network for decision-making. Results show substantial improvement compared to previous approaches.

### Strengths
- This paper studies an important problem in visual navigation: learning high-capacity perception modules for modeling and reasoning view correspondence. It proposes DEBiT, which implements a dual encoder to enable early fusion of the images. It introduces CroCo and RPEV pre-training, which are highly relevant and have shown to be effective in addressing the problem. 
- Significant improvement is achieved compared to previous approaches, boosting the ImageNav and Instance-ImageNav results to 94% SR and 59.3% SR, respectively. The methods introduced in this paper and the resulting pre-trained models are very likely to inspire/to be used by future research in relevant fields.
- The paper is technically sound; many important arguments and design choices are justified by experiments. Besides the key results, there are many highly constructive analyses/findings, such as "directly training binocular encoder from scratch", "tuning visual encoder with downstream policy network", "early fusion vs. late fusion", "attention with scale changes", etc., that are very valuable to future research.
- Overall, this paper is nicely written; it is very compact, informative, and clear. All methods (and most of the implementation), visualizations, and discussions are clearly presented.

### Weaknesses
- The proposed DEBiT model seems to be limited in addressing image-goal navigation tasks (the image-nav task itself needs more justification), and it is unclear how it might benefit other visual navigation problems.
    - However, I do believe that CroCo and RPEV can help in learning a general (and better) navigation-specific perception model (e.g., for obj-Nav, language-guided-Nav, Audio-Nav, etc.), while I am concerned that it might be much less effective compared to ImageNav which is defined to take two images as input.
    
- I am aware that ImageNav is an interesting visual navigation problem and has gained some research attention (publications), but I am still not convinced by its setting, especially how much practical value it might bring to real-world applications. [This question might be more appropriate for researchers who proposed ImageNav, but since this paper is devoted to ImageNav, I believe it must have a very strong reason and motivation behind.]
    - The two ImageNav tasks consider indoor short-range navigation for finding static objects (Instance-ImageNav has paths with an avg. geodesic length of 12.41m); from the user's perspective (e.g., a household robot), giving instruction in the form of a specific image is unnatural.
    - From the ImageNav data statistics and the visualization provided in this paper (supp. video), it seems that most of the paths have very few intersections, and the agent doesn't really need to explore the environment but keeps moving to new regions until the target is in its sight. This could be the reason why a very simple policy network, without methods like SLAM, can still lead to amazingly high performance (94% SR). I am concerned that the ImageNav task itself oversimplifies the problem, and this paper might overclaim the contribution to visual navigation research.

- Some experiments are missing to justify arguments (see Questions below).

- The limitation and future extension of this work are not discussed in this paper.

### Questions
Questions without a star (*) are not critical to my evaluation of this paper, but I still hope the authors can kindly and briefly respond to them. Please also respond to my concerns in Weaknesses.

- (*) This paper mentioned depth inputs, but I wonder why depth images are not applied in the model since it might greatly facilitate learning view correspondence and identifying space and obstacles. (I might have overlooked some details; please correct me if I did.)

- (*) How does the choice of $\tau$ influence the pre-training and the downstream results? If two images are too distant away and have little overlap, will it be too noisy to learn? Or it might help the visual encoder to learn distant image correspondence and benefit exploration in navigation? Any numerical analysis on this?

- (*) The paper claims the benefit of having visibility estimation but does not quantify its impact on downstream tasks. Any results for this?

- Just curious, can CroCo and RPEV be trained simultaneously? 

- In Table 2, from Tiny to Large, the model size increases drastically, but the difference in navigation results is quite small; what might be the reason? Does it mean that a very large perception model might not be necessary? What would be the result of DEBiT-Tiny + Adapters?

- Instance-ImageNav depicts targets viewed from a different camera; if this is the main reason why the proposed method gets much less improvement compared to ImageNav (an OOD situation as claimed), I wonder what if the images for pre-training are augmented with different camera parameters, (1) Is it still feasible to learn CroCo and RPEV? (2) Will it reduce the visual domain gap in downstream?

- Are the visual encoders in OVRLs fine-tuned with the policy networks in downstream tasks? From their papers and Table 4, it seems Yes. But in the section Related Work, "Once pre-trained, the encoder is often frozen before passing into a policy learning module."

- About comparison experiments.
    - Using adapters in the perception model largely improves the results. I wonder how much improvement it might bring to the previous approaches.
    - In Table 3, for a fair comparison (in terms of pre-training tasks and #params), I think DEBiT-Tiny and RPEV-only should be listed, which I believe is more rigorous and can prove the same argument.
    - (*) In Table 4, an important point to mention is the size of the visual encoders (#params) applied in each work. After scanning some papers in the Table, I believe there is a clear trend of larger-models-better-results. But it seems that DEBiT is relatively efficient, especially compared to OVRL-v2. I hope the authors can clarify this point, which I believe will also strengthen the argument.

Other Suggestions:
- Remove "(Instance)-" from the title.
- I found a paper, "Learning navigational visual representations with semantic map supervision (Hong et al., ICCV2023)", which also focuses on learning better navigation visual encoder with view correspondence and uses two images for pre-training. It seems relevant and could be added to the references.

### Summary
In this work, the authors introduce pretext tasks and a dual visual encoder for ImageNav and Instance-ImageNav navigation, offering rich geometric information and enabling the resolution of the challenging mono-view scenario with end-to-end trained techniques. 

The method breaks down the problem into multiple training stages, demonstrating the emergence of solutions to the correspondence problem without explicit supervision. 

Through experiments, the manuscript highlights the effectiveness of the proposed pretext tasks and a dedicated dual encoder architecture, surpassing competing methods and achieving  a novel state-of-the-art performance on both benchmarks. Additionally, the authors demonstrate seamless integration into a modular navigation pipeline of the proposed approach.

### Strengths
- In the state of the art (Section 2), a detailed review of all the literature related to the problem investigated in this work is conducted. Furthermore, the main differences of the proposed model with respect to previous works are outlined.

- The system proposed in Section 2 is novel. It describes an integration of subsystems/submodules that allows for an approximation to the problem, yielding highly promising results. Additionally, the proposed design can be considered innovative. The integration of Cross-View Completion (CroCo) into a navigation system as described has not been explored before, although it's true that this contribution is not the strongest of all. The second pretext task, relative pose estimation and visibility (RPEV) for navigation settings, is interesting and provides significant results. Overall, the originality of the work is considerable.

- The experimental evaluation provides very interesting results in which the proposed model outperforms the state of the art (see tables 4 and 5). An ablation study is provided where the real impact of each of the contributions or parts of the model can be interpreted. Finally, qualitative evidence is presented on how the proposed pre-training process results in the emergence of correspondences between images by analyzing the attention of the last layers.

### Weaknesses
The experimental evaluation included in the paper has some minor limitations that should be addressed:
- It is not clear on which databases or environments the system has been tested. For example, on what environments are the results reflected in Table 5 obtained? The interested reader has to review (Krantz et al., 2023) to know these details. Section 4, "Experimental setup" subsection needs to be improved.

- I believe one of the most interesting contributions of the proposed model is that it generates correspondences between images due to how the pre-training is designed. Figure 4 shows some results or qualitative evidence in this regard. However, the paper does not explain in detail how this image is generated or how these correspondences are analyzed. The manuscript simply mentions that they "visualize averaged attention of the last cross-attention layer of a DEBiT-L model", but more details should be provided.

### Questions
Overall, I see an strong paper here.
I would simply suggest to the authors that they provide explanations for the limitations I have described in the previous section.
