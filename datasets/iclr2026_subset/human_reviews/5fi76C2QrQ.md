### Summary
This paper addresses the limitation that standard Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks process flattened feature vectors, thereby losing spatial structure essential for image processing. The authors propose Functional Kolmogorov-Arnold Network named FunKAN, which claims to extend the classical Kolmogorov-Arnold theorem from multivariate functions on ℝⁿ to continuous functionals on Hilbert spaces Hⁿ. Each 2D feature map is treated as an element of a Hilbert space, parameterized via truncated Fourier expansion over Hermite basis functions with learned spatial grid deformation. When integrated into a U-shaped architecture as U-FunKAN, the model achieves competitive IoU scores on three medical imaging datasets: BUSI for breast ultrasound, GlaS for histology, and CVC-ClinicDB for colonoscopy, with claimed computational efficiency of 14.02 Gflops versus U-KAN's 2087 Gflops.

### Strengths
- Systematic ablation studies examining channel scaling and Hermite basis function count, demonstrating methodological rigor in experimental design.

- Competitive IoU performance on BUSI dataset showing score of 68.49±0.62 with marginal improvements over some baselines.

### Weaknesses
- Fundamental motivation-experiment mismatch: The paper frames FunKAN as a general multi-purpose backbone for medical image processing and claims the method is suitable for image processing pipelines, yet experiments are restricted exclusively to medical image segmentation. The broad theoretical motivation of extending KA theorem to functional spaces is disconnected from the narrow empirical validation on three segmentation datasets, creating an impression that universal claims are used to mask incremental contributions.


- Lack of generalization evidence: The paper makes universal claims about being suitable for image processing pipelines and serving as a multi-purpose backbone but provides zero evidence beyond medical segmentation. All three datasets are medical images with similar characteristics including binary segmentation, limited resolution, and anatomical structures. No experiments on natural images such as ImageNet or COCO, other medical tasks like classification, detection, or reconstruction, or other data modalities such as video or 3D volumes are included. This narrow scope contradicts the broad framing and raises questions about whether the method is truly general or merely overfitted to medical segmentation benchmarks. Evidence: Sec. 4 evaluates only BUSI/GlaS/CVC segmentation; no generalization experiments.

- Binary segmentation only: All experiments are confined to binary segmentation tasks including tumor versus background in BUSI, gland versus background in GlaS, and polyp versus background in CVC-ClinicDB. No multi-class or multi-organ segmentation is evaluated. This limitation restricts the demonstrated generalizability of FunKAN to single-class scenarios, despite the paper's claims of being a multi-purpose backbone. It remains unclear whether the functional space extension can handle more complex label structures or class imbalances typical in multi-class medical segmentation.

- Interpretability claims unsubstantiated: The paper emphasizes theoretically grounded and interpretable design as key advantages in the Abstract and Sec. 3, positioning FunKAN as more interpretable than standard CNNs due to its mathematical foundation in Kolmogorov-Arnold theorem and Hermite basis functions. However, the paper provides zero empirical evidence to substantiate this claim. No visualization of learned Hermite coefficients is shown, no analysis of grid deformations is provided, and no demonstration of how basis functions correspond to meaningful image features such as edges, textures, or anatomical structures is included. The interpretability advantage remains entirely conceptual rather than demonstrated, making it unclear whether the theoretical grounding translates to practical interpretability.

### Questions
- Narrow claims to match experimental scope: Either provide experiments on diverse tasks such as ImageNet classification, COCO detection, and medical image reconstruction along with multiple modalities including natural images and 3D volumes to justify multi-purpose claims, or alternatively reframe the paper as a focused study on KAN-based medical image segmentation and remove universal claims. Addresses weakness: motivation-experiment mismatch.

- Provide complete computational cost analysis: First, include grid deformation network as specified in Eq. 7-8 in Gflops calculations. Second, report actual wall-clock training and inference times on standardized hardware. Third, profile U-KAN to verify whether 2087 Gflops is implementation-specific or inherent. Fourth, discuss memory consumption during training. Addresses weakness: questionable computational efficiency claims.

- Discuss limitations section and failure analysis: Discuss when FunKAN fails, analyze the IoU-F1 trade-off, provide discretization error analysis, and acknowledge the gap between theoretical claims and experimental validation. This would demonstrate scientific rigor and honesty. Addresses weakness: missing critical discussions.

- Evaluate multi-class segmentation: Demonstrate FunKAN on multi-organ or multi-label dataset to validate beyond binary scenarios. Current experiments are all single-class including BUSI tumor versus background, GlaS gland versus background, and CVC polyp versus background. Provide evidence or discussion on how FunKAN would handle multi-class outputs, class imbalances, or overlapping structures typical in complex medical segmentation tasks. Addresses weakness: binary segmentation only.

- Substantiate interpretability claims: Provide visualizations of learned Hermite coefficients and grid deformations, show correspondence to image features such as edges, textures, and anatomical boundaries. Even simple visualizations would concretely demonstrate the claimed advantage of being theoretically grounded and interpretable. Currently, the interpretability benefit is purely conceptual without empirical evidence. Addresses weakness: interpretability claims unsubstantiated.

### Summary
This paper introduces FunKAN, a novel and interesting extension to KANs that enables the modeling of spatial 2D information. It achieves this by generalizing the Kolmogorov-Arnold theorem to functional spaces, i.e. it models the 2D feature map directly as an element in a functional Hilbert space. This eliminates the need for feature flattening, which is necessary for vanilla KANs and results in them losing spatial context. The authors propose using spectral expansion via Hermite basis functions, which enable this functional modeling. They integrate FunKAN as a spatially-aware network backbone into a U-Net architecture (U-FunKAN). In medical segmentation experiments, U-FunKAN outperforms all baselines in both accuracy and efficiency.

### Strengths
- The proposed method provides a mathematically elegant and (very) promising idea for escaping the problem of the inherent scalar modeling of Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks. 
- The proposed method works well and is able to outperform all baselines.

### Weaknesses
While the core idea is relevant and promising, I unfortunately found its presentation unsatisfactory, and I would encourage the authors to revisit the manuscript based on the presented feedback. As I greatly appreciate the idea behind this paper, I hope this feedback is relevant and helpful in its improvement. I am also happy to discuss it with the authors. 

Abstract / Introduction / Related Work: 

Since the authors propose a technical advancement tailored to KANs that may be relevant outside of the scope of segmentation within the context of KANs, similar to how U-KAN [1] is relevant to both segmentation and diffusion, I feel that the motivation of the paper should not be as heavily focused on its application to cancer segmentation. While segmentation is a highly relevant subfield of medical imaging, and the proposed FunKAN may excel at segmentation in this context, the introduction and motivation read as if they were intended for a medical application paper. For instance, I personally think that the statement of WHO statistics is outside the scope of this paper. Perhaps, to make it even clearer, I believe the proposed method was not designed to "solve" cancer segmentation; it was designed to model spatial information within the context of KANs. I.e., it may also be relevant to diffusion models and other application areas.

Thus, I see two potential directions - shift the focus from application-oriented segmentation to the mathematically motivated framework for FunKANs and choose another application, such as registration (eg alternative to VoxelMorph) or diffusion similar to the U-KAN paper [1] to highlight its versatility or benchmark the method with greater rigor (more datasets) and by ensuring the highest benchmark standards [2] possible. This starts by stating the exact settings for all baseline models, evaluating them across more datasets and with more rigor, as in [2]. For instance, I can't properly assess if the improvement stems from better hyperparameter tuning, as these details are not disclosed, and rigorous evaluation if we trust this paper [1] is not something the medical segmentation field is known for. 

Experimental Design:

- While the authors use representative segmentation architectures, it is not ultimately clear to me how (or if) the authors tuned the baseline models. There are many source code files and config files, so I may have missed this, but to me, this is also not apparent from the source code. If so, this is disappointing since this is presented as one of the author's contributions (?).
- Since the authors claim that the spatial context is of particular relevance, I feel that experiments that actually show that FunKAN leverages this would be of particular relevance.

- I would encourage the authors to compare against nnUNET and/or integrate their FunKAN formulation as a novel backbone into nnUNET to (1) benchmark against the current SOTA tool, and (2) make their implementation accessible to a wider audience of clinicians, since it seems very promising. For instance, it would have been extremely nice to benchmark this in the nnunet framework as well. 

Minor:

- I would also recommend rephrasing some sections - eg the authors state that "Our work unites theoretical function approximation
and practical medical image analysis, offering the novel state-of-the-art solution for clinical applications.". This is an incredibly big claim and such statements undermine the valid technical advancement this paper brings. I believe this is unnecessary.  

- I would not consider reproduible research a real contribution but more a backbone of science (and ICLR views it similarly) and thus would omit it from the contribution section. 

- I would not say that "cutting-edge research is 'increasingly' grounded in rigorous mathematical foundations."
Deep learning has always drawn on the mathematical frameworks proposed e.g. for SGD, and even if different, KANs are as mathematically grounded as e.g. MLPs or CNNs. All of these models have a mathematical theory, even if we don't understand how some of them may learn. 

In several areas, the authors state that KANs offer interpretability, but they refrain from showing these (relevant?) properties. If the authors cannot show how these are relevant in this application, I would drop this statement/claim.

### Conclusion:

I hope that this feedback may help to improve the manuscript. If the claims of the authors hold true (across other datasets and rigours evaluation), this paper may propose a fundamentally relevant and potentially highly impactful sota segmentation tool. For me, since the idea is relevant also outside of the context of segmentation, this would not have to be the case at all - interesting ideas can also inspire research without beating SOTA. However, in the way that the authors currently present it, this framework is sold as SOTA segmentation, and as such, it needs to be rigorously evaluated, or the storyline (and validity in other applications) must be shown. Think of it as advice that this technical idea does not get buried or labeled as another segmentation paper.

### Questions
1. How does the modeling of spatial 2D context in KANs differ from the presentation in vanilla multi-layer perceptrons? 
2. Can you comment on how KANs have been proposed as an alternative network to MLPs in the context of implicit neural representations, which model spatial context with coordinates? Is there a connection? 
3. Can this also be related to the operator learning context?
4. Since KANs should be interpretable, did the authors look into what the "spatial grid deformation module" learns? Does the KAN pick up on spatial patterns? 
5. Are the other design choices available for casting this as a Hilbert space learning problem - some of the intuitions are not easy to understand if one is not entirely familiar? Eg. are the alternatives to the spectral expanison with Hermit basis functions?

### Summary
The authors introduce the Functional Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (FunKAN), a novel deep learning architecture designed for medical image segmentation that addresses the limitations of standard Kolmogorov-Arnold networks (KANs) by generalizing the underlying theorem to functional spaces. This generalization allows FunKAN to process 2D feature maps directly, preserving the spatial structure crucial for image analysis, unlike prior KAN implementations which flatten features. The resulting architecture, U-FunKAN, integrates this new framework into a U-shaped structure, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy and superior efficiency across diverse medical imaging modalities.

### Strengths
1. Addressing KAN Limitations for Medical Images: The paper provides a rigorous mathematical basis by generalizing the Kolmogorov-Arnold theorem to functional spaces. This is a major theoretical advance that resolves the fundamental incompatibility of classic KANs with spatial data. As a result, it overcomes the key weakness of previous KAN architectures (like U-KAN) in image processing, which is the failure to preserve spatial structure by treating feature maps as unstructured coordinate collections. Remarkably, FunKAN directly processes 2D feature maps as elements of a Hilbert space.

2. Efficiency and Training Stability: The resulting U-FunKAN architecture is highly efficient, achieving state-of-the-art performance with dramatically reduced computational overhead (Gflops) compared to competitive models, including the previous KAN variants. Furthermore, the reported low variance across independent runs suggests the design (including the use of Hermite basis functions and pre-activation residual blocks) contributes to stable optimization.

3. Demonstrated Robustness across Modalities: The empirical validation is comprehensive, testing the method on three distinct medical imaging modalities (ultrasound, histology, and colonoscopy) covering various anatomical structures; and achieving state-of-the-art IoU on all three datasets suggests strong generalization capability.

4. Interpretability Potential: By grounding the model in the Kolmogorov-Arnold theorem, the architecture retains the potential for the enhanced interpretability characteristic of KANs, which is highly valued in clinical diagnosis systems.

### Weaknesses
1. Limited Exploration of Interpretability: While the paper repeatedly cites the theoretical ground and interpretability of KANs, it does not provide any specific analysis or visualization demonstrating the interpretability features of the learned FunKAN functions or how they relate to medical features (e.g., tumor margins or glandular texture). This misses an opportunity to empirically validate a core theoretical advantage.


2. Trade-off in F1-score: Although U-FunKAN achieves the highest IoU, the paper notes a minor underperformance in F1-score on the BUSI and CVC datasets compared to U-KAN and UKAGNet. The observed performance profile (high IoU, slightly lower F1) suggests the model might be overly conservative (fewer False Positives) at the expense of False Negatives. This trade-off needs deeper consideration, as minimizing false negatives (missing a tumor) is often critical in medical diagnosis. The authors do not discuss how this could affect their claim of state-of-the-art method.


3. Implicit Architecture Dependency: The introduction of learned spatial deformation via a residual block (inspired by implicit architectures), while beneficial for adaptation, adds complexity and moves the model slightly away from the pure, fixed functional representation emphasized by the Kolmogorov-Arnold theory. The interaction between spectral encoding and spatial deformation needs more dedicated analysis.

### Questions
1. Interpretability of FunKAN Layers: Since interpretability is a core motivation of KANs, can the authors provide visualizations of the learned Hermite coefficients or the resulting inner functions for a trained model? How do these functions change based on input features, and what biological or anatomical characteristics do they encode, especially compared to the fixed filters in conventional convolutional networks?

2. Necessity of Spatial Deformation: The learned spatial deformation is introduced to induce additional learnable dependency. What is the quantitative impact of this deformation module (a dedicated ablation study)? Specifically, how much accuracy gain is achieved by the learned deformation compared to simply evaluating the Hermite basis functions on the original uniform grid q?

3. Basis Function Selection Rationale: While the paper cites external work for selecting r=6 Hermite basis functions, what is the inherent advantage of Hermite functions over other orthogonal systems (like Chebyshev polynomials used in ChebyKAN) or Radial Basis Functions (used in FastKAN) when specifically handling continuous functional approximation of 2D image features?

4. Clinical Trade-off Analysis (IoU vs. F1): The observed performance profile suggests a high IoU but a slightly lower F1-score on BUSI and CVC datasets, which might be critical from a clinical perspective. Would a different loss function weighting (e.g., increasing the Dice component weight or introducing a specific sensitivity term) mitigate this trade-off?

5. Comparison to Hybrid Convolutional KANs: The paper mentions UKAGNet and MedKAN as hybrid approaches combining convolutions with KAN concepts. Since U-FunKAN also incorporates 1x1 and 3x3 convolutions in its embedding, projection, and residual blocks, a more direct analysis or ablation comparing U-FunKAN's unique functional layer against the hybrid convolutional approaches would solidify its methodological advantage. Could you elaborate on the insights on that analysis?

### Summary
The paper introduces FunKAN, a Kolmogorov-Arnold (KAN) based network for medical image segmentation. Instead of the typical KAN, which works on a 1D sequence, the authors propose to operate directly on 2D feature maps to preserve spatial structure for medical image segmentation. The UNet-style network is evaluated on diverse medical image modalities, including histopatology, ultrasound and colonoscopy.

### Strengths
- The paper is well-written and easy to follow.

- The idea of using 2D feature maps instead of flattening for KAN is interesting. 

- Experiments are performed on diverse medical imaging modalities.

### Weaknesses
- The main idea of the paper is to use KANs for interpretability in the task of medical image segmentation; however, this is just mentioned in the abstract of the paper. There is no clear motivation for why KAN is used here. If it's the interpretability, why didn't the authors include evidence on the interpretability of KANs?

- The datasets used for the experiments have small sizes less than 700 images, whereas larger datasets would better support generalisation claims.

- Experiments in tables 1/2 do not consider very recent medical image segmentation networks, especially transformer-based ones, and are very limited. Also the improvements made are marginal.
