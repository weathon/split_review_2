- Decision: Reject
- Scores: 3, 6, 3, 5

## Abstract
Simulating the behavior of nonlinear and anisotropic materials is a central problem with applications across engineering, computer graphics, robotics, and beyond. While conventional mesh-based simulations provide accurate and reliable predictions, their computational overhead typically prevents their use in interactive applications. Graph neural networks (GNN) have recently emerged as a compelling alternative to conventional simulations for time-critical applications.  However, existing GNN-based methods cannot distinguish between deformations in different directions and are thus limited to isotropic materials. To address this limitation, we propose a novel and easy-to-implement GNN architecture based on directional encodings of edge features. By preserving directional information during message passing, our method has access to the full state of deformation and can thus model anisotropic materials. We demonstrate through a set of qualitative and quantitative evaluations that our approach outperforms existing mesh-based GNN approaches for modeling anisotropic materials.

### Summary
The paper presents a novel mesh-based graph neural network architecture for learning the elastodynamics of anisotropic elastic materials. The paper proposed a novel and easy-to-implement edge feature decomposition scheme that can be able to preserve the directional information and model the material anisotropies while the previous works focus on the isotropic materials. From the submission, there are some toy examples to demonstrate the proposed method outperforms some previous work from the qualitative and quantitative view.

### Strengths
- The paper has very good organization in the section and experiment design, which makes it very easy to follow and learn its core idea.
- From a technical point of view, the novelty is relative enough for the conference. The deformation of anisotropic materials is very important for engineering design, material simulation, robotics, and so on.

### Weaknesses
- The major one is the lack of sufficient comparisons and evaluations; there is only one alternative method as the baseline to compare and demonstrate the superiority of the proposed methods. More baselines are strongly recommended, adding to the experiments and evaluations to support the proposed methods by thorough evaluations.
- For the network architecture, the message-passing operation connects the position after encoding and decoding. If we add more blocks (including message passing, edge processing, and vertex processing), what about the performance of the proposed methods?
- For the loss function, how to determine the weight for each term and the ablation study on the different weight combinations should be evaluated.
- What about the running times, such as the deformation efficiency? failure cases.
- More results on some other complex shape or material composited object are strongly recommended; the current presented results are very simple. For the proposed method, it is very interesting to see some real examples instead of synthetic ones.

Other than that, some related works should be considered as

### Questions
The strengths of the paper lie in the comprehensive information provided, the inclusion of supplementary materials, and the thorough explanations. However, the lack of novelty, limited evaluation, and other weak issues. Although the appendix serves its purpose as a resource for implementing AGILE3D, it does not significantly contribute to the field. Considering these strengths and weaknesses, I am negative about the submission currently, but I look forward to the response to the above questions.

### Summary
This paper proposes an extension to MeshGraphNets (Pfaff et al. 2021), to account for anisotropic materials.  The primary contribution is the addition of directional encodings in the message-passing GNN, such that during updates of the vertex embeddings, the corresponding incident edge features are _weighted by directional edge weights_ prior to being concatenated.  This allows the network to additionally learn anisotropic deformation.  They also devise a self-supervised loss function based on the variational formulation of the physical laws governing the simulation.  They present comparisons with MeshGraphNets, and a ground truth FEM simulator.  Their method allows the graph networks to more faithfully learn anisotropic dynamics.

### Strengths
The paper addresses a useful open question within the emerging topic of learned simulators, equipping message-passing networks with anisotropic elasticity.  The solution is simple but effective, and experimental results show a meaningful improvement over the baseline method.  Overall, the writing is clear, and experiments seem reproducible.

### Weaknesses
The technical contribution seems potentially incremental from prior work (MeshGraphNets) -- however, this is not necessarily an issue, as the experiments are well-designed, the results are solid and finding are conclusive.

I would be interested to see additional experiments, beyond the cantilever (and cantilever-like) setup, such as simulation with collision/contact.  This is not a requirement though, as the existing experiments are quite informative.

### Questions
- I am curious about the "material space bases" mentioned on page 4.  Could you elaborate on how the "material space bases" are defined exactly?  How are these defined relative to global coordinates, and are they defined in a canonical way?

- Would defining the local bases in a different way change the three axis-aligned weights/coefficients that are computed during preprocessing?  In turn, would this make it difficult to learn?  (Presumably the x-axis is aligned with the edge, what about the others.). Thanks, look forward to your reply.

### Summary
This paper proposes a graph network for simulating deformable solids with anisotropic hyperelastic materials. The key contribution lies in its treatment of material anisotropicity in the network module. The paper compares its results with MeshGraphNet, a standard GNN baseline for deformable solid simulation.

### Strengths
At a very high level, the core idea in the paper is easy to follow for people familiar with GNNs and deformable solid simulation. Modeling anisotropic materials with neural networks is also an interesting problem with many potential applications.

### Weaknesses
Most of my concerns are reflected in the questions section below.

**Novelty and contributions**
The scope of the problem setup is narrow (anisotropic hyperelastic material without considering plasticity, contact, or collision). Therefore, I expect an in-depth study of this problem to justify its publication. This can include deep insight into anisotropic materials, comparisons with strong and fine-tuned baselines, comprehensive analysis of its generalizability, or demonstrating its exciting downstream applications with anisotropic materials.

**Methods**
The notations in the technical methods are confusing, and I feel it would be challenging for people lacking deformable solid simulation background to understand and reproduce this paper. I left a number of specific questions in the “Questions” section below.

**Experiments**
- I feel the problem size is too small to conduct meaningful analysis on GNNs. 60-120 elements (the training problem size) are considered very few for deformable solid simulation and can be solved quickly and accurately with numerical methods. The “DeformablePlate” in MeshGraphNet contains ~1200 nodes (so >= 300 tetrahedrons, with contact/collision handling). A modern, GPU-based numerical simulator can probably scale this up even more without losing speed or accuracy if no contact/collision needs to be solved, which seems to be the setup of this paper. I do agree with the intro that learning-based approaches can “strike a balance between accuracy and efficiency,” but such a tradeoff doesn’t need to exist for very small problems.

- Baselines: The performance of the baseline seems much worse than what the original MeshGraphNet paper reported. A concrete example is Fig. 6: if MeshGraphNet caused 60% volume change, their “DeformablePlate” example would have exhibited very obvious artifacts. I wonder whether the variational loss + MeshGraphNet combination negatively influenced its performance, but I am not sure. Also, following my first point, I feel the paper lacks a crucial comparison to the reference simulator in terms of speed and accuracy.

- I also feel the study on the method’s generalizability is limited. Having more diverse, spatially varying fiber orientations other than horizontal and vertical ones would be more convincing. Testing it on more realistic hyperelastic materials (e.g., Neohookean or corotated) would be useful as well.

### Questions
**Technical questions about the network design**
- I suspect “f^{v->e}” in “vertex processing” of Figure 2 should be replaced with “f^{e->v}”.
- I don’t quite follow why fiber orientation is an edge feature. It seems more reasonable to consider fiber orientation as a (finite) element feature if there is such a thing in the network module. The reason why I have this feeling is that F, the deformation gradient, is typically an element quantity in linear tetrahedron finite elements, and Eqn. (6) indicates that it’s convenient to consider d as an element quantity as well.
- Could you clarify the notation “E_j” in Eqn. (4)?
- How are E_x, E_y, E_z in Eqn. (4) defined? I am guessing that one of them is d and the other two are orthogonal to d, but I am not quite sure.
- I am not sure I get the intuition behind explicitly formulating three weighted sums of e_j in  Eqn. (3). Part of me wonders whether it is truly necessary, as the directional information d is already provided in the edge feature. I can accept that doing so does not hurt, but it would be nice if the authors could provide more insights into this design decision. This seems crucial for the paper’s technical contribution, so I want to make sure I fully understand it.

**About the loss function**
- Eqn. (5): Is x^{t+1} computed from a^{t+1} or is it an independent variable? I am guessing that the network produces a^{t+1}, which is then used to compute x^{t+1}, and both a^{t+1} and x^{t+1} are fed into this loss function.
- Eqn. (6): I understand that the text already mentioned that the loss function sums up per-element potentials, but I’d still appreciate a more rigorous writing of the strain energy, i.e., adding a proper sum over all finite elements and defining how F is computed from x^{t+1} (e.g., by citing 16 or similar literature). Echoing my question above, I’d also like to understand how dFFd is computed in a single element.
- While I appreciate the choice of using the incremental potential as the loss function L, I feel there are some subtleties after incorporating the network. Let x be the new position and theta be the network parameters. A stationary point of min_x L(x) nicely solves implicit Euler integration because L is its variational form, but a stationary point of min_theta L(x(theta)) only satisfies dL/dtheta = dL/dx * dx/dtheta = 0. From a theoretical perspective, whether this guarantees dL/dx = 0 (the true solution to the implicit Euler integration) is not obvious to me.

**About network training**
- Could you elaborate on how the fiber orientations are uniformly sampled in each element? Also, is each element assigned an independently sampled direction? The results seem to contain only horizontal and vertical directions shared by all anisotropic elements.

**About the “Convergence” experiment**
- Is Fig. 3 displaying the training loss or its difference from the ground truth incremental potential solved by the reference simulation?
- I suggest adding another figure that directly visualizes the difference between the network-predicted x^{t+1} and the reference x^{t+1} from the numerical simulator.
- Fig. 4: Why is the “total” energy difference lower than the “fiber” term difference?
- For both Figs. 3 and 4, I am not sure whether the worse performance of MeshGraphNet should be attributed to the network lacking the direction-aware message-passing mechanism or the decision to use the new loss function in MeshGraphNet.

**About the “Volume Preservation” experiment**
- A minor comment is that Poisson’s ratio = 0.48 does not mean zero volume change. It would be informative to add a third curve in Fig. 6 showing the volume change from the reference simulator.

**About the “Tip Displacement” experiment**
- I am trying to understand the significance of the “Tip Displacement Error.” What is the average size of the finite elements in these scenes?
- Also, how many elements does a test scene typically have?

**About the “Imbalanced Forces” experiment**
- I like this experiment more than the others, but again, what is the size of the finite elements? Without knowing it, I was having a difficult time calibrating the “Force Density” column and the “Imbalanced Force” column in Table 2.

**About the “Generalization” experiment**
- I didn’t find quantitative data about this experiment. In particular, how different is it from the deformed shape computed from the reference simulator?
- I am curious to see the generalization to more diverse, spatially varying fiber orientations.

### Summary
This paper proposes directional encodings for edge features in GNN to help extracting the directional information during message passing. The proposed method outperforms the MeshGraphNet as shown in the experiments.

### Strengths
* The proposed directional encodings are easy to integrate with GNNs.
* The proposed method obtain superior performance over MeshGraphNet.

### Weaknesses
This paper seems technically limted and compared with only one basic GNN. Some weaknesses are as follows:
1. Only the basic MeshGraphNet is compared. For example, Is HOOD (CVPR'23) able to achieve better performance?
2. The equation 3 has a similar format of attention with 3 heads. What's the performance of Graph Attention Network (GAT)? Will attention scores be able to replace the weights and become a more general format of equation 3? 
3. The simulated objects in datasets seem only consist of limited number of elements (60-120). Note that MeshGraphNet is able to deal with thousands of particles.  Is this method able to handle cases with more elements?

### Questions
1. Does the "5 rollouts" in Fig.3 mean the model autoregressively predicts 5 steps?
2. Is there any video result of the process of the deformations?
