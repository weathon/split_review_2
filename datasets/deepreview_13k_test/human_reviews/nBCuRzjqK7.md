- Decision: Accept
- Scores: 8, 6, 5, 6

## Abstract
Long-term forecasting presents unique challenges due to the time and memory complexity of handling long sequences. Existing methods, which rely on sliding windows to process long sequences, struggle to effectively capture long-term variations that are partially caught within the short window (\textit{i.e.,} outer-window variations). In this paper, we introduce a novel approach that overcomes this limitation by employing contrastive learning and enhanced decomposition architecture, specifically designed to focus on long-term variations. To this end, our contrastive loss incorporates global autocorrelation held in the whole time series, which facilitates the construction of positive and negative pairs in a self-supervised manner. When combined with our decomposition networks, our contrastive learning significantly improves long-term forecasting performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach outperforms 14 baseline models in multiple experiments over nine long-term benchmarks, especially in challenging scenarios that require a significantly long output for forecasting.

### Confidence
4: You are confident in your assessment, but not absolutely certain. It is unlikely, but not impossible, that you did not understand some parts of the submission or that you are unfamiliar with some pieces of related work.

### Summary
The paper is about self-supervised contrastive forecasting in long sequences. Existing methods perform poorly on capturing long-term variations beyond the window (outer-window variations). The proposed method, AutoCon, learns a long-term representation by constructing positive and negative pairs accross distant windows in a self-supervised manner. The authors have perform extensive experiments on 9 datasets, using 14 state of the art models, and MSE and MAE evaluation metrics to show that the models with AutoCon loss outperform the rest in most cases, achieving performance improvements of up to 34%.

### Strengths
- The paper is well-written and well-structured. The authors have done a great job with providing the related work and the limitations, giving the details to the proposed methodology and an extensive experimental evaluation. The images and tables are well-designed and show attention to detail.
- The paper is about an interesting problem, long-term time-series forecasting via contrastive learning. This is topic that has gained a lot of attention recently.
- The methodology is described with enough details.
- The extensive experiments, not only capture different cases in a various datasets and with various state of the art comparison methods, but they also show that the proposed methodology outperforms in most cases the other models.

### Weaknesses
- The novelty of the work is incemental. While the authors focus on an interesting problem, the proposed methodology is combination of existing components.
- It would be useful to add a table with the dataset statistics summarized (in Appendix if it does not fit in the main paper). How does the proposed methodology performs in imbalanced data?
- It would be interesting and more convincing on the performance if the authors would add results on more evaluation metrics, e.g., Accuracy, AUROC, AUPRC, etc.
- It would be interesting to show what is the runtime for each method/dataset and time complexities.

### Questions
- There is no discussion about making the code available publicly.
- The authors can respond on my comments 2-4 in the weaknesses section above.

### Summary
This paper mainly presents a new contrastive objective in self-supervised representation learning in time series forecasting. Specifically, the paper argues that the trends extracted from a moving window are often long-term seasonal variations that cannot be captured by the window of smaller size. Therefore, the representations of windows within a mini-batch that are more similar are explicitly induced to get closer compared to other samples with lower correlations. The proposed contrastive loss is then added to a decomposition-based forecasting model as a regularization term. Experiments show impressive performance improvements over existing SOTA models.

### Strengths
1. Overall the paper is well-written and easy to follow. The idea of global autocorrelation and decomposition is well-motivated and sufficiently grounded, and the argument that short-term trends are long-term variations is quite convincing.
2. The empirical results on univariate long-term forecasting is very impressive.
3. Extensive analysis support the effectiveness of the proposed method with abundant evidences

### Weaknesses
1. Most of the ambiguity comes from the global information in the proposed representation. The authors should elaborate on the details of the encoder to highlight how the similarity of representations $v_i, v_j$ differ from the linear autocorrelation $r(i, j)$ in order to justify the contrastive objective (3). See question (1). 
2. The plots of baseline models in figure 2 are not quite convincing. While the baseline models do not consider long-term correlations, it's counter-intuitive that the similarity of moving windows with various patterns stays almost constant as shown in the chart.

### Questions
1. How is the timestamp-based features derived and incorporated into the encoder?
2. Which dataset is used in Figure 6? Do you observe the same result on other datasets?

### Confidence
5: You are absolutely certain about your assessment. You are very familiar with the related work and checked the math/other details carefully.

### Summary
This paper points out existing approaches fail to capture the long-term variations that are partially caught within the short window. Based on the finding, this paper presents a novel approach for long-term time series forecasting by employing contrastive learning and an enhanced decomposition architecture. The contrastive loss incorporates global autocorrelation held in the whole time series, which facilitates the construction of positive and negative pairs in a self-supervised manner. The authors conducted extensive experiments on nine benchmarks and achieved superior performance compared to baseline models.

### Strengths
* It is a good observation that long-term forecasting data exists long-term autocorrelations and existing methods fail to take into account.

* By adding autocorrelation constrained contrastive loss, it reaches long-term variation consistency between windows, making it more explainable.

* Extensive experiment results and ablation studies show the effectiveness of the method.

### Weaknesses
* Capturing long-term variation via the contrastive loss part is separated from the forecasting mechanism. Good finding but have no further design for architectures based on this finding. The forecasting module is a simple dual-head forecaster and already achieves good performance. 

* Lack of performance comparisons of different self-supervised objectives. 

* 14 baselines comparison is claimed in the abstract, only 7 are found.The performance improvement seems marginal. Extending the forecasting window too much has little practical meaning.

### Questions
Could you provide training protocols and the default value of the contrastive loss weight hyperparameter?

### Summary
This paper addresses challenges of long-term forecasting by utilizes contrastive learning and an enhanced decomposition architecture specifically designed to address long-term variations. The key idea considers the global autocorrelation within the entire time series, enabling the creation of positive and negative pairs in a self-supervised manner. Experiments demonstrate that this approach outperforms baseline models on nine established long-term forecasting benchmarks.

### Strengths
Contribution:

- The authors deliver an intuitive and easy to implement technique based on newly defined ‘global autocorrelation’. A plus point for this technique also relates to its fast computing time and no extensive memory requirement.
- The method is extensible and applicable to both uni and multi-variate datasets.
- Well-rounded experiments are conducted with multiple datasets of different patterns (different autocorrelation patterns - Fig. 5).
- The authors are well aware with the weakness of autocorrelation technique - which capture only linear variations.

Presentation:

- Nice visual explainations (e.g. Fig.1, 3).

### Weaknesses
- For circumstance of nearly stationary input sequence, the autocorrelation will produce stationary result and cause the collapse of Constrastive Learning framework.
- The increasing complexity for long-term branch of decomposition framework might contribute to the better result of the whole proposed pipeline. A potential verification could be an additional ablation case of that architecture with a linear layer like the work of Zeng (2023).
- While the authors are aware of the linear assumption of autocorrelation and suggest the potential use of different techniques for high-order one, this suggestions might be inapplicable for the lengthy global input sequences with densely use frequency. Any approaches investigating these non-linear correlation can consume much more resources compare to the current autocorrelation.
- Some grammar and typos (e.g. TiemsNet - page 2)
