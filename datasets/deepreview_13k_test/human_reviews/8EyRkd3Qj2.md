# CLAP: Collaborative Adaptation for Patchwork Learning

- Decision: Accept
- Scores: 8, 8, 8, 6

## Abstract
In this paper, we investigate a new practical learning scenario, where the data distributed in different sources/clients are typically generated with various modalities. Existing research on learning from multi-source data mostly assume that each client owns the data of all modalities, which may largely limit its practicability. In light of the expensiveness and sparsity of multimodal data, we propose patchwork learning to jointly learn from fragmented multimodal data in distributed clients. Considering the concerns on data privacy, patchwork learning aims to impute incomplete multimodal data for diverse downstream tasks without accessing the raw data directly. Local clients could miss different modality combinations. Due to the statistical heterogeneity induced by non-i.i.d. data, the imputation is more challenging since the learned dependencies fail to adapt to the imputation of other clients. In this paper, we provide a novel imputation framework to tackle modality combination heterogeneity and statistical heterogeneity simultaneously, called ``collaborative adaptation''. In particular, for two observed modality combinations from two clients, we learn the transformations between their maximal intersection and other modalities by proposing a novel ELBO. We improve the worst-performing required transformations through a Pareto min-max optimization framework. In extensive experiments, we demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method compared to existing related methods on benchmark data sets and a real-world clinical data set.

### Summary
This paper primarily addresses the task of processing multimodal data in a multi-client context, proposing the CLAP framework. The framework consists of a modality VAE and a client-adaptation VAE. The modality VAE learns a representation for each modality, while the client-adaptation VAE handles dependencies between modalities. Given that data are from multiple clients and not independently and identically distributed, to alleviate the statistical heterogeneity of the learned representations, an encoder is shared and the KL divergence of the representations is balanced by maximizing the maximum KL divergence. The authors demonstrate through experiments that the CLAP framework effectively processes heterogeneous data while protecting user privacy.

### Strengths
1. The CLAP framework proposed in this article achieves the imputation of multimodal data when dealing with non-independent and identically distributed data.
2. By employing a vertical Pareto min-max optimization strategy to balance the KL divergence, CLAP addresses the issue of statistical heterogeneity in client data distributions.
3. The training of CLAP adheres to the federated learning framework, effectively protecting the privacy of users across multiple clients.

### Weaknesses
1. The framework presented in this paper is complex; is it suitable for practical deployment?
2. The experimental section includes a limited number of medical datasets, which constrains the assessment of the model.

### Questions
1. Why is client data non-independent and identically distributed? How is the feature distribution of the same modality dataset across different clients demonstrated?
2. The author presents a heterogeneous data exchange among multiple medical institutions, but I am not quite clear whether the complexity of the current research algorithm is already suited to the needs of the current research context.

### Summary
The authors introduce a novel problem in machine learning referred to as the "Checkerboard Learning" This problem focuses on the issue of missing modalities within local client datasets by employing multimodal learning imputation techniques. To tackle this problem, the authors present a comprehensive framework called "Collaborative Adaptation" or CLAP. In essence, CLAP aims to bridge the gap between differing data distributions and unearth interdependencies between local clients through the utilization of two VAEs. A pivotal component of CLAP is the Modality VAE, designed to enhance the consistency of data representation by implementing a shared Modality Encoder across all clients. The Client-Adaptation VAE (CA-VAE) builds upon the Modality VAE by introducing a new decoder to learn the dependencies among different modalities. Empirical experiments demonstrate that CLAP exhibits strong performance across both benchmark and real-world datasets, validating its effectiveness in addressing the checkerboard learning challenge.

### Strengths
1. The proposed method is very practical. In real-world, there are many local clients with multi-modal data. However, the modality types are largely inconsistent, makes it difficult to learn models directly. This paper proposes “checkerboard learning”, which formulates this problem precisely.

2. The analysis of the problem is important, and the proposed method is convincing. This paper analyzes the checkerboard learning deeply and summarizes three challenges of checkerboard learning, e.g., heterogeneity, different modality combinations. To complete the checkerboard, this paper proposes two basic assumptions, which makes it possible to impute the missing modalities by learning from other clients.

3. This paper provides experimental verification of the proposed method. It conducts experiments on MNIST-typed datasets, CelebA CUB and a real-world datasets eICU. The experiments show the superiority of the proposed methods compared with existing methods.

4. In the Appendix, the authors did sufficient ablation studies for the proposed methods, including more clients and the number of missing modalities. It is very helpful to evaluate the proposed method.

### Weaknesses
1.In related work, most of the papers are published before 2022. Are there more recent related works which study the similar learning scenarios?

2.This paper experimentally verifies the effectiveness of the proposed Pareto min-max optimization. Could the authors give more explanation of it? Why the Pareto min-max optimization is helpful for the imputation of the checkerboard?

3.For the real-world application, the implementation is very important. From the C.3 in Appendix, the author discusses the limitations. How to address the privacy issue when in real-world applications?

### Summary
The authors explore a novel federated multi-modal learning scenario “checkerboard learning”. Different from existing research which mostly assume the presence of complete modalities, the proposed task considers a practical problem where different clients possess various data modalities. The federated clients aim to impute the missing modalities by collaborating with other clients. A client could impute the missing modalities relying on the dependency learned in other clients which contain the aiming modalities. The proposed framework CLAP to tackle this problem consists of modality VAEs and client-adaptation VAEs. The modality VAEs strive to address the statistical heterogeneity problem by balancing the distribution distance among clients. And the client-adaptation VAEs are the additional decoders used for balancing the modality heterogeneity among clients. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of CLAP.

### Strengths
1. The authors propose a very novel task. Existing federated multi-modal learning research mostly assume the same modality combination in all clients. The scenario of different modalities among clients is under-explored. Besides, the proposed task is substantially practical, as collaborative scenarios involving multiple clients with diverse modality combinations are frequently encountered in real-world applications.
2. In the proposed new task, the missing modalities are not only invisible during testing, but also unavailable during training, making the checkerboard learning a much more challenging and practical problem.
3. The proposed method is concise and effective. The method is developed based on a comprehensive study of the checkerboard learning problem, wherein the challenges can be concluded into two aspects: statistical heterogeneity and modality combination heterogeneity among clients. The authors employ the Pareto min-max framework to address the aforementioned heterogeneity, which proves to be fundamentally valid.
4. They conduct extensive experiments with sufficient datasets and compare with various baselines. They also perform experiments on a real-world clinical dataset, which demonstrates the effectiveness of the method in practice.

### Weaknesses
1. This paper studies a useful and significant learning task. From my knowledge, it is the first to investigate checkerboard learning. I want to know whether there is previous related research.
2. There are modality VAEs and client-adaptation VAEs in the proposed framework. These VAEs are specifically designed to tackle two different challenges: statistical heterogeneity and modality heterogeneity, respectively. One important question is whether they share the same encoders. If they do, it is crucial to understand how they interact and influence each other.
3. The details behind certain aspects of the proposed method needs more explanation. More clarification is needed regarding why the employment of the Pareto min-max framework is advantageous for addressing heterogeneity, as well as the detailed implementation of this framework.
4. During the application, the proposed method incorporates an additional set of decoders. Does it entail a significant increase in computational overhead?

### Summary
This paper learns the domain of multimodal learning, with a specific focus on the challenge known as "checkerboard learning." In contrast to conventional federated multimodal learning, where all clients typically share the same modalities, checkerboard learning presents a scenario where different clients may possess different modality combinations. The primary objective of this task is to reconstruct or impute the missing modalities for each client without access to the raw data. To address this problem, the authors propose a method named "Collaborative Adaptation" (CLAP), which encompasses two distinct training stages within each client: Modality Variational Autoencoder (MVAE) and Client-Adaptation Variational Autoencoder (CA-VAE). The authors provide empirical evidence showcasing the efficacy of their proposed approach on various datasets, underscoring its ability to effectively address the challenges posed by checkerboard learning.

### Strengths
1. Exploring modality differences has great practical significance in real-world applications. In practice, numerous local clients deal with multi-modal data. Yet, the challenge lies in the substantial inconsistency in the types of modalities. This paper considers a practical and challenging problem.
2. The proposed method is novel and valid for addressing this problem. To impute the incomplete checkerboard, this paper proposes CA-VAE to model the relationships between modalities based on the the assumption that not all modalities are isolated modalities. For the statistical heterogeneity, this paper proposes Pareto Min-Max optimization to balance the performance of all combinations.
3. This paper offers empirical validation of the proposed methodology through a series of experiments. These experiments encompass MNIST datasets, other benckmark datasets and eICU. The results of these experiments underscore the superior performance of the proposed methods when compared to existing approaches.
4. This paper is well-written. The figures is very helpful to understand the motivation of the proposed method.

### Weaknesses
1. The proposed method is based on the two assumptions. It seems that these two assumptions are not so strict. Is the effectiveness of the proposed method will be affected by the Assumption 2 (e.g., when there are many missing modalities)?
2. For the challenge of statistical heterogeneity, the author proposes vertical Pareo min-max optimization to address it. Please explain it why the vertical Pareto min-max optimization could mitigate the statistical heterogeneity.
3. In this paper, the author did experiments on some datasets. When the data is more completed, is it still useful to complete the missing modalities?
4. For the statistical heterogeneity, in real-world applications, there are many different types of heterogeneity, how the heterogeneity affects the effectiveness of the proposed method?
5. For the proposed CA-VAE in section 4.4, it seems sound. However, is there direct experimental verification of the effectiveness of CA-VAE?

### Questions
Please see the weaknesses above. Besides, I have the following minor problems.

1. In section 4, the author demonstrates the proposed method. However, an algorithm would be more helpful for other to follow this research.
2. For the assumptions in section 3, it is better to give a justification for its practicality.
3. In the conclusion, this paper says that it opens a direction for the future research. Could the author discuss more details about it?
