- Decision: Accept
- Scores: 6, 3, 5, 6

## Abstract
Crystal structures are characterized by atomic bases within a primitive unit cell that repeats along a regular lattice throughout 3D space. The periodic and infinite nature of crystals poses unique challenges for geometric graph representation learning. Specifically, constructing graphs that effectively capture 
the complete 
geometric information of crystals and handle chiral crystals remains an unsolved and challenging problem. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach that utilizes the periodic patterns of unit cells to establish the lattice-based representation for each atom, enabling efficient and 
expressive graph representations of crystals. Furthermore, we propose ComFormer, a SE(3) transformer designed specifically for crystalline materials. ComFormer includes two variants; namely, iComFormer that employs invariant geometric descriptors of Euclidean distances and angles, and eComFormer that utilizes equivariant vector representations.  
Experimental results demonstrate the state-of-the-art predictive accuracy of ComFormer variants on various tasks across three widely-used crystal benchmarks.

### Summary
This paper proposes a graph transformer network with rotation, translation, and periodic equivariance/invariance for learning on crystal graphs. It introduces a crystal graph representation with geometric completeness and equivariance. On top of it, the paper also proposes a transformer architecture with efficiency and expressivity. Experiments on three different benchmarks show the superiority of the proposed network.

### Strengths
- The paper introduces a crystal graph representation with equivariance and geometric completeness together with an equivariant transformer architecture, which tackles a practical problem in material analysis.
- The authors have provided adequate theoretical proof.
- The authors have presented extensive experiments on different benchmarks, efficiency analysis, and ablation studies, showing the effectiveness of the proposed network with superiority over prior works.
- The illustrations and explanations in the paper are clear and intuitive. I don't have any background in material science, but the problem statement in the paper sounds reasonable to me.

### Weaknesses
- I have limited knowledge about crystal graph learning, but the arguments in the paper look convincing to me. The authors mentioned learning higher-order properties in their own discussion of limitations. This could possibly be solved by the SO(3)-representation with sperical harmonic basis [1, 2].

### Summary
The paper described an experimental approach to material property prediction by using graphs built on periodic crystal structures.

### Strengths
The authors should be highly praised for studying important real objects such as solid crystalline materials and for attempting to give formal Definitions 1-4. The paper is generally well-written and contains enough details that helped to understand the difficulties.

### Weaknesses
The word "problem" appears only once (in the abstract), though a rigorous and explicit problem statement might have helped to understand the unresolved challenges. 

If we need a complete and invariant description of a periodic crystal, crystallographers solved this problem nearly 100 years ago by using Niggli's reduced cell of a lattice and then recording all atoms in so-called standard settings, see the book "TYPIX standardized data and crystal chemical characterization of inorganic structure types" by Parthé et al, which actually applies to all periodic crystals, not only inorganic. 

However, all these standardizations have become obsolete in the new world of big and noisy data because the underlying lattice (not even a unit cell) of any periodic crystal is discontinuous under almost any perturbation, which is obvious already in dimension 1.

For example, the set Z of all integers is nearly identical to a periodic sequence with points 0, 1+ep_1, ..., m+ep_m in the unit cell [0,m+1] for any sma;; ep_1,...,ep_m close to 0, though their minimal periods (or unit cells) 1 and m+1 are arbitrarily different. 

This discontinuity was reported for experimental crystals already in 1965, see Lawton SL, Jacobson RA. The reduced cell and its crystallographic applications. Ames Lab., Iowa State Univ. of Science and Tech.

A more recent example from Materials Project shows two nearly identical crystals whose unit cells differ by a factor of (approximately) 2

Moreover, atoms in any material always vibrate above absolute zero temperature, so their positions continuously change. As a result, any crystal structure with fixed atomic coordinates in a database is only a single snapshot of a potentially dynamic object, especially for proteins whose structures are also determined often by crystallization. 

Hence the new essential requirement for any (better than the past) representations of crystals is a proved continuity under perturbations of atoms. This problem has been solved by Widdowson et al (NeurIPS 2022) with theoretical guarantees and practical demonstrations on the world's largest collection of materials: the Cambridge Structural Database. The underlying invariants have a near-linear time in the motif size and were used for property predictions by Ropers et all (DAMDID 2022) and by Balasingham et al (arxiv:2212.11246). 

Despite the authors citing one of the papers above, Definition 1 didn't follow the definitions from the past that modeled a crystal as a periodic point set not as a graph. 

Any graph representation of a crystal or a molecule is discontinuous because all chemical bonds are only abstract representations of inter-atomic interactions and depend on numerous thresholds on distances and angles, while atomic nuclei are real physical objects.

The traditional representation in (1) and Definition 5 (appendix A.3) of an isometry order atoms in a unit cell. While many crystals contain identical atoms, the invariance under permutations of atoms is missed because the paper has no words "permute" or "permutation".

The permutation invariance seems lost when using angles, which depend on point ordering. 

The property prediction makes sense only for really validated data, not for random values, because neural networks with millions of parameters can predict (overfit) any data.

### Questions
The words "crystal graph" appear a few times before section 2.2 with references but without details. In Definition 1, could the authors please explain the meaning of "a crystal graph" and the symbols "=" and "->"? 

Did the paper consider the invariance of crystal descriptors under permutations of atoms?  

Does a manually chosen cutoff radius (line 3 from the bottom of page 4) make any invariant incomplete because perturbing atoms can scale a unit cell larger than any fixed radius?

Since the paper title promised complete transformers, have the authors found any geometric duplicates in the used datasets? Some duplicates were reported by Widdowson et al (MATCH 2022) as being investigated by several journals for data integrity. 

The dataset details in section A.5 could include the most important information: whether crystals are simulated or experimental, and if the "ground-truth" properties are obtained from computer modeling or physical experiments. 

It seems that all used crystals are hypothetical with simulated properties. Is the main contribution a computer program that predicts the outputs of other computer programs? 

If initial property computations were too slow and most likely iterative, why not to stop their computations earlier instead of writing another program simulating the simulations?

How many hidden parameters and CPU hours were used for producing the experimental results?

What results in the paper are stronger than the past work below?

(1) continuity under perturbations in Theorem 4.2 and generic completeness of the density fingerprint in Theorem 5.1 from Edelsbrunner et al (SoCG 2021),  
(2) continuity under perturbations in Theorem 4.3 and generic completeness with an explcit reconstruction in Theorem 4.4 from Widdowson et al (NeurIPS 2022),
(3) full completeness in Theorem 10 from Anosova et al (DGMM 2021), extended in arxiv:2205.15298,  
(4) 200+ billion pairwise comparisons of all periodic crystals in the Cambridge Structural Database completed within two days on a desktop, see the conclusions in Widdowson et al. 

Did the authors know about the classical results in crystallography cited above, starting from Niggli (1927), Lawton (1965), and Parthe (1987)?

### Summary
Geometric graph representation learning for crystal material property prediction is challenging due to the periodic and infinite nature of crystals. This paper proposed SE(3) invariant and SO(3) equivariant crystal graph representations for geometric completeness of crystalline materials. Furthermore, two variants of a SE(3) transformer is proposed for crystalline material property prediction, i.e., iComFormer that uses invariant geometric descriptors of Euclidean distances and angles, and eComFormer that uses equivariant vector representations.

Experiments are conducted on three widely-used crystal benchmarks: JARVIS, the Materials Project, and MatBench. Experimental results showed that ComFormer achieves the best prediction accuracy across a range of crystal properties in most cases. The ablation study verifies the importance of geometric completeness of crystal graphs and higher rotation order features.

### Strengths
1. $\textbf{Problem Formulation}$: This paper identified an existing issue in previous related works, i.e., they map different crystal structures with different properties to the same graph representation and thus produce wrong property predictions. This is a good motivation. Based on this motivation, this paper aims to resolve this issue by proposing a new graph representation for crystalline materials to distinguish different crystals and remain the same under crystal passive symmetries.

2. $\textbf{Method}$: The proposed SE(3) invariant graph construction is sound and the subsequent crystal transformer networks are effective in crystal property prediction.

3. $\textbf{Experimental Results}$: The performance is superior than or comparable to the compared approaches across all three datasets in most cases.

### Weaknesses
1. $\textbf{Method}$

1.1 Is it just the way of lattice representation construction (Section 3.2 and Section 3.3) that introduces SE(3) invariant and SO(3) equivariant properties, or the proposed Transformer network (Section 4) has such properties? In other words, if the proposed Transformer network is applied to an ordinary graph (say a k-NN graph), does the SE(3) invariant and SO(3) equivariant properties still hold?

1.2 It seems that the node-wise transformer layer in SE(3) invariant message passing (Section 4.1) has no significant difference from the conventional graph Transformer (or graph attention network) [1]. Though detailed design may be different, but the general structure/scheme are similar. Correct me if I'm wrong.

1.3 It is unclear why edge feature $\textbf{e}_{ji}$ needs to be embedded using spherical harmonics, in second paragraph of Section 4.2. A justification is needed.

1.4 "$\textbf{TP}_0,\textbf{TP}_1,\textbf{TP}_2$ are tensor product layers" in the fourth paragraph of Section 4.2, What is tensor product layer and why need it here? Could you provide a concise and intuitive explanation?

2. $\textbf{Experiments}$

2.1 Is it possible to provide some qualitative experimental results (visualization) of SE(3) invariant property and/or SO(3) equivariant property, to prove the graph representation and the proposed Transformer network indeed learns such properties? It is not mandatory, but just out of curiosity.

2.2 In Table 5, the size of eComFormer is larger than iComFormer by two to three times. Any explanation or reason for this model size?

3. $\textbf{Writting}$

3.1 The paper spends a lot of space for background introduction and graph representation description, leading to just 1.5 pages for Transformer network design. It lacks the description of the rationale behind the network design, especially for SO(3) message passing, which causes a bit confusion in finding enough novelty of the proposed network.

### Summary
Constructing graphs that effectively capture the complete geometric information of crystals remains an unsolved and challenging problem. In order to address it, this paper introduced a novel approach that utilizes the periodic patterns of unit cells to establish the lattice-based representation for each atom, enabling efficient and expressive graph representations of crystals.

### Strengths
1) The presentation of this paper is good. The author's statement is logical, and the vocabulary used is relatively easy to understand.

2) This paper proposes an interesting problem. A complete crystal representation is important for downstream tasks.

### Weaknesses
1) This method is not universal as it cannot handle crystals with lattice containing (0,0,0). The paper mentions that “Third, we select the duplicate with the next smallest distance ||e_ii3||_2, and verify that eii3, eii1 and eii2 are not in the same plane in 3D space, and repeat until eii3 is found”, but if lattice containing (0,0,0), then eii3 cannot be found.

2) The experiment is not comprehensive enough. The most significant contribution of this paper is that it proposes a complete representation, but the final experiment only verifies that it can better predict without verifying the completeness of the representation.

### Questions
1) How to deal with the crystal whose lattice contains (0,0,0)? Do the datasets in experiments contain this type of data? In theory, the method proposed by the author cannot handle this situation. Why was it not explained in experiments?

2) What is the role of SE(3) invariant and SO(3) equivariant? In what scenarios should eComFormer be used, and in what scenarios should iComFormer be used?  What are the reasons for iComFormer outperforming eComFormer in most cases?

Suggestions:
If possible, it is recommended that the author add some experiments that demonstrate the completeness of the representation.
