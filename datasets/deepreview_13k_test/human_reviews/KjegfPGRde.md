# DePT: Decomposed Prompt Tuning for Parameter-Efficient Fine-tuning

- Decision: Accept
- Scores: 6, 6, 6, 6

## Abstract
Prompt tuning (\pt), where a small amount of trainable soft (continuous) prompt vectors is affixed to the model input, has shown promising results across various tasks and model architecture for parameter-efficient fine-tuning (\peft).
\pt stands out from other \peft approaches because it maintains competitive performance with fewer trainable parameters and does not drastically scale up its parameters as the model size expands. 
However, \pt introduces extra soft prompt tokens, leading to longer input sequences, which significantly impacts training/inference time and memory usage due to the Transformer's quadratic complexity. 
Particularly concerning for Large Language Models (LLMs) that face heavy daily querying. 
To address this issue, we propose \textbf{De}composed \textbf{P}rompt \textbf{T}uning (\ours), which decomposes the soft prompt into a shorter soft prompt and a pair of low-rank matrices that are then optimised with two different learning rates. 
This allows \ours to achieve better performance while saving substantial memory and time costs compared to vanilla \pt and its variants, without changing trainable parameter sizes.
Through extensive experiments on 23 natural language processing (\nlp) and vision-language (VL) tasks, we demonstrate that \ours outperforms state-of-the-art \peft approaches, including the full fine-tuning baseline, in some scenarios.
Additionally, we empirically show that \ours grows more efficient as the model size increases.
Our further study reveals that \ours integrates seamlessly with parameter-efficient transfer learning in the few-shot learning setting and highlights its adaptability to various model architectures and sizes.

### Confidence
3: You are fairly confident in your assessment. It is possible that you did not understand some parts of the submission or that you are unfamiliar with some pieces of related work. Math/other details were not carefully checked.

### Summary
The paper proposes a new PEFT method that falls under the prompt tuning category. The paper is motivated by the fact that soft prompts increase the sequence length which results in increased training and inference time. The main idea of the paper is to reduce the number of soft prompt tokens and use the remaining parameters to perform low-rank updates to the embedding matrix. The DePT method outperforms vanilla prompt tuning in almost all cases and is competitive with many other PEFT methods.

### Strengths
S1: The idea is very simple and leads to decent improvements over the baseline methods. Also, the paper is very easy to read and understand. 

S2: The experiments are thorough enough, however, I have some mild additional suggestions that might make the experimental section more complete.

### Weaknesses
W1: Some of the important baseline methods like IA3 are missing. See questions below. 

W2: The idea is interesting, however some more intuition on why this works might strengthen the paper.

### Questions
**For me to retain my current score**

Q: Many of the tables have inconsistent baseline and incomplete results. All the superglue results should be filled in Table 1. I understand that the numbers are not available in past papers but it is not hard to obtain these numbers. This is important because the LORA method is the closet peft method on the glue benchmark however it is missing when looking at Superglue. Similarly, Table 2 should have LoRA as a baseline.

Q: IA3 is a recent PEFT method that is very parameter efficient and is missing from the baseline comparison. It is a crucial baseline, especially in the case of the few-shot adaptation. It should be added at least to Tables 4 and 5 and adding it to Tables 1-2 would also be good.



**Other Questions**

Q: Most of the improvement in the table-1 glue task seems to come from 1-2 tasks like cola, rte any specific reason for this?


Note for other reviewers and AC: I am not sure of the related work section, there might be some relevant prompting-related baselines that I am not aware of.

### Summary
This paper proposes a novel parameter efficient tuning method for language models named decomposed prompt tuning or DePT. Compared with popular parameter efficient tuning method prompt tuning, deft aims to learn more compact soft prompt and a pair of low-rank matrices for updating the vocabulary embeddings. The key innovation for DePT is to offload the potential need for long soft prompts and decompose them into a pair of low rank matrices. Through experiments with both language models and vision-language models across various tasks, the authors find that DePT can achieve advantageous performance while saving approximately 20% memory cost.

### Strengths
To the best of the reviewer’s knowledge, the method proposed in this paper DeFT is novel. The authors also provide solid intuitions and reasoning for this method. Besides the method constructions, the experiments are comprehensive. I also appreciate the authors’ efforts in organizing the anonymous project code that covers the experiments.

### Weaknesses
The key contribution of DePT lies in that it is both optimizing a soft context as long as the vocabulary in an efficient manner. The decomposition idea, although novel in its current form, is incremental to current PEFT methods. There is also existing work (e.g. [1]) that explored tuning subsets of vocabularies as a way of PEFT. That being said, DePT still has the advantage of efficient vocabulary tuning. The 20% efficiency advantage also is only revealed with one soft prompt length of 100. It would be appreciated if the authors are to disclose more performance comparison under different prompt length scenarios.

### Questions
I appreciate the ablation experiments on the significance of different learning rates for the soft prompts and low rank matrices. I also wonder if there are other intuitive explanations.

### Summary
The work introduces decomposed prompt tuning for parameter-efficient fine-tuning, or DEPT. They propose to reduce the prompt and add a decomposable matrix to the word embeddings. The experiments on GLUE and SuperGLUE show the method's effectiveness while being more efficient than prompt tuning. The few-shot learning experiments show that the method is competitive with other parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods with more parameters. Overall, the method improves prompt tuning while being 20% efficient in training.

### Strengths
**Paper quality.** The paper is well written. The organization of the paper is clear and well thought out. I enjoyed reading the paper. 

**Extensive experiments.** The paper extensively experiments with improved results compared to prompt tuning while being more efficient during training and inference. The authors have done a great job comparing the work with other recent methods in the literature and show that DEPT outperforms them on GLUE and SuperGLUE. They further provide evidence of their efficiency on GPT and Llama2 models. 

**Code.** The code is well organized and easy to understand (see https://anonymous.4open.science/r/DePT-8F43/README.md).

### Weaknesses
**The architecture is not well motivated.** 
The architecture appears to be a combination of prompt tuning and LoRA. But, unlike LoRA, DEPT still suffers from prompt length compared to architectures at inference time. While DEPT can also achieve the same inference speed as the base model, like LoRA, when the prompt length is 0, in Figure 3, we see that the performance is about 20 points below the DEPT performance reported in Table 1. Furthermore, decomposing the prompts does not offer any conceptual understanding or insight into the learned prompts. 

**Experiments with only smaller models (<1B model parameters).**
All experiments in the main paper are conducted on smaller models which hurt the technical contribution of the work. The paper presents improved results over several parameter-efficient methods, by a small margin, on models that have less than 1 billion parameters. The authors have included results of Llama2 in Appendix B but show improvements over prompt tuning on only one dataset (SST-2). It would be of interest to the community to know if the work is applicable to larger models say T5-XL, T5-XXL, or Llama2 on more datasets.
 
**Missing experiments.**
I noticed that the authors do not include results on SuperGLUE for LoRA in Table 1. Since the results for DEPT and LoRA are so close on GLUE, I would be curious to see how close the results are on SuperGLUE. 

**Suggestions.**
- Related work: The title of your work is similar to the below papers [a,b] but the proposed work differs. You could choose to cite them and clarify the differences in the next version of the paper. 
- Move the 3.3 #2 (DEPT grows more efficient with model size increases) to the Appendix and move Llama2 to the main paper as it is obvious that the inference time will improve with model parameter size. The Llama2 results, on the other hand, are more interesting.
- For completeness, it would be great if the authors could include the GPT-2 results in the Appendix on GLUE and SuperGLUE. I’d be curious to see if there are any changes in the performance.

### Questions
- In implementation details, you have included that the soft prompts and low rank matrices are initialized from soft prompts derived from one of the source tasks. Could you clarify this detail? It is unclear why this is necessary. 
- Do you think $\mathbf{BA}$ could use a scaling factor like $\frac{\alpha}{r}$? It is possible that this could be causing the low performance due to when only the decomposed matrices are trained. 
- In the background, you have mentioned that $s$ is the maximum sequence length. How would you set $s$ for Llama2 or models that do not have a fixed maximum sequence length?

### Summary
The paper proposes Decomposed Prompt Tuning (DePT), which decomposes the soft prompt into a shorter soft prompt and a pair of low-rank matrices optimized with two different learning rates. The authors conduct experiments to evaluate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed DePT.

### Strengths
- the paper is easy to follow
- extensive experiments on simple datasets are conducted to evaluate the proposed method

### Weaknesses
- **motivation is weak**: 
  - soft prompts are already very parameter-efficient; it is not necessary to reduce the #parameters in prompt tuning
  - usually, the length of soft prompts is small, e.g., 8, 16, 32; the additional inference cost is minor compared with the current LLM, which can accept thousands of tokens as input
  - though prompt tuning is sensitive to initialization, there are some recent methods to deal with this problem, e.g.,
    - Effective Structured Prompting by Meta-Learning and Representative Verbalizer, ICML 2023
    - MetaPrompting: Learning to learn better prompts, COLING 2022
- for the method, the idea of using a LoRA matrix to approximate part of soft prompts is odd to me. Can the authors visualize the learned A and B matrices to explain why DePT is better than Prompt tuning?
- the tasks used in experiments are too simple; better to try more challenging tasks, like GeoQuery (Zelle & Mooney, 1996), NL2Bash (Lin et al., 2018), WebQS (Berant et al., 2013). 
- datasets in GLUE and SuperGLUE are sensitive to hyperparameters. What are the hyperparameters for each dataset?
-  In Table 3, DePT is much worse than FT on VQA, but can perform better on MSCOCO; why?
- how to initialize the soft prompt in prompt tuning? Usually, they can be initialized randomly or use the embeddings of label tokens.
