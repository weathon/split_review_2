## Abstract
Dataset distillation aims to generate a smaller but representative subset from a large dataset, which allows a model to be trained efficiently, meanwhile evaluating on the original testing data distribution to achieve decent performance. Many prior works have aimed to align with diverse aspects of the original datasets, such as matching the training weight trajectories, gradient, feature/BatchNorm distributions, etc. 
In this work, we show how to distill various large-scale datasets such as full ImageNet-1K/21K under a conventional input resolution of 224$\times$224 to obtain the best accuracy over all previous approaches, including SRe$^2$L, TESLA and MTT. To achieve this, we introduce a simple yet effective ${\bf C}$urriculum ${\bf D}$ata ${\bf A}$ugmentation ($\texttt{CDA}$) during data synthesis that obtains the accuracy on large-scale ImageNet-1K and 21K with 63.2\% (IPC 50) and 36.1\% (IPC 20), respectively. Finally, we show that, by integrating all our enhancements together, the proposed model beats the current state-of-the-art by more than 4\% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K and for the first time, reduces the gap to its full-data training counterpart to less than absolute 15\%. Moreover, this work represents the inaugural success in dataset distillation on larger-scale ImageNet-21K under the standard 224$\times$224 resolution. Our distilled ImageNet-21K dataset of 20 IPC, 2K recovery budget are available anonymously at https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/12pC0GDTURdYLThAbVHkTw2lkF2KF_85i?usp=sharing.

### Summary
The paper introduces a curriculum learning framework for dataset distillation. It presents a strategic learning approach during the data recovery and synthesis phase, where image crops are adaptively adjusted according to the complexity of regions. The study investigates three learning paradigms for data synthesis: standard curriculum learning, reverse curriculum learning, and constant learning. Extensive experiments showcase the promising and superior results achieved by the proposed method.

### Strengths
1. The introduction of this article is well-crafted. Algorithm 1 efficiently conveys the author's method to the readers.

2. The design of the CDA framework is innovative, delivering good results on both ImageNet-1K and ImageNet-21K.

3. The inclusion of coarse data synthesis not only stabilizes the training process but also improves the model's ability to generalize and reduces the risk of overfitting.

### Weaknesses
1. In Table 2, the authors compared the distillation performance of their proposed method with SRe2L in Tiny ImageNet, ImageNet-1K, and ImageNet-21K datasets. However, I am curious about the performance when randomly sampling an equal number of images from the source dataset, which was not explicitly shown in the table (e.g., randomly selecting 200 images from ImageNet-1K and training on resnet-18).

2. The validation accuracy for DeiT-Tiny in Table 15 appears to be subpar. What do you think could be the reason for this result?

3. Given that other dataset distillation approaches have shown effectiveness at higher distillation ratios, could the authors provide experimental results for this method on the Tiny ImageNet dataset with smaller compression ratios (e.g., IPC=1 and IPC=10)?

### Summary
The paper introduces a dataset distillation model that employs a random cropping strategy for synthetic images, progressing from coarse to fine using various sampling scale hyperparameters. This cropping approach integrates the concept of Curriculum Learning. Notably, the model's efficiency and capability to handle large-scale dataset distillation are achieved without relying on complex gradient matching or trajectory matching techniques. Experimental results demonstrate that the model surpasses state-of-the-art models, including SRe2L, in multiple ImageNet subsets, including a large-scale ImageNet-21K dataset.

### Strengths
1. The first effort to apply a larger-scale dataset, i.e., ImageNet-21K in dataset distillation. It will amplify attention on this method for larger datasets, enhancing comprehension of its advantages and real-world challenges.
2. The model is simple yet it outperforms the existing method SRe2L by a margin.

### Weaknesses
1. The technical innovation is rather limited; the approach is more of a simple data augmentation trick. Although the concept of Curriculum Learning is incorporated, there's a lack of further exploration regarding the rationale or underlying principles for its application in the context of dataset distillation.
2. The experimental assessment is insufficient, lacking comparisons with a broader range of state-of-the-art models such as KIP, TM, and DSA, across various settings, including different architectures, IPC values, and image types.

### Questions
1. Regarding Eq. (3), could you explain why the objective is defined based on the training data (D) rather than on the distribution of real data?
2. The specific details on how to leverage the statistics in Batch Normalization (BN) have not been provided.
3. For the random crop: (a) Why is only the min_crop varied and not both min_crop and max_crop? (b) Should we always set the parameter \beta_u to 1 to maintain the original resolution intact?
4. In Algorithm 1, how does the ReverseRandomResizedCrop function operate? Does it directly restore and scale a crop, or is it applied as a patch to the original image? Additionally, aside from preserving the same resolution, does it serve any other purpose in the overall process?
5. The settings for reverse curriculum learning are not entirely clear. Could you please specify the actual values of \beta_l and \beta_u that are used during training?
6. The experiments conducted in the study is not sufficient: (a) It would be valuable to include cross-architecture performance evaluations. Instead of exclusively training on the ResNet family (e.g. Table 6 and 7), consider testing the approach with a broader range of models such as LeNet, VGG, MLP, etc. (b) Expanding the evaluation datasets beyond ImageNet to include other datasets like SVHN, MNIST, etc., would provide a more comprehensive assessment of the method's performance. (c) More baselines should be compared, such as Gradient Matching, Differentiable Siamese Augmentation, Distribution Matching, KIP, and Training Trajectory Matching (d) Considering a wider range of IPC settings, especially with smaller IPC values like 1, 10, 20, would offer insights into the method's performance across various scenarios.
7. It would be better to include a time and efficiency comparison when training on massive datasets like Image-21k. Providing insights into the computational costs and time requirements for training on such datasets for DD methods.

Minor comments:
1. Please provide the full name of an abbreviation, for example, IPC, which stands for image per class.

### Summary
This paper proposes a Curriculum Data Augmentation (CDA) specifically for SRe^2L which is a state-of-the-art dataset distillation method based on the model inversion technique. Specifically, the proposed CDA extends the original random resized crop during the model inversion process of SRe^2L by introducing a scale-varying (from larger to smaller) cropping scheme. Extensive tests demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed augmentation strategy.

### Strengths
S1: The exhibited experimental results demonstrate that the proposed CDA can improve the performance of SRe^2L among various evaluated scenarios.

S2: The paper is well-organized and presents a clear narrative. The experiments showcased are comprehensive and thoughtfully executed.

### Weaknesses
W1: It appears that this augmentation strategy is specifically introduced for SRe^2L. Compared to the prior art of data augmentation for dataset distillation (e.g., Data Siamese Augmentation [1]), the universality is considered to be insufficient and thus limits the contribution.

W2: According to the discussion within the original paper of SRe^2L, the primary problem limited to general dataset distillation can be concluded that the data synthesized by SRe^2L are not effective for training models without batch normalization module. It appears that the proposed CDA did not exhibit the capability to mitigate this limitation.

W3: Considering the straightforwardness and intuitiveness of this method, the fact that the authors have not delved deeper into discussing why this CDA strategy can effectively enhance the performance of SRe^2L and the unsatifactory universality of the proposed augementation strategy, it would be considered that this work does not offer sufficient insights for the dataset distillation.

### Questions
Q1: Is this data augmentation strategy also effective for other existing dataset distillation frameworks such as gradient matching or training trajectory matching (MTT)?

Q2: Based on W2, I am wondering if CDA can improve the generalization ability of SRe^2L on models without batch normalization such as ViT?

### Summary
This paper propose a dataset distillation method for large-sclae datasets. The authors propose a Curriculum Data Augmentation (CDA) method to improve the baseline Sre2L, achieveing a state-of-the-art perfromance among the existing dataset distillation methods. The atuhors conducted experiments on the large-scale dataset including ImageNet-1k and ImageNet-21k with significant improvement compared with Sr2L.

### Strengths
1. The performance is outstanding. The effectiveness of dataset distillation in large-scale datasets has been challenging for the community. This paper proposes a method that generalizes well on ImageNet-1k and ImageNet-21k. Furthermore, the authors provide the distilled dataset for verification, which is convincing.
2. The logic of this paper is rigorously structured, showcasing a well-thought-out approach to the research question. Each argument is methodically developed, drawing on relevant evidence and theoretical frameworks.
3. The experiments of this paper are sufficient. The visualization of the distilled images are good. Figure 2 is good to understand randomresizedCrop.

### Weaknesses
1. Although the experiments on ImageNet-1k and ImageNet-21k are convinsing, it would be better to have the experiments on CIFAR10/100 datasets. Because most of the baselines report their results on CIFAR, it will better illustrate the performance improvement of this paper if the authors do so. 

2. The authors should highlight the differences (innovation part) of their proposed method compared to the baseline  Sre2L. Section 2 could be organized better to demonstrate the nolvety of this paper. 

3. This paper should introduce more about the computational requirements for the experiments on ImageNet-21k. For example, the memory cost, over all training time.

### Questions
1. Experiments on CIFAR.  

2. The memory cost, over all training time, and GPUs of the experiments on ImageNet-21K.

3. Could this method be mitigated to the dataset such as NLP? The NAS problem in NLP is more urgent than CV.
