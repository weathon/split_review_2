# Neural Common Neighbor with Completion for Link Prediction

- Decision: Accept
- Scores: 6, 8, 3

## Abstract
In this work, we propose a novel link prediction model and further boost it by studying graph incompleteness. First, we introduce MPNN-then-SF, an innovative architecture leveraging structural feature (SF) to guide MPNN's representation pooling, with its implementation, namely Neural Common Neighbor (NCN). NCN exhibits superior expressiveness and scalability compared with existing models, which can be classified into two categories: SF-then-MPNN, augmenting MPNN's input with SF, and SF-and-MPNN, decoupling SF and MPNN. Second, we investigate the impact of graph incompleteness---the phenomenon that some links are unobserved in the input graph---on SF, like the common neighbor. Through dataset visualization, we observe that incompleteness reduces common neighbors and induces distribution shifts, significantly affecting model performance. To address this issue, we propose to use a link prediction model to complete the common neighbor structure. Combining this method with NCN, we propose Neural Common Neighbor with Completion (NCNC). NCN and NCNC outperform recent strong baselines by large margins, and NCNC further surpasses state-of-the-art models in standard link prediction benchmarks.

### Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of GNN-based link prediction, presenting a new framework MPNN-then-SF, aimed at enhancing the expressiveness of structure feature-based link prediction methods. The framework, operationalized through the NCN implementation, incorporates common neighbor features beyond simple counts. This work also tackles the issue of graph incompleteness that can lead to suboptimal link prediction results. The authors propose a common neighbor completion strategy to enrich the input graph. Experimental findings indicate that this methodology outperforms baseline models significantly.

### Strengths
1.	The proposed MPNN-then-SF framework innovatively incorporates common neighbor features beyond simple counts, enhancing the expressiveness of the graph-based link prediction model. NCNC further addresses the problem of graph incompleteness through the common neighbor completion module.
2.	The exploration into how graph completeness affects prediction outcomes is insightful. It underscores the importance of a comprehensive input graph for robust link prediction, setting the stage for further research in this area. 
3.	The results, as evidenced by Table 2 and Figure 5, show considerable improvements in expressiveness and scalability. The detailed analysis in Table 3 underscores the contribution of each component within the proposed framework, validating its effectiveness.

### Weaknesses
1.	While Figure 5 suggests that inference time does not increase significantly, calculating P_{uij} values for all node pairs could, in theory, create a computational burden. The paper would benefit from a more detailed explanation of this process. Is there a mechanism, such as pre-calculation or an efficient online algorithm, that mitigates the computational load during the inference phase? 
2.	The paper reveals that a first-order neighborhood is adequate by comparing NCN and NCN2 models. However, the potential of incorporating a broader neighborhood scope remains unclear. Could extending the common neighbor completion (CNC) to consider 2-hop neighbors improve performance significantly? It would be beneficial for the paper to discuss the implications of such an extension and, if possible, to present experimental results from implementing a 2-hop neighbor completion, referred to as NCNC, for a thorough comparison.

### Summary
In this paper, the authors propose a novel link prediction model called NCN. Unlike prior works, which can be classified into SF-then-MPNN and SF-and-MPNN categories, NCN introduces a novel architecture, MPNN-then-SF, that overcomes the defects of the previous two methods and offers a unique combination of high expressivity and scalability. Further addressing the Common Neighbor (CN) distribution shift problem caused by the graph incompleteness in existing link prediction settings, the authors introduce the Common Neighbor Structure Completion module to enhance NCN's performance. Finally, through extensive experiments on seven commonly used link prediction datasets, the author demonstrates the model's effectiveness and establishes it as the new state-of-the-art model for link prediction tasks.

### Strengths
- The paper is well-written, and the idea is easy to follow. For most claims, the paper provides either theoretical proofs or empirical results to support them, demonstrating its soundness.

- Extensive experiments have been conducted on commonly used link prediction benchmark datasets, with most baselines being competitive. The paper also includes details about efficiency statistics (time and resource consumption) and parameter settings.

- The observation regarding the CN distribution shift is very interesting and could inspire future work aimed at improving the performance of link prediction models by addressing this issue.

### Weaknesses
There are some minor issues with notation. For example, in Equation 6, why are double brackets used, "{{" and "}}"? In Equation 9, it would be better to explain the symbol "||" as concatenation again, as the definition of "||" is provided at the end of section 3.1, which is quite far away and might cause confusion for readers.

### Questions
How does the method behave on graphs without node features?

### Summary
In this paper, the authors propose a novel link framework, which they combine the MPNN and the SF. It is interesting to investigate the combination of the MPNN and the SF. However, the authors mainly compare their method against solely using the MPNN and solely using the SF. Another issue lies in the time complexity analysis. It would much better to report the time complexity of their paper compared to solely using the MPNN and the SF and the other combination methods.

### Strengths
1. It is interesting to study the combination of the MPNN and the SF. 
2. It is great to see the improvement of the proposed method against the baselines. 
3. Summarizing the limitations is always encouraged.

### Weaknesses
1. The theoretical analysis is mainly on the comparison between the combinations of the MPNN and the SF against solely using the MPNN and the SF. 
2. There is no complexity analysis.
3. There is no clear comparisons among different combinations (as shown in Figure 2).

### Questions
Firstly, in the introduction section, the authors have described three ways to combine the MPNN and the SF. However, there are no clear comparisons among these approaches. For example, what use cases fit each approach, and what is the complexity cost of each way? Second, the description of their approach is in Section 3.2, which is very simple and straightforward. I expect more analysis on why the proposed method is better than other combinations, instead of proving why the proposed method is better than solely using the MPNN and solely using the SF. For the experiment, I consider the proposed framework to be a general framework that can be applied to various GNNs. Therefore, I expect to see the results of employing the proposed method in different GNNs to verify the generalizability of the proposed method. Moreover, I also want to ask the authors why to report the results in terms of different evaluation metrics in Table 3. Could you please provide a completed version in the appendix? Also, in Table 3, we can see in some datasets such as Core, CIteseer, and Pubmed, there is very slight difference between GAE and NCN. I highly recommend the authors to further investigate the best use cases of the proposed method. Furthermore, it would be very interesting to summarize a table that includes the pros, the cons, and the best use cases, the worse use cases of different combinations in Figure 2. In Section 6.2, the authors report the memory costs, I highly recommend the authors to report the time complexity cost of applying the proposed methods against solely applying the MPNN and solely applying the SF, as the time complexity is quite crucial to determine whether a model can be applied online or not. 
Overall, I do not think this paper is ready for publication for this version. Please correct me if I have some misunderstanding.
