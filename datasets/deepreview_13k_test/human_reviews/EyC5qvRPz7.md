# Emerging Semantic Segmentation from Positive and Negative Coarse Label Learning

- Decision: Reject
- Scores: 6, 5, 3, 5

## Abstract
Large annotated dataset is of crucial importance for developing machine learning models for segmentation. However, the process of producing labels at the pixel level is time-consuming, error-prone, and even requires expert-level annotators for medical imaging, which is rare to have in practice. We note that it is simpler and less expensive to draw merely rough and approximate annotations, e.g., coarse annotations, which reduce the effort for expert and non-expert level annotators. In this paper, we propose to use coarse drawings from both positive (e.g., objects to be segmented) and negative (objects not to be segmented) classes in the image, even with noisy pixels, to train a convolutional neural network (CNN) for semantic segmentation. We present a method for learning the true segmentation label distributions from purely noisy coarse annotations using two coupled CNNs. The separation of the two CNNs is achieved by high fidelity with the characters of the noisy training annotations. We propose to add a complementary label learning that encourages estimating negative label distribution.  To illustrate the properties of our method, we first use a toy segmentation dataset based on MNIST. We then present the quantitative results on publicly available datasets: Cityscapes dataset for multi-class segmentation, and retinal images for medical applications. In all experiments, our method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods, particularly in the cases where the ratio of coarse annotations is small compared to the given dense annotations.

### Summary
This paper proposes a novel framework for semantic segmentation based on noisy coarse labels. The framework mainly consists of two parts: the first part is the Coarse Annotation Network, which models the features of both negative and positive coarse labels by estimating pixel-wise confusion matrices for each image; the second part is a normal Segmentation Network, whose role is to predict the true segmentation. The combination of these two parts yields the predicted coarse label, allowing the model to be trained with noisy coarse labels. As the training progresses, the output of the Segmentation Network gradually approaches the ground truth label. Experimental results demonstrate that the framework outperforms the current weakly supervised learning and weakly-supervised methods on multiple datasets.

### Strengths
- The problem this paper is trying to solve is interesting: how to effectively train a good segmentation network with only coarse labels? It has good potential in real-world applications.
- By using the estimated confusion matrices, the idea of simultaneously constructing a mapping relationship for the input image to both noisy coarse annotations and true segmentation labels is interesting.
- The proposed method models and disentangles the complex mappings from the input images to the noisy coarse annotations and to the true segmentation label simultaneously.

### Weaknesses
- The authors mentioned the use of complementary label learning for estimating the distribution of negative coarse labels. Furthermore, it is claimed in Section 3.1 that the proposed method is also applicable to cases involving only positive or negative coarse labels. Does the model work with only negative coarse labels? I am expecting to see the corresponding experiments/ablation studies to support the claims (only uses negative coarse labels).
- One of the basic/main assumptions in this paper is that: Given the input image, the authors assume that the provided coarse annotations are generated statistically independently across different samples and over different pixels. However, in practice, I am afraid this is not always true. The spatial relationship exists within neighboring/adjacent pixels and their corresponding coarse labels. Any thoughts regarding this?
- In Table 1, the proposed method also compares with two corse annotation-based baselines. While there are a few more recently proposed methods [1,2], just list a few. Also, in Table 2 of [2], the reported numbers on Cityscape seem to outperform the numbers reported in this paper. Would you please include such baselines as well for a fair comparison?

### Summary
The paper presents an end-to-end supervised segmentation technique that derives accurate segmentation labels from imprecise, rough annotations. The proposed design employs two interconnected CNNs: the first predicts the actual segmentation probabilities, while the second captures the traits of two distinct coarse annotations (positive annotations highlighting the area of interest, while negative ones point to background). The latter CNN achieves its task by determining pixel-specific confusion matrices for each image. In contrast to earlier approaches for weakly supervised segmentation that utilize coarse annotations, the proposed approach simultaneously identifies and decouples the relationships between the input images, the imprecise annotations, and the accurate segmentation labels. The performance of the method is evaluated on the MNIST, cityscape and a medical (retinal) imaging dataset.

### Strengths
Indeed, performing accurate annotations for large datasets for the purposes of segmentation is extremely time-consuming and unrealistic, hence the paper addresses an important, real-world problem. The paper is also clearly written and does a good job of providing a summary of the state-of-the-art in the literature. I like the basic idea of learning the unobserved true segmentation distribution by using a second CNN simultaneously with the first CNN estimating the correct segmentation. This makes the inference step very easy.

### Weaknesses
A major weakness of the paper is evaluation. Datasets such a MNIST are not meaningful for evaluating the performance of an image segmentation algorithm. For the retinal image dataset, the evaluation is quite unrealistic since the challenge with coarse segmentation is mainly the variation in how deep the vessel trees are segmented. For example, some annotators may only annotate the major vessels, others will annotate smaller vessels further down in the vessel tree. This is not taken into account at all.

Another fundamental weakness is that the coarse segmentations are synthetically generated by performing morphological transformations. To me, it is clear that such a synthethically generated can be learnt and corrected for. However, this is not what happens when human annotators perform coarse segmentations. The authors try to simulate the behaviours of different annotators (section 4.5) but unfortunately, this is not very realistic either.

### Questions
How do you deal with different annotators having different strategies for scribbles? Could the confusion matrix be estimated per annotator if the annotator ID is known for each image?

How can your method be used for multi-class segmentation problems which are very common in medical imaging. 

How does your method perform on structures which are less line-like, for example brain tumour segmentation.

It's good to see that you have evaluated your approach on retinal images, however it would have been better to evaluated on the well-established retinal image segmentation challenege: https://drive.grand-challenge.org/. How would your method compare here?

### Summary
The authors propose an approach for learning semantic segmentation from coarse (i.e., intuitively, fast-drawn) annotations. They adapt an approach for regularized annotator confusion matrix estimation, as proposed by Tanno et al. (CVPR 2019) for image classification, to semantic segmentation by predicting pixel-wise confusion matrices. Furthermore, their setup allows for coarse annotations of class foreground- as well as background labels to be exploited. 

Results are presented on MNIST, CityScapes, and a retinal vessel segmentation dataset from the medical domain.
Synthetic coarse labels are generated from expert consensus labels by fracturing and morphological operations as contained in the Morpho-MNIST toolbox. Quantitative evaluation in terms of mIoU indicates competitive performance.

### Strengths
The authors adapt a method proposed for learning image classification from noisy labels to learning image segmentation from coarse labels. Furthermore, they extend the approach to work with positive and negative class labels. Quantitative results indicate competitive performance of the proposed approach, suggesting good potential for practical use in learning segmentation from coarse labels.

### Weaknesses
The work lacks clarity in terms of the description of the coarse labels employed for evaluation. Furthermore, the work lacks a discussion in which cases basic assumptions and necessary conditions hold. Consequently, the soundness and practical value of the proposed method remains unclear.

In more detail: It remains unclear precisely how the synthetic coarse annotations were generated. The nature of the coarse labels is, however, crucial for the success of the proposed approach. E.g., if coarse labels are generated by a constant amount of morphological growing of the true labels, the necessary properties of success, as outlined by Tanno, appear to be violated, namely that the (pixel-wise) confusion matrices (true as well as predicted) need to be diagonally dominant. To give a concrete example, a systematic error like, e.g., an over-segmentation of the foreground by two pixels and resp. undersegmentation of the background by two pixels, does not appear to be "disentangleable" from the true label distribution by the proposed approach. 

The authors do not discuss whether their synthetic coarse annotations entail confusion matrices that satisfy the necessary diagonal dominace conditions. More generally, they do not discuss which types of real-world coarse annotations would satisfy the necessary conditions. Furthermore, it is not discussed whether the assumption of statistical independence of label noise across pixels, as stated in 3.2, holds for the employed coarse annotations, and if not what this would entail.

Specifically, how coarse annotations were generated remains unclear as follows: 
-- For MNIST it remains unclear if synthetic labels were generated by constant morphological growing (in addition to the random fracturing, which is not critical). Furthermore, it remains unclear whether expert labels were used to derive coarse labels (as stated in 4.2), or whether thresholded images were used (as stated in 4.1).
-- For CityScapes, it remains unclear whether expert labels (as stated in 4.2) or coarse polygonal annotations as provided with the data (as stated in 4.1) were used to derive coarse labels. Furthermore, the precise way in which morphological operations were applied to the former is not described.
-- For the medical data, the precise way in which morphological operations were applied to the expert consensus annotations is not described.


** Further detailed comments **

Figure 1: the arrows after transformation of u(x) appear to be wrongly conected: The dotted line should be between "Noisy Negative Coarse Annotation" and "Predicted Noisy Negative Coarse Distribution", and should be labelled "CE Loss"; The coninuous line should lead to "Predicted Noisy Negative Coarse Distribution" instead of "Noisy Negative Coarse Annotation"

The introduction states that "drawing coarse annotations [...] needs only similar effort and time as the scribble and box-level labelling, and can be conducted by non-experts"; It remains unclear / is not discussed though why expert knowledge would *not* be required for coarse labelling in cases where it *is* required for accurate labelling; Furthermore, the claim that coarse annotations are similarly cheap as scribbles and boxes is not substantiated by any respective citation or evaluation.

Related work that employs confidence filtering to deal with noisy labels is not discussed, e.g., DivideMix (Li et al., ICLR 2020)

The term "objective" is often used where "object" appears more appropriate

The annotation in 3.1 is somewhat inconsistent: image indices are sometimes n and sometimes i, please fix
Furthermore, S(x_i) is not clearly defined; it seems to be a subset of \mathcal{Y}; please clarify

In the "Learning with Negative Coarse Label" subsection, 2nd paragraph, there seems to be a typo, as "CE" should read "CM"

In Figure 2, the visualization of the pixel-wise CMs in A and C are not clear -- how are the (2x2?) CMs encoded via the color map? Furthermore, it is unclear how the figure shows the assumed behavior described in the last paragraph on page 7; This paragraph is very hard to parse; It would be very helpful if the authors could clearly describe where to look in the Figure to reveal the described behavior.

The caption of Table 1 should state that result are given for coarse labels at ratio 1 here (otherwise this needs to be deduced from comparison with Fig. 3)

Figure S5 gives the impression as if training was perfomed including the validation set -- or are these results on the training set? or are the respective coarse annotations only shown to provide some examples? please clarify in the caption

The citation style should be fixed as described in the provided template in most cases

### Questions
How were the synthetic coarse labels generated, precisely? Do these kinds of coarse annotations satisfy the pixel independence assumption, and do the entailed confusion matrices satisfy the diagonal dominance condition necessary for disentangling label noise? 
More generally, which kinds of coarse labels do satisfy these, and which don't? Would the kinds of coarse labels you would expect to get in practice satisfy the conditions?

### Summary
The paper introduces an image segmentation algorithm based on coarse drawings. Unlike previous weakly-supervised segmentation methods which only focused on the weak annotation either for the target objective or for the complementary label, the authors propose to leverage both of them to improve the segmentation performance. Experiments show the effectiveness of the proposed method and superior performance over existing methods.

### Strengths
1. Clear Motivation: Both positive and negative coarse drawings offer complementary information that is beneficial for image segmentation. Therefore, it is reasonable to utilize both of them simultaneously to enhance the performance of image segmentation.
2. Authors provide extensive experimental justification.

### Weaknesses
1. It is recommended to make fair comparisons with strong baselines, rather than comparing against weaker ones.
2. The novelty appears to be somewhat incremental, as the handling of positive and negative annotations in the method seems to be derived from Tanno et al. (2019) and Yu et al. (2018). Therefore, it is suggested to conduct ablation experiments separately comparing the proposed method with these approaches to validate the impact of positive and negative annotations on the final segmentation performance.
3. There are some spelling typos, such as "S(x_n)" and "S(x_i)" on page 3, which may hinder readers' understanding of the paper.

### Questions
1. As previously mentioned, I am curious about the influence of positive and negative coarse annotations on the final segmentation performance,
2.  and the comparisons with the current state-of-the-art weakly supervised segmentation methods, and even unsupervised methods like SAM Kirillov el. al (2023).
