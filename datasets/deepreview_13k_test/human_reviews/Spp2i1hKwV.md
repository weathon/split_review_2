- Scores: 8, 5, 3, 6, 8

## Abstract
In-context learning is a promising paradigm that utilizes in-context examples as prompts for the predictions of large language models. These prompts are crucial for achieving strong performance. However, since the prompts need to be sampled from a large volume of annotated examples, finding the right prompt may result in high annotation costs. To address this challenge, this paper introduces an influence-driven selective annotation method that aims to minimize annotation costs while improving the quality of in-context examples. The essence of our method is
to select a pivotal subset from a large-scale unlabeled data pool to annotate for the subsequent sampling of prompts. Specifically, a directed graph is first constructed to represent unlabeled data. Afterward, the influence of candidate unlabeled subsets is quantified with a diffusion process. A simple yet effective greedy algorithm for unlabeled data selection is lastly introduced. It iteratively selects the data if it provides a maximum marginal gain with respect to quantified influence. Compared with previous efforts on selective annotations, our influence-driven method works in an end-to-end manner, avoids an intractable explicit balance between data diversity and representativeness, and enjoys theoretical support. Experiments confirm the superiority of the proposed method on various benchmarks, achieving better performance under lower time consumption during subset selection.

### Summary
This paper presents a work on selective annotations in in-context learning. Given a pool of unlabeled instances to annotate for prompts, this paper proposes an influence-driven framework to identify those more significant data points for annotations and follow-up tasks. Compared with the previous method, the proposed method enjoys (1) greater convenience in selection due to the end-to-end manner; (2) it does not need to balance diversity and representativeness of selected instances; (3) theoretical analysis is provided to show the subset influence is at least as large as a certain proportion of the influence of the optimal solution. Comprehensive experiments are conducted to show the superiority of the proposed method, which achieves the best performance in most cases. The time consumption in selection is significantly lower than previous state-of-the-art methods.

### Strengths
1.	In-context learning is an important and swiftly advancing research area, capturing significant attention from both the ICLR and NLP communities. This paper conducts comprehensive evaluations on the influence of selecting specific examples for inclusion in the prompt. The findings illustrate the substantial impact this choice can have on the final model's behavior.
2.	The paper is well-structured and easily comprehensible. Within the evaluation section, there are numerous intriguing findings that hold significant value for dissemination within the wider research community. Besides, the source code is provided to ensure the reproducibility of the empirical findings. 
3.	The proposed method is simple and relatively straightforward to implement. Consequently, there is a possibility that it could be utilized in real-world applications of in-context learning.
4.	Theoretical analysis is provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method under a greedy search algorithm.

### Weaknesses
1.	There are some unclear expressions and inconsistent explanations. Some polishes are needed. 
2.	Some experimental settings only include the baselines Random and Vote-k. More methods as mentioned in 4.3.2 can be also included. 

More questions about weaknesses can be checked below.

### Questions
1)	The experiments can be supplemented by including other methods not just Random and Vote-k, as mentioned above. 
2)	The paper claims that it conducts experiments three times and reports the average score. What/where is the randomness? It mainly comes from examples selected or model predictions? Or both of them?
3)	For the process of information diffusion, in the main paper, it seems that the process is only performed once. In the Appendix, the paper discusses that multiple processes are performed. I suggest that this description can be moved to the main paper. Also, what is the influence of the times of information diffusion? 
4)	Additional elaboration is required to explain why the combination of IDEAL/vote-k and similarity retrieval proves effective, while IDEAL/Vote-k alone, coupled with the random selection of supporting examples, does not work well. 
5)	Recently, Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting has gained widespread adoption in in-context learning research. Several studies employing this method have reported enhanced model performance. However, an unexplored aspect of this approach is the model's sensitivity and variance concerning the retrieved prompts when used in conjunction with CoT. This work does not address whether such sensitivity exists and whether CoT can be applied for better performance.
6)	Is there any consideration given by the authors to the cost associated with encoding every unlabeled training instance using Sentence-BERT when comparing the methods? As far as I can discern, this aspect was not addressed in the paper.
7)	It seems that the instance embedding has a large Influence on the proposed method since it needs to build a directed graph using the embeddings. I am interested in changing the previously used pre-trained models and seeing the robustness of the proposed method. 
8)	The paper shows the label distribution brought by the proposed method. What about the distribution of original data (before selecting)? Are their label distributions similar? Besides, a balanced distribution is expected to bring better performance in follow-up tasks? Or otherwise. I am interested in this.

### Summary
In this paper, the authors propose the method using influence-driven selective annotations to minimize the annotation cost, thereby tackling the high annotation costs of discovering the right prompts for in-context learning. They construct a direct graph to represent unlabeled data and use a diffusion process to quantify the influence of unlabeled subsets. Finally, a greedy algorithm is utilized to conduct the final selection. Experiments are conducted on several benchmark datasets, and the experimental results show that the proposed method can achieve better performance with lower computational time in subset selection.

### Strengths
* S1: The influence-based greedy method can effectively and efficiently help find the right prompts from the large corpus.
* S2: Experimental results show improvements over Random and Vote-K.
* S3: The authors provide some preliminary theoretical proofs.

### Weaknesses
* W1: Some state-of-the-art studies like MDL [a] TopK (Liu et al., 2022) are not cited and/or compared in the experiments.
* W2: The rationales behind some experimental results are not explained, such as the reverse performance of MNLI in Table 5.
* W3: Lack of analysis on how the proposed method

### Questions
* Q1: Following W1,it would be great if the authors could patch more comparisons to more state-of-the-art works during the author feedback period.
* Q2: Following W2, I wonder why there are some inconsistent behaviors of the proposed method, instead of only getting the message "the proposed method performs still not bad". This is important because it would decide the choice between IDEAL and Auto-IDEAL.
* Q3: Following W3, because the proposed method should be general, it is reasonable to apply the method to different LLMs. It would be great if the authors could also conduct some related studies.

### Summary
In this paper, the authors propose an influence-driven demonstration selection method. I like the theoretical analysis of the influence function. However, I hold two main concerns: (i) if it requires running the influence function during the inference, then it is crucial to have the time complexity analysis, (ii) how the proposed approach considers the correlations among the retrieved data points.

### Strengths
1. Investigating the demonstration selection task from the influence perspective is very interesting.
2. It is great to have a theoretical analysis of the property of the influence function. 
3. Overall, this paper is well written.

### Weaknesses
1. There is no time complexity in the proposed method, which is very crucial if it needs to run for every inference. 
2. It is not clear how the proposed method considers the correlations among the retrieved data points. 
3. It is better to compare with more demonstration selection methods such as similarity-based and diversity-based methods which are widely used in practice.

### Questions
The topic of the demonstration selection is a hot and essential topic. I like the idea of investigating the demonstration selection from the perspective of influence. I like Section 3. I have two main concerns. First is that for each inference of LLM, whether it is required to run the influence function for n times to retrieve n shots. If it is true, it is very important to have a complexity analysis of running time. Second, I do not see how to consider the correlations among the retrieved samples. For greed search, there may be cases where A+B is better C+B, and C has more influence than A. I want to know how the proposed method addresses these cases. Furthermore, I also want to know how the proposed method leverages the features of each data sample. In other words, the nodes in the graph have their own features. How do you embed these features? Using sentence transformer or some GNN-based methods? And, what is the cost of applying these methods? Also, for the experiment, there are many demonstration selection methods in the NLP field, for example, similarity-based or diversity-based methods, which are widely employed in the LLMs. Therefore, I highly recommend the authors compare their method against these existing approaches. It would be great to see some results for more datasets (especially more tasks beyond the text classification) and more LLMs. Overall, I do not think this version is ready for publication.

### Summary
This paper studies the selective annotation for minimizing annotation cost on massive unlabeled in-context examples. To tackle the drawbacks of the existing Vote-k method and choose diverse and representative in-context examples, this paper proposes an unsupervised influence diffusion method to quantify the influence of each unlabeled example in the example corpus. Experimental results on various datasets and LLMs validates its effectiveness with reduced time consumption. The paper also proves the influence lower bound of the in-context selection method.

### Strengths
- The selective annotation is a meaningful research problem, since in reality LLMs need to to generalize to novel tasks without the existence of large amount of labeled data. 
- The previous Vote-k method needs to get the uncertainty from LLM predictions which incurs large computation time consumption, while the proposed method bypasses such need and considers from the perspective of data influence in the corpus. Also, this method reduces the LLM sensitivity on in-context examples, such as the order, which increases the robustness of in-context learning. 
- The experiments is conducted on different LLMs and various tasks, showing its effectiveness.

### Weaknesses
- This paper is related to "Li et al., Finding Support Examples for In-Context Learning", which also adopts the idea of coreset selection in in-context example selection, and "Diao et al., Active prompting with chain-of-thought for large language models", It is suggested to include discussion with these papers in the related work. 
- The theoretical analysis is about the influence lower bound. How the influence score relates to better diversity and representativeness needs further illustration, since it is the major consideration of the proposed method. 
- A minor suggestion is that the experiment datasets can also include some novel LLM benchmarks that are probably not trained on the experiment LLMs.

### Questions
- This paper uses small LMs less than 7B, and ChatGPT. Will the method still be effective on medium-sized LMs such as LLaMA2-chat 7B, 13B? And do you use any instruction for testing on ChatGPT?

### Summary
In order to improve the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) via in-context learning, this paper introduces a selective annotation method for creating, on a budget, high-value prompts for the LLM. The proposed approach selects a salient subset of examples to annotate (and choose-from for future prompts) from a large-scale unlabeled data pool. It uses the unlabeled data to (i) create a directed graph of "related examples," (ii) estimate  the influence of the candidates-for-annotation via a diffusion process, and (iii) iteratively select the data that provides a maximum marginal gain with respect to quantified influence.

### Strengths
The paper introduces a novel approach to improving in-context learning, which is an important problem with a myriad of strategic practical application. The works appears to be original and the. empirical evaluation suggests that this work could have major impact (also see comments below on how to make a stronger case along these lines). The paper is reasonably well-written and organized; see below suggestions on how to further improve it.

### Weaknesses
The most improvements could be achieved by tightening up the Empirical Evaluation section:
- ideally, rather than (arbitrarily?) choosing k = 18 & k = 100, you should provide an automated approach to AUTOMATICALLY assess the smallest amount of annotations that leads to the best possible performance; you only introduce Auto-IDEAL in "4.4" but you do not seem to claim it as a major contribution. Why?
- in Table 2:
   a) please add an additional row that shows the best-known performance on each dataset; without it, it is impossible to quantify the practical impact of IDEAL (i.e., is "just" improving on Vote-k, or does it come close to the best-known performance?)
   b) please also add to the Table results for k = 1,000 and even k = 10,000. How big are these improvements, if any?
   c) please explain why do we see IDEAL(100) < IDEAL(18) on RTE. Is there a general lesson worth sharing?
   d) similarly, why does Vote-k outperform IDEAL(100) on GeoQ (Tables 2 & 8). In particular, given that Table 8 suggest that there is a fair amount of variability among the various trials, ideally you should increase the number of trials to 10 or even larger. In the current setting, according to Table 8, for "100" Vote-k and IDEAL obtain the same best result (60.5) on GeoQ; similarly, for "18", there is a similar "tie" on HellaSwag, and Vote-k gets a better max on GeoQ.
- section 4.3.1 should cover all datasets, not only two; worst case scenario, if space is an issue, you can summarize the results on all datasets here, and refer the reader to the appropriate appendix
- same as above, section 4.3.1 should cover all datasets, not only three of them. Also: (i) why have Table 2 for "18" rather than "100," when IDEAL(100) outperforms IDEAL(1*0 on all datasets, and (2) similarly to the above comment on stability, you should use at least 10 randomized trials. 
- same as above, section 4.4 should cover all datasets, not only five of them

OTHER COMMENTS:
1) please add early-on (e.g., in the Introduction) a few illustrative examples. For one or two of your application domains, you should show:
- an un-annotated example that IDEAL selects for annotation
- the annotated version of that example
- the answer of the LLM w/o that annotated example used as a prompt
- the answer of the LLM w/o that annotated example used as a prompt
- explain and/or discuss the difference between the two answers above  

2) please add to the paper a paragraph or two about the actual/expected cost of annotation for the various domains in the empirical evaluation.

3) please intuitively explain the "end-to-end" term that you are using in the Abstract, Introduction, and later on in the Appendices, but nowhere else in the rest paper. If it is an important concept, it should also appear in the "meat" of the paper; if it is not, you should remove all references to it as it is distracting to see it mentioned early on, never clarified, and then simply ignored. 

4) both in Fig 3's caption and in the abstract, please summarize the running time improvements of IDEAL vs Vote-k. The current "largely reduces the time cost" is simply too vague. Ideally, the last sentence of the abstract should end something like this: "... improving the performance by X% while reducing the running time by Y%"


Nitpicks:
- p 1: "pretty performance" --> "strong performance"
- p 1: please add a reference and /or brief summary for "requires substantial manpower and financial resources"
- p 2: "Vote-k devoids theoretical guarantees" --> "Vote-k lacks theoretical guarantees"
- p 2: please explain why "the algorithm does not need a delicate trade-off between diversity and representativeness"
- p 2: last paragraph of the Intro: please also quantify the performance improvement, not only the gains in speed
- p 3: for Fig 2, please explain if/why the iterations start at (d).  
- p 5: probably the theorem should be called "Theorem 1" (or else the reader expects to see a Theorem 1 before it)

### Questions
1. why don't you claim Auto-IDEAL as a major contribution?
2. why don't you use all datasets in all experiments, but rather different subsets in 4.3.1, 4.3.2, and 4.4?
3. how did you end up with the two values of 18 and 10 (especially the "18" one)?
4. why do we see such large variability in performance among the three different runs? why din't you try more runs, so that you can get a better understanding of the scale of the variability issue?
