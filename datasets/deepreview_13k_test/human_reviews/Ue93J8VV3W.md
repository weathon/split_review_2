# TabGraphs: new benchmark and insights for learning on graphs with tabular features

- Decision: Reject
- Scores: 3, 3, 3, 6

## Abstract
The field of tabular machine learning is very important for industry and science. Table rows are typically treated as independent data samples. However, often additional information about the relations between these samples is available, and leveraging this information may improve the predictive performance. As such relational information can be naturally modeled with a graph, the field of tabular machine learning can borrow methods from graph machine learning. However, graph models are typically evaluated on datasets with homogeneous features, such as word embeddings or bag-of-words representations, which have little in common with the heterogeneous mixture of numerical and categorical features distinctive for tabular data. Thus, there is a critical difference between the data used in tabular and graph machine learning studies, which does not allow us to understand how successfully graph methods can be transferred to tabular data. In this work, we aim to bridge this gap. First, we create a benchmark of diverse graphs with heterogeneous tabular node features and realistic prediction tasks. Further, we evaluate a vast set of methods on this benchmark, analyze their performance, and provide insights and tips for researchers and practitioners in both tabular and graph machine learning fields.

### Rating Number

### Confidence
5: You are absolutely certain about your assessment. You are very familiar with the related work and checked the math/other details carefully.

### Summary
Creates 8 graph datasets with 7-31 features per node and reports result of a number of baseline methods on them.

### Strengths
S1. The new datasets may be helpful in that they seem to have useful node-level features. Many of the datasets are created by extending existing graph benchmarks with new features that were originally not provided, which may make these graphs more realistic.

### Weaknesses
W1. No insight
W2. No "research" contribution
W3. Language

On W1. While new datasets may be useful, the paper does not provide any tangible insights. First, the datasets are merely described, but there is little rationale about why they have been constructed in this way and what qualitative properties they have. Second, and more importantly, the experimental study reports results of some baseline models using fixed (!) hyperparameters, but does not provide any additional insight beyond pure numbers. I did not learn anything from this study.

On W2. This is more a dataset paper than a research paper. As argued above, the methodology used in dataset construction and, more importantly, empirical study does not enhance our understanding of graph learning.

ON W3. The paper positions itself as graph learning with "tabular" / "heterogenous" features. This raises misleading expectations, as it's really just graphs with a fixed set of vertex-level features.

--- UPDATE AFTER DISCUSSION ---
I'd like to encourage the authors to follow-up on this benchmark, even though I do not think it is ready for publication at ICLR. I raised my overall score to express this point.

The current submission (still) misses a solid discussion of available benchmarks and where they fall short, it is not clear if the submission provides SOTA baselines (which are not "easy" to beat by subsequent work), it's not clear to what extent feature heterogeneity actually plays any role (e.g., would the result change if the original non-heterogenous datasets were used), and the paper's study lacks insight (including insight beyond Platonov 2023).

### Summary
The paper addresses the lack of ml models for graphs with heterogeneous features. The work provides several benchmark datatsets with such characteristics and evaluates with numerous methods to analyze the performances. Finally, the paper provides some insights and tips for researchers and practitioners in both tabular and graph machine learning fields.

### Strengths
- The paper provides several useful benchmark datasets for graph based ml.
- The paper provides results across various ml models for tabular learning, graph based models, and combinations of the two.
- The paper provides some recommendations and insights for researchers and practitioners working with tabular and graph data.

### Weaknesses
- The paper should address its focus on either transductive or inductive settings. The comparison of the models deal with both models (gbdt and gnns), and the performance gap could be resulting from the fact that gnn models use the unlabeled test data. 
- In many real-world situations, the data comes with unseen data. The paper should also address the conversion of relations to graphs and application of gnns in those settings.
- The paper should address address some of the limitations in converting relations into graphs. For instance, the time it takes to preprocess the data and time comparison of the model evaluations.
- The tables of results could be of better quality. (eg, bold-face the best results)

### Questions
- On the performance comparison, how does the paper differentiate or address the difference between the transductive and inductive learning methods?
- What are the hyperparameter search space for gradient boosting methods?
- What are some limits in constructing relations into graphs (for example computational limits, etc.,)?
- Even without the relation (graph-like) information, it is advisable to apply construction of graphs with features (for instance Gaussian-kernel) and then apply one of the comparing methods?
- It would be good to have some distinctive markings (ex, bold-face) on the table of results.

### Summary
This paper proposed a benchmark (TabGraph) for learning on graphs with heterogeneous tabular node features. The benchmark contains 8 datasets that vary in the mixture of feature types, node numbers, average degrees and domain. The author compared GNN models, tabular deep learning models, tabular tree models, and some tabular and graph hybrid models. The author also proposed to embed the tabular node features with the PLR algorithm and demonstrated that it can boost the performance.

### Strengths
1. Lots of tabular data have correlated samples that can be effectively modeled by a graph. The TabGraphs benchmark compared several recent methods under this setting, and is helpful for people dealing with such kind of tabular data.
2. The author showed that PLR can boost the performance of GNN on graphs with heterogeneous tabular features.

### Weaknesses
1. Although PLR can boost the performance of GNN, it is not novel. It is not surprising that a better node representation can boost the performance of GNN.
2. Although the author claimed that these 8 datasets in TabGraph is diverse, their selection criteria is unclear to the reader. In fact, lots of tabular benchmarks contain hundreds of datasets (e.g., AMLB). Benchmarking on only 8 tables may not be conclusive.

### Questions
What's the selection criteria of these 8 tabular datasets?
For generic tabular datasets, you can build a graph that connects the samples (e.g., based on the sample correlation). Can GNN + PLR still obtain performance in the general setting?

### Summary
The paper says that tabular data can be seen as graph-structured data to improve the predictive performance,  which is interesting. The paper proposes datasets with heterogenous node features for future research that fills in the gap between machine learning for tabular data and graph machine learning, which makes sense. Most of the proposed datasets are processed by certain rules, which undermines the credibility of the datasets and insights.

### Strengths
S1. Filling in the gap between machine learning for tabular  data and graph machine learning make senses.

S2. Datasets of different kinds are included. Major models are evaluated.

S3. The paper reads well.

### Weaknesses
W1. It is unclear that how much model performance can be achieved from the proposed heterogeneous features. See Q1.

W2. Important data is missing. Strings or texts are common data types in Tabular data. TabGraph does not include strings or texts data (see Q2). Data from science domain is not included (see Q3).

W3. Insights are not completely convincing as datasets are preprocessed by rules. See Q4 and Q5.

W4. Limitations of the paper are not discussed in the paper. Please discuss limitations of the paper.

### Questions
Q1: Model performances on homogeneous features are not shown. Can authors compare models performances on hemogeneous features and heterogeneous features to show the efficacy of  proposed datasets?

Q2:  Can authors explain why strings or texts data are not included by TabGraph? 

Q3: Graph data from science domain is not included. Can authors add one dataset for science for node classification and node regression tasks?

Q4: The paper says that " In our preliminary experiments, we found that by using GBDT on all the features available in this dataset, one may achieve ∼ 0.99 ROC-AUC, so we decided to remove the number of votes as the most important feature .." If GBDT performs very well on certain types of data, insights probably need to be updated.  Can authors comment on why the number of votes shoud be removed? 

Q5: Can authors explain why certain thresholds are chosen for different datasets in Section 3.1? 

Q6: Table 1 shows that there are three types of features: number features,  binary features, category features. Can authors show which feature is more important than others?

Q7: How are the node features extended to be heterogeneous for tolokers-tab dataset? 

Q8: Can authors provide tentative dates to release both the source code and the datasets?

Q9: Can authors explain how expensive is transforming tabular data relations to graph structure?
