# HoloNets: Spectral Convolutions do extend to Directed Graphs

- Decision: Accept
- Scores: 6, 6, 8, 6

## Abstract
Within the graph learning community, conventional wisdom dictates that spectral convolutional networks may only be deployed on undirected graphs: Only there could the existence of a well-defined graph Fourier transform be guaranteed, so that information may be translated between spatial- and spectral domains. Here 
		we show this traditional reliance on the graph Fourier transform to be superfluous and -- making use of certain advanced tools from  complex analysis and spectral theory -- 
		extend spectral convolutions to directed graphs. %We explain 
		We provide a frequency-response interpretation of newly developed filters, investigate the influence of the basis used to express filters
		and discuss the interplay with characteristic operators on which networks are based.
		In order to thoroughly test the developed  theory, we conduct experiments in real world settings, showcasing
		that  directed spectral convolutional networks provide new state of the art results for heterophilic node classification on many  datasets  and
		-- as opposed to baselines -- may be rendered stable to resolution-scale varying topological perturbations.

### Summary
This paper studied the problem of designing graph filters for directed graphs. Instead of following the same approach for undirected cases (first define the spectrum based on Graph Fourier Transform, then define the filters based on spectral responses), the authors proposed to analyze the relationship between spectral response $g(\lambda)$ and graph filter $g(T)$ directly when function $g$ comes from some constrained set. By observing an interesting connection between this problem and results from functional calculus, this paper presented a principal design for directed graph filters and two feasible approximations: faber polynomials and resolvent. Furthermore, the stabilities of these graph filters are established, and the simulations show that the new method outperforms other directed GNN baselines over several benchmark datasets.

### Strengths
I believe the most important contribution of this paper is that the authors point out the fact that we do not really need Graph Fourier Transform to define graph filters, which has always been an obstacle in graph learning and signal processing community due to the non-symmetric nature of directed Laplacian. The literature review and observations presented in this paper can be viewed as a general guidance to design convolutional kernels for directed graphs, and lay the theoretical foundations for other future works on this subject. Following the general design, this paper also introduced two computationally feasible filter banks to implement the directed graph kernels in practice, which achieves good results on standard benchmark datasets.

### Weaknesses
Although the technical insights shown in this paper are great and very interesting, the presentation of this paper, especially the main text, can be improved. I understand that the authors want to convey as much information as possible within the main text, but the main goal of this paper, which is the implementation of the practical directed convolutional kernels (layers), should still be explained clearly in detail. For example, after reading the entire paper, I still do not know if we need to perform the eigendecomposition of the graph operator or not. In other words, even if we set the function to be faber polynomials $\Psi_k(\lambda)=\lambda^k/2^k$, what will $\Psi_k(T)$ in this case, where $T$ is the operator? Do we still have to consult Eq (3) to compute $\Psi_k(T)$, which can be computationally expensive? This type of question should be clearly explained in the main text to help readers better understand the big picture. A pseudocode of the algorithm/training procedure can help solve this issue.

Besides the computation of graph kernels, some of the heuristic choices adopted in Holonets lack theoretical insights as well. For example, why do we need to use forward and backward filters separately? Why the operator is chosen to be $T=(D^{in})^{-1/4}W(D^{out})^{-1/4}$? Why use absolute value as the nonlinear activation, which is unusual in GNN literature? All of these choices seem to just come out of trial and error in simulations. It would be good if the authors could provide some further explanations for these choices.

One minor concern that I have is about the simulation of directed graph regression problems. I am not very convinced why we should treat this as a directed graph problem, and how it helps when we consider the edges to be directed and the nodes to be weighted. Maybe it has some physical/chemical meanings, but since I am not an expert in physics, I will leave this to other reviewers to decide.

Two other small comments: I would not describe the difference between the performance of FaberNet and that of Dir-GNN to be significant, as most of the differences are within one standard deviation. Also from the implementation side, Dir-GNN is much simpler than FaberNet; on page 5, "Faber polynomials provide near near mini-max polynomial approximation" there are two "near".

### Questions
Besides the ones listed above, I have the following questions as well:

1. What is the choice of $y$ for Dir-ResolvNet?

2. Why is the normalization for $T$ $-1/4$ not $-1/2$? If in undirected case, I believe the practice is to use $D^{-1/2}$. Why is there a discrepancy? Also, I am not sure how this is related to the motivation stated in the paper "We thus use as characteristic operator a matrix that avoids direct comparison of feature vectors of a node with those of immediate neighbours".

3. Where do the imaginary weights in FaberNet come from? Is it because the eigenvalues can be complex?

### Summary
This paper introduces a novel approach to extending spectral graph neural networks (GNNs) from undirected graphs to directed graphs. 
Instead of leveraging the traditional Graph Fourier Transform, this paper employs the holomorphic function to avoid the self-adjoint requirement. This paper further discusses the significance of this extension, highlighting its frequency-response interpretation and the basis used to express filters. Finally, the proposed method, namely FaberNet, is validated through experiments on diverse datasets.

### Strengths
1. This paper provides a new direction for designing spectral GNNs in directed graphs, i.e., holomorphic functions, which can preserve the algebraic relations to construct the polynomial filters.

2. The authors give sufficient justifications to verify the advantages of holomorphic functions, convincing me about their effectiveness.

3. The proposed FaberNet consistently outperforms other directed GNNs in both heterophilic node classification and regression tasks.

### Weaknesses
I'm concerned about the datasets used in the node classification task. Results in Table 1 show that the performance of MagNet is far way from FaberNet. I guess that this is because MagNet operates as a low-pass filter and therefore cannot perform well in the heterophilic datasets.

Since extending spectral GNNs to direct graphs mainly relies on the modification of eigenvectors, I think the choice of filters should not be the major reason to affect the model performance.

It would be better if the authors could provide more experimental results in the homophilic graphs to validate the effectiveness of the proposed methods.

### Questions
Replacing $\lambda$ with $T$ yields equation 2. I wonder what $d$ indicates in $T - z \cdot I d$? This symbol seems to conflict with the differential symbol.

2: You are willing to defend your assessment, but it is quite likely that you did not understand the central parts of the submission or that you are unfamiliar with some pieces of related work. Math/other details were not carefully checked.

### Summary
This paper targets the limitation of conventional Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) that struggle with handling directed graphs effectively. The objective is to enhance spectral convolution networks to cater to directed graphs, thereby eliminating reliance on the Graph Fourier Transform. The proposed method's effectiveness is confirmed through experiments conducted on real-world datasets.

### Strengths
1. The paper is novel and has theoretical depth.
2. The proposed method is technically sound.
3. The paper is well-written and easy to follow.
4. The proposed method achieves SOTA performance in several real-world directed heterophilic datasets.

### Weaknesses
I am not an expert in spectral GNNs thus I could only point out a limited number of issues in the experiments:
1. It would be good to examine the efficiency of the proposed method, especially when compared with DiGCN and DirGNN. Moreover, a discussion on the number of learnable parameters would be beneficial.
2. The impact of the number of layers on the model's performance is worth exploring. Do we have the same problem of over-smoothing in directed graphs when the GNN goes deeper?
3. Did HoloNet outperform the baselines in graph classification tasks? More evaluation tasks could be investigated.


Overall, I think it's a good paper ready for publication at NeurIPS.

### Summary
This paper introduces spectral convolutions to directed graphs without relying on the graph Fourier transform. The paper provides a frequency-response interpretation of the proposed filters with a theoretical analysis. Experimental results seem promising.

### Strengths
1) The usage of holomorphic functional calculus to introduce directed graph filters is novel.
2) Directed graphs are important to consider.
3) Theoretical analysis seems sound.
4) The proposed method seems effective and expressive.

### Weaknesses
1) The formulation seems to be restricted to one-dimensional node weights for the nodes, but it is not clear what modifications should be made if we are given multiple-dimensional node features.
2) The underlying reason for using holomorphic functional calculus has not been clearly demonstrated.
3) Some typos exist. For example, in the "Contributions" part at the end of Sec. 1, there is one redundant "the" in line 6; in the second paragraph of Sec. 3.3.1, there is one more "near" in line 5; there should be an 'as' after 'referred to' right after equation (5) on page 17; the first 'eigenvalue' should indeed be 'eigenvector' in Sec. C on page 17; 'interpreting' should be 'interpreted' right after the mention of Appendix B on page 18.

### Questions
1) The formulation seems to be restricted to one-dimensional node weights for the nodes. What modifications should be made if we are given multiple-dimensional node features?
2) What is the computational complexity of HoloNets compared to DiGCN, MagNet, and Dir-GNN?
