# Doubly Robust Structure Identification from Temporal Data

- Decision: Reject
- Scores: 6, 6, 6, 3, 3

## Abstract
Learning the causes of time-series data is a fundamental task in many applications, spanning from finance to earth sciences or bio-medical applications. Common approaches for this task are based on vector auto-regression, and they do not take into account unknown confounding between potential causes. However, in settings with many potential causes and noisy data, these approaches may be substantially biased. Furthermore, potential causes may be correlated in practical applications. Moreover, existing algorithms often do not work with cyclic data. To address these challenges, we propose a new doubly robust method for Structure Identification from Temporal Data (\alg). We provide theoretical guarantees, showing that our method asymptotically recovers the true underlying causal structure. Our analysis extends to cases where the potential causes have cycles and they may be confounded. We further perform extensive experiments to showcase the superior performance of our method.

### Summary
This paper presents a novel and efficient Doubly Robust Structure Identification from Temporal Data (SITD) algorithm, offering theoretical guarantees including $\sqrt{n}$-consistency. It establishes a technical connection between Granger causality and Pearl's time series framework, outlining the conditions under which the approach is suitable for feature selection and full causal discovery. The paper's theoretical insights highlight the algorithm's ability to handle non-linear cyclic structures and hidden confounders, even without relying on faithfulness or causal sufficiency. In extensive experiments, the approach demonstrates remarkable robustness, speed, and performance compared to state-of-the-art methods, making it a valuable contribution to causal discovery in various applications.

### Strengths
- They've introduced a doubly robust structure identification method for analyzing temporal data. It doesn't rely on strict faithfulness and causal sufficiency assumptions, making it versatile enough to handle general non-linear cyclic structures and hidden confounders.

- The innovative application of the double machine learning framework to Granger causality is a significant contribution.

- The paper is well-structured, maintaining a coherent and easily-followed flow from beginning to end.

- The paper extensively references related work, offering a comprehensive overview of prior research that not only provides valuable context for the study but also underscores the authors' profound understanding of the field.

### Weaknesses
- Regarding the "stationary causal relation" assumption, you mentioned that the results could potentially apply to models that do not meet this axiom. Have you formally demonstrated this claim in any specific section, or are you implying that the proof of Theorem 4.1 does not rely on this assumption?

### Questions
- How do you identify cyclic structures? Does Algorithm 1 have the capability to detect cyclic structures, and does this imply the presence of confounders?

- In your method, is the time lag $k$ fixed, or does it remain stationary but vary among different variables?

### Confidence
2: You are willing to defend your assessment, but it is quite likely that you did not understand the central parts of the submission or that you are unfamiliar with some pieces of related work. Math/other details were not carefully checked.

### Summary
The authors present a doubly robust structure identification method for temporal data that can identify the direct causes of the target variable assuming additive noises, even in the presence of cyclic structures and in the absence of faithfulness or causal sufficiency.

### Strengths
1. The authors offer a discussion connecting Granger's causality with Pearl's framework, which is thought-provoking.
2. The authors propose an algorithm based on a parameter estimation framework, namely DoubleML, to detect the causes of the target variable. 
3. The literature review is comprehensive.
4. The authors conduct extensive experiments on semi-synthetic and synthetic datasets, compared with several baselines.

### Weaknesses
1. In the contribution, the authors claim that the proposed algorithm can be used for full causal discovery under some assumptions. The related discussion in section 5.2 is limited without details.
2. In principle, the approach adheres to steps (1) through (4) in section 4.2, yet the practical algorithm has been adjusted to account for the time-consuming nature of "large instances." While the approach outline aligns with the proven theorem, a gap exists between the outlined approach and the modified algorithm. Is it feasible to implement the approach strictly in smaller instances, adhering to steps (1) through (4)? Furthermore, what does "large instances" imply in this context?
3. There is no real-world application provided in the paper.
4. Regarding the baselines, from my understanding, some of them are designed for full causal discovery, encompassing the detection of causes for target variables and beyond. In contrast, the proposed algorithm primarily focuses on feature detection. In the experiment section, are there any specific modifications necessary to ensure a fair comparison?

### Questions
1. Can you please provide a brief explanation of the role played by the causal graph in the proposed algorithm? Personally, I am under the impression that the causal graph is unrelated to the proposed method, rendering the faithfulness assumption, cyclic structure, and causal sufficiency irrelevant to the algorithm. Thus, I do not consider the relaxation of this assumption as an advantage of the method, as it falls outside the scope of the algorithm. Please correct me if I missed the point.
2. In the first equation on page 4, what is $N$?
3. In equation 3, what is $n$? Should it be $k$?
4. I felt lost that in equation 3, $g^0_0$ and $g^i_0$ equal to the same conditional expectation as $\alpha^0_0$ and $\alpha_0^i$ in the second point in section 5.1. Are they the same things?
5. As the appendix states, $k$ ranges from 3 to 7. What is the value of $k$ used in each experiment? Is the algorithm output sensitive to the value of $k$?
6. The term "trajectories" means the time series, correct? In Fig.2, what does $N_feat$ represent? Is $N_feat$ indicative of the number of trajectories? Additionally, in Fig.3, all the algorithms exhibit improved performance with an increase in the number of trajectories. Could you provide a brief explanation for this trend? Moreover, why does Fig.3 depict the performance in low-sample regimes, and how are "low-sample regimes" reflected in the Fig.3?
7. Is there a specific reason for using only one baseline algorithm in the experiments presented in the appendix?

### Summary
The paper proposes an algorithm to discover causal relationship using time series data. It is based on the double/debiased machine learning (DML) framework that has been popular in the recent literature. There are two main theoretical results: (I) Theorem 4.1 shows that under a set of axioms (A to C, in particular), true causality is equivalent to Granger causality, and (ii) Theorem 4.2 claims that under axioms A to D, Granger causality is equivalent to checking whether two expectations are the same or not. The algorithm called Structure Identification from Temporal Data (SITD) is given on page 7 and its numerical performance is illustrated using the Dream3 dataset.

### Strengths
The research question addressed in the paper is of very high importance. As mentioned in the first paragraph on page 1, there are numerous scientific fields where causality questions need be addressed with time series data.

### Weaknesses
1. The paper focuses on time series data but there is no statistical analysis focusing on time series data. For example, on page 7, it is stated that "Under mild conditions on the convergence of $g_j^0$, $g_j^i$ and $\alpha_j^0$, $\alpha_j^i$, the quantity $\theta^0 − \theta^i$ has $\sqrt{n}$-consistency" and that "We refer the reader to Chernozhukov et al. (2022; 2018) for a proof of the $\sqrt{n}$-consistency for estimates as $\theta^0$ and $\theta^i$."  I do not think the cited references deal with time series data directly. It is disappointing that the paper does not provide any extensive treatment of time series analysis. 

2. Lemma A.1 claims that conditional mean independence in part 1 is equivalent to the conditional dependence in part 2. This seems mainly driven by Axiom (A) where the error $\varepsilon$ is exogenous independent noise. I feel that this is a rather restricted setting. For example, suppose that Y is the time series of financial returns (e.g., S&P 500) and X is the causal factor that does not affect the conditional mean of returns but does affect the conditional variance of returns (typically called volatility in finance). It seems that the framework in the current paper excludes this kind of scenario. It is unclear to me what sense Axiom (A) is necessary; related to this point, Appendix A.3 is difficult to understand (see question 1 below).

### Questions
1. Appendix A.3 is difficult to understand. What are roles of $W_t$ and $Z_t$? $\Sigma$ is not a positive definite matrix here and seems too irregular. Some further comments would be useful.

2. The derivation on page 18 after "We now prove the claim" is difficult to follow. It seems to me that it is already assumed that $E[Y_ T | X_t^i = x, I_T^{\backslash i} = i] = E[Y_T | X_t^i =x', I_T^{\backslash i} = i]$ for any $x$ and $x'$ in the derivation; but I am not sure why. Does the current proof imply the if and only if result for equation (3)? Some clarifications would be helpful. 

3. I cannot follow why equation (4) is a good property. This indicates that the bias multiplied by $\sqrt{n}$ goes to zero. It might be better to show that the root mean squared error multiplied by $\sqrt{n}$ goes to zero as $n \rightarrow \infty$. Some explanations would be helpful.

4. In the experiments on page 8, the area under the ROC curve (AUROC) is used as the performance metric. It would be beneficial why this metric is related to causality concerns.

[Update after the discussion period] The author(s) provided timely responses to my comments/questions; I very much appreciate them; however, I still have concerns and would like to keep my ratings.

### Confidence
3: You are fairly confident in your assessment. It is possible that you did not understand some parts of the submission or that you are unfamiliar with some pieces of related work. Math/other details were not carefully checked.

### Summary
The paper proposes an approach for learning time varying causal features of a target variable using Granger causality and doubly robust methods. The approach can also be used for full causal discovery and does not require the faithfulness or causal sufficiency assumptions.

A theorem is given that under the assumptions made, Granger causality is equivalent to true causation. The approach then proceeds by choosing a target causal feature, fitting parameters and testing significance of the parameters.

The approach is empirically evaluated on a semisynthetic dataset (Dream3) and is one of the top performing methods in 3/5 of the experiments.

### Strengths
1) The approach is very novel to the best of my knowledge

2) If the theorem that under the given setting, Granger causality is equivalent to true causation is correct (I am unable to check the proof of this theorem in the appendix), then the approach is sound

3) Background and related work are extensively reviewed

### Weaknesses
1) Generally speaking, the paper is hard to follow and the goals of the proposed method are unclear given the entire paper. The approach is motivated as to be for (time-varying) causal feature selection for a target variable. However, it is claimed in the paper that it can also be used for full causal discovery, but it's not clear the evaluation is for either causal feature selection or full causal discovery.

2) The task performed in the evaluation section is not described at all. Presumably the task should be causal feature selection, but all the reader is told is the metric used for evaluation is AUC, which doesn't sound like we're evaluating the correct set of causal features. Furthermore, the methods used in the evaluation section do not appear to be causal feature selection methods and are different from the related methods mentioned earlier in the paper. 

3) Aside from the above confusion about the evaluation section, the empirical work is minimal in general and standard errors are not included.

### Questions
1) Can the authors explain the evaluation task? Is it causal feature selection? What is the actual target that AUC is reported for?

2) How is the time-varying nature accounted for in the evaluation?

3) Why are the baselines in the evaluation section different from the methods mentioned in the introduction for the problem the method is proposed for? Has the approach been compared to the other causal feature selection methods mentioned earlier in the paper?

4) Why are standard errors missing form the baselines? Is the improvement significant?

5) Is there a limitation when extending the approach to the full causal discovery setting?
