## Abstract
In nature, the behaviors of many complex systems can be described by parsimonious math equations. Automatically distilling these equations from limited data is cast as a symbolic regression process which hitherto remains a grand challenge. Keen efforts in recent years have been placed on tackling this issue and demonstrated success in symbolic regression. However, there still exist bottlenecks that current methods struggle to break when the discrete search space tends toward infinity and especially when the underlying math formula is intricate. To this end, we propose a novel Reinforcement Symbolic Regression Machine (RSRM) that masters the capability of uncovering complex math equations from only scarce data. The RSRM model is composed of three key modules: (1) a Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS) agent that explores optimal math expression trees consisting of pre-defined math operators and variables, (2) a Double Q-learning block that helps reduce the feasible search space of MCTS via properly understanding the distribution of reward, and (3) a modulated sub-tree discovery block that heuristically learns and defines new math operators to improve representation ability of math expression trees. Biding of these modules yields the state-of-the-art performance of RSRM in symbolic regression as demonstrated by multiple sets of benchmark examples. The RSRM model shows clear superiority over several representative baseline models.

2: You are willing to defend your assessment, but it is quite likely that you did not understand the central parts of the submission or that you are unfamiliar with some pieces of related work. Math/other details were not carefully checked.

### Summary
This paper proposes Reinforcement Symbolic Regression Machine (RSRM), a symbolic regression method that combines reinforcement learning (RL), genetic programming (GP), and a novel modulated sub-tree discovery block. RSRM alternates between a reinforcement learning stage that searches for the optimal expression tree using double Q-learning and MCTS and a GP stage that refines the expression trees. At the end of each epoch, MSDS discovers new expression forms that reduce the search space for subsequent steps. RSRM demonstrates superior performance over baselines across a suite of symbolic regression datasets.

### Strengths
- The idea of combining RL and GP is a novel contribution. Using double Q-learning in junction with MCTS effectively reduces the search space. This is further enhanced by discovering new expression forms in MSDB.
- The method achieves strong performance across a suite of datasets, outperforming baselines in terms of expression recovery rate.
- The authors conducted extensive ablation studies to validate the effectiveness of each component in contributing to the overall performance.

### Weaknesses
- There is a limited set of hand-designed expression forms, which restricts the applicability of the method to other domains.
- It is a bit illusive how SR can be applied to practical domains.

### Questions
- Can you elaborate on each step in figure 1? The way it's presented now makes it hard to understand.
- What are some practical domains that SR is useful in? In particular, what are some scenarios where SR outperforms neural network regression?

### Summary
This paper studies the problem of discovering math equations in real-world complex systems. The authors propose a Reinforcement Symbolic Regression Machine (RSRM) that masters the capability of uncovering complex math equations from scarce data.  Experiments demonstrate the proposed method outperforms baselines on various benchmarks.

### Strengths
1.	The paper is well-written and easy to follow.
2.	Experiments demonstrate the proposed method outperforms baselines on various benchmarks.

### Weaknesses
1.	The novelty of the proposed method is unclear. The proposed method seems to be a simple combination of existing methods, including the monte carlo tree search (MCTS) algorithm, double q-learning method, and genetic programming method.
2.	The motivation and advantages of the proposed method over previous work are unclear.
3.	The authors claim that they use a MCTS agent for exploration. However, I found that they use greedy selection rather than exploration based on the upper confidence bound, which is a key component for efficient exploration in MCTS. Thus, whether the MCTS agent can explore the environment efficiently is unconvincing. 
4.	The proposed modulated sub-tree discovery incorporate three specific search forms into the algorithm. However, the three forms may be too specific to be generally applicable to complex real-world problems.
5.	The authors evaluate the generalization ability of their method in a toy environment. It would be more convincing if the authors could conduct the generalization experiments on more complex real-world problems.

### Confidence
3: You are fairly confident in your assessment. It is possible that you did not understand some parts of the submission or that you are unfamiliar with some pieces of related work. Math/other details were not carefully checked.

### Summary
This paper proposes a new symbolic regression discovery method that uses Monte Carlo Tree Search for exploration, Double Q-Learning for exploitation, and a sub-tree discovery block to capture equation decompositions. All three components combined in their method named Reinforcement Symbolic Regression Machine, appear to achieve state-of-the-art results on a diverse range of standard symbolic regression benchmarks.

### Strengths
* The proposed approach appears novel and is well-placed in the relevant literature. The introduction does an excellent job of introducing the related work in a concise setting.
* The paper is well-written and easy to follow.
* The approach was empirically demonstrated to achieve state-of-the-art performance across the existing SR benchmark tasks and problem sets.
* The appendix is detailed and extensive, adding further empirical evidence to the core claims.

### Weaknesses
* There are no theoretical results to verify the proposed approach. However, the method does obtain strong empirical performance.
* Page 3, top. $c$ is undefined. It could perhaps be helpful to state what $c$ is in the UCT algorithm or provide a reference to either another paper or a forward reference to where it is defined.
* Page 5, "we find that Gaussian random numbers with a unit mean and variance provide more effective initial values for optimization.". There seems to be no empirical evidence in the paper supporting this. Although you may have results for this, it could be helpful for the reader if you included an additional Appendix experiment and linked it to this statement as the empirical evidence for this.
* There are no error bars for the main results tables, Table 1, Table 2, and Table 3.
* In Table S7, only 12 AI Feynman equations are used, whereas the original AI Feynman paper proposes 100 AI Feynman equations. Why were these 12 AI Feynman equations used, and is it possible to provide results for the complete set of AI Feynman equations?


Typos:
* Page 5: Splitting by Addition paragraph: "Expand" -> "Expanding"
* Page 5: Splitting by Addition paragraph: "Split" -> "Splitting"
* Page 5: Splitting by Addition paragraph: "converts" -> "convert"
* Page 5: Splitting by Addition paragraph: ", then transforms" -> ", and then transforms"

### Questions
* Can you define $c$ in the UCT algorithm in the text when you introduce it?
* Can you provide empirical evidence for the statement of "we find that Gaussian random numbers with a unit mean and variance provide more effective initial values for optimization.", perhaps in an additional appendix?
* Can you highlight why only 12 AI Feynman equations were used and possibly include results for all the AI Feynman equations in the AI Feynman problem set?

### Questions
- (Abstract) "In nature, the behaviors". Consider changing to "In nature, the behavior"
- (Abstract) "Automatically distilling these equations from limited data is cast as a symbolic regression (SR)". This sentence is confusing. Symbolic Regression **is** the task of distilling equations from data. The sentence gives the impression that SR is something else and that the authors are using SR to solve that something else. Please clarify.
- (Abstract) "The discrete search space tends toward infinity". This statement is not mathematically rigorous. The search space in SR (with variable length expressions) is always infinite. Do the authors mean the complexity of the search space? How do they measure it? Please clarify.
- (Introduction) "The early process of fitting expressions involves". What do the authors mean by "early process"? Are they taking a historical perspective of the field? If so, please clarify.
- (Introduction) " By incorporating double Q- learning into MCTS, we effectively address issues of overfitting and generate new expressions". How does Q-learning address overfitting? Please clarify. What do the authors mean with "generate new expressions"? Any other SR method is "generating new expressions" as well.
- (Method) " we introduce an interpolation method (e.g., data pre-processing)". What do the authors mean by "interpolation method" and how is "data pre-processing" related to it? Please clarify.
- (Method) "the MSDB examines whether the few expressions that perform well adhere to a specific form. For instance, if both $\exp(x) − x$ and $\exp(x) + x$ yield favorable results, the expression can be confirmed as $\exp(x) − f(x)$, thereby allowing us to focus on finding $f(x)$" How do the authors determine what "perform well" means? I can understand the intuition of the authors: if both $\exp(x) − x$ and $\exp(x) + x$ yield favorable results, then the expression must be close to the middle of both expressions, i.e., $\exp(x)$. However, it seems to me that how to determine the threshold in the fitting error to determine what "perform well" means is not clear. Is this threshold the same for all datasets? If not how is it determined? Please clarify.
- (Method) "This approach effectively reduces the difficulty associated with specific equations." This statement is not clear. Please clarify.
- (Expression Tree) "The underlying objective of SR is to transform the given task into the generation of an optimal expression tree". This statement is not clear. Which task is SR transforming into the generation of an optimal expression tree? Please clarify.
- (Modulated sub-tree discovery) "This search form focuses on identifying expressions of the form like ex − x and ex + x." What do the authors mean by "search form"? Please clarify.
- (Modulated sub-tree discovery) "In this search form, we obtain good expressions such as 1.57ex and 1.56ex + x,". The concept of "search form" and the use of "..in this search form" is not clear. Is search form a synonym of "search space"? Please clarify.
- (Modulared sub-tree discovery) "The complete from-discovery algorithm, ". There is a typo in "from-discovery". Please fix.
- (Results) How many expressions were evaluated in each algorithm? Is this the same number for all algorithms? This is very important to assess the computational complexity of the algorithm proposed. Please clarify.
