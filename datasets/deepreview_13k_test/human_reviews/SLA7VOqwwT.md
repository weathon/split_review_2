- Decision: Reject
- Scores: 5, 5, 5, 5

## Abstract
Uncertainty estimation is crucial for deep learning models to detect out-of-distribution (OOD) inputs. However, the naive deep learning classifiers produce uncalibrated uncertainty for OOD data. Improving the uncertainty estimation typically requires external data for OOD-aware training or considerable costs to build an ensemble. 
In this work, we improve on uncertainty estimation without extra OOD data or additional inference costs using an alternative \textit{Split-Ensemble} method. 
Specifically, we propose a novel \textit{subtask-splitting} ensemble training objective where a task is split into several complementary subtasks based on feature similarity. Each subtask considers part of the data as in-distribution while all the rest as OOD data. 
Diverse submodels can therefore be trained on each subtask with OOD-aware objectives, learning generalizable uncertainty estimation.
To avoid overheads, we enable low-level feature sharing among submodels, building a tree-like Split-Ensemble architecture via iterative splitting and pruning. 
Empirical study shows Split-Ensemble, without additional computational cost, improves accuracy over a single model by 0.8\%, 1.8\%, and 25.5\% on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and Tiny-ImageNet, respectively. OOD detection for the same backbone and in-distribution datasets surpasses a single model baseline by 2.2\%, 8.1\%, and 29.6\% in mean AUROC, respectively.

### Summary
The paper proposes a method to train a “Split-Ensemble” model for detection of OOD inputs. The main idea is to split classes into (semantically related) groups and train a submodel on each group. Further,

- Submodels are trained to correctly classify a (disjoint) subset of classes plus an additional OOD class that refers to the rest of the classes (i.e., those in the subsets of other submodels).

- Submodels share a backbone and a method is proposed to branch out from the backbone using sensitivity criteria until each submodel has an individual branch.

- Submodels are “calibrated” so that classification may be performed as argmax of concatenated logits. 

Experimental results on CIFAR-10/100, Tiny-ImageNet and other datasets (used as OOD data) show that:
- The proposed model has better accuracy than a single model and some ensemble models with 4 members.

- The proposed model has better OOD detection (e.g., in terms of AUROC) than a sigle model and a 4-member ensemble.

### Strengths
**S1.** The method is well motivated and the presentation is easy to follow.

**S2.** The method shows a level of measurable success.

### Weaknesses
**W1.** Some key aspects of the method are not discussed properly nor validated theoretically or experimentally. For example:
- How is the OOD detection criteria probabilistically sound?

- When a split is decided it is not stated what architecture and parameters are used for the new branches.

- The experiments on subtask grouping are in the appendix and are not specified in detail.

- There is a predefined computation budget that is also not specified.

**W2.** Important recent baselines and benchmarks were not discussed or incorporated. For example, (Yang et al. ICCV21) and (Wang et al. ICML22). The current set of benchmarks and baselines do not represent the more performant or challenging cases.

**W3.** For the OOD detection experiments it is not specified how the OOD detection threshold was determined for each model.

### Questions
Besides looking for some reply to the issues noted above,

**Q1.** Like other OOD detection methods, this method does not seem to address the issue of the distribution of OOD data being unknown. What would the authors say with regards to this in relation to the method and the reported results?

### Summary
This paper proposed an ensemble based method for out-of-distribution detection (OOD). Specifically, the original classification task is split into several sub-tasks trained on ID data but with OOD aware class targets. One model is trained for each sub-task. A weight split and pruning strategy is proposed to reduce the computational cost. In the inference stage, probabilities produced by each model is concatenated and a sample is considered OOD if all the probabilities are below some threshold.

### Strengths
1. The idea of using task-splitting on ID data to train an ensemble for OOD is interesting.

### Weaknesses
1. The effectiveness of the proposed method is not convincingly evaluated as benchmarking experiments are not enough. Table 1: benchmarking results on CIFAR-10 and TinyIMNET are missing; numbers reported for Deep Ensemble ON CIFAR-10 are problematic as it should not underperform single network; Table 2: lacking benchmarking with SOTA methods.

### Questions
1. How to determine the optimal number of task splits? It seems that using a larger number of sub-tasks increase AUROC, but the computational cost is also increased.
2. How can the method be applied to OOD detection in object detection and semantic segmentation?

### Summary
In this paper, a new method, Split-Ensemble, is proposed to improve the accuracy and OOD detection of a single model by splitting a multi-classification task into multiple complementary subtasks. And a dynamic segmentation and pruning algorithm based on relevance and sensitivity is proposed to construct a more efficient tree-like Split-Ensemble model, which performs well on several experiments.

### Strengths
1.	An innovative approach to task segmentation and model partitioning is proposed, which can improve the performance and reliability of a single model without increasing the computational overhead.
2.	The data distribution information in the original task is effectively utilized to achieve the goal of OOD-aware training without external data.
3.	An automated segmentation and pruning algorithm is designed that dynamically adjusts the model structure according to the correlation and sensitivity between subtasks.
4.	Full experiments on multiple publicly available datasets demonstrate that the Split-Ensemble approach outperforms baseline.

### Weaknesses
1.	There is no adequate theoretical analysis and discussion of the principles of subtask segmentation, and there is no explanation of how to choose the optimal number of subtasks and the way to divide the categories.
2.	Lack of detailed explanation of the definition and importance of OOD-awareness in some sections
3.	No experiments are conducted on more complex or larger datasets, and there is relatively little in the way of discussion of the limitations of its approach and potential directions for improvement.

### Questions
1.	In the introductory section on page 1, please enhance the background on uncertainty estimation
2.	Does the subtask splitting mentioned in the text take into account the category imbalance? Please give a clarification.
3.	The visualization in the experimental section is low, it is suggested to add
4.	Please describe in one paragraph the structure of your Split-Ensemble model in detail, including the detailed construction of each submodel
5.	For the evaluation of the model, could you provide more description of the evaluation metrics, such as the definition and calculation of AUROC?
6.	Please derive equations (1) and (2) in detail to help the reader better understand your thinking
7.	In the concluding section, could there be a more detailed discussion of future directions of work or potential applications of this methodology?
8.	Throughout the paper, could an additional time complexity analysis of the method be considered?

### Summary
This paper proposed a subtask-splitting ensemble training objective to enhance the  out of distribution(ood) detection as well as estimate the uncertainty. In detail, the authors split the original classification task into several complementary subtasks. When we focuses on one subtask, data from the other subtasks can be considered as ood data. Then the training scheme can take both id and ood task into consideration. In addition, the authors propose a tree-like Split-Ensemble architecture that splits and prunes the networks  based on one shared backbone to extract low level features. To verify the proposed method, the authors conduct experiments on several image classification datasets such as CIFAR10 CIFAR100 and Tiny-ImageNet. The classification results on id data has an enhancement in terms of classification accuracy. According to the ood detection criterion, the ood detection ability seems to improve significantly.

### Strengths
The authors offer us a clear presentation for the proposed method. And the idea is quite interesting, it can be considered as use multi task and domain classifier to enhance the performance. This paper presents the whole detail of the training scheme clearly including dealing with the class imbalance and splitting the subtasks. For the splitting and pruning process, the authors propose a novel splitting criterion and utilize global pruning to reduce the model size. To verify the proposed method, extensive experiments are conducted. For the proposed ood setting, the enhancement of the proposed method is very significant. Further analysis of the task splitting is also present.

### Weaknesses
1 For table 1, the authors present us the classification results on several datasets including CIFAR10, CIFAR100 and Tiny ImageNet. For CIFAR10, the proposed method is slightly better than single models. But the deep ensemble has a significant drop. However on CIFAR100, deep ensemble enhance the performance significantly. It is weird. In addition, the proposed method can optimize the network structure, to give a more complete comparison,  other methods focusing on search structures could be considered for comparison. 

2 The performance on Tiny-ImageNet is very significant, could the authors show us the performance on ImageNet. If the proposed method can have significant improvement on ImageNet, it can be exciting.

3 For ood detection, could the authors use commonly used dataset for ood detection or report the performance of other ood detection methods on your setting?

4 For related works, it would be better for the authors to add some works about split-based structure search such as [1]-[3]
