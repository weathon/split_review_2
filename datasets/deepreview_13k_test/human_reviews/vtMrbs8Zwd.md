# The Effects of Overparameterization on Sharpness-aware Minimization: An Empirical and Theoretical Analysis

- Decision: Reject
- Scores: 8, 6, 6, 3

## Abstract
Training an overparameterized neural network can yield minimizers of the same level of training loss and yet different generalization capabilities. With evidence that indicates a correlation between sharpness of minima and their generalization errors, increasing efforts have been made to develop an optimization method to explicitly find flat minima as more generalizable solutions.
This sharpness-aware minimization (SAM) strategy, however, has not been studied much yet as to how overparameterization can actually affect its behavior.
In this work, we analyze SAM under varying degrees of overparameterization and present both empirical and theoretical results that suggest a critical influence of overparameterization on SAM.
Specifically, we first use standard techniques in optimization to prove that SAM can achieve a linear convergence rate under overparameterization in a stochastic setting.
We also show based on a stability analysis that the solutions found by SAM are indeed flatter and have more uniformly distributed Hessian moments compared to those of SGD.
These results are corroborated with our experiments that reveal a consistent trend that the generalization improvement made by SAM continues to increase as the model becomes more overparameterized.
We further present that sparsity can open up an avenue for effective overparameterization in practice.

### Rating
8

### Rating Number
8

### Confidence
3: You are fairly confident in your assessment. It is possible that you did not understand some parts of the submission or that you are unfamiliar with some pieces of related work. Math/other details were not carefully checked.

### Summary
This paper studies sharpness-aware minimization under differing levels of overparameterization. The authors obtain linear convergence and stability of the obtained minima in the interpolating regime, under standard smoothness and PL conditions. An extensive numerical section verifies the practical utility of the theoretical results, and further investigates the effects of sparsification as a method to alleviate computational burden.

### Strengths
This appears to be a solid paper, recovering versions of results for SGD for a relevant related problem. The paper is generally well written and presented.

### Weaknesses
Further discussion on the non-monotonicity encountered in the experimental section would be useful. Reference to where and when the model starts to interpolate the data, as well as how the peaks in relative accuracy and accuracy correspond to these or others points the authors may have observed to be relevant, would be interesting.

### Summary
In this paper, they empirically and theoretically show the effect of overparameterization on SAM. By defining interpolation in terms of overparameterization, they demonstrate that SAM converges at a linear rate under such conditions. Additionally, they illustrate that SAM can achieve flatter minima than SGD. Varying the number of parameters, they empirically show the effect of overparameterization.

### Strengths
This paper presents mathematical theories to verify the impact of overparameterization on SAM and the relationship between SGD and SAM.

### Weaknesses
Minor weaknesses in the paper include typos, as observed in Figure 4 where image captions and labels do not match (e.g., (a,b) → (a), (c,d) → (b)). Additionally, to enhance clarity, it's advisable to consider indexing terms more carefully. For instance, changing 's_i for i-th moment' to 's_k for k-th moment' on page 4 may help avoid confusion.

### Questions
I think the assumptions to be rather stringent: for example, requiring $\beta$-smoothness for each individual point. Is that assumption based on the model's overparameterization? Is there any justification for the assumption?
As I understand it, as the number of parameters increases, the model needs to be smoother, which should lead to an increase in the optimal perturbation bound. However, in Figure 5(c), the optimal rho decreases when the number of parameters is 14.8m. Is there any explanation for this phenomenon?

### Summary
The authors begin with an analysis of the convergence of SAM, and establish a convergence result for SAM with stochastic gradients by using a smoothness condition which ensures that SAM updates are similar enough to SGD updates for SGD convergence bounds to apply. They then characterize the stability condition for SAM in terms of moments of the stochastic loss Hessian. They conclude with experimental evidence that SAM is more useful for larger models (mixed results for vision transformer), and also is useful for sparsified models.

### Strengths
The basic theoretical analysis is clean and easy to follow. In particular Equation 7 breaking down the stability condition into necessary conditions on different moments provides a lot of intuition about how SAM might shape network training. Additionally, the experiments relating scaling of models to usefulness of SAM are, to my knowledge, novel, and I find them interesting. Though the results are more complicated in the case of ViT and ResNet without weight decay, they suggest that this is an area that merits further investigation.

### Weaknesses
The basic convergence rate analysis for SAM seems correct but is not very compelling; these types of convergence bounds seem to be far from the rates in practice.

Regarding the experimental results: it is not clear if the effects are due to the networks pushing into the interpolation regime. For example in the MNIST and CIFAR examples, the number of parameters is much larger than the number of datapoints for most of the examples, but the gap does not develop until well into this regime. I have listed some questions about this phenomenology below; I believe some more detail on this point could make the paper significantly stronger.

Update: After significant engagment by the authors in the review period, some of the weaknesses have been addressed, and I updated my review score.

### Questions
It would be helpful to define $f_i$ and its relationship to $f$ more explicitly.

How does batch size play a role in the analysis and the various theorems?

The paper claims that as models become more overparameterized, SAM becomes more useful. What is the evidence that the models in the experiments are distinct in their level of overparameterization? What fraction of them are reaching interpolating minima? How close are any of the settings to the NTK regime?

One interesting experiment could be to train a networks with a fixed number of parameters, but which is closer to or further from the linearized regime (using techniques from [1] and [2]), with and without SAM, and seeing if SAM is more helpful in the linearized regime or not. This could provide another insight on whether or not overparameterization itself is the cause for the differences in effectiveness.

4: You are confident in your assessment, but not absolutely certain. It is unlikely, but not impossible, that you did not understand some parts of the submission or that you are unfamiliar with some pieces of related work.

### Summary
This paper presents some theoretical results on the convergence and linear stability of SAM, as well as experimental verification.

### Strengths
The paper shows that SAM can be flatter than SGD, which is good.

### Weaknesses
- First, the theoretical results do not seem to be that new or involved, and the proofs are mostly standard. That can be fine if new insights are uncovered in the paper, but the overall message of the paper is not surprising, and the flatness of SAM solutions is well-studied.

- I also do not understand why overparameterization is stressed so much in the paper, while no result really seems to use overparameterization. I can only see PL condition and overparameterization are discussed, but that is a very hand-wavy discussion. If authors are using a specific result, they should properly refer.

### Questions
How does the results of the paper compare to linearization study of https://arxiv.org/pdf/2302.09693.pdf?
