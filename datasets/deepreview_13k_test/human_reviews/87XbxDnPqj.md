# Gradient Descent Provably Solves Nonlinear Tomographic Reconstruction

## Abstract
In computed tomography (CT), the forward model consists of a linear Radon transform followed by an exponential nonlinearity based on the attenuation of light according to the Beer--Lambert Law. Conventional reconstruction often involves inverting this nonlinearity as a preprocessing step and then solving a convex inverse problem. However, this nonlinear measurement preprocessing required to use the Radon transform is poorly conditioned in the vicinity of high-density materials, such as metal. This preprocessing makes CT reconstruction methods numerically sensitive and susceptible to artifacts near high-density regions. 
In this paper, we study a technique where the signal is directly reconstructed from raw measurements through the nonlinear forward model.
Though this optimization is nonconvex, we show that gradient descent provably converges to the global optimum at a geometric rate, perfectly reconstructing the underlying signal with a near minimal number of random measurements. 
We also prove similar results in the under-determined setting where the number of measurements is significantly smaller than the dimension of the signal. This is achieved by enforcing prior structural information about the signal through constraints on the optimization variables.
We illustrate the benefits of direct nonlinear CT reconstruction with cone-beam CT experiments on synthetic and real 3D volumes. We show that this approach reduces metal artifacts compared to a commercial reconstruction of a human skull with metal dental crowns.

4: You are confident in your assessment, but not absolutely certain. It is unlikely, but not impossible, that you did not understand some parts of the submission or that you are unfamiliar with some pieces of related work.

### Summary
This article proposes a tomographic reconstruction method starting from the Beer-Lambert measurements on projections without linearisation. The resulting formulation is non-convex but the authors show its global optimum can be reached by gradient descent with high probability, with sufficient measurements, even in the presence of regularisation, which is the main result of the paper.

### Strengths
The paper is interesting and relatively easy to read. The approach is also fairly straightforward, although non-trivial, and it is surprising that is has not been attempted before. The mathematical and optimisation approach is well carried out.

### Weaknesses
Experiments are unconvincing, particularly Fig.2, where except around the high-density object (the crown), the quality of the linearised reconstruction is visibly better. Since the image is a phantom, a ground-truth should have been provided. The experiments on the Shepp-Logan phantom are too simple to be convincing.

Maybe this is due to a poor choice of hyper-parameter or a sub-optimal regulariser.

Reference code does not seem to be provided, limiting reproducibility.

### Questions
- How could you improve the fuzziness of Fig.2 ? This is essential because the current result does not sell your method well.
- There are many other non-linear aspect to real tomography, for example the phenomenon of beam hardening (BH), due to the fact that the X-ray source is not monochromatic and that lower-energy photons are absorbed more than higher-energy ones. Can you carry over some of your methodology to reduce the artefacts caused by BH?
- Could you compare with other non-linear tomography approaches.

### Rating
3

### Rating Number

### Confidence
2: You are willing to defend your assessment, but it is quite likely that you did not understand the central parts of the submission or that you are unfamiliar with some pieces of related work. Math/other details were not carefully checked.

### Summary
The paper studies a nonlinear CT reconstruction model and provides global convergence for the proposed algorithms for unregularized and regularized problems. To justify the theoretical results, experiments are conducted on one synthetic data set and one real cone-beam CT data set. Some related works and further discussions are presented.

### Strengths
Detailed convergence analysis for the proposed algorithms would be the major strength. Besides, numerical experiments on CT data sets are conducted to justify the theoretical results.

### Weaknesses
1. The paper does not seem to use the standard ICLR paper template. 
2. Regularization techniques have been widely used in solving inverse problems to address the ill-posedness. It is not clear about the contributions and novelty of the proposed approaches. 
3. In the experiments, there are no other related works for comparison. So, it is hard to see whether the proposed performance is standing out.

### Questions
Why was the regularization term in the objective function in (2.3) recast as an inequality constraint in (4.1)? Will they give two different solutions? In addition, how was $x$ in (4.1) selected/constructed?

### Summary
The authors consider the computed tomography (CT) reconstruction problem. Specifically, they consider a case with strong reflectors in the scene of interest (like a metal implant). When such materials are present, they argue that a preprocessing step that is normally used to obtain a linear inverse problem is not numerically stable. In contrast, they propose to solve the resulting non-convex problem directly through gradient descent. They show that, if the observation matrix were a sample from a Gaussian distribution, and if the number of measurements exceed a lower bound, with high probability, gradient descent converges to the true solution at a geometric rate.
They also extend the results to the case where the number of measurements are fewer but this reduction is compensated by a regularizer that captures the structure in the family of signals that the solution belongs to.
In an experiments section, they compare their proposed reconstructions against the linearized model (where the Fourier-slice theorem applies).

### Strengths
The paper is clear, well-written, and points to a relevant sub-problem in CT reconstruction. They show that a simple approach like gradient descent, targeting a relatively simple reconstruction formulation, can provably solve the original problem under certain constraints. They also extend their results to the case where the number of measurements are reduced at the expense of making certain assumptions about the signal of interest, and come up with clear statements that they can prove. Reducing the number of measurements in CT is always welcome as that reduces the amount of radiation the patient is subjected to.

### Weaknesses
The assumptions made by Theorems 1 and 2, which form the main contribution of the paper do not match well the CT measurement setup. Specifically, in CT, the beams are well-structured, and if we consider the image of a beam, it does not resemble at all a sample from a 2D Gaussian field. Therefore, it's not clear to me how much the results on provable convergence carry over. If the authors can show or argue that the local pseudo-convexity property (in some reasonable neighborhood of the solution) carries over to the deterministic concentrated-beam setting, the connection with CT would be stronger. Since the paper is not concerned with proposing a non-obvious algorithm but proving the usefulness of a rather well-known algorithm, this is a serious shortcoming.

Less importantly, the experiments are not entirely convincing -- I think reconstructions with the linear model could have been improved by including regularizers.

### Questions
Here are some comments/questions, some of which are minor.

1. Page 2, "We propose a Gaussian model of eqn 1.2" : Please clarify what you mean by a Gaussian model? I guess you're referring to modelling $a_i$ to be samples of a Gaussian field, but that's not clear at all at this stage.

2. Page 2, beginning of Section 2, "(1) we model $a_i$ as a standard Gaussian..." : This strongly contradicts the opening sentence of Section 2, where you mention "$a_i$ are sparse, nonnegative, highly structured, dependent on $i$". What is the motivation behind this modelling? Is it mainly to obtain provable results? I understand some deviation from an accurate model, but this is taking it a bit extreme.

3. The second sentence of Definition 2 ("Throughout...") doesn't look like it's part of the definition.

4. Page 5, footnote 1 : It's worth bringing in to the main text and clarifying what $m$ should exceed.

5. In general, I would welcome concrete typical values for the constants $c_i$ that appear in theorems, for specific cases/resolution.

6. Section 5.1 : Can you actually expect to see inside the metal? Here, I think the regularizer plays a more crucial role. What happens if you were to use a regularized formulation but with a linear measurement model (e.g., using one of the iterative solvers like FISTA)?
