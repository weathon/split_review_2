- Decision: Accept
- Scores: 8, 3, 8

## Abstract
\noindent We introduce \odeformer{}, the first transformer able to infer multidimensional ordinary differential equation (ODE) systems in symbolic form from the observation of a single solution trajectory. We perform extensive evaluations on two datasets: (i) the existing `Strogatz' dataset featuring two-dimensional systems; (ii) \odebench{}, a collection of one- to four-dimensional systems that we carefully curated from the literature to provide a more holistic benchmark. \odeformer{} consistently outperforms existing methods while displaying substantially improved robustness to noisy and irregularly sampled observations, as well as faster inference. We release our code, model and benchmark dataset publicly.

4: You are confident in your assessment, but not absolutely certain. It is unlikely, but not impossible, that you did not understand some parts of the submission or that you are unfamiliar with some pieces of related work.

### Summary
The paper studies the problem of symbolic regression for dynamical systems, specifically ODE, with the use of transformers. Apart from the adjustments need to use a transformer based model for this task, authors also propose a new benchmark. This is claimed to be more diverse and larger than existing ones. Empirically, the proposed method is shown to outperform existing baseline methods in terms of reconstruction as well as generalization.

### Strengths
The paper is extremely well-written (including notations, clearly stating contributions, etc.), very well motivated and the proposed method is shown to achieve state of the art performance.

The placement within existing literature is very well articulated.

Since, authors propose a benchmark, it is appreciated that the data generation procedure is outlined precisely.

The section on filtering of the data to avoid rapidly converging and divergent systems is worth mentioning, details like these make a benchmark standout.

Tokenization, embedding process and encoding of the symbolic functions is very well justified.

Baseline methods have been chosen appropriately and the empirical evidence is very convincing.

### Weaknesses
The authors have mentioned a few of their limitations, which is great. 

While authors mention the presence of a very related work "Becker, Sören, et al. "Predicting Ordinary Differential Equations with Transformers." (2023).", I am not sure why they do not elucidate the difference between the paper mentioned and their proposed method, why is this method not used as a baseline? There is no attempt to illustrate the difference at all.

I have another point which I would like to bring up with the authors regarding the generation of the data, specifically the way it is being integrated. As mentioned (and I think this is reasonable as a first step) the authors using fixed homogeneous grid to integrate, and it is claimed that number of points don't matter during inference (Figure 3), is this indeed an artifact of the way the data is generated. How do the results change when the integration procedure is altered, it would be great to have the authors comment on this issue.

Please see questions section for further.

### Questions
1) Please compare and contrast the proposed method with the work "Becker, Sören, et al. "Predicting Ordinary Differential Equations with Transformers." (2023).". As acknowledged that this is closely related, it should be clearly articulated what are the differences. The mentioning of difference between univariate and multivariate is okay, but this needs more explanation. I strongly believe this should be a baseline for comparison in some setting.

2) How should one think about inferring PDE with a variant of this framework, can we have a discussion around this as part of limitation if that is the case? 

3) The learning from multiple trajectories, doesn't seem to give promising performance, do authors have comments on explaining this behavior?

4) For the noise corruption of the data, the authors have tried out adding Gaussian noise and dropping samples uniformly at random. Can authors comment on missing chunks of data instead. This might be of practical implication in certain cases, where the data collection mechanism (sensor) went faulty for some time before resuming activity.

### Summary
ODEFormer, a transformer model designed for dynamical symbolic regression. This model is capable of inferring multidimensional ordinary differential equation (ODE) systems from noisy and irregularly sampled data. It utilizes a pre-trained sequence-to-sequence transformer on synthetic data to generate symbolic expressions directly from observations. The paper also introduces ODEBench, a benchmark dataset for dynamical symbolic regression, comprising 63 ODEs sourced from the literature, modeling real-world phenomena across dimensions one to four, including chaotic systems.

The reviewer further highlights the evaluation and comparison of ODEFormer with existing methods. It assesses ODEFormer's performance on both the established Strogatz dataset and the new ODEBench dataset. The comparison encompasses various techniques based on genetic programming, regression, and Monte Carlo methods.

### Strengths
The introduction of ODEFormer represents a novel framework that serves the purpose of generating ordinary differential equations (ODEs) specifically designed for testing dynamical systems. This innovative approach allows researchers and practitioners to create ODE models that can accurately capture and represent the dynamics of real-world systems, providing a valuable tool for testing and understanding the behavior of complex dynamical systems.

ODEFormer introduces a pioneering use case for transformers in the realm of ODEs. Traditionally, transformers are employed in natural language processing and sequential data tasks. However, in this context, they are harnessed to directly infer ODE systems from noisy and irregularly sampled data. This expansion of transformer applications into the domain of ODEs signifies a breakthrough, offering a versatile and data-driven approach for modeling and analyzing complex dynamic systems, and opening up new possibilities for the fusion of machine learning techniques with physics-based modeling.

### Weaknesses
One notable limitation in the presented work is the absence of comparisons with benchmarks employed in previous studies, such as the widely recognized benchmark datasets used in Neural ODE (Chen et al). This absence makes it challenging to gauge how the proposed ODEFormer framework performs in comparison to existing approaches on well-established and widely accepted testing scenarios.

The demonstrated applicability of ODEFormer on toy datasets represents another potential limitation. Toy datasets are typically simplistic and may not fully capture the complexity and variability encountered in real-world applications. Therefore, the extent to which ODEFormer can effectively handle and model more complex, real-world data remains an open question and warrants further investigation and validation on diverse and challenging datasets.

### Questions
One key aspect that warrants further exploration is the practical application of the technique on real-world datasets. While the framework shows promise in artificially constructed datasets, its effectiveness in solving real-world problems, where data can be noisy, irregularly sampled, and complex, remains to be demonstrated. Evaluating its performance on non-artificial, real-world datasets across various domains, such as finance, healthcare, or environmental monitoring, would provide valuable insights into its applicability and limitations in practical scenarios.

Time series data indeed represents a compelling use case for the framework. Time series forecasting is a critical application in various fields, including finance, energy, and climate modeling. Therefore, it is crucial to investigate the applicability of this method in a time series forecasting modeling scenario. Demonstrating its effectiveness in accurately modeling and predicting time-dependent data can significantly enhance its practical utility and establish its relevance in solving real-world, dynamic data challenges.

### Summary
The authors proposed a model for discovering the governing law of dynamical systems out of observed trajectory. The model treats trajectories as sequences of tokenized numbers and utilizes a transformer network to learn the symbolic form of governing laws from them. The authors conduct the experiment on 1D to 4D systems, and the proposed method outperforms the baseline methods.

### Strengths
(1) The paper is well motivated, as discovering the symbolic form of governing laws from observed data has always been the focus of scientific research.

(2) The paper contributes to neural network models for symbolic regression of ordinary differential equations.

### Weaknesses
(1)	The idea in this paper is not novel enough. The idea of transformer-based symbolic regression on tokenized sequences was previously reported[1]. The proposed model shares the same network structure but is applied to ordinary differential equation data. However, no analysis could be found in the paper on how the network is adapted to this new type of data.

(2)	Figures and explanations of the proposed model are way too rough and lack the necessary details.

(3)	This paper lacks crucial detail on dataset separation and the definition of tasks in the experiment section.

### Questions
(1)	Could the authors give a detailed description and specific form of the loss function used during training? Is it symbolic or numerical? If the loss function is symbolic, does it measure the similarity between the symbolic tree structure or simply between the sequences? And as the ground-truth equations can be organized in different orders under both forms, which one of them is chosen in practice, and what are the reasons for refusing other possible sequences/trees?

(2)	As the authors claimed in section 2, most existing approaches of symbolic regression require a separate optimization for each new observed system. However, it is unclear in the paper whether or not the proposed model needs separate optimization on unseen systems as previous models do. Could you add some analysis on this problem and provide reasons and results to support your arguments?

(3)	The authors conduct subsampling in the experiment part and compare model performances under different subsampling rates. Could you explain further what condition in practice the subsampling process corresponds to? And how does the proposed model deal with the resulting irregular time-interval as most sequence transformers are built to encode trajectories with regular time intervals?
