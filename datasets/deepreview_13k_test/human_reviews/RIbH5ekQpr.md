# IMP: Benchmarking Image Polysemy in Vision-Language Models

- Decision: Reject
- Scores: 5, 5, 8, 5, 3

## Abstract
Current vision-language models predominantly use contrastive losses to learn from the co-occurrence of image and text. While effective for certain tasks, this approach assumes semantic equivalence between these two modalities. This assumption runs counter to the diverse meanings that a single image can convey, which in turn may compromise visual understanding. To investigate the impact of this assumption, we introduce a novel dataset: $\textbf{IMP}$, designed to challenge and evaluate vision-language models on image polysemy. Our empirical results reveal that current models fall short in recognizing the multiple semantic dimensions of images, underscoring the need for more robust approaches for learning vision-language representations. Code and data will be made available on publication.

### Summary
The paper argues that current models are mostly trained on datasets where an image has a single caption and collects a dataset covering both descriptive and conceptual captions and each image could have multiple captions. Experiments show that current models struggle on the dataset even after fine-tuning.

### Strengths
Most prior work seeks to have cleaner and more descriptive captions; it is interesting to see efforts on including more conceptual captions.

The evaluation shows that current models struggle with retrieving more abstract and conceptual captions, which raises an interesting and challenging problem.

### Weaknesses
**A.** It seems that the “image polysemy” considered in this paper mainly means: the model should have the ability to match images to both “descriptive” and “conceptual” captions; previous datasets such as COCO contains mainly descriptive captions.

However, I am not fully convinced that the collected datasets have more “conceptual” captions than the web image-text data such as CC3M, since many of the captions in the dataset come from web data. The MPL2D also does not indicate that the collected dataset is more “conceptual”.

The only advantage of the dataset seems to be that it has multiple captions per image while CC3M/12M does not. But if the final goal is to teach a model to match an image to descriptive / conceptual captions, then it is not clear why it is necessary to have multiple captions per image for training; as long as CC3M has a lot of conceptual & descriptive captions, then the model can learn to retrieve both types captions. 
E.g., say there is a dataset A with 1K images each with 5 captions; suppose a dataset B with 5K images each with 1 caption. The captions in A and B are identical. Then I do not see the necessity of training on A if we have dataset B.

In sum, it would be better if the paper could illustrate either a) why / how the dataset has more diverse / conceptual captions than CC3M or b) the importance of having multiple captions per image. 

**B.** The experiments are not very insightful. While the problem of image polysemy is interesting, the paper simply evaluates/fine-tunes current models with image-text retrieval on the collected datasets. The take-away conclusion seems to be that the task is hard and larger models perform better. 
I would expect more analysis and discussions on why and how studying image polysemy could benefit future vision-language models and how to model such a phenomena. For example, does explicitly modeling image polysemy benefit other tasks that could require high-level conceptual understanding (e.g., understanding actions, events, memes, etc)?

**C.** For the image-to-text retrieval evaluation, how does this test model’s ability to handle image polysemy? If I understand it correctly, as each image has 5 matching captions, as long as the model retrieves 1 of the matching captions, then it is counted as correctly retrieved? Then the evaluation protocol does not test whether the model handles polysemy; if for most images, at least 1 of the captions is “descriptive”, then a model that only “understands” descriptive captions will still score high on image-to-text retrieval.

**D.** For comparing the dataset with CC3M/CC12M on MPL2D, why not treat the collected dataset as a single caption dataset (either downsample to one caption per image or just “duplicate” the images)? 

In addition, I am not sure about the takeaway message by comparing MPL2D: is higher MPL2D score better or lower score better? On the one hand, if there are more diverse / conceptual captions, the score is higher; on the other hand, if the captions are noisier, the score is also higher. Thus, a lower/higher score could be attributed to these two possible factors and we cannot make a conclusion.

### Summary
This paper proposes IMP, a dataset for image-text pairs in which texts capture polysemy: diverse types of correspondences between each image and its (multiple) captions. The main difference from previous datasets is the curation and inclusion of multiple non-descriptive and naturally-occuring captions for a single image. The paper also reports results on this benchmark on image and text retrieval tasks.

### Strengths
- S1: I think that the research question studied in this paper is significant and interesting. This benchmark would be really beneficial to the community. As far as I can tell, no benchmark like this exists. Previous benchmarks also suffer from losing images over time.

- S2: Overall, both the approach for collecting the dataset and experimental design are sound.

### Weaknesses
- W1: Analysis of this dataset can be improved significantly from what is reported in Table 1. My major concern is in the characterization of polysemy, which is not much beyond “non-descriptive”. For instance, does any kind of image-text correspondence ontology emerge? Perhaps this needs human classification of (a subset) captions into a pre-defined categories, or automatically clustering captions, etc. This is especially important since quantitatively MPL2D cannot distinguish noise from diversity. Finally, I would also like to see further statistics beyond word lengths (word clouds, token/type ratio, etc. that would lead us to have a clearer picture of how this dataset is more diverse than existing ones. 

- W2: The tasks that perform on this dataset are standard image- and text- retrieval tasks with zero-shot and fine-tuning evaluation. Further, an adaptation of models that address image polysemy does not lead to improved performance (see, e.g., SE models in Table 4). These experiments are a good start but the paper would be stronger with additional tasks that focus on measuring model’s capability in addressing polysemy such as image captioning generation given a “caption sense”.

- W3: Besides improving the analysis in W1 above, the discussion of image-text datasets can also be further expanded to include additional datasets in the analysis, including RedCaps and SBU captions. 

- W4: Clarity on the data collection process is quite obscure (under Table 4). IMO, it is important to include the details on the database used to retrieve captions (CC3M and CC12M) in the main text so the reader is well-informed about the bias of these captions. In addition, it is important to include the details on how the authors optimize for diversity and quality control.

### Questions
At this point, what would change my mind the most is a much more thorough analysis of the dataset that focuses on polysemy (W1).

### Summary
This paper presents the Image Polysemy dataset (IMP). IMP is designed to require models to understand that there are different plausible ways of describing an image that goes beyond the approach of crowdsourcing captions from the internet. IMP is collected in a multi-stage process starting from images sourced from Unsplash that includes human annotation and cleaning. The dataset is used to evaluate a broad collection of VLM in a zero-shot and fine-tuned setting. The results show that surprisingly good performance is possible in the zero-shot setting, and that fine-tuning various versions of the CLIP model can indeed improve performance. The experiments also include ablations on different CLIP-style models trained on different amounts of data, different architectures, and on different data sources.

Edit: thanks for your response to my questions!

### Strengths
1. Extensive zero-shot experiments across a large collection of models.
2. Should prove to be a useful resource for evaluating VLMs.

### Weaknesses
1. I didn't feel like both Figure 1 and Figure 3 needed to exist in the main body of the paper because it feels like they are duplicating information. 
2. Not entirely clear why the dataset needed to be based on "high-quality stock photography from Unsplash".

### Questions
1. Why is the high-quality stock photography from Unsplash a good source for evaluating models in different scenarios?
2. Which steps did you take to ensure that none of the models had pretrained on the photos that you used from Unsplash?
3. Why did you use captions that described other images as the "human-authored" versions of the captions? Is CLIP similarity really good enough for this?
4. Why is RSUM a meaningful measure to report? It doesn't seem like it gives a better understanding of model performance than the original set-based retrieval measures.
5. What is the purpose of the qualitative analysis in Section 4.3? I couldn't fully understand the contribution of this section.

### Summary
The following work presents a dataset for benchmarking polysemy in text-image pairings. Examples of difficult pairings include meme-like pairings that require drawing higher level and more abstract connections between the text and image content. Dataset curation uses a combination of google vision API and CLIP image embeddings to collect website titles as potential captions, combined with candidate captions from existing datasets. Annotator's select captions either based on descriptiveness or level of conceptual match, the latter being a more abstract linking. Diversity is encouraged by clustering captions candidates by their sentenceBERT embeddings, then selecting 1 caption candidate per cluster. Existing pretrained models are then benchmarked on this dataset through both zero-shot testing and fine-tuning.

### Strengths
- Tackles an important barrier in higher level image-text comprehension
- Contributes another fairly large scale dataset that can be of use to community

### Weaknesses
- The claim for having higher diversity in captions in this work is slightly problematic because diversity is never clearly defined. Based on their method, it seems to refer specifically to whatever euclidean distance can be associated with in sentenceBERT's embedding representation, which I am not entirely sure how to interpret.
- Some concerns regarding methodology which I elaborate on in the next section.
- While this work certainly provides a useful benchmark for polysemy, I don't think the contributions of this work sufficiently shed light on any new aspects of the problem that the community was already aware of.

### Questions
- The MPL2D metric measures the mean euclidean distance between image and caption embeddings, meant to capture the semantic diversity to justify the aforementioned diversity claims. There may be some concerns regarding this formulation which I would like to give the authors a chance to verify any possible misconceptions on my end:
    - If these are the embeddings used in the CLIP contrastive cosine distance loss, then it should be specified whether they are normalized inner products. The CLIP contrastive loss encodes distances only in the angular difference of the embeddings, so the embedding norms should not contribute to the analysis unless there's a good reason to.
    - If the used embeddings correspond to CLIP's normalized inner product space, then we also have to be careful about applying any sort of euclidean analysis, because the clustering from the learned representation probably lies on the surface of the N-dimensional normalized sphere.
- Is it possible to verify that there is no dataset leakage in the zero-shot analysis? Based on my understanding of the dataset collection pipeline, there should be existing captions from previous datasets such as MSCOCO and FLICKR30K included in this dataset, with possibly different image pairings. Can we confirm that none of the pre-trained models have been exposed to MSCOCO or FLICKR30k?

### Summary
This work proposes a benchmark, IMP, to evaluate understanding of image polysemy in vision-language models. The IMP benchmark includes diverse captions that range from descriptive to conceptual. A semi-automatic pipeline was constructed to select the captions, with use of human annotators. A variety of existing vision-language models are benchmarked on the IMP dataset.

### Strengths
The dataset is novel, and is the first to study image polysemy in the context of image-text matching / retrieval. The experiment evaluation covers a wide range of models and is sufficient.

### Weaknesses
I am concerned about the difficulty of the task. "Vanilla" image-text retrieval itself is not straightforward to evaluate, given the high rate of false negative caused by plausible but unrecorded matches [1,2]. The subjectivity of image polysemy amplifies all these difficulties. I wonder to what degree this task is even _possible_ to evaluate objectively. For example, it was not obvious to me that the caption and images in Fig 4. Col1 & Col 4 go together. Similarly for many of pairs in Fig 3. 

The subjectiveness of this benchmark calls for a human accuracy check, given that this benchmark is so heavily based on human judgements of image meaning. The human judgements of similarity can then be used to create similarity judgements similar to [1,2] or correct false negatives. Given the dataset construction technique, I'm skeptical whether the evaluations are meaningful given that the captions are abstract enough that many of the might match plausibly match to other images. This could be corrected by verifying human accuracy on the dataset and modifying the benchmark so that correlation with human accuracy is being assessed instead.

Note that the annotation process _does not_ guarantee this, since the annotation procedure does not exclude the possibility that there are 10-15 other captions somewhere in the dataset that describe the image equally well, and vice versa for any image. You could do this by using CLIP to rank _all_ the captions in the dataset w.r.t to a particular image (and vice versa), and having humans rerank the top 50 from each cluster. This could be used to measure both human accuracy, and capture more plausible measurements of human similarity.
