- Decision: Accept

## Abstract
Identifying cell types and understanding their functional properties is crucial for unraveling the mechanisms underlying perception and cognition. In the retina, functional types can be identified by carefully selected stimuli, but this requires expert domain knowledge and biases the procedure towards previously known cell types. In the visual cortex, it is still unknown what functional types exist and how to identify them. Thus, for unbiased identification of the functional cell types in retina and visual cortex, new approaches are needed. Here we propose an optimization-based clustering approach using deep predictive models to obtain functional clusters of neurons using Most Discriminative Stimuli (MDS). Our approach alternates between stimulus optimization with cluster reassignment akin to an expectation-maximization algorithm. The algorithm recovers functional clusters in mouse retina, marmoset retina and macaque visual area V4. This demonstrates that our approach can successfully find discriminative stimuli across species, stages of the visual system and recording techniques. The resulting most discriminative stimuli can be used to assign functional cell types fast and on the fly, without the need to train complex predictive models or show a large natural scene dataset, paving the way for experiments that were previously limited by experimental time. Crucially, MDS are interpretable: they visualize the distinctive stimulus patterns that most unambiguously identify a specific type of neuron.

### Summary
In this paper, the authors developed a framework to jointly cluster cells into functional cell types and obtain Maximally Discriminative Stimuli (MDS) for each functional cluster, based on an EM-type iteration. The MDS aims to stimulate one cell type while suppressing all others, as an extension to previously developed Maximally Exciting Inputs (MEIs). The authors carried out several real data analysis to demonstrate the capability of the proposed framework.

### Strengths
The paper is relatively easy to follow and well-structured. The method seems to be straightforward and intuitive. The authors provided multiple experiments to demonstrate the performance of the proposed framework.

### Weaknesses
My primary concern is how useful and interpretable the method will be for actual practice. The experiments essentially treated a carefully-examined existing publication as the ground truth to compare with. I assume in a lot of real scenarios, we might already have this kind of biological baselines. For cases where they are not available, the interpretability of the identified MDS might be important.

### Questions
1. For the sub-cluster split, the authors used an "evaluation MDS" for determining if clusters should be kept. This seems to be a newly initialized, separately trained MDS which does not necessarily tell whether the sub-clusters are bringing in better cell type identification. I hope the authors can explain more about the logic of this.
2. Can the authors elaborate more on Figure 2B? They referenced figure 2B when stating in the text that “none of the MDS exhibited direction selectivity”, but I didn’t quite understand why Figure 2B is referenced here.
3. For the experiments in Figure 2, the identified MDS seems to be largely combination of several functional cell types from the published Baden et al (2016) paper. I wonder if further tweaking with the sub-clustering procedure can better recover the published functional cell types.
4. How will the result change if the number of gradient ascent steps is changed during each M-step? Trying to understand if there is a delicate balance needed between how well the M-step is optimized and the E-step, or if the procedure is relatively robust and almost guaranteed to converge to the same set of results.

### Summary
Identifying and understanding cell types and their functional properties is crucial for understanding perception and cognition. Traditional methods have limitations, such as bias and lack of knowledge about functional cell types. A new approach, Maximally Discriminative Stimuli (MDS), uses optimization-based clustering with deep predictive models to identify functional cell types. This approach is successful across species and recording techniques and provides real-time cell type assignment, making experiments more efficient. MDS is interpretable and visualizes distinctive stimulus patterns for each neuron type.

### Strengths
* MDS provides a time-efficient on-the-fly cell type assignment by using a concise stimulus.
* MDS outperforms conventional approaches in identifying the correct cell type cluster, saving 20% of experimental time compared to traditional methods.

### Weaknesses
A potential weakness in the presented approach is that it assumes that the most informative stimuli for classifying cell types can be automatically chosen without requiring domain knowledge or expert input. While this is presented as an advantage, it may also be a limitation, as there could be cases where domain-specific insights are necessary for more accurate and nuanced cell type classification. Additionally, the success of the approach relies on the availability of a "digital twin" dataset, which may not always be readily available for all experimental studies, potentially limiting its applicability.

### Questions
While the authors express their belief in the usefulness of the algorithm and stimuli, there is no mention of empirical results or validation studies that demonstrate the actual effectiveness and applicability of the proposed approach. 

One potential weakness of the clustering algorithm is its limitation in effectively distinguishing certain cell types with complex responses. For instance, for ON-OFF RGCs that respond to both light increments and decrements, optimizing a single, short MDS to maximize their response may not adequately capture their unique properties. Similarly, for cell types like "OFF suppressed 2," which exhibit a high baseline firing rate mostly suppressed by stimulation, the algorithm may not effectively identify them without specific adaptations, potentially requiring additional stimulus optimization strategies for better classification.

The absence of a benchmark is a significant weakness in this paper. It would be helpful if the author can add any performance to determine its effectiveness or limitations.

### Summary
This paper proposes maximize discriminative stimuli (MDS) that maximizely activates each functional cell types, and not activate the other types, and it is an extension of MEI (maximize excitation inputs). The algorithm follows the similar way as expectation maximization (EM), start from random assignment of groups, and maximize the activation objective in M step, and then reassign groups in E step. The total number of cell type groups is not defined as a prior, depends on the coverage and threshold of the EM algorithms. The work is evaluated on multiple real datasets and different animals (mouse retina, marmoset retina, and macaque V4). The proposed method is also helpful to provide time-efficient cell type identification.

### Strengths
Novelty and Importance:
1. The paper focus on a novel and important concept that finding inputs that maximize the difference of different functional cell types, which extend from single neuron MEI to group level. 

Evaluations:
1. The work has been comprehensively evaluated on multiple experiments across multiple animals to demonstrate the soundness of the proposed approach. Sensitivity analysis including different initialization, number of clusters are included.

Writing:
1. The paper is well organized and presentation is good.

### Weaknesses
Method:
1. The clustering approach is based on the discreteness hypothesis of functional cell types, while ignoring the neurons might be close to the boundary or shows patterns that belongs to two functional cell types in different trials. Therefore, there might be limitation of separability.
2. It remains unclear how does the choice of neural networks or back-propagation algorithms affect the solutions. 
3. Qualitatively, it is difficult to compare and interpret different MDS, and understand how they diverge from each other.

Baselines:
1. Simple baselines like searching nearest neighbor in original image space, or simple image interpolation could be introduced and compared. 

Evaluation:
1. It seems that the optimized MDS has not been tested on real mouse yet, only evaluated on holdout neurons and trials.

### Questions
1. How does functional cell types here related to neuron classes of excitatory and inhibitory?
2. How to explain and interpret some off-diagonal entries in Fig 2D and Fig 4A?

### Summary
An optimisation-based clustering approach is proposed obtain functional clusters of neurons using deep predictive models and Maximally Discriminative Stimuli (MDS). The stimulus optimization and cluster reassignment are alternately conducted until the convergence is achieved. Empirical studies demonstrate the proposed algorithm recovers functional clusters in mouse retina, marmoset retina and macaque visual area V4.

### Strengths
++ The paper attempts to address an important problem of cell type identification.

++ The experimental results seem to be promising and useful in practice.

### Weaknesses
-- Essential technical details of the digital twin (i.e. the neural network used to predict the neuron responses) are missing. From the text, it is not clear how the digital twin is obtained and how it will affect the optimisation of MDS.

-- It is stated in the paper "We optimized the stimulus by gradient-ascent, using the SGD optimizer with a learning rate of 100". What are the learnable parameters during this optmization? It is unusual to use such a large value of learning rate. 

-- The statement is ambiguous "After each step we renormalize the video snippet to a L2 norm of 30 and clamp ... into ranges of [-0.913, 6.269] and [-0.654, 6.269]". What does it mean by "a L2 norm of 30"? What are the ranges from?

### Questions
1. Where does the digital twin (i.e. the neural network) come from? Is it a pre-trained neural network?
2. How are the results/performance sensitive to the hyper-parameters and initializations?
