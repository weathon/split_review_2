# Path Choice Matters for Clear Attributions in Path Methods

- Decision: Accept
- Scores: 6, 8, 8

## Abstract
Rigorousness and clarity are both essential for interpretations of DNNs to engender human trust. 
Path methods are commonly employed to generate rigorous attributions that satisfy three axioms.
However, the meaning of attributions remains ambiguous due to distinct path choices.
To address the ambiguity, we introduce \textbf{Concentration Principle}, which centrally allocates high attributions to indispensable features, thereby endowing aesthetic and sparsity.
We then present \textbf{SAMP}, a model-agnostic interpreter, which efficiently searches the near-optimal path from a pre-defined set of manipulation paths.
Moreover, we propose the infinitesimal constraint (IC) and momentum strategy (MS) to improve the rigorousness and optimality.
Visualizations show that SAMP can precisely reveal DNNs by pinpointing salient image pixels.
We also perform quantitative experiments and observe that our method significantly outperforms the counterparts

### Summary
This paper introduces SAMP (Salient Manipulation Path), a novel model-agnostic method for attribution explanation that selects a near-optimal path guided by the proposed Concentration Principle. The authors further enhance SAMP with two additional modules, IC and MS, creating an extended version SAMP++. Performance evaluations of SAMP/SAMP++ are conducted on MNIST, CIFAR-10, and ImageNet datasets using Deletion/Insertion metrics. It outperforms other baseline methods. Additionally, the qualitative results of SAMP and SAMP++ show improvements in visualization quality, offering more precise object location and detailed pixel highlighting. These results demonstrate the advantages of the proposed method.

### Strengths
1.	The paper introduces a novel technique for determining the optimal path for distinct attribution allocations, using Brownian motion as the guiding mechanism. To satisfy the completeness axiom, the Infinitesimal Constraint is employed, while the Momentum Strategy is utilized to avoid local optima. Overall, the algorithm is well-motivated and clearly explained.

2.	The evaluation is thorough, and the results highlight the fidelity advantages of both SAMP and SAMP++. Importantly, the efficiency of SAMP and SAMP++ remains relatively high when compared to other integrated gradient methods.

3.	The paper is well-organized and clearly written, contributing to its overall quality.

### Weaknesses
1.	Some parts need more clarification: 

    a.	Figure 8 states that "as η decreases, the attribution visualization becomes fine-grained." However, at η=10, the visualization appears overly dark, making it challenging to understand. Similarly, Table 3 suggests that “since the main role of IC is to ensure rigorousness, its effect in improving performance is not significant”. Have the authors conducted a statistical test to substantiate this claim?

    b.	In Section 4.4.2, more details should be added, for instance, “B+W” refers to Bin the path x^T to x^0 and W refers to x^0 to x^T. In Figure 7, the authors claim that “the visual impact of different baselines is not significant”. But Figure 7 demonstrates quite different qualitative results. For instance, B+W is in general less salient than others. Moreover, quantitative results in Table 6 in the appendix also show significant differences between baselines. Could the authors elaborate on their reasoning?

    c.	Does SAMP++ provide similar qualitative results as SAMP? Why not present qualitative results of SAMP++ as it has better performance than SAMP? 


2.	The current results support the efficacy of the proposed method, but the paper would benefit from more impactful and insightful analyses. For example, it would be informative to investigate whether SAMP++ can help humans understand models, particularly on complex tasks involving fine-grained data.

### Questions
How do we understand the impacts of baselines on two paths? To be concrete, in Appendix A.5.3, “the setting of Deletion/Insertion is consistent with ‘B+G’”. How are they related?

### Summary
This paper proposes a new attribution method. For the baseline of integrated gradient, the author proposed the Concentration Principle and also proposed the SAMP method, which can target the black box model. Advantages over partial IG methods on the challenging Imagenet dataset.

### Strengths
- A new path attribution principle is proposed for path methods (IG class methods).
- This method can target agnostic models.
- On the challenging imagenet dataset, this method has better attribution effects compared with traditional attribution algorithms and IG-type attribution algorithms.
- This method has theoretical guarantee.

### Weaknesses
- Should "Attributions" be changed to "Attribution" in the title of this paper?
- It is not recommended to cite references in the abstract.
- Since the proposed method is attributed to the pixel level, I hope the author can discuss the advantages of this method compared to the method attributed to features, because it seems that the explanation attributed to the region level is more convenient for human understanding.
- In addition to natural image datasets such as Imagenet, I suggest that the author can try to apply this method to natural language interpretation or medical images. Because a single word in natural language has strong semantics and is easy for humans to understand, it is most critical for medical images to have small areas. This can better reflect the practical application value of this article.
- The author mentions the case of model agnosticism. If we consider that the internal gradient of the model is accessible, that is, a white-box model, can the method proposed in this article achieve better attribution results? Or why doesn't it work with white box? I hope the author can discuss relevant content.
- I hope the author can discuss the limitations of this article and future outlook.
- In Table 1, why does the value of deletion appear negative? Did the authors fail to normalize the network's classification output?

### Questions
Please see weaknesses, if the author can convincingly address my concerns, I'm open to raise my score.

### Summary
This work studies the efficacy of optimal path to achieve clarity of attributions. A Concentration Principle is defined to guides the interpreter to identify essential features and allocate attributions to them.

### Strengths
+ This work study how optimal path can improve the clarity for attributions for interpretations of DNNs. A Concentration Principle is proposed, which aim to concentrate the attributions on the dispensable features.
+ A Salient Manipulation Path approach is proposed to search the near-optimal path (as an approximation of Equation 5). Each manipulation step is constrained below an upper bound with l1-norm, and momentum strategy is proposed to avoid convergence to local solution.
+ This paper shows quantitative and qualitative results to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. 
+ The paper is written clearly and easy to follow.

### Weaknesses
- There are some minor typos and latex error for the manuscript.

### Questions
- The proposed approach is evaluated on image classification dataset, where there common has a dominant object in the image. For some of the example shown, the attributions could cover several objects (e.g., socks and heaters are both attributed; the dog, tiles line, and shower head are attributed). Does it infer that all the attributed regions/pixels contribute to the decision? Has the author applied this method on fine-grain image classification dataset?
- Brownian motion is the erratic motion of particles suspended in a medium due to continuous collisions. Assumption 1 assume the additive process as the Brownian motion. Please explain why is this valid and the intuition behind. 
- The manipulation path is pre-defined. How is the path defined? Could these paths sufficiently cover most scenarios for the search of near-optimal path? 
- What is the full name for IG?

Minor comments:
- Some of the figure (or table) is too far from the text that discussed its result, hence not friendly to cross reference the figure and the discussion.
