## Abstract
Understanding the interactions of atoms such as forces in 3D atomistic systems is fundamental to many applications like molecular dynamics and catalyst design. 
However, simulating these interactions requires compute-intensive \textit{ab initio} calculations and thus results in limited data for training neural networks. 
In this paper, we propose to use \textbf{\underline{de}}noising  \textbf{\underline{n}}on-equilibrium \textbf{\underline{s}}tructures (\textbf{DeNS}) as an auxiliary task to better leverage training data and improve performance. 
For training with DeNS, we first corrupt a 3D structure by adding noise to its 3D coordinates and then predict the noise. 
Different from previous works on denoising, which are limited to equilibrium structures, the proposed method generalizes denoising to a much larger set of non-equilibrium structures.
The main difference is that a non-equilibrium structure does not correspond to local energy minima and has non-zero forces, and therefore it can have many possible atomic positions compared to an equilibrium structure.
This makes denoising non-equilibrium structures an ill-posed problem since the target of denoising is not uniquely defined.
Our key insight is to additionally encode the forces of the original non-equilibrium structure to specify which non-equilibrium structure we are denoising.
Concretely, given a corrupted non-equilibrium structure and the forces of the original one, we predict the non-equilibrium structure satisfying the input forces instead of any arbitrary structures.
Since DeNS requires encoding forces, DeNS favors equivariant networks, which can easily incorporate forces and other higher-order tensors in node embeddings.
We study the effectiveness of training equivariant networks with DeNS on OC20, OC22 and MD17 datasets and demonstrate that DeNS can achieve new state-of-the-art results on OC20 and OC22 and significantly improve training efficiency on MD17.

### Summary
The paper introduces DeNS, an approach to improve energy and force predictions with the aid of non-equilibrium structures' denoising as an auxiliary task. Its implementation feeds forces from original structures as inputs, contributing to a well-structured problem. Demonstrated results indicate minor improvements on EquiformerV2 for datasets like OC20, OC22, and MD17.

### Strengths
-The paper addresses an essential challenge: the development of a self-supervised learning methodology using non-equilibrium molecules.

-The proposal offers a unique perspective on non-equilibrium denoising by discussing the ill-posed mapping. The handling of input encoding using forces seems logically feasible.

-The documentation is unambiguous and comprehensible.

### Weaknesses
-The paper could benefit from a broader theoretical discussion and a comparative analysis with other self-supervised techniques for non-equilibrium structures, such as denoising pretraining in [1], Noisy Nodes (using the OC20 dataset)[2], and improved noisy nodes (using MD17)[3]. These techniques have demonstrated efficacy for energy or force predictions for non-equilibrium molecules, hence their significance.

-The motivation behind the paper's approach needs additional validation.
a) The concept of “encoding force as input” finds extensive discussion in the paper. However, this approach needs corroborative proof from experiments. Results from Table 1e indicate energy prediction outcomes remain the same without force encoding. The possibility of label leakage and its contribution to improvement in force prediction, as discussed under question 2, needs examination.
b) Similar problem-solving approaches have been published. A comparative discussion highlighting the distinctions and superiority of this paper's proposed methodology would prove advantageous.

-The significant results were, to a large extent, achieved through Equiformer. Against Equiformer's backdrop, the improvements contributed by DeNS appear minimal.

### Questions
-While encoding input forces can mitigate the non-equilibrium denoising's ill-posed problem, [1] shows that denoising without force input is also plausible. Does this undermine your motivation and imply the redundancy of input force encoding?
-Could there be label leakage when encoding forces as input for energy and force predictions of structures?
-Given that force prediction is one of your experiments, should you consider adding the force prediction loss to eq. (6)?
-Provision of the pseudocode for DeNS training would be beneficial. This can offer insights into the usage of Multi-Scale Noise and other hyperparameters like p_{ DeNS }.

### Summary
In this paper, the authors proposed a denoising non-equilibrium structures (DeNS) training strategy to improve force field learning. Different from previous denoising approaches limited to equilibrium structures, DeNS enables the utilization of non-equilibrium structures for the denoising task by encoding the corresponding non-zero forces for specifying the denoising targets. Extensive experiments are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of DeNS.

### Strengths
- The target problem is of interest to the machine learning force field community. 
- The proposed approach to encode the forces for specifying target structures when denoising perturbed non-equilibrium structures is a new modification compared to previous methods like noisy-node.
- The experimental evaluation covers both small and large-scale benchmarks. The ablation studies on the introduced hyperparameters are informative for practitioners to try the proposed DeNS approach in their applications.

### Weaknesses
- **Regarding the performance improvement** . Serving as a simple modification upon previous denoising training strategy on molecular modeling, performance improvement is the most important aspect to measure the quality of this work. However, there exist several issues that need to be further clarified:
  - The gains brought by DeNS diminish with the dataset scales up. From Table 1 and Table 2, we can see that models trained on the 2M subset of the OC20 S2EF dataset benefit a lot more from the DeNS auxiliary task compared to the OC20 S2EF-All+MD split.
  - The improvement on MD17 is limited compared to the OC series experiments.
  - The improvement on the IS2RE task is also limited (sometimes DeNS even hurts the performance).
  - The gains on the energy and force metrics are not consistent across different datasets with different scales. In the OC20 tasks, models trained with the DeNS task achieve lower force errors and competitive energy errors compared to the standard training and vice versa for the OC22 tasks.

The first issue relates to the scaling property of the proposed training strategy. I recommend the authors further design experiments to investigate whether such a phenomenon is due to the inability of the proposed DeNS to bring performance gains when large-scale data is provided or other factors of the model, optimization, and so on. The second issue relates to the generality of the proposed strategy. MD17 contains simple molecules instead of adsorbate-catalyst complex in OC20/22. This dataset is much smaller than OC20/22 dataset, on which the proposed DeNS is expected to bring more gains according to the phenomenon mentioned in the first issue. However, the results in Table 5 and 6 show the gains are limited. It is suggested to further verify the generality of DeNS. The third issue relates to the significance of the force field learning task. In OC and other similar applications, what we really care about is to obtain the property of the equilibrium states like relaxed energy and structure. The error of force field model is an indirect metric. In this sense, the significance of improvement brought by DeNS on energy and force error of S2EF task should be reexamined based on the IS2RE performance.

Overall, I recommend the authors to carefully clarify the proposed issues above with further experimental evidence to make some aspects of the proposed DeNS training strategy more clear for readers. I would like to increase my scores if the authors could address my concerns in this section and questions in the next section.

### Questions
1. In each iteration, the model uses either the standard training or the DeNS training. As DeNS training requires the forces to be encoded into the input atom features, I wonder how the force encoding module would be used in the standard training which instead uses the forces as labels.

2. In Table 5, the authors demonstrate that the DeNS training is more efficient and results in larger performance gains than increasing max degrees of irreps. I wonder why the authors changed the model from EquiformerV2 to EquiformerV1 for this investigation. After all, the EquiformerV2 model is claimed to largely benefit from scaling the max degrees of irreps. How would EquiformerV2 with different max degrees of irreps behave in the same setting of Table 5?

3. Could you provide more discussion on why you chose Equation 7 for the multi-scale noise scheduler?

### Summary
The paper proposes an auxiliary task (not a pre-training) to help learn molecular tasks: denoising not only equilibrium (few are available) structures, but also denoising the not-yet-at-mechanical-equilibrium structures (much more numerous).

The key new idea is to provide also the forces (of the non-corrupted input) together with the corrupted structures, to make the problem well posed.

Rather heavy experiments show that the proposed method can sometimes beat the state of the art.

### Strengths
Originality:

The idea of the auxiliary task applied to non-equilibrium structures is great, here the paper allows to make this task well-defined by feeding the (uncorrupted) forces as input.


Clarity:

The paper explains carefully how the auxiliary task is added to the "default" model on which one wants to work.
I like a lot figure 1, which explains very clearly and concisely the idea.



Significance:

I think the paper makes the point for releasing more non-equilibrium structures (although, this is already the case in OC20 and OC22 if I understood well), which is important to state clearly to the community.  As authors say:

> We hope that the ability to leverage more from non-equilibrium structures as proposed in this work can encourage researchers to release data containing intermediate non-equilibrium structures in addition to final equilibrium ones.

### Weaknesses
Originality:

The original idea is not groundbreaking: auxiliary tasks are known, the specific case of denoising as well, here the novelty is only in feeding also the forces as input.

Quality:

it is not always clear from the results shown in tables, that the proposed method improves the SOTA significantly.
Also, since there are two measures of success (energy and forces), it's sometimes difficult to make a final decision.

Clarity:

The paper has some typos, but most importantly, experiments are discussed very quickly (too quickly). More space should be devoted to discuss results. For instance table 4 shows a nice improvement for DeNS on OOD splits (i.e. better generalization if I understand well that OOD is Out of Distribution as opposed to ID=In Distribution).

Significance:

Since the results are not strikingly better when using DeNS on the SOTA, and given it involves a number of additional hyperparameters (that obviously do not need very narrow fine-tuning, admitedly, but still, they involve more work and potential for problems), it is not clear yet whether the contribution would be used widely.

Table 1d is probably the most convincing result, to me (differences between models seem more significant). Is it computed on the validation set(s) ? (or train set ? I have a doubt).

In summary, this is red AI and the results are not significantly better than SOTA, thus not convincing for publication.

### Questions
I note that:
- trainings are very heavy.
- there is some hyper-param tuning, and DeNS is used on top of the best models (equiformerV2).
- energy and force: sometimes only one is better, but as you say, it's a balance.
- All that considered, most of the differences reported are not very significant. Maybe you could outline in green when a metric is significantly better in one model than in others (when this happens).
Can you answer and/or improve the discussions (and/or presentation of results) in the Experiments section, to show that indeed, the improvement is significant ?

If some tables show no significant improvement, it should be explained why.

If the method is mostly able to speed up training to achieve equivalent accuracy, state it (and it will weaken the paper's claim, but at the same time strengthen the submission).



Note:
Table 2 does not show a significant improvement from using DeNS




typos:
devication -> deviation
"L2 different" -> "L2 difference / L2 norm / squared difference "

### Summary
This paper proposes a method called denoising non-equilibrium structures (DeNS), which generalizes to a larger set of non-equilibrium structures without relying on additional datasets for pre-training, and the effectiveness of DeNS is demonstrated on the OC20, OC22, and MD17 datasets, achieving better results and faster training times compared to existing methods.

### Strengths
1. The inverse denoising framework presented in this work is quite interesting, as it proposes a novel possibility of combining structures, forces, and energy (or other properties) in a dual or inverse setting.
2. The experiments and ablation study conducted are robust and extensive, accompanied by meticulous analysis.
3. Well-written and easy to understand.

### Weaknesses
1. The results show limited improvements in the OC20, OC22, and MD17 datasets.
2. Maybe could add more results from the denoising framework with other backbones to provide a comprehensive understanding of its performance.
3. I believe that developing a general AI-based molecular dynamics (MD) method is more crucial than specifically designing and tuning for the OC dataset. A more generalized approach could be beneficial to the community by focusing on the broader application of deep learning-based MD methods across different systems, such as drug molecules, crsytal materials or polymers.

### Questions
1. If the improvements are not solely due to data augmentation, but rather are attributed to the inverse or dual denoising setting, it would be valuable to explore the generalization ability of the S2EF system in other systems.
2. The tunable standard deviation (σ) denoising strategy appears to be crucial, it might be beneficial to incorporate visualizations of σ during the training process for better illustration.

### Summary
This paper proposes a new auxiliary task to improve the training of networks on the prediction of the energy and forces from the structure of an atomistic system. It proposes to consider the recovery of the 3d structure after perturbing it with Gaussian noise (similar to a denoising autoencoder). Yet, since this plain (structure-to-structure) denoising problem is only well-posed for equilibrium structures, the authors propose to consider the forces of the original structure as an additional input along with a corrupted non-equilibrium structure, which seems to make the denoising problem well-posed again. The resulting ability to also consider  non-equilibrium structures significantly increases the available amount of training data and results in significant and systematic numerical improvements on several data sets.

### Strengths
I am not familiar with machine learning on atomistic systems, such that my evaluation has to be treated with some care. Yet, 
- The idea seems to be novel, very well motivated by language processing and computer vision, and nicely resolves the ambiguity of denoising non-equilibrium structures with the help of additional input. 
- The numerical results (on huge and apparently very competitive datasets) are very promising as they are largely able to improve the state-of-the-art. 
- Ablation studies over hyper-parameters, architectural choices, and loss functions indicate a very well-designed method.

### Weaknesses
The presentation of the work could be improved significantly. While part of my difficulty in understanding the presentation is surely due to my lack of knowledge in the particular field, I believe some aspects hold for scientific texts in general 
- Abbreviations should not be used before they are introduced. The abstract already refers to "S2EF" and "IS2RE results" (clarified in the numerical results), refers to network architectures without citation and even uses variables ($L_\max = 2$ and $L_\max=3$) whose meaning is assumed to be known.
- It is not explained why forces make the denoising problem on non-equilibrium structures well-posed and also not how the forces are obtained. Is it correct to assume that the potential of any structure can be computed and that the forces are the gradient thereof? If so, it would be just two additional sentences of explanation that make the work much more clear. 
- The property "equivariant" is frequently used. While I know what it means, it was unclear to me what kind of equivariance (with respect to which transformations) is meant and why that influences the ability to encode forces. Rotations and translations of 3d coordinates/vectors? 
- I do not know the term "type-L vectors" - what does it mean? I tried googling but did not have direct success. Thus, I'd recommend defining it. Also, what is "the projection of $f$ into type-L vectors with spherical harmonics"? Representing the function f with L-many coefficients corresponding to spherical harmonics basis functions?
- It would have helped me to cite something for "SO(3) linear layer". 
- Please double-check the manuscript for typos. 

Please be aware that I am not part of your main audience. Thus, feel free to adjust the writing for those aspects where you believe your main audience would also agree.

From my (quite uncertain) point of view, the strengths seem to clearly outweigh the suboptimal presentation (particularly if the latter is well suited for a more expert audience).

------  
As an update after the discussion phase, the points I thought were strong (contribution+numerical evaluation) are rather seen as critical by reviewers who are much more familiar with the field. As my initial rating was based on the assumption of a significant novelty, such that I am lowering my score to account for this.

### Questions
In addition to some small things raised above, I have two further questions:
- It was strange to me to decide for a cost function for each batch during training with some probability. Will this not be equal to a weighted linear combination between the two terms in expectation?
- The ablation in Table 1 (b) indicates that $p_{DeNS}=0.5$ is the best, but also the largest tested value. Wouldn't it make sense to ablate values $>0.5$?
