- Decision: Reject
- Scores: 5, 5, 3, 6, 8

## Abstract
Multi-task learning (MTL), a learning paradigm to learn multiple related tasks simultaneously, has achieved great success in various fields. However, task balancing problem remains a significant challenge in MTL, with the disparity in loss/gradient scales often leading to performance compromises. In this paper, we propose a Dual-Balancing Multi-Task Learning (DB-MTL) method to alleviate the task balancing problem from both loss and gradient perspectives. Specifically, DB-MTL ensures loss-scale balancing by performing a logarithm transformation on each task loss, and guarantees gradient-magnitude balancing via normalizing all task gradients to the same magnitude as the maximum gradient norm. Extensive experiments conducted on several benchmark datasets consistently demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of DB-MTL.

### Summary
The paper presents a method to tackle the task-balancing problem in multi-task learning called Dual-Balancing Multi-Task Learning (DB-MTL). The work is grounded on the observation that differences in loss scales and gradient magnitudes across different tasks could negatively impact the performance of some tasks. The DB-MTL method is designed to balance these aspects at both the loss and gradient levels. It involves a logarithmic transformation on each task loss to ensure uniform scale, which is shown to also benefit existing gradient balancing techniques. Moreover, it also includes the normalization of all task gradients to the same magnitude to ensure respective uniformity. The researchers found that setting this magnitude as the maximum gradient norm yields the best performance. Comprehensive experiments have been performed on several benchmark datasets, and the results suggest that DB-MTL can achieve state-of-the-art performance. The primary contributions include the proposal of the DB-MTL method, empirical evidence of its effectiveness, and an illustration of the advantage of combining loss-scale balancing with gradient balancing.

### Strengths
Quality: The authors execute extensive experiments which support their conclusions. The postulations and the experimental results correlate well, strengthening the paper’s credibility. 

Clarity: The paper is well-written and very easy to understand.

Originality: The maximum-norm strategy in Section 3.2  has some novelty.

### Weaknesses
There is a significant lack of novelty in the presented techniques. The first part discusses scale-balancing loss transformation, which utilizes the common method of applying a log transformation to loss. This technique has already been mentioned by Nash-MTL and therefore doesn't contribute anything substantially new to the field.
The second section of the method, gradient normalization, is a modification of the GradNorm technique. The presented maximum-norm strategy essentially ensures all small-task gradients have the same norm as the task with the greatest gradient. While this may present an interesting approach, it is not substantially innovative. The final part of the paper brings together the previous two parts, but again, this combination doesn't present any great novelty or challenges. Consequently, the paper’s primary contribution is the maximum-norm strategy, which is not significant enough.

From the writing perspective, this paper reads more like a technical report or experiment report, where effective methods from previous work are summarized, but with few unique thoughts proposed.

From an experimental perspective, the explanation of the maximum-norm strategy in section 3.2 lacks experimental support and could benefit from visual analysis. For example, the authors could investigate how using different alpha values impacts the optimization path or the decrease of loss in different tasks. This would provide a much-needed experimental grounding to the theoretical concepts presented in the paper. 

Overall, the paper needs more novelty and substantial analysis to make a significant contribution to the field.

### Questions
Why are the baseline methods worse than STL on almost all datasets? In previous papers (IMTL etc.), at least on the NYUv2 dataset, the effects of most methods are positive.

### Summary
The paper presents a straightforward Dual-Balancing Multi-Task Learning (DB-MTL) method with well-conducted experiments across multiple datasets. The method alleviate the task balancing problem by using logarithmic transformation for loss-scale balancing and normalizing gradients to the same magnitude for gradient-magnitude balancing.

### Strengths
1. **Simplicity of the Method:** The loss-scale balancing and the gradient-magnitude balancing of the approach are both commendably straightforward.
2. **Sufficient and Effective Experiments:** The paper demonstrates the effectiveness of DB-MTL through extensive validation across three distinct scenarios and five datasets. The proposed method is optimal on all datasets.

### Weaknesses
1. **Imprecise Overview of the MTL Objective:** The MTL objective (Equation 1) in Section 2 is imprecise. It is applicable primarily to existing loss balancing and certain gradient balancing methods. For example, in some gradient balancing methods like PCGrad and CAGrad, the weights of task-specific parameters are all 1, and in all hybrid balancing methods, the weights of task-specific and task-shared parameters are different.
2. **Omission of Relevant Literature:**   (1) The DB-MTL method, albeit not defined as such within the text, is one of hybrid balancing methods. However, the treatment of hybrid balancing in Section 2 is overly simplistic and lacks a formal definition, along with an inadequate reference to relevant literature. For instance, approaches like RLW, Auto-λ[1] and IGB[2] have also conducted exploratory work combining loss balancing and gradient balancing.    (2) In the discussion part of Section 3.1, IGB[2] has also studied the logarithm transformation and has further extended it into a new loss balancing paradigm.
3. **Lack of Novelty:** The proposed loss balancing method, as well as the combination of loss and gradient balancing, have been previously discussed and experimented in prior works.
4. **Lack of Theoretical Analysis:** Though the proposed method is easy to understand intuitively, it lacks theoretical understanding about why the proposed gradient balancing is beneficial for the overall MTL objective. In terms of gradients, the primary factor affecting the MTL performance is gradient conflicts, specifically the conflicts in gradient directions. The discrepancy in the magnitude of gradients does not lead to performance degradation if their directions are aligned. How does the proposed gradient balancing method directly or indirectly mitigate the conflicts in gradient directions? Are there any theoretical analyses, empirical experiments (maybe toy examples), or even intuitive explanations?
5. **Fairness of Comparative Experiments:** Combining loss balancing and gradient balancing is beneficial. Thus, directly comparing MB-MTL with existing gradient balancing methods might introduce unfairness. In the image classification scenario, when only the proposed gradient-magnitude balancing is employed, the performance is not optimal within gradient balancing methods (NashMTL yields better results). Would combining logarithmic transformation with NashMTL surpass MB-MTL?

### Summary
This paper proposes a dual-balancing multi-task learning (DB-MTL) method to alleviate the task-balancing problem in multi-task learning (MTL). DB-MLT attempts to combine a loss-scale balancing and a gradient-magnitude balancing. Specifically, the former performs a logarithm transformation on each task loss to ensure all losses have the same scale. The latter normalizes the gradients of all tasks to have the same magnitude as the maximum gradient norm. This guarantees the gradients contribute equally. Combining the two methods, DB-MTL achieves state-of-the-art performance on several MTL benchmark datasets, including scene understanding, image classification, and molecular property prediction. Ablation studies demonstrate both the loss-scale and gradient-magnitude balancing components are effective.

### Strengths
- The method is well-motivated. Experiments on various datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art performance. Ablations validate the efficacy of each component.
- The dual-balancing framework is reasonable. The loss-scale balancing via logarithmic transformation helps existing gradient methods. Normalizing gradients by the maximum norm is simple yet effective.
- The problem setup and methods are clearly explained.

### Weaknesses
- The novelty of this paper is limited. Loss and gradient balance have been extensively explored, and this paper does not have any new technical insights. It is only a combination of the existing works.
- The theoretical analysis is not sufficient to suppor the advantage of the proposed method. Proving convergence guarantees or other theoretical properties of DB-MTL could reveal more advantages over existing methods.
- Detailed experimental analyzing on why DB-MTL outperforms certain baselines is missing.
- The discription of the intuition is not clear.

### Questions
- Can you provide any theoretical analysis for DB-MTL? Convergence guarantees or other properties could reveal advantages over existing methods.
- For the loss transformation, is there an adaptive way to estimate the scale? Using the maximum seems to work well, but a learned loss scale could be interesting.

### Summary
This paper proposes a fairly simple but effective multi-task optimisation strategy with two key components: i) Optimising on log loss for scale balancing; and ii) applying l2-normalisation on aggregated gradients via EMA for gradient balancing. Each component can actually be combined with existing multi-task optimisation strategies, and have shown improved performance to validate the effectiveness. The paper presents experiments in standard multi-task learning benchmarks on dense prediction tasks, image classification tasks and molecular property prediction tasks.

### Strengths
1.	Idea is clean and simple and can be universally applied in many multi-task learning optimisation strategies.
2.	Experiments are well-rounded and covered in many settings and domains.
3.	Ablation shows the importance of each design component, presenting gradient-magnitude-balancing possibly is more important than loss-scale balancing.

### Weaknesses
No prominent weaknesses. See questions.

### Questions
1.	Since each design component shows to be effective and useful for existing multi-task optimisation strategy, I think it’s important to highlight DB could be considered as a drop-in enhancement to existing multi-task methods to further improve performance. 
2.	From the algorithm 1, it looks like the method should be able to run very fast, as similar to standard weight-based methods. Maybe it’s also useful to highlight its running speed, comparing to other gradient-based methods such as CAGrad, Nash-MTL which take considerably longer training time.
3.	It might be also interesting to see whether DB could also enhance auxiliary learning methods, such as AuxiLearn (Navon et al 2021), GCS (Du et al 2018) and Auto-Lambda (Liu et al 2022). This could further emphasise the design benefits and may approach even wider range of audiences.

### Summary
The paper tackles the problem of multi-task learning by proposing a dual-balancing strategy in the hard shared paradigm. For the task-shared parameters, gradients from different tasks are normalized to the maximum norm. For the task-specific parameters, logarithm transformations are applied to the loss so that all losses have similar scales. Ablation studies show that each of the proposed strategies can enhance other complementary methods. Besides, combining the two balancing can surpass all previous methods.

### Strengths
1. The paper proposes two novel strategies in the context of hard parameter sharing multi-task learning, one for gradient balancing and the other for loss balancing, which are well-motivated and easy to follow.
2. For each of the two strategies, it can boost other complementary methods when integrated, showing the general applicability.
3. The authors conduct extensive experiments on scene understanding, image classification and molecular property prediction to show the effectiveness of the dual-balancing strategy.

### Weaknesses
1. It would be better to compare the training time efficiency of each method.
2. More discussions can be made on the proposed method, such that the stability, e.g. will the balancing method cause the model to collapse during training?

### Questions
The authors could provide the training dynamics (both loss and gradient) such that readers can better understand how the balancing strategy affects the model learning.
