## Abstract
Edge-popup (EP) is a de facto algorithm to find \emph{strong lottery tickets (SLT)}, the sparse subnetworks that achieve high performance \emph{without any weight updates}. EP find the subnetworks by optimizing of a score vector representing the importance of each edge, and select subnetworks given optimized scores. This paper first show that such a simple gradient-based method result in suboptimal solution due to the existence of \emph{dying edges}. Specifically, we show that, most edges are \emph{never} selected during the search process, i.e., EP might be trapped around the local minima nearby random subnetworks and need help to search the entire spaces of subnetworks effectively. Unlike the standard iterative pruning that masks out a certain amount of edges and thus induce a similar problem to the dying edges, Soft iEP \emph{do not} disable the bottom edges at each cycle, i.e., leave a chance to be selected at the end regardless of whether it was chosen at the former cycle. Empirical validations show that iEP with soft pruning stably outperforms both EP and iEP w/ hard pruning on ImageNet, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100 and reduces dying edges. Notably, it discovered a subnetwork that is sparser than ResNet-34 but exceeds the performance of trained dense ResNet34 by over 2.4\% in the accuracy of ImageNet (76.0\% with 20M parameters). Our results also provide new insight into why iterative pruning helps to find good sparse networks.

### Summary
This paper studies the Strong Lottery Tickets Hypothesis (SLTH), which suggests that randomly initialized dense network itself contains sparse subnetworks that can achieve comparable performance with dense network. Specifically, this paper first explores the Edge Popup (EP) algorithm of SLTH that learns the sparse mask with a popup score, rather than update the weights, and empirically finds that EP results in a high ratio of dying edges, which is the edge that is never selected until the termination of the algorithm. As a result, the performance of the SLTH is hindered. To address this issue, this paper proposes Soft Iterative EP (Soft IEP). Soft IEP is the first attempt that applies the common iterative pruning method from LTH to SLTH. Besides, Soft IEP also suggests soft pruning, where are edges can be selected at the end of the EP. Experiments results on CIFAR and ImageNet with different architectures demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed Soft IEP.

### Strengths
- The topic about SLTH is interesting, which only learns the mask (structure) of the subnetwork, rather than the weights. Besides, the empirical analysis of EP from the dying ratio perspective is interesting, which has never been explored before. Moreover, this paper also present many evidence to support the claim about dying ratio. 

- The proposed solution with iterative pruning and soft edge is simple yet effective and well-motivated. 

- This paper is well-written and easy to follow.

### Weaknesses
- It’s better if this paper could discuss more benefits of SLTH. What is the major benefits of only learning mask, rather than weights? What is the current performance gap between learning mask and learning weights.  For example, based on Figure 5, we can see that a ResNet-50 with 8 millions number of parameters only achieve a performance around 70%, while at this 66% (1 - 8 / 23) sparsity level, many previous LTH with unstructured pruning  have show that they can still almost match the performance of the dense net (~76%). Thus, there is still a huge performance gap for SLTH-based methods. I would suggest the authors highlight the practical benefit of SLTH, and also show the performance gap with weight-based LTH.  
 
- The novelty of applying iterative pruning to the SLTH is kind of limited. Although this paper claims that iterative pruning has not been evaluated in SLTH, the proposed idea is not exciting considering that iterative pruning has been massively explored in the LTH community. 


- The investigation of the relationship between dying ratio and performance may be unclear. This paper explores different hyperparameters to optimize EP, including batch size, learning rate, etc. However, it’s unclear whether these hyper parameters themselves will hinders the performance. For example, it’s common that different optimizer will result in different performance when you learn the weights. Thus, the causal relationship between them (“”high dying ratio hinders the performance) cannot be verified. Besides, it’s unclear why change these hyperparameters can result in different dying ratio. It’s better for this paper to illustrate their relationship.  


- It would be advantageous to include mathematical formulations for the proposed soft edge. The current draft employs plain language to convey the concept, ensuring ease of comprehension but lacking the necessary technical rigor.

### Summary
The paper introduces a variant of the edge-popup algorithm that seeks to uncover strong lottery tickets—optimally pruned neural network architectures—by substituting the traditional rigorous pruning approach with a more lenient one. The authors delve into the concept of 'dying edges,' a seemingly-newly-introduced term coined in this paper to describe edges that are consistently overlooked during the optimization process of the milestone work edge-popup (EP), which they link to the performance of the final pruned network.

Providing a solid foundation, the paper lays out the necessary background for the newly proposed soft iterative edge popup (soft iEP). The authors build their case by discussing the limitations of the original iterative edge popup (iEP), particularly highlighting how the prevalence of dying edges can lead to inefficiencies. They draw a correlation between the quantity of dying edges and the test accuracy of the network.

Finally, the authors demonstrate the soft iEP approach effectively lowers the dying ratio and enhances performance as well; this is evidenced by experimental results on CIFAR10/100 and ImageNet using some ResNet architectures. Additionally, the paper benchmarks the proposed method against other variations of EP to provide a thorough comparison and underscore the benefits of their approach.

### Strengths
1. The paper is well-structured, offering sufficient background and well-supported claims with evidence to readers.
2. Soft iEP is simple yet effectively reduces dying edges, which results in performance improvement.
3. The experimental studies are well-executed offer meaningful insights.

### Weaknesses
1. The concept of soft pruning, also known as soft filter pruning, is not novel, having been explored in such previous works [1,2], which should be cited in this paper as it is connected to the idea of finding SLTs.

2. It would be great to see more experiments with more advanced models. For example with an advanced CNN such as ConvNeXt and the recently proposed vision transformers, the proposed method would be stronger.

3. The proposed method of soft iEP presumably has many variations for reviving edges, but the details in the manuscript are unclear to me.

### Questions
1. Can the authors give any (architectural) differences between the two final networks pruned by iEP and soft IEP having the same pruned weights ratio? 

2.  This reviewer suggests that the paper could be strengthened by comparing the proposed method with other approaches in the domain of strong lottery tickets if such methods exist and are available.

3. This reviewer is curious about the applicability of the proposed method to pretrained models, given that hard pruning (hard-EP) has been shown to underperform with randomly initialized weights as shown in [1].

### Summary
This paper empirically studies of the edges in network pruning, specifically coupling the performance of pruning with dying ratio of edges, and propose a soft edge-popup algorithm to allow selections of bottom edges, in order to improve the pruning performance.

### Strengths
This paper explores/defines the exploration efficacy of the pruning process from the perspective of dying edge ratio (proportion of edges have never been explored), and the empirical study and figure illustrations around this concept looks interesting and solid to me. Meanwhile, this paper specifically focus and discuss EP algorithm with important details, which I find it very helpful to understand the gist of the paper.

### Weaknesses
The technical or algorithmic contribution is rather limited. The soft iEP differs its hard counterpart from whether using mask, allowing the bottom edges to selected (Fig. 6 (b)). This is expected but not sure how such difference contributes to the final performance. It seems that higher exploration efficacy implies better performance, which from my point of view, has not really been given any rationales.

### Questions
1. It would be great to give a detailed description in formulas (Appendix should be fine) to summarize the algorithms.
2. Please give rationale and motivation of the higher exploration efficacy, the better performance?
3. For training such soft iEP, how does this converge compared to the hard one?
4. Please discuss the dying ratio and pruning performance for different randomized initializations of the network.
5. How many only visited once edges are finally retained?
6. To what degree are the final prune edges similar of soft and hard iEP edges? (maybe compare the edge graph similarity?)

### Summary
This paper empirically identifies that the edge-popup technique yields suboptimal performance because of the existence of a high dying edge ratio resulting from poor exploration of the  search space. To tackle this, the paper proposes a Soft iEP technique that iteratively prunes the subnetwork from the initialized network based on the Edge-Popup algorithm. The proposed technique keeps the chance for the bottom edges to be selected in each cycle and thereby effectively explores search space leading to a lower dying edge ratio. The experimentation conducted on multiple datasets showcases the effectiveness of the proposed technique.

### Strengths
* The motivation behind proposing the Soft iEP is well justified with the help of multiple empirical evidence. Also, the authors have done a good job in terms of empirically identifying the problem of dying edge in the Edge-Popup (EP) algorithm. 
* The experimentation is conducted on a wide range of datasets ranging from easy datasets (e.g., Cifar10) to difficult datasets (e.g., ImageNet).
* The superior performance of the proposed Soft iEP is very convincing and intuitive. 
* The paper is well written with the help of multiple visualizations. Also, the writing is very coherent and easy to follow.

### Weaknesses
* One of the reasons for having increased popularity of the EP algorithm is its computational efficiency compared to iterative techniques. Specifically, without iterative pruning, we can easily get the desired subnetwork (winning ticket) in one-shot training. The proposed technique misses the key advantage of the EP algorithm as the proposed Soft iEP requires iterative pruning. Therefore, the proposed technique may be computationally expensive and may limit its applicability in crucial domains such as large language models (LLM) where the computational cost is very expensive. 
* The proposed techniques miss the multiple baselines that do not require iterative pruning but still perform exploration [1, 2, 3]. It is important to discuss how their proposed technique compares with those techniques in terms of methodology as well as experimental results. 
* It would be interesting to see how the dying edge phenomenon scales with respect to the size of the network. It may be the case that for the bigger architecture model, the impact of the dying edge is less. To assess the robustness of the proposed technique for different architectures, the authors may be required to consider the higher capacity models (such as ResNet101, ViT) especially for the Cifar10 and Cifar100 datasets.

### Summary
Summary: 
To tackle the inefficient dying edge phenomenon when training a sparse model with the strong lottery ticket hypothesis, this paper proposes a soft iterative edge-pop-up to explore possible edges that are masked earlier in training with an iteratively increasing pruning ratio. Experiments on training Resnet model families on ImageNet and CIFAR show that soft iEP improves EP and sometimes even outperforms the dense counterpart.

### Strengths
Pros: 
1. Good preliminary study to intuitively show the widely existing dead edge problems and detrimental high dying ratio to pruning performance.
2. The writing is clear and easy to follow.

### Weaknesses
Cons: 
1. Need comparison to some "drop and then grow" pruning methods in LTH like Rigging the Lottery and its following works. In the related studies, the authors explained that the difference between SLTH and LTH is that SLTH assumes there are strong subnets in dense models without training. However, the methods and experiments involve model training. Therefore, it is necessary to compare dynamic sparse training methods in LTH.
2. Soft pruning was directly added to iEP and the best-performing learning rate rewinding setting during the experiment. Need ablation studies: (1) decompose soft pruning and iEP to examine which contributes most; (2) combine soft pruning with different variants of iterative pruning to demonstrate its effectiveness.
3. Similar to cons 1, related studies compared in the experiment only include IteRand about iterative pruning. And IteRand is not implemented with the Wide ResNet-50 setting.
4. Figure 6(b) is difficult to comprehend, as the x-axis and the red and blue lines all refer to the weight remaining rate.
5. DST based approaches like RigL and ITOP should serve as necessary baselines for empirical comparisons.
6. The comparison in Figure 5 is unfair. Although the dense network (ResNet18) has similar parameters counts with a sparse ResNet50, the former needs much less training time since the proposed sparsity is unstructured and hard for acceleration. More discussions are needed to avoid misleading.
7. Also, the dense baseline performance is weak. Based on previous literature like https://arxiv.org/pdf/2210.04092.pdf, the dense ResNet-18 on CIFAR10 and CIFAR100 can reach ~95% and ~77% respectively, which are ~5% and ~17% accuracies better then the ones in Figure 5.
