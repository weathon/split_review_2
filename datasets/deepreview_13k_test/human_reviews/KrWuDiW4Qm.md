# MetaPhysiCa: Improving OOD Robustness in Physics-informed Machine Learning

- Decision: Accept
- Scores: 8, 6, 8, 6

## Abstract
A fundamental challenge in physics-informed machine learning (PIML) is the design of robust PIML methods for out-of-distribution (OOD) forecasting tasks. These OOD tasks require learning-to-learn from observations of the same (ODE) dynamical system with different unknown ODE parameters, and demand accurate forecasts even under out-of-support initial conditions and out-of-support ODE parameters. In this work we propose to improve the OOD robustness of PIML via a meta-learning procedure for causal structure discovery. Using three different OOD tasks, we empirically observe that the proposed approach significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art PIML and deep learning methods (with $2\times$ to $28\times$ lower OOD errors).

### Summary
The paper focuses on the significant challenge of forecasting tasks within dynamical systems where the underlying ordinary differential equation (ODE) parameters may vary. The key contribution is the application of a meta-learning procedure for causal structure discovery, which aims to improve model performance even when faced with initial conditions and ODE parameters that lie outside the training distribution. The proposed method is tested across three different OOD tasks, and the results indicate a substantial performance improvement over existing state-of-the-art physics-informed machine learning and deep learning methods.

### Strengths
- The paper's approach to modeling dynamical systems by interpreting them as structural causal models within a meta-learning framework is both novel and significant. This perspective opens new avenues for understanding and forecasting complex systems.

- The framework's construction is innovative, and the incorporation of the V-REx penalty to uncover causal structures appears effective.

### Weaknesses
- My main concern with this paper is the robustness and completeness of the empirical results. Authors developed two OOD scenarios and picked one for each dynamical system. The selection of OOD scenarios for each dynamical system requires further clarification, as the current rationale is not provided. In addition, the authors use limited in- and out-distribution "pairs": only one single distribution for training, and another single distribution for testing. This limits the assessment of method generalizability. Expanding the experimental design to include both OOD scenarios across all dynamical systems and a broader range of distribution pairs would likely enhance the validity of the findings.

- The methodological scope is limited by not accounting for interactions between basis functions, potentially restricting the model's capability to learn more intricate dynamics. Additionally, by confining the approach to ODE-style dynamics, it may not accurately reflect the complexity of real-world systems, such as those found in real world epidemics.

- While the method can integrate prior knowledge of dynamical systems into the creation of basis functions, it appears that this is the extent to which such insights can be utilized. Expanding the method to incorporate prior knowledge more deeply could further improve model performance and applicability.

### Questions
- Is it possible for you to run extra experiments for multiple in- and out-distribution "pairs" and show that the results are consistent? I'd be happy to increase my score after seeing a more robust evaluation of the method.

- A real epidemic does not follow the SIR model but there are some characteristics of the SIR model that are useful. How can we adapt your work to handle such real-world dynamical system?

### Summary
The authors propose a meta-learning based method for physics-informed out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization. Specifically, the proposed method comprises a set of basis functions that are assumed given where each basis function is governed by its set of parameters (unknown). Additionally, it is assumed that the proposed system is trained on a set of related training instances (from some dynamical system e.g., pendulum) to learn the parameters of the basis functions (specifically a sub-set of the basis functions that govern the task) as well as to learn parameters that are involved in the linear combination of these basis functions. These basis functions (with appropriate learned parameters) and their linear combination comprises the causal structure discovery mechamism (CSM) proposed in the paper. Additionally, the authors adopt a meta-learning approach where the CSM model (trained on multiple trajectories with different initial conditions and PDE parameters) is additionally also trained with a invariant-risk minimization (IRM)  type of loss (specifically minimal variance of loss across all training tasks).  Once the model is trained with the CSM + IRM based losses, the test-time comprises a few-shot adaptation (only of a subset of parameters of the model) to the  related but new (initial, PDE parameters) condition of the dynamical system.  

The authors demonstrate that the proposed model in multiple contexts (i) epidemic modeling (ii) predator-prey systems (iii) pendulum system  and showcase better OOD adaptation compared to traditional physics-informed approaches as well as other approaches like Neural ODE.

### Strengths
- The problem of OOD generalization is important and is a significant challenge (as highlighted in the paper) for physics-informed neural networks (transductive or inductive) as well as traditional neural network models to accomplish. However, any useful neural network model applied to scientific domains needs to have good OOD generalization capabilities. Hence, the authors develop an effective solution to an important problem. 
 

- Overall, the paper is well written, and the related work and methodology as well as results are well organized and clear.

### Weaknesses
- Testing is required on more challenging settings (e.g., 1D convection, convection diffusion other “stiff” PDE / ODE settings where physics informed approaches are known to fail). 
 

- The assumption that the collection of m possible (appropriate) basis functions are always available seems too strong to the reviewer. It would be helpful if more clarity about this can be provided by the authors. Basically, this strong assumption might significantly reduce the impact of the proposed method as the full set of basis functions might not always be available to select from.

### Questions
1. Have authors tested on more challenging (stiff PDE, ODE settings and on settings like 1D convection, convection-diffusion where traditional physics-informed models fail)? 

2. Could you please expound on the assumption of the m possible basis functions? Are there contexts where all sub-parts of the full applicable basis might not be present in the pre-trained network? How can the proposed method adapt to this OOD scenario? Has this been tested?

### Summary
In the paper, the authors propose an approach to prove more robust dynamical system forecasting, for physics-informed algorithms. The paper first describes the out-of-distribution (OOD) setting with transduction and inductive setting, where the algorithm alignment is needed for the accurate forecasting. For the proposed model, MetaPhysiCa, the authors first describe the deterministic underlying structural model, where at each time step, the hidden state $x$ can go through different bases functions. The derivative is a combination of the task-specific coefficients and selected bases functions. Given the training data, the authors extract the underlying causal structure from causal structure discovery problem (minimal causal structure with the last number of edges). The structure parameters, global parameters and task-specific parameters are minimized using the binarization tricks to approximate. The authors have provided the proof to show that MetaPhysiCa can correct identify the causal structure. During the test time, the task-specific parameters can be adjusted. In the experiments, the authors show that the MetaPhysiCa can perform better than existing PIML method in the tasks.

### Strengths
(S1) The paper introduces a novel concept, MetaPhysciCA, which focuses on out-of-distribution learning in the PIML setting. This approach is distinct from the state-of-the-art methods and addresses an important robustness problem that is yet to be solved in the research community.

(S2) The paper is clearly written. The authors give a clear problem definition (inductive setting and transductive setting) with compelling examples (Figure 1-2). There are several components in the methodology, yet each component is clearly addressed. The author has also provided a theoretical proof to show that the method can correctly identify the underlying causal structure.

(S3) The empirical results presented in the paper show that the proposed method outperforms standard PIML methods in the OOD setting, showcasing the quality and robustness of MetaPhysiCa. Given the ubiquity and increasing reliance on PIMLs in real-world applications, the capability to adapt to real-time data shifting and providing robust estimation under underspecified physics prior is important. MetaPhysiCa's methodology has potential impact for ensuring PIML’s reliability.

### Weaknesses
W1. While MetaPhysiCa showcases success in the datasets mentioned, it is usually the case that the the correctly specified basis function is included in the search space of $f$. MetaPhsysiCa’s performances in the set of incorrectly specified basis function is not known.

W2. There should be an ablation study that shows MetaPhysiCa’s performances for a relatively small pool of $f$ basis functions and a relatively large pool of $f$ basis functions. For example, for the large pool of $f$, does learning the causal structure more difficult?

W3. The paper mentions that joining optimizing all parameters result in comparable experiments than bi-level optimization. But the experiments in the main body of the paper forego showing this. The authors should consider adding experiment results that shows bi-level optimization results as well as the jointing optimization.

### Questions
Q1.  The authors have described the MetaPhysiCa primarily for ODE tasks. However, could the MetaPhysiCa be adapted to PDE setting, for example, for finding the parameters for Burger’s Equation? How could MetaPhysiCa be adapted to methods such as PINN?

Q2. Why are only the task-specific parameters updated during the test-time? Why would causal structure not needed to be updated? For fraudulent detection system, it is possible that a ODE function shifts during the test time.

Q3. Theorem 1 is only guaranteeing that MetaPhysiCa identified the true causal structure. What is the theoretical guarantee that MetaPhysiCa discovers the good task specific parameters, especially for few-shot updates during the test time?

Q4. Could the authors provide more insights into the computational complexity introduced by MetaPhysiCa, especially for more larger pools of $f$ basis functions and increasing number of observations?

Q5. Would MetaPhysicCa be adapted or be integrated into PIML methods that contain different loss functions?  Is that as simple as adding the additional loss terms into Equation 4?

### Summary
This paper adopted a meta-learning technique to improve the robustness of OOD. The experimental results demonstrate the proposed method exhibits a better generalization ability.

### Strengths
1. Develop a meta-learning technique for identifying the underlying governing equations of dynamical systems.

2. Formulate it as a bi-level optimization problem

3. The evaluation results have demonstrated the good performance of the proposed method over baselines.

### Weaknesses
1. How many basis functions are used in the experiments? If there is no prior knowledge, the number of basis functions will be very large.

2. The proposed method still adopts the SINDy-like approach in which all key terms should be included in a set of basis functions. It may not work on complex equations like $dx/dt = 1/(x_1^2 + sin (x_2^3+x_3))$

3. Conduct experiments on more complex systems in the CoDA paper, such as reaction-diffusion system and Navier-Stokes system

4. I am curious about the causal structure in Fig. 4. Which two terms in each of the three dynamical systems have causal relationships? Please give an example to explain it. It seems that the authors did not discuss this in the Evaluation section.

5. Please conduct experiments on noisy data.
