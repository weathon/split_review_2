# Effective Structural Encodings via Local Curvature Profiles

- Decision: Accept
- Scores: 6, 8, 6, 3

## Abstract
\noindent Structural and Positional Encodings can significantly improve the performance of Graph Neural Networks in downstream tasks. Recent literature has begun to systematically investigate differences in the structural properties that these approaches encode, as well as performance trade-offs between them. However, the question of which structural properties yield the most effective encoding remains open. In this paper, we investigate this question from a geometric perspective. We propose a novel structural encoding based on discrete Ricci curvature (\emph{Local Curvature Profiles}, short \emph{LCP}) and show that it significantly outperforms existing encoding approaches. We further show that combining local structural encodings, such as LCP, with global positional encodings improves downstream performance, suggesting that they capture complementary geometric information. Finally, we compare different encoding types with (curvature-based) rewiring techniques. Rewiring has recently received a surge of interest due to its ability to improve the performance of Graph Neural Networks by mitigating over-smoothing and over-squashing effects. Our results suggest that utilizing curvature information for structural encodings delivers significantly larger performance increases than rewiring

### Summary
The paper addresses the crucial issue of improving the performance of GNNs through structural encodings. The authors present a novel approach based on discrete Ricci curvature, termed Local Curvature Profiles (LCP), and demonstrate its significant effectiveness in enhancing GNN performance. They also investigate the combination of local structural encodings with global positional encodings and compare these encoding types with curvature-based rewiring techniques. The paper makes important contributions to the field of Graph Machine Learning and provides valuable insights into the potential of curvature-based encodings.

==================================

Update: I appreciate the authors for answering my questions and providing more experimental results. I would like to keep my scores.

### Strengths
- LCP provides a unique way to encode the geometry of a node's neighborhood, and the paper convincingly demonstrates its superior performance in node and graph classification tasks.

- The paper investigates the combination of local structural encodings with global positional encodings, showing that they capture complementary information about the graph. This finding is valuable as it suggests that using a combination of different encoding types can result in enhanced downstream performance. The authors provide empirical evidence to support this claim.

- A theoretical analysis of LCP's computational efficiency and its impact on expressivity is included in the paper.

### Weaknesses
- Some parts of the introduction are a bit dense and may be challenging for readers not deeply familiar with the field. A clearer presentation of the background and motivation could benefit a wider audience.

- Including experiments on a more diverse set of datasets and domains would be better.

### Questions
How well does LCP generalize across different domains, and what factors might influence its applicability in practical scenarios?

Are there any computational bottlenecks when implementing LCP in large-scale graph datasets, and what strategies or optimizations could be considered to address these issues?

### Confidence
2: You are willing to defend your assessment, but it is quite likely that you did not understand the central parts of the submission or that you are unfamiliar with some pieces of related work. Math/other details were not carefully checked.

### Summary
This paper proposes improving graph neural networks, e.g. graph convnets. The idea is to encode structural information through Local Curvature Profiles, enabling each node to better characterize the geometry of its neighborhood. Instead of rewriting the graph, the proposed approach adds summary statistics about each node's local curvature to the features of each node.

On a variety of different tasks, this approach improves the performance of the resulting graph neural nets.

### Strengths
This paper seems reasonable to this reviewer, outperforming baseline encoding approaches or approaches that require rewiring. 

Perhaps most surprising to this reviewer is that it improves performance of GATs (seemingly similar to transforms in that they use self-attention?) as it would seem reasonable that such a network would be able to dynamically compute something similar to these statistics.

The experiments seem reasonably done at least to this reviewer (not an expert in this area at all), involving both LCP itself as well as combining it with positional encoding, and then later rewiring.

### Weaknesses
It's not obvious to this reviewer what the weaknesses are. The main concern to this reviewer is that some large pretrained transformer could do better than any of the proposed methods, but that's a very general concern these days. Possibly this approach or GNNs in general could work better on more specialized tasks where there are a very large number of nodes.

### Questions
How do the results compare versus model size? E.g. could making a GCN deeper allow it to implicitly compute these kinds of features itself? What's stopping it from doing that?

4: You are confident in your assessment, but not absolutely certain. It is unlikely, but not impossible, that you did not understand some parts of the submission or that you are unfamiliar with some pieces of related work.

### Summary
The paper proposes to use local curvature profile (LCP) for structural encoding in graph neural networks. Several notions of local curvatures are investigated and superior experimental results are shown on several datasets as compared to the baseline.

### Strengths
The introduction of the local curvatures for structural encoding in graph neural networks is the key contribution of the paper.  A theoretical result (Theorem 1) is also established suggesting improved expressivity due to LCP. However the result is rather qualitative without a quantitative characterization of the extent to which the expressivity is improved. Thus the theoretical development is rather light.

Overall the paper is very well written and, for most parts, easy to read. 

The idea is sound and the experiments look convincing to this reviewer.

### Weaknesses
I do not see an obvious weakness in the paper, just like I do not see its development particularly striking.  To me, the paper falls into those works that have a sound intuitive idea, which is validated via empirical evaluation. The paper does not appear to touch on the studied problem (i.e., the issues of over-smoothing and over-squashing) at a fundamental level or at depth. But it is perhaps above the acceptance threshold.

### Summary
The paper explores the efficacy of various structural encodings, along with their integration with global positional encodings, to enhance the performance of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) in downstream tasks. It introduces a novel structural encoding known as LCP, derived from discrete Ricci curvature, which demonstrates superior performance compared to existing encoding methods.

### Strengths
1. The article introduces LCP encoding which presents how curvature information may affect GNN performance, contributing to a better understanding of the research context and significance
2. The article conducts comprehensive experiments on various datasets; however, it could benefit from additional experiments to investigate the underlying reasons why LCP is effective

### Weaknesses
1. The article lacks explanations for some crucial implementation steps, making it confusing to read. I suggest the author improve the presentation and logic of the article to enhance clarity (see question 1 and 2)
2. Please provide definitions for variable names, such as 'd_max.' Currently, there are many variables in the article that are not explained, which can be challenging for newcomers to understand
3. In spite of keeping settings and optimization hyperparameters consistent among different settings, the authors should still provide the corresponding parameter configurations. This would aid in experiment reproducibility and, as a result, make the results more robust.
4. In Section 3.1, the authors mention, 'We believe that the curvature information of edges away from the extremes of the curvature distribution, which is not being used by curvature-based rewiring methods, can be beneficial to GNN performance.' I consider this assertion somewhat speculative, and I did not find any subsequent experiments that substantiate this claim. Would it be possible to include relevant ablation experiments to support this hypothesis?
5. In Section 3.1, the authors define LCP as 'five summary statistics of the CMS.' I would appreciate a more detailed motivation for this particular definition. Additionally, it would be beneficial to include relevant ablation experiments that showcase the impact of removing specific summary statistics to demonstrate their significance in influencing the final results.

### Questions
1. Could the authors please provide a detailed explanation of the specific approach referred to as 'no encodings (NO)'?
2. Could the authors please elaborate on how the combination of LCP encoding and position encoding is implemented in Section 4.2.2? I couldn't find any details regarding the actual implementation.
