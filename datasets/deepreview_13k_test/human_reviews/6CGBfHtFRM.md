# Mean Field Langevin Actor-Critic: Faster Convergence and Global Optimality beyond Lazy Learning

- Decision: Reject
- Scores: 6, 5, 5, 5, 5

## Abstract
We study how deep reinforcement learning algorithms learn meaningful features when optimized for finding the optimal policy. 
In particular, we focus on a version of the neural actor-critic algorithm where both the actor and critic are represented by over-parameterized neural networks in the mean-field regime, and are updated via temporal-difference (TD) and policy gradient respectively. 
Specifically, for the critic neural network to perform policy evaluation,  
we propose $\textit{mean-field Langevin TD learning}$ method (MFLTD), an extension of the mean-field Langevin dynamics with proximal TD updates, and compare its effectiveness against existing methods through numerical experiments. 
In addition, for the actor neural network  to perform policy updates, 
we propose $\textit{mean-field Langevin policy gradient}$ (MFLPG),  which implements policy gradient in the policy space through a version of Wasserstein gradient flow in the space of network parameters. 
We prove that MFLTD finds the correct value function, and the sequence of actors created by MFLPG created by the algorithm converges linearly to the globally optimal policy of the Kullback Leibler divergence regularized objective. To our best knowledge, 
we provide the first linear convergence guarantee for neural actor-critic algorithms with $\textit{global optimality}$ and $\textit{feature learning}$.

### Summary
This paper considers the mean-field neural actor-critic algorithm for deep reinforcement learning. Both policy and Q-function are parametrized by a two-layer neural network. With appropriate assumptions, the authors conduct analysis in the mean-field limit region. The main contributions in this paper are
1. Authors introduce a mean-field Langevin TD learning algorithm for the critic update. It is a double-looped algorithm, and specifically the inner loop is based on the gradient descent of the regularized loss function discussed in Nitanda et al., 2022 and Chizat, 2022.  For the discrete time analysis, the paper provides a time-averaged convergence rate $O(1/T)$.
2. Authors introduce a mean-field Langevin policy gradient algorithm for the actor update. From the continuous-time perspective, the paper provides the guarantee of global optimality and a linear convergence rate.

### Strengths
The algorithms for the actor and critic updates combined with feature learning are original, and rigorous analysis is provided. Moreover, the authors claim that the paper gives the first global optimality result of the stationary point of the MFLPG using a one-point convexity method. Numerically the paper shows that it outperforms NTK and single loop TD algorithm by achieving lower mean squared Bellman errors.

### Weaknesses
1. The writing of this paper is very dense and the text arrangement makes it not easy to track definitions and theorems. I suggest that all equations in the main text should be labeled, and for notations in the appendix, authors should try to make an enumerated list to summarize all definitions of $\tilde{f}$, $\tilde{\rho_t}$, $\hat{\rho_t}$, $Q^{(l)}$, $Q_{\pi}$, $q_s$, $q^{(l)}$, $\cdots$ to assist reading. 

2. The paper does not show how the actor and critic updates are combined together. A unified analysis for the combined algorithm would also be useful. However, I cannot find the combined algorithm anywhere in this paper. 

3. The discrete time analysis of MFLPG, unlike MFLTD, is missing. 

4. Many parts of the proof are unclear to me, I will explain them in details in the Questions section.

5. The technique used to show linear convergence of inner loop MFLD does not seem to be new compared to previous established works.

### Questions
In the appendix, 

1. Is $||f||\{\mu,2\}$ the same as $\mathbb{E}_{\mu}[f^2]^{1/2}$? 

2. On page 16, in C.1, (12), where is $\frac{\lambda_{TD}}{2}\mathbb{E}(||\omega||^2) +Z$ ?. Also, $s\in [0,T_{TD}] $ should be $l\in[0,T_{TD}]$.

3. On page 16, $\mathbb{E}[(Q^{(l)}-\mathcal{T}Q^{(l)})(Q^{(l+1)}-Q_\pi)] = \mathbb{E}[\Delta Q^{(l+1)}(I-\gamma \mathcal{P})\Delta Q^{(l)}]$, can you give a detailed derivation?

4. On page 18, ``using the strong convexity of $L_l$", can you explain or add a reference to it?


5. On page 19, the explanation of $D_{KL}(q_0||\nu)=0$ is missing.

6. On page 21, the expression of $J[\rho]$ is different from the one on page 3, can you add details to explain why they are the same?

7. On page 22, $g_t[\rho_t]$ does not look like the one defined on page 5, (5). A derivation for that equivalence is missing.

8. On page 22, (31), I don't see how the last inequality holds. In 1D, it means that $2ab\geq a^2-b^2$, how could it be true?

In the main text,

9. On page 4, $\mathcal{S}\times \mathcal{A}\subset \mathbb{R}^d$ does not look correct.

10. Assumption 2 needs a further verification. What do you mean by "$R$ is the boundary of neural networks Q-function estimator"? Or say ``neural network radius" mentioned on page 20? I suggest that giving a simple example and computation would make this assumption more convincing.

### Summary
This work proposes actor-critic methods where both the actor and critic are represented by over-parameterized neural networks in the mean-field regime as shown in Eq. (3). They proposed entropy and $\ell_2$ norm regularized expected reward objective, and its policy gradient update (continuous and discrete-time),  as shown in Algorithm 1. The critic update contains two loops (to guarantee monotonic improvement), as shown in Algorithm 2.

Under several assumptions, the authors proved that Algorithm 2 converges in terms of Q-function with rate $1/T$, verifying its validness as a policy evaluation algorithm, and then Theorem 2 shows that Algorithm 1 converges linearly toward globally optimal policy value up to bias introduced by regularization. Numerical results verify the theoretical findings.

### Strengths
1. Actor-critic methods with neural network parameterizations and theoretical guarantees give promising results, justifying their empirical success.
2. The writing and presenting results are clear and easy to follow.

### Weaknesses
1. Hard to verify assumptions, which weaken the aim of supporting empirical success by theoretical footing.
2. It is unclear how practical those proposed actor-critic methods are. The authors argued that those assumptions are moderate, but the work also does not show the proposed methods are still close enough to what have been used in practice.

### Questions
How do we justify widely used actor-critic methods in practice are learning representations in the same way of how the proposed methods learn?

### Summary
The work presents a convergence theorem for neural actor-critic algorithms with feature learning (i.e. in the mean feild setting). They do so by formulating neural networks as a collection of $m$ neurons and consider the mean filed behavior as $m \to \infty$ under a pecific parametrization of the single hidden layer NNs. Both the actor and critic NNs are parameterized similarly. The agent is assumed to be optimizing an entropy regularized objective and optimized via minimizing a surrogate first variation. They employ a dual loop learning mechanism for the $Q$ function, within every policy improvement step. They show the soundness of their methodology:
1. they show "one step" improvement of the inner loop of TD learning,
2. convergence of the $Q$-function's estimate to the $Q$-function corresponding to the policy in that step
3. convergence to globally optimal stationary distribution with bias dependent on the entropy regularization's weight.

Finally, they demonstrate the efficacy of their proposed method in a toy environment.

### Strengths
The paper has the following strengths:

1. The authors clearly state and back each one of their assumptions.
2. The authors build the algorithm and the theoretical framework for analysis in a structured manner.
3. They closely and clearly follow previous work on neural TD learning for NTK parametrization (Cai et. al 2019 and Zhang et. al 2020) while formulating the problem.
4. The overall results and conclusion are pretty convincing (although I am not certain of all the proofs and details).

### Weaknesses
I see a couple of weaknesses:

1. **Weaknesses in writing:**  there are issues with notation and referencing sections of appendix. As a reader I would be interested in appendix sections with various proofs and technical concepts. For more details see the minor issues listed below. Further, there is some lack of clarity when it comes to interpreting the various Lemmas and Theorems. There are some notational issues as well which make it harder for me to interpret the math and the results.
2.  **Issues with feature learning in RL:** while the authors claim that the NN learns features they do not define it in context of RL. I understand that mean field parametrization is a feature learning regime as opposed to NTK but I dont see how it relates to RL? In section 5, the claim is that MFLTD performs better by reducing the Bellman error better than NTK-TD due to better feature learning but I am unclear how it would follow that feature learning helps achieve this. What contribution does feature learning make to agent performance or to minimizing the TD error? Further, this is only shown for the td-learning sub-loop (MFLTD) and not for the broader algorithm MFLPG. Any insight into how feature learning effects an RL agent's learning trajectory would be meaningful and go a long way in answering the primary question posed in the introduction.

***Minor issues:***
1. Agarwal et. al on top of page 3 is missing the year. 
2. Section 3.1 for Log-Sobolev inequality point to Appendix and please offer some explanation.
3. Section 3.1: please cite previous work for the claim that regularization smoothens the problem
4. "is a standard Gaussian distribution simply." -> "is a standard Gaussian distribution."
5. Point to the proof of Proposition 1 in Appendix and also the related Appendix sub-section which contains the definition for First variation of Functionals.
5. Section 3.1: cite for the connection between the Fokker Planck equation and the SDE.
6. Algorithm 2 is referenced in algorithm 1 without any explanation, I would add one liner on how Algorithm 2 is for TD-learning.
7. Definition 1 in Appendix B.1: What is $\mathcal F$? It would be better defined or explained here.
8. $t$ is overloaded across Equations 5,6 and Section 2. One is agent time and another is gradient time step.
9. What do you mean by "From an argument similar to $\mathcal F$" in section 3.2?
10. Term $s$ is overloaded for the expression of $dw_s$ for Section 3.2, used as both state and time.
11. In the sentence with sample $(s, a, s', a')$ is introduced without explanation, where are these samples used? In the estimation of the loss in Equation (7)?
12. Equation (25) from Appendix referenced in the main body in Section 4 and this seems like a leap. 
13. $S$ as run-time is overloaded in Section 4.
14. Lemma 1: what is the difference between $\varsigma$ and $\varsigma_{\pi}$?
15. In various locations $Q_{\pi}$ and $Q_q$ are used which is ambiguous notation because $\pi$ is policy and $q$ is the initialization distribution of the NN.
16. Theorem 1: $s$ is overloaded.
17. Section 4: "takes advantage of the data-dependent advantage of neural networks" reads like it might be wrong.
18. It might be helpful to define the Radon-Nikodym Derivative in the Appendix.
19. Figure 1 left side: why is the x-axis starting from 1000?
20. Point to proof sections in the Appendix under all statements of Theorems and Lemmas.

### Summary
The authors propose an actor-critic method to solve the RL problem in discrete time and continuous state and action space. Both the policy and the Q function are parametrized by neural network with one hidden layer. The parametrization becomes distributions in the mean-field limit.  
The actor part is policy gradient w.r.t. regularized objective function, resulting in an Langevin dynamic of the actor distribution. The critic is temporal difference learning with two-level optimization. The inner loop is mean-field Langevin dynamic for q, while the out loop updates the critic objective.
The authors give proof for the convergence of the critic and whole algorithm in theorem 1 and 2 respectively. A numerical example is also provided to justify the algorithm.

### Strengths
The authors propose a new method to solve the RL problem and provide theoretical guarantee on the level of mean-field limit of neural network parametrization. This work contributes to enhancing our comprehension of deep learning techniques in solving RL problems.
The authors give a global convergence result for the algorithm.

### Weaknesses
Assumption 5 looks like a key part to fill the gap of the proof. But there is neither intuitive explanation, nor examples showing the validity of this. I am concerned about the existence of such a uniform positive lower bound 1/B. Given that the policy \pi belongs to a rich family, the advantage functions A_{\pi} should also span a rich spectrum, making this assumption hard to satisfy.
The authors explain that when M and B are large, the class \mathcal{F}_{R,M} is a wide class. This argument is fine for M, but for B I do not understand. It is unclear to me why Assumption 5 constitutes a constraint on the class \mathcal{F}_{R,M} and how increasing the value of B contributes positively. In my understanding, a larger class \mathcal{F}_{R,M} might increase the likelihood of satisfying this assumption. Also, this explanation does not justify the existence of a uniform positive lower bound 1/B.

### Questions
1.	Page 3. \varrho_\pi is the stationary distribution, while \nu_\pi is state visitation measure. I think the difference is that the latter depends on the initial distribution. If the initial distribution is the stationary distribution, then they should be the same, in which case the definition of \nu_\pi is unnecessary. However, the authors are using the policy gradient theorem, which only holds under stationary distribution.
2.	Page 4 SxA should be in R^(d-2) with d>3? There is 1 dimension for b and another one for the bias of the network.
3.	In the algorithm, is [0,m] a common notation for 1 to m? I think (0,m] makes more sense.
4.	Page 5. What’s the meaning of “its minimum value always upper bounds the mean squared error”?
5.	Page 6 upper part. There are two definitions for \mathcal{L}_l[q] and they do not coincide with each other. Maybe the second one should be modified.
6.	Lemma 1 eqn (9). The second term on the right looks confusing. Q^{(l+1)} is a function of (a,s) while q_*^{(l+1)} is a distribution with input \omega. Their difference doesn’t make sense. Please clarify this part.
7.	Page 7 bottom. What is the meaning of “can achieve the annealed Langevin dynamics by attenuating \lambda_{TD} by O(1/log(S))”?
8.	Page 2 bottom. In related works, when introducing the LQR settings, I think the work “Single Timescale Actor-Critic Method to Solve the Linear Quadratic Regulator with Convergence Guarantees” (JMLR2023) is also closely related.
9.	A notation issue: s is used for both state and time, which is a bit confusing. t is used for both the discrete time in RL and the continuous Langevin dynamic.
10.	The dynamic for critic for the outer loop is discrete. The continuous dynamic is only for inner loop. We only have Q^{(l)}, and Q_t is not explicitly defined. I think it is better to give an explicit definition of Q_t based on the inner loop and clarify (at Lemma 2) that at some points of t, it may not be differentiable.

There are also some typos:
Page 1: a considerable challenge “to” the optimization aspect
Page 5 after (6). g[\rho_t] should be g_t[\rho_t]?
Page 6 eqn (7). \mathcal{T} should be \mathcal{T}^\pi?
Page 8 Theorem 2. Let J* be “the” optimal expected total reward.

### Summary
To find the global optimal policy in reinforcement learning, this paper proposes the mean-field Langevin TD learning method (MFLTD) and mean-field Langevin policy gradient (MFLPG).
MFLTD converges to the true value function at a sublinear rate. MFLPG converges to the globally optimal policy of expected total reward at a linear convergence rate under KL-divergence regularization. This paper also provides the linear convergence guarantee for neural actor-critic algorithms with global optimality and feature learning.

### Strengths
1.	This paper proposes a new actor-critic approach.
2.	The theoretical analysis in this paper is sufficient.

### Weaknesses
1.	The reference part is missing in the main file.
2.	The global optimality should be analyzed in finite MDPs.
3.	The experiment is only on CartPole.
3.	There should be the experiment on the over-parameterized cases.

### Questions
1.	Why the networks are over-parameterized? In fact, more parameters can improve the performance of deep reinforcement learning. See OFE ([Ota et al., 2020] and [Ota et al., 2021]).
2.	Is the global optimality guaranteed in  finite MDPs? If some states are not reached, how can we guarantee global optimality?
3.	I would like the see the details of the feature learning in this work. Is there any encoded representation, like OFE and DREAMER?
