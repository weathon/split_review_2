- Decision: Accept
- Scores: 6, 6, 8, 6, 8

## Abstract
Large language models (LLMs) have shown the ability to produce fluent and cogent content, presenting both productivity opportunities and societal risks. To build trustworthy AI systems, it is imperative to distinguish between machine-generated and human-authored content. The leading zero-shot detector, DetectGPT~\citep{mitchell2023detectgpt}, showcases commendable performance but is marred by its intensive computational costs. In this paper, we introduce the concept of \emph{conditional probability curvature} to elucidate discrepancies in word choices between LLMs and humans within a given context.}, an optimized zero-shot detector, which substitutes DetectGPT's perturbation step with a more efficient sampling step. Our evaluations on various datasets, source models, and test conditions indicate that Fast-DetectGPT not only surpasses DetectGPT by a relative around 75\% in both the white-box and black-box settings but also accelerates the detection process by a factor of 340, as detailed in Table \ref{tab:intro_results}.

### Rating
6

### Rating Number
6

### Confidence
5: You are absolutely certain about your assessment. You are very familiar with the related work and checked the math/other details carefully.

### Summary
This paper improves the previous zero-shot method for detecting machine-generated text, DetectGPT, by replacing the perturbations as sampling using the same source model. Through the conditional probability curve, the author proves the effectiveness of this method. However, some experimental details are missing. More importantly, it did not mention another zero-shot work [1] released 5 months ago, which is the first to propose using a conditional probability curve for detection. Considering the similarity with the previous work [1], I would like to question the novelty of this paper since the long 5-month period clearly shows they are not concurrent work.

### Strengths
Strength:
The experiments over diverse datasets and models validate its effectiveness.
The author considers both open-sourced and closed-source models for the detection. Thus, the results can be easily reproduced.
The ablation study is enough to support its claim regarding parameter sensitivity, attacks, etc.
The paper is well-written and easy to follow. The tables and figures are arranged properly.

Missing reference: 
The following zero-shot method is missing either in the related work or in the baselines.

### Weaknesses
Weakness: 
1. The novelty is limited. The conditional probability curve has already been used by another zero-shot detector released 5 months ago [1]. However, the author neither cites this previous work nor discusses its differences. Considering the reference [1] work was released 5 months ago, I will not consider them as concurrent work.
2. It is not clear how the sampling process works. Give a passage x, how do you sample the alternative x’ ? Throughout the paper, I did not find any explanation for this.
3. How would the number of resampled instances influence the result? I did not find any result for this.
4. What is your default setting for the number of resampled instances for all the experiments? There is no clarification at all. 
5. How do you compare the speedup of your result over DetectGPT? Since the setting of your number of samples is unclear, I am not sure how did you compare it.


After rebuttal: Thanks for the clarification. The authors addressed most of my concerns. I would like to raise my score.

### Questions
Questions: 
The number of relative improvements is confusing. For example, in Table 1, why is the relative improvement 74.7%? In my understanding, (0.9887−0.9554)/0.9554*100%=3.48%. I do not understand why you report 74.7%.

### Confidence
3: You are fairly confident in your assessment. It is possible that you did not understand some parts of the submission or that you are unfamiliar with some pieces of related work. Math/other details were not carefully checked.

### Summary
This paper present an extension for DetectGPT, improving its efficiency and effectiveness. Relying on LLM's output probability, the model can threshold and perform zero-shot detection. Given a sentence, the model will first autoregressively predict x' from the input, and then use the original input x as input to a LLM but calculate the probability to predict x'. The modification is simple, and effective, which intuitively makes sense.

### Strengths
1. Improved results over DetectGPT for 3 points, with also faster speed.

2. The paper also showed results on detect GPT-4 results.

3. Analytical solution presented to avoid sampling approximation.

4. Ablation study on different lengths, decoding strategies, paraphrasing has been shown.

### Weaknesses
1. Presentation should be made clear. In the intro, paragraph 4 talked about the algorithm, yet it is unclear what does \tilt mean, what does <j means, also, the insight on why conditional probability is better is missing here, especially given that this is an extension of DetectGPT.

2. Is there results for speed comparison?

### Questions
Can you elaborate how \tilt {x} is generated? The reviewer is still confused.

Where does the acceleration come from? DetectGPT samples 100 pertrubations, how could this method accelerate 340 times? How many sampling does this needs?

### Summary
This paper proposes a new method for detecting LLM generated text that offers not only substantial performance benefits over DetectGPT but is also much less compute intensive. This is underpinned by a hypothesis that context matters in determining the differences between human and machine generated output. Their method accordingly uses a new criteria, the conditional probability curvature, which they find is more positive for LLM output than human. They perform experiments on a variety of datasets, and analyze robustness with respect to multiple text attributes.

### Strengths
- The proposed method is well motivated and described, and follows naturally from existing work
- The results are strong both from a performance and efficiency standpoint, compared to DetectGPT
- There is meaningful analysis with respect to attributes like passage length, paraphrasing, decoding strategies, etc.

### Weaknesses
- The discussion of prior work with respect to alternate detection strategies such as watermarking is shallow. The Kirchenbauer et al. 2023 paper is for example not cited. While this paper takes an orthogonal approach, it would be good to see some motivation or discussion around the tradeoffs of those strategies.
- The discussion of ethical considerations and broader impacts is lacking. Liang et al. 2023 has shown that LLM detection systems tend to exhibit higher false positive rates for non-native speakers. While this doesn’t invalidate the usefulness of this work, at the least it is worth engaging with that literature and acknowledging the potential problems at play with this task. At best there could be experiments on the relative performance of this system on text written by different demographics as compared to prior work. Granted there is some analysis of performance on languages besides English but this is also relatively shallow.

### Summary
This paper provides a state-of-the-art approach to zero-shot detection of LLM-generated text based on the difference of text likelihood and entropy. The paper provides extensive experiments, outperforming DetectGPT and a number of statistical baselines, as well as a supervised RoBERTa-based approach. The approach performs especially well when the scoring and target LLMs differ, e.g., when using GPT-J to detect whether an article was written by ChatGPT or GPT-4, which is a known failure mode of the existing DetectGPT approach. The paper also includes a number of experiments on different decoding strategies, reports performance across document lengths, and experiments with paraphrasing attacks.

### Strengths
The main strength of this work is the performance of the proposed method, which is better than much more computationally intensive zero-shot detectors such as DetectGPT. The set of ablation experiments (across languages, domains, decoding strategies, and paraphrase attacks) is also reasonably thorough, and the proposed method shows state-of-the-art performance across almost all tested conditions and datasets.

### Weaknesses
I find the framing of this paper and its comparison to be somewhat misleading. In particular, while the proposed method is described as a more efficient alternative to DetectGPT, its approach of computing the difference between the conditional probabilities of words and their alternatives is more similar to likelihood-based (Solaiman et al. 2019) or rank-based (GLTR; Gehrmann et al. 2019) approaches. Framing the method as a 340x speedup over DetectGPT therefore does not seem appropriate, although the method does seem to outperform existing zero-shot approaches. The sampling step in Fast-DetectGPT is also not clearly motivated and straightforwardly approximates an expected difference, so IMO the derivation could just immediately be replaced by the analytical solution. 

The paper also includes supervised RoBERTa baselines from OpenAI; however, these are not state-of-the-art for supervised detection. I believe the paper would be strengthened by comparison to state-of-the-art supervised methods, such as Ghostbuster (Verma et al. 2023) or GPTZero (commercial model), especially given the claims in Section 5 that supervised methods have limited generalization capabilities in LLM-generated text detection. Because the primary purpose of the paper is to evaluate and compare zero-shot methods, however, this does not affect my score or recommendation for the paper.

Minor notes:
- The paper mentions both Rank and LogRank baselines in Section 3.1 but only provides LogRank in tables

### Questions
- Did you experiment with computing the difference between the probability of the top-ranked word according to an LM scorer and the observed word? I expect this should be closely correlated with the metric proposed in this paper, and is also a slightly more informative alternative to the Rank model.

4: You are confident in your assessment, but not absolutely certain. It is unlikely, but not impossible, that you did not understand some parts of the submission or that you are unfamiliar with some pieces of related work.

### Summary
This paper introduces an extension of DetectGPT called Fast-DetectGPT, which modifies the curvature criterion to operate per token, using the difference between the observed and average log probabilities. This requires only a single parallel forward pass from each model.

### Strengths
The proposed idea is intuitive. The conditional probability function is naturally parallelized by autoregressive models and this value should naturally be close to a local maximum for a model that generated a given text. The connection to likelihood and entropy was also interesting.

The experimental results are strong and comprehensive. Fast-DetectGPT is faster than DetectGPT by over two orders of magnitude due to its parallelization and also shows performance gains across six datasets. Even in the black-box (surrogate) evaluation setting, DetectGPT achieves impressively high recall at low false positive rates. It also shows qualitatively better behavior than DetectGPT on longer passages, where quirks of T5 masking cause DetectGPT to start underperforming as sequence length increases beyond a point.

### Weaknesses
The end of section 2 shows that the criterion for Fast-DetectGPT can be seen as closely related to likelihood and entropy. While this connection is nice, I think the paper could be stronger if it analyzed each term in (7) in isolation to see what is most contributing to increased performance and why. Both likelihood and entropy are points of comparison in the result tables, but they do not perform as well; does their sum perform well? If not, and the denominator in (7) plays a key role, what probabilistic interpretation does that have, and what does that imply about the log_p surfaces of LLMs?

Not really a weakness and perhaps out of scope for this submission, but I'd be interested in knowing how Fast-DetectGPT would work for very long passages, given that it scales favorably with passage length.
