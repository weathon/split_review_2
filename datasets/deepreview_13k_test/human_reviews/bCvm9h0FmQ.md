# Causality-Based Black-Box Backdoor Detection

- Decision: Reject
- Scores: 3, 6, 6, 6

## Abstract
Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are known to be vulnerable to backdoor attacks, where attackers can inject hidden backdoors during the training stage. These attacks pose a serious threat to downstream users who unintentionally use third-party backdoored models (e.g., HuggingFace, ChatGPT). To mitigate the backdoor attacks, various backdoor detection methods have been proposed, but most of them require additional access to the model's weights or validation sets, which are not always available for third-party models. In this paper, we adopt a recently proposed setting, which aims to build a firewall at the user end to identify the backdoor samples and reject them, where only samples and prediction labels are accessible. To address this challenge, we first provide a novel causality-based perspective for analyzing the heterogeneous prediction behaviors for backdoor and clean samples. Leveraging this established causal insight, we then propose a Causality-based Black-Box Backdoor Detection algorithm, which introduces counterfactual samples as an intervention to distinguish backdoor and clean samples. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets validate the effectiveness and efficiency of our method. Our code is available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/CaBBD-4326/

### Summary
This paper proposes a method to detect backdoor samples at
run-time in the black-box scenario. The proposed method is based
on the causality analysis of the backdoor attacks. It works
by adding the noises under different magnitudes on the
examined images and detects backdoor samples by analyzing
the prediction's sensitivity to the magnitudes of the added
noise. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed method is
effective.

### Strengths
* Run-time backdoor sample detection in the black-box manner is an important problem.

* Both sample-agnostic attacks and sample-specific attacks are analyzed and discussed.

### Weaknesses
* The novelty of this paper might be limited as this paper
claims to be the first to analyze backdoor predictions from
a causal perspective, while previous work by Zhang et al.
[1] has conducted a similar analysis. This paper lacks a
detailed comparison between Zhang et al.'s causal analysis
and its own although it cites Zhang et al. The connection
between the proposed method and the causal analysis is not
clear. The definition of counterfactual samples and the
rationale behind considering noise-added samples as
counterfactual is vague. The proposed method distinguishes
backdoor samples and clean samples based on their different
sensitivity to the perturbations or augmentations, which
shares similar spirits to many existing methods such as
STRIP.

* There are some attacks that are robust to the
perturbations, such as Wang et al. [2]. The
color-style-based attacks [3,4,5] might also have stronger
robustness to the added noises compared to the attacks
involved in the experiments. The evaluation of these attacks
is missing. In addition, this paper only uses one simple
trigger pattern for the BadNet attack. It is suggested to
use more complicated patterns with large pixel values to
make the evaluation more comprehensive.

* This paper does not explore adaptive attacks where
attackers are aware of the defense mechanism and
actively attempt to circumvent it.

### Summary
This study focuses on the problem of identifying backdoor samples. The authors introduced a framework for backdoor detection for cases where a separate clean validation dataset is unavailable. Their methodology draws from techniques found in the causal inference literature. The proposed methods are subject to experimental evaluation, using three distinct datasets.

### Strengths
1. Addressing the problem of backdoor sample detection is important and the introduction of Causality-based techniques for defense is new, at least to me.
2. The paper is well-written and easy to follow.
3. The experimental results seem to be promising.

### Weaknesses
1. The proposed method has undergone testing with only four types of attacks, which may not provide sufficient evidence to establish its effectiveness convincingly. It is recommended that the authors consider assessing its performance against a broader range of attacks, including adaptive backdoor attacks such as TaCT [a] and Adaptive Blend [b], as well as non-poisoning based backdoor attacks.
2. Is there a theoretical rationale for utilizing counterfactual samples, even when dealing with a simple linear model? While the empirical observations provide some insight, it is essential to gain a deeper analytical understanding of the underlying mechanisms that drive the proposed method.

### Summary
The paper explores a black-box backdoor detection problem that can only access testing samples and labels. By analyzing the heterogeneous prediction behaviors for backdoored and clean samples, the paper proposes a Causality-based Black-Box Backdoor Detection (CaBBD) method to distinguish whether a sample is clean or backdoored. Specifically, CaBBD introduces counterfactual samples as intervention to check the difference of model outputs. Extensive experiments on three datasets and four datasets indicate the effectiveness of CaBBD.

### Strengths
The paper explains the intuition of proposed method from the causality-based perspective, which makes the proposed reasonable. Also, some preliminary experiments (e.g. figure 8) demonstrate the observations (at the bottom of page 5) that clean and backdoored samples can behave differently when attatching noises with different sthengths. The extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of proposed method in Table 1.

### Weaknesses
The experiments are not sufficient. The paper presents results using four attacks including BadNet, Blended, WaNet and ISSBA in Table 1. There is no clean-label attacks such as label-clean [1], SIG [2] and ReFool [3]. It is better to show the results on clean-label attacks.

Some typos are obvious. For example, in the caption of figure 2, (b) should be sample-agnostic trigger and (c) should be sample-specific trigger.

### Questions
Could the authors explain more about how to choose \alpha and \beta? Are the two hyperparameters are attack-dependent or dataset-dependent or architecture-dependent? It is better to do some ablation studies.

Is the proposed method sensitive to different network architectures? It is better to show results on the same dataset using different architectures.

### Summary
This paper analyzes the heterogenous prediction behaviors for backdoor samples and clean samples from the causality perspective and proposes a causality-based backdoor detection method that only requires the prediction labels from the victim model. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed detection method.

### Strengths
- Trendy topic
- Interesting and easy-to-understand attack pipeline
- Well-written

### Weaknesses
- Some presentations are misleading
- More explanations are needed
- More experiments are needed

### Questions
- The authors leverage causal inference to find that the backdoor attacks act as a confounder, creating a spurious path from backdoor samples to the modified prediction results. Based on this insight, the authors propose a causality-based black-box backdoor detection method that employs counterfactual samples as interventions on the prediction behaviors to effectively distinguish backdoor samples and clean samples. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed detection method.

- I appreciate that the paper is well-written, especially the section where the authors use causal inference to explain the different behaviors between backdoor samples and clean samples. Their detection method is interesting and easy to understand.

- In Figure 2(f), the authors aim to show that images with sample-specific triggers promptly deviate from the original prediction results by adding noise. I do not think the label here is still "Fish."

- In Section 3.1, the authors directly introduce a magnitude set by adding noise. Based on my understanding, it is necessary to explain how to choose this magnitude set, because the proposed method involves introducing varying magnitudes of noise and observing whether the prediction results are flipped in each query to conclude whether a given sample is a backdoor sample. Another alternative approach is to show that the choice of magnitude set does not affect the effectiveness of the proposed detection method.

- It would be better to conduct more experiments on the choice of $\alpha$, $\beta$, and $|S|$, and determine whether the values differ across different datasets and different attack methods.

- In Table 1, it would be better to have a notation indicating which attacks are sample-specific and which attacks are sample-agnostic. Additionally, it is unclear whether the proposed detection method performs similarly well on both types of attacks.
