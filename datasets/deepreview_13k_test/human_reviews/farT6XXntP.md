# A Paradigm Shift in Machine Translation: Boosting Translation Performance of Large Language Models

- Decision: Accept
- Scores: 8, 6, 5, 8

## Abstract
Generative Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable advancements in various NLP tasks. However, these advances have not been reflected in the translation task, especially those with moderate model sizes (i.e., 7B or 13B parameters), which still lag behind conventional supervised encoder-decoder translation models. Previous studies have attempted to improve the translation capabilities of these LLMs, but their gains have been limited. In this study, we propose a novel fine-tuning approach for LLMs that is specifically designed for the translation task, eliminating the need for the abundant parallel data that traditional translation models usually depend on.
Our approach consists of two fine-tuning stages: initial fine-tuning on monolingual data followed by subsequent fine-tuning on a small set of high-quality parallel data.  We introduce the LLM  developed through this strategy as \underline{\textbf{A}}dvanced \underline{\textbf{L}}anguage \underline{\textbf{M}}odel-based tr\underline{\textbf{A}}nslator (\textbf{ALMA}). Based on LLaMA-2 \citep{llama2} as our underlying model, our results show that the model can achieve an average improvement of more than 12 BLEU and 12 COMET over its zero-shot performance across 10 translation directions from the WMT'21 (2 directions) and WMT'22 (8 directions) test datasets. The performance is significantly better than all prior work and even superior to the NLLB-54B model \citep{nllb} and GPT-3.5-\texttt{text-davinci-003}, with only 7B or 13B parameters.
This method establishes the foundation for a novel training paradigm in machine translation.}

### Summary
The paper is motivated by that the translation performance of LLMs are not as good as other tasks compared to the task-specific methods. To improve the translation capabilities of the moderate LLMs, it proposes a fine-tuning paradigm which is firstly fine-tuning on monolingual data followed by subsequent fine-tuning on a small set of high-quality parallel data. It turns out a huge gain in translation quality compared to the zero-short performance across 10 translation directions from the WMT21 and WMT22.

### Strengths
The paper is clearly written and provides many insights. Using LLM to boost the translation quality is an interesting and important topic. It proposes a novel fine-tuning paradigm to let the moderate size LLMs better at translation. Many analyses should be very helpful to the NLP and ML community.

### Weaknesses
The paper is mainly focusing on improve the translation quality of LLMs. It'd be better to compare more with the encoder-decoder translation models and shed light on the best practice of translation itself.

### Questions
How's your fine-tuned models compared with the dedicated encoder-decoder based translation models in similar size? Please discuss in both high and low resource settings.

If fine-tuning with large amount of parallel data is not optimal, how about using the during pre-training phase? If targeting at the highest translation performance, what's your take? Please include the dedicated translation model in the discussion.

What would be the results of evaluating on some out-of-domain test sets?

### Summary
This paper focuses on improving the translation capability of large language models (LLMs). The authors find that LLMs do not require a large amount of parallel data as traditional models do to achieve decent translation quality. Accordingly, they propose a new training recipe including two stages: firstly finetune LLM on monolingual data and then finetune the model on a small set of high-quality parallel data. Experiments with LLAMA-2 show promising performance even on par with GPT-3.5.

### Strengths
1) Propose a simple training recipe for LLMs for translation tasks: finetuning first on monolingual data and then on small high-quality parallel data.
2) Demonstrate impressive performance across 5 language pairs with LLAMA-2.

### Weaknesses
1) The statement of "paradigm shift" is somehow overestimated.
2) The few-shot prompting results are highly undervalued.
3) The proposed recipe might not apply to other LLMs and languages.

### Questions
Firstly, the authors claim the finding/proposal is a "paradigm shift" as highlighted in the title, which might be inadequate. The recipe generally follows the pretraining-finetuning paradigm which has already been well-established since BERT and mBart/T5. In addition, similar solutions have already been used in prior studies, such as BigTranslate.

Secondly, the few-shot results are largely undervalued. As shown in Table 11, the quality gap between the HW 5-shot and the proposal is only 0.2 COMET on XX->En, although the finetuning used a large amount of monolingual corpus and more parallel data. Few-shot performance should be able to be further enhanced via beam search and optimized prompt construction, and it should be used as the fair baseline rather than 0-shot prompting. It's also misleading to state in Appendix I that "ICL substantially underperforms our stage-2 finetuning". 

Lastly, finetuning performance is highly dependent on pretraining conditions and the downstream task. Intuitively, when the downstream tasks highly correlate with the pretraining, the demand for a large volume of the supervised corpus is reduced as highlighted in this paper. However, as the MPT-7B performance indicates in Figure 4, when the correlation is low, adding more supervised data is almost always helpful. In other words, the findings in this paper might not be generalization. Do you also have the finetuning results for MPT-7B? Does the recipe also apply to low-resource languages like Gu?

### Summary
This paper examines ways of improving the translation performance of large language models. There is no modelling or training innovation in the paper, but they are the first to show that you can take a smaller English focussed language model (LLaMa 7B,13B) and make it into a translation model with equivalent performance to a large LLM (GPT 3.5 &4) using relatively small amounts of monolingual (20B?) and parallel data (1B) in a fine-tuning step. The paper is generally clearly written but some important details are missing, some claims are not entirely supported, and there are some typos. 

In more detail:
They first show that large models (GPT3.5) do extremely well translating into and out of  5 diverse languages and English, mostly high resource except for Icelandic. They then select the best performing smaller model (7B parameters) and experiment on fine-tuning to the translation task using instructions. They show that LLama27B quickly maxes out after 10k examples, whereas MPT-7B continues improving until the final datapoint at 20M. 
They then experiment with using monolingual data in pretraining, and finetuning with instructions, and call the resulting model ALMA. They show that with a relatively small multilingual (but not parallel) pretraining dataset 1B, they get significant gains in translation quality. Also they used high quality parallel data for finetuning and experimented with full fine-tuning and LORA fine-tuning.

### Strengths
They show large improvements in the translation capabilities of the most useful size of models (7B,13B) with very affordable limited fine-tuning and data. 
This is a useful paper for people working in machine translation to see what works in fine-tuning large language models for the translation task.

### Weaknesses
There is not a lot of novelty in the approach - either in training or modelling. I am not sure that the "New paradigm" title is justified. 
I have not learned much from reading the paper - it is still not clear what the contribution of the monolingual vs parallel training data is. It is also not clear whether the good performance of the trained models is due to the reduced number of non English languages (5) vs other models (NLLB, GPT3.5,4). 
I am also not sure these results (improvement over LLaMa7B with fine-tuning) would hold if you used few-shot - and it would have been a very easy experiment to conduct. 
The paper writing is not particularly clear (see questions for details).

### Questions
They claim/state things which are either not entirely correct or are overstated: 
"Both monolingual data fine-tuning and human-written data" - I think they mean parallel data here - both monolingual and translated data are human-written. 
This claim is not correct: "We demonstrate that LLMs, such as LLaMA-2-7B, do not voraciously consume parallel data. " What they demonstrate is that for fine-tuning LlaMa-2-7B does not improve much beyond 10k examples. However, their other model MPT-7B does keep improving and does not max out even at the 20M mark.
The citation for this claim in the intro: "they still fall short in translation for low-resource languages" Zhang et al. is wrong. They do not look at low resource languages, only experiments with English, Chinese and German. 
They conclude: "From our observations, LLMs should not adopt the same training approach as earlier models—whether randomly initialized or pre-trained—that rely heavily on vast amounts of training data" but do not specify that this is just for the fine-tuning LLaMa - it is a too broad claim to make.

Some things are not explained or described:
They do not explain why they selected MPT for experiments in 3.2, and more importantly they do not discuss why it performs contrary to their claimed results - that LLMs to not voraciously consume parallel data. 
Also for Section 5 they do not say how much parallel data is used for fine-tuning and what ratios of parallel data are we using - same as the monolingual data? This really should be detailed in the main paper. 
This caption is confusing "Figure 5: The average performance of ALMA-7B at the completion of each 1B-token fine-tuning". Is this without the instruction fine-tuning? How do these numbers compare to Tables 1 and 2? I can't figure this out due to the differences in the data - but it seems like the instruction fine-tuning makes little/no difference here. (Fig5) 85.28 COMET vs. (84.12 + 86.27) / 2 (Table 1 and 2) for the ALMA7B?

There are a number of typos and inconsistencies that need to be polished for final submission: 
The ALMA models are called AMLA,
Typo:  "As expected, it tends up with a similar performance ". 
The graphics are not very consistent in the paper and don't look clean or very legible. Figure 5 is particularly  hard to read.  
Results are not very structured. For some (2.2) use NLLB and other not (3.1) .
Many different result formats vertical/horizontal bar, line, table - it is harder to read and looks messy.

### Summary
This paper proposed an innovative two-stage fine-tuning method: initially fine-tuning on non-English monolingual data to enhance comprehension, followed by further fine-tuning on a small amount of high-quality human-translated parallel text. This approach enabled even smaller LLMs to achieve state-of-the-art translation performance.

### Strengths
The results of the paper indicated that smaller models could achieve SOTA translation levels through specialized fine-tuning, suggesting that there might not be a continuous need to expand datasets and models for better performance.

Through compact, specialized fine-tuning, smaller LLMs could achieve SOTA translation quality without billions of parameters. The focus of this research was on tailored fine-tuning methods that unleashed the potential of LLM's multilingual capabilities on a broader scale.

The paper demonstrated that instead of increasing data scale, intentional fine-tuning targeting key language capabilities might be the key to maximizing LLM performance.

By revealing the potential of smaller LLMs for efficient and accurate machine translation, this work laid the foundation for developing more user-friendly and scalable machine translation systems. This training approach offered more possibilities for deploying capable multilingual LLMs in real-world applications.

### Weaknesses
There were certain flaws in the method, and prompts affected the results. 

The evaluation methods had its limitations. 

The stability of the proposed method was not verified.

### Questions
1. Typically, if an LLM was fine-tuned with specific bilingual corpora to enhance translation capabilities between those two languages, it might impair other NLP capabilities of the LLM, such as document summarization and logical question answering. Did this issue not arise in this study?

2. If possible, please consider using the 'Instruct Score' from EMNLP 2023 (Instructscore: Towards Explainable Text Generation Evaluation with Automatic Feedback) as a metric. I believe it's a better benchmark for evaluating LLM-MT.

3. The outputs of large models were uncertain. Even a minor change in a prompt could lead to variations in the output. During the two-stage fine-tuning process, was the specific impact of the prompt considered?

3. Given the powerful In-Context Learning capabilities of large language models, it would be worth exploring whether adding relevant knowledge to the prompt could further enhance translation capabilities.

4. The section "Small Training Data Is Enough" contained many uncertain descriptions, which should be rigorous in a paper and supported by convincing data. Moreover, the best-performing commercial LLM, GPT-4, remained proprietary, leaving us in the dark about the amount of data used, the number of parameters trained, and potential data leakage issues during translation metric testing.

5. The sentence in the "Large Parallel Data Wash Out the Knowledge" section: "As expected, it tends up with a similar performance in both BLEU and COMET evaluations (triangle in Figure 4)," was hard to understand.

6. The proposed method significantly improved translation metric scores, highlighting ALMA's effectiveness. Based on this, how did the authors believe LLM generalized translation capabilities? Did the proposed method fundamentally assist LLMs in learning deep bilingual text alignment?
