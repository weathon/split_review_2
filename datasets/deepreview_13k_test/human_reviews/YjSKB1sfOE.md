# From Trojan Horses To Castle Walls: Revealing Bilateral Backdoor Effects In Diffision Models

- Decision: Reject
- Scores: 6, 5, 6, 3

## Abstract
While state-of-the-art diffusion models (DMs) excel in image generation, concerns regarding their security persist. Earlier research highlighted DMs' vulnerability to backdoor attacks, but these studies placed stricter requirements than conventional methods like 'BadNets' in image classification. This is because the former necessitates modifications to the diffusion sampling and training procedures. Unlike the prior work, we investigate whether generating backdoor attacks in DMs can be as simple as BadNets, *i.e.*, by only contaminating the training dataset without tampering the original diffusion process. In this more realistic backdoor setting, we uncover *bilateral backdoor effects* that not only serve an *adversarial* purpose (compromising the functionality of DMs) but also offer a *defensive* advantage (which can be leveraged for backdoor defense). Specifically, we find that a BadNets-like backdoor attack remains effective in DMs for producing incorrect images that do not align with the intended text conditions and for yielding incorrect predictions when DMs are employed as classifiers. Meanwhile, backdoored DMs exhibit an increased ratio of backdoor triggers,  a phenomenon we refer to as 'trigger amplification', among the generated images. We show that this latter insight can enhance the detection of backdoor-poisoned training data. Even under a low backdoor poisoning ratio, we find that studying the backdoor effects of DMs can be valuable for designing anti-backdoor image classifiers. Last but not least, we establish a meaningful linkage between backdoor attacks and the phenomenon of data replications by exploring DMs' inherent data memorization tendencies.

### Summary
Since previous works show that diffusion models are still threatened by backdoor attacks, this paper investigates whether backdoor attacks for diffusion models can be as simple as "BadNets". After directly adding poison images into training datasets and substitute the benign prompt with the misaligned prompt. The answer to the above question is "yes". In addition to this empirical finding, this paper also provide a mount of fruitful insights: The phase transition phenomenon, the trigger amplification effect and correlation with data replications. Overall, this paper is a quite solid work.

### Strengths
1 This paper is well-written.

2 This paper is easy to follow.

3 This paper provides multiple insights which are rarely mentioned in previous works.

### Weaknesses
1 minor errors: 

​       (1) Page 5 should be "Table 2" instead of Figure 2.

2 All experiments are performed on small dataset. Do the provided insights still hold on larger datasets, such as ImegNet-100?

### Questions
1 Can you explain why in Figure 2, poisoning 10% of training samples will have marginal effect on the FID of benign images? Does this mean that the performance of diffusion model is not sensitive to the number of training dataset?

2 ddim is another sampling algorithm for diffusion models. Would your proposed insight vary if we use DDIM to sample images from a backdoor diffusion models?

3 Can your provided insights be transferable to SDE [1]?

### Summary
The paper studies the effects of data poisoning in diffusion models (DMs).
Based on the experiments, it finds that backdoored DMs amplify triggers, which
can be used to enhance the detection of backdoor-poisoned training data. The
paper also finds that this can be helpful in designing anti-backdoor
classifiers.

### Strengths
Many of the observations made by the paper are very interesting, especially, the
design of anti-backdoor image classifier. I think many of the observations can
be leveraged by future research.

The paper is also easy to follow, and it is well-orgnizaed with claims following
experiments. Sections are also well-connected.

### Weaknesses
The paper is rather long and tries to cover too many things, losing the focus.
While many of the claims are interesting. I think the paper limits this
discussion in a narrow aspect, making the results not so convincing. For
example, its claims on poisoning ratios. While existing backdoor attacks have
shown that the poisoning ratio has to be related to many factors -- the training
dataset, the trigger itself, the training objectives and settings, and data
processing techniques (e.g., normalization, smoothing) -- I felt it is too easy
to draw such conclusions base on the limited experiments performed in the paper.
This remains to be the same for **most** claims in the paper, and they make the
paper less convincing to me.

The paper is well-organized, but I would suggest revising the paper a lot. The
abstract dumps many messages, and thought the whole paper, I am not sure what is
the main message of the paper. It seems to be present a set of experiments
(which are not comprehensive), and draw a few conclusions (which seems to be not
convincing based on the description of the experiments). I would suggest
focusing on a single promising direction rather than dumping all experiments.

The paper is very empirical and does not have in depth analysis to explain the
observations, making the observations weak and not strongly supported. I would
wonder if there exists adaptive methods that compromises the observations.

### Questions
What is the main takeaway message?

### Summary
The paper inspects the effect of the classic BadNets-like backdoor attacks on diffusion model (DM) training. It discovers bilateral backdoor effects: (1) BadNets-like backdoor attacks cause the trained diffusion models to produce a portion of incorrect images that do not align with the text conditions, and (2) the poisoned diffusion models produce increased ratios of images with the backdoor triggers. Based on the second observation, the paper proposes a novel backdoor defense via training DM models on the suspicious dataset. Datasets with high poisoning rates will produce DMs with amplified trigger appearance, thus allowing more accurate backdoor detection. Datasets with low poisoning rates, instead, have the DMs transform malicious data into benign and be safe to be used for retraining. Backdoored DMs can also be used as image classifiers with improved robustness. Finally, the paper shows that poisoning the replicated training data leads to increased data replication.

### Strengths
- The paper shows that the simple, classic BadNets-like backdoor attacks can highly affect the produced DMs. It discovers bilateral backdoor effects, which are somewhat surprising and interesting.
- Based on the observations on BadNets-like backdoored DMs, the paper proposes a novel backdoor defense scheme. It helps improve backdoor detection on datasets with moderate-to-high poisoning rates while producing cleaner data from datasets with low poisoning rates.
- The paper also provides some other insights on the BadNets-like backdoored DMs, which are interesting and potentially useful.

### Weaknesses
- As for the first observation, the mismatching between the generated images and the text conditions may not come from backdoor trigger injection but from the incorrect labels of the poisoned images. The authors should try relabeling data only (without adding the backdoor trigger) and check if the ratios of generated mismatching images (G1+G3) are similar to those of BadNets-like backdoored DMs in Figure 3.
- The paper only inspects two simple dirty-label attacks, which are easily detected by standard backdoor defenses. It is recommended to examine if the bilateral effects still appear with more sophisticated dirty-label (e.g., WaNet, LIRA) and clean-label attacks (e.g., LabelConsistent, SIG) and whether the proposed backdoor defense is helpful in those cases.
- The authors should provide more details on the Caltech-15 dataset, including the selected classes, the statistics on data size, and the absolute ratios of poisoned and clean images of the target class.
- In Table 3, the proposed approach only helps to improve backdoor detection accuracy on the generated images; it cannot be used to filter backdoor examples in the original training data. Hence, it does not help to mitigate datasets with moderate-to-high poisoning rates, unlike many other backdoor defense approaches. 
- In Table 4, the classifiers trained on generated data, while being more robust, have significant accuracy drops (sometimes more than 10%). Hence, they are not usable in practice. Particularly, since it is hard to differentiate a clean dataset from a dataset with a low poisoning rate, applying this technique will hurt a lot if the suspected dataset is actually clean.
- The test dataset used for the diffusion classifiers (Table 5) is different from the datasets used in the previous experiments. The authors should explain the reason.
- What datasets were used in Table 4, Table 6, and Figures 6-7?

### Summary
This paper studies how to backdoor conditional diffusion models via only data poisoning without changing the loss. An example of the attack goal is to generate a deer image with a specific patch when the input condition is a truck. Experiments show an image with a specific patch (eg, a deer image with a specific patch) can be generated, but the backdoored model also generates a truck image with the patch. This paper also tries to study the relationship between backdoor defense and attacks, as well as the effect of data replication.

### Strengths
1. This paper tries to study the backdoors in the popular generate model.
2. This paper studies both the attack and defense.

### Weaknesses
1. I don't quite understand the logic of this paper. It proposes a new but weak attack method and then shows it's easier to detect this attack because of the weakness of the proposed attack. A bad backdoor attack is expected to be easily detected. It seems that all the insights in this paper are based on this new attack and thus not valid. And in fact, it's questionable if this is a backdoor attack.

2. This attack is not well-defined, precise, or stealthy. This paper's attack goal is to generate a deer's image with a specific patch when the input condition is "a truck". This is not a backdoor. Existing literature defines the goal as generating specific images (e.g., one specific image or images with a specific patch, etc, ) whenever the input condition contains trigger words such as "[T]". The backdoor shouldn't be triggered if the input condition doesn't contain "[T]". This paper's method is not a backdoor attack. When the input condition is "a truck", it will generate a deer with the patch, a truck with the patch, or a clean truck. It's more like training a bad classifier with mislabeled data and the classifier will randomly predict a label for a truck. There's no way to consistently or precisely trigger the backdoor effects. This is probably why authors have A(2) and other observations related to the "amplification".

3. The proposed method can only attack conditional diffusion models, while VillanDiff can attack both conditional and unconditional diffusion models.

4. This paper claims Baddiff and VillanDiff change the sampling process. However, it's not the case according to my understanding. They change the input distribution but not the sampling process. Changing the input distribution is reasonable, as backdoor-attacking image classifiers also adds triggers to the input image and thus changes the input distribution.

5. Experimental details are missing. What are the training details such as learning rate, and epochs? Which part of the stable diffusion models is trained? What's the accuracy of the ResNet-50 used to measure the misalignment? How are the images in G1-G4 generated (only using the target class)? How are existing backdoor detection methods such as STRIP applied to the diffusion models because they are designed for classifiers?

6. The Y-axis of Figure 7 means the similarity between the training image B and its replicated counterpart C. Why are there a lot of points at the left bottom corner? Does it mean B is very different from its replicated image? But I think they should be very similar. If so, does it mean the similarity metric is problematic?

### Questions
1. Why is this a valid and good backdoor attack?
