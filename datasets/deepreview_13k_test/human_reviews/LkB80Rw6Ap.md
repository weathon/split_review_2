# Curvature MPNNs : Improving Message Passing with Local Structural Properties

- Decision: Reject
- Scores: 1, 3, 5, 5

## Abstract
Graph neural networks follow an iterative scheme of updating node representations based on the aggregation from nearby nodes know as the message passing paradigm. Although they are widely used, it has been established that they suffer from a problem of oversquashing that limit their efficiency. Recently, it has been shown that the bottleneck phenomenon comes from certain areas of the graphs, which can be identified by a measure of edge curvature.
In this paper we propose a framework appropriate for any MPNN architecture called Curvature Message Passing, that distributes information based on the curvature of the graph's edges.
Experiments conducted on different datasets show that our method mitigate oversquashing and outperforms existing graph rewiring in several nodes classification tasks.

### Confidence
2: You are willing to defend your assessment, but it is quite likely that you did not understand the central parts of the submission or that you are unfamiliar with some pieces of related work. Math/other details were not carefully checked.

### Summary
The authors use Olivier curvature to modify message passing in MPNNs. More specifically, message passing can now be controlled using neighbours connected by positively or negatively curved edges only. Since curvature is somewhat related to homophily and heterophily, this extended message passing scheme provides better adjustment to  homophily vs heterophilic datasets.

### Strengths
1. The integration of curvature into the message passing is a nice idea.
2. The approach shows promise empirically.

### Weaknesses
1. The paper is very badly written. Many sentences do not parse well.
2. The idea is nice, but it is extremely simple. The overall technical depth is not on par with one expects from an ICLR paper.
3. The presentation of the different ways that curvature can be used (section 4.4.) could have been more precise.
4. There is no theoretical justification of the proposed method.
In summary,  nice idea but not enough substantial contributions.

### Questions
Q1. Could you explain how one should choose between message passing between positive vs. negative curved neighbourhoods? Or does one  simply tries all possible combinations and picks the best?

### Summary
This paper tackles two major problems in standard message-passing neural networks on graphs: oversquashing and oversmoothing. For this, they propose to send messages only along edges that have positive curvature and also to increase the neighborhood of nodes by also considering multi-hop neighbours. This new message passing is tested on node classification tasks on homophilic and heterophilic where a gain for heterophilic graphs is reported

### Strengths
- Try to tackle the problem of oversmoothing and oversquashing jointly 
- Paper is easily to follow

### Weaknesses
- The authors often do not back up their results. For example, they claim that  "sparsifying the graph has several advantages, (1) helps to reduce oversmoothing..." While there is a reference to DROPEDGE, it is not clear that sparsifying by removing negatively curved edges reduces oversmoothing. Oversmoothing has a mathematical definition, thus it would be beneficial to prove or show experiments that back these claims up.
- Some passages and "results" seem unrelated or at least not well discussed. For example, in Table 1 the authors show the homophily gains by considering a different computational graph (that has only negatively or positively curved edges). How does this relate to the remainder of the work?
- There are many details missing, e.g., the model itself in Equation 7 doesn't include the multi-hop propagation.
- The experimental section is weak. Only one hyperparameter configuration is used. There should be many hyperparameters tested. Otherwise there is also no need for having a validation set, and also it may be that the baseline methods are not well evaluated. For instance, other papers ([1,2]) report much higher numbers.
- Also regarding the experiments: As the work claims to tackle oversmoothing, it may be beneficial to compare the method to other works that tackle oversmoothing, see, e.g., [1-5]
- While the authors refer to (Pei et al., 2020) for their experimental setup, they do not use the setup therein. For instance, there exist standard splits which makes comparison to other methods easier. 
- The overall writing and grammatic should be checked again

### Questions
- The authors identify (in accordance with related work) that negatively curved edges may be bottlenecks leading to oversquashing; but then messages are only passed along negatively curved edges. How does this go hand in hand?
- Regarding the experiments: It is not clear how the experiments relate to the rest of the work. For instance, do any of these datasets actually suffer from oversquashing? 

While the tackled problem is relevant and interesting, I believe the paper is not ready for publication. It would benefit a lot from backing up more of their claims; either through experiments or mathematical proofs.

### Summary
The authors tackle a significant challenge within Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). In recent years, numerous critiques have arisen regarding the effectiveness of GNNs, and various research endeavors have been dedicated to pinpointing the primary flaws in their message-passing framework. Recent investigations have pointed to concerns like over-smoothing and over-squashing issues. Additionally, recent research has proposed that Ricci curvature can be utilized to pinpoint bottleneck areas within graphs, which are responsible for the over-squashing problem. In this study, the authors set out to leverage Ricci curvature as a means to address these problems. Through a series of experiments, the authors substantiate the effectiveness of their methodology in improving node classification, especially in heterophilic graphs.

### Strengths
1. This paper focuses on leveraging the inherent local structural features of graphs within a message-passing framework for Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) by incorporating curvature. The primary objective is to tackle issues such as over-smoothing and over-squashing that are prevalent in GNNs. The idea is novel, and seems to improve the performance, especially in heterophillic graphs.

2. The comparative analysis in Section 3.2, which examines homophily versus curvature, provides valuable insights for the model.

3. By conducting a series of experiments, the authors establish the effectiveness of their methodology in enhancing node classification, with a particular emphasis on its performance in heterophilic graphs.

### Weaknesses
1. While most of the paper is written well, Section 3.3 needs to be clarified. If I understand it right, you have constructed five distinct models and conducted experiments with each model on separate datasets. To enhance clarity, consider labeling each model  like Model 1, Model 2, and so forth. Additionally, in the experiments section, explicitly specify which model corresponds to each set of experiments. Without this clarification, there is a potential for misinterpretation, where one might incorrectly assume that there is only one model and that the results represent the performance of a single model.

2. Because of several different models, and separate experiments, it is not clear what is working and what is not. 

3. A performance comparison with SOTA GNNs (not just rewiring baselines) would be better to evaluate the performance of the model.

### Questions
1. Although there are results suggesting similarities between the expanded Forman Ricci curvature and the Ollivier Ricci curvature, do you anticipate achieving comparable outcomes if you were to substitute your method with the Forman Ricci curvature? Given its computational efficiency, this alternative might be more suitable for handling large graphs.

2. Did you try to use curvature values (positive and negative) directly as weight in message-passing framework, instead of using them to eliminate some edges?

### Summary
This paper suggests a new GNN architecture that uses the curvature of the input graph to determine which nodes can pass messages. Specifically, the paper suggests passing messages only along the negative curved edges. The paper then shows that this improves performance for hetrophilic datasets.

### Strengths
The idea of passing messages based on the curvature of the edges is interesting. 

The idea is simple and seems to work well and have been tested against quite a few appropriate methods on a variety of different graphs.

### Weaknesses
The writing of the paper, specially the first 7 pages contain many mistakes. Please see the questions section for many of these. Specifically the math presented in the paper has many error (definition of $W_1$, sparsifying the graph improving the diameter, and other statements such as that). 

There also many formatting issues, I list some of them in the questions section. I would highly recommend the authors to fix these. 

However, I think many of these are fixable and I am very willing to increase my score on seeing a fixed revision.

### Questions
Formatting issue between 2nd and 3rd paragraphs. 

Instead of using a fake link, I recommend you GitHub anonymous. It creates an anonymous version of GitHub repositories. 

On page 3 you say the formation of curvature in Topping et al. is to improve expressiveness. Could you elaborate? My understanding was that it was to improve computability. 

The formatting for Banerjee, Kardhakar, and Montufar 2023 makes it look like two separate papers above equation 2, and drops the name of the first author Banerjee in other places. This needs to be fixed.

Just above equation 4, $\pi$ is not a measure for this paper. Also I would recommend not using $\pi$ to represent a scalar different from the constant $\pi$. The prior work cited uses $\alpha$.

For equation 5, you are missing the restrictions on the marginals of $M$ as well the restriction that $M$ is a probability measure on the product space.

How is the two hop $\beta^+$ defined?

I also do not understand how Figure 2D is the 2hop *positive message passing*. What do the dashed lines represent? The message also propagated further for the regular message passing framework. Which is contrary to the caption of Figure 2. 

For 1 hop message passing. It says that sparsifying the graph **reduces** the diameter of the graph. This is just blatantly false. For example, for the graph graph used, removing either the positive or negatively curved edges results in the graph being disconnected which makes the diameter infinite.
