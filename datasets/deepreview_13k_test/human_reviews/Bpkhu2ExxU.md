- Scores: 6, 8, 6, 6

## Abstract
Dropout is  a widely utilized  regularization technique  in the training of neural networks,  nevertheless, its underlying mechanism and its impact on achieving  good generalization abilities remain poorly understood.  In this work, we derive the stochastic modified equations  for analyzing the dynamics of dropout, where its discrete  iteration process  is approximated by a class of stochastic differential equations. In order to investigate the underlying mechanism by which dropout facilitates the identification of flatter minima, we study the   noise structure  of the  derived stochastic modified equation for dropout. By drawing upon the structural  resemblance between the Hessian and covariance through several intuitive approximations, we empirically demonstrate the universal presence of the inverse variance-flatness relation and the Hessian-variance  relation, throughout the training process of dropout. These theoretical and empirical findings make a substantial contribution to our understanding of the  inherent tendency of dropout to locate flatter minima.

### Summary
This paper aims to deepen the understanding of dropout regularization in neural network training. The authors firstly derive stochastic modified equations (SMEs) that approximate the iterative process of the dropout algorithm. This provides valuable insights into dropout's dynamics. The study then conducts empirical investigations to explore how dropout assists in identifying flatter minima. By employing intuitive approximations and drawing analogies between the Hessian and covariance of dropout, the authors probe the mechanisms behind dropout's effectiveness. The empirical findings consistently demonstrate the presence of the Hessian-variance alignment relation throughout dropout's training process. This alignment relation, known for aiding in locating flatter minima, highlights dropout's implicit regularization effect, enhancing the model's generalization power.

### Strengths
1. The authors present a rigorous theoretical derivation of the stochastic modified equations that approximate the iterative process of the dropout algorithm. This theoretical framework enhances the understanding of the underlying mechanisms behind dropout regularization.

2. The empirical findings support the idea that dropout serves as an implicit regularizer by facilitating the identification of flatter minima. This discovery contributes to a more profound comprehension of dropout's intrinsic characteristics and its ability to improve the model's generalization capabilities.

### Weaknesses
1. The results presented in this paper are specifically applicable to shallow neural networks. The analysis and findings may not directly extend to deeper or more complex neural network architectures.

2. The findings and conclusions derived from the theoretical analysis using GD may not fully reflect the behavior and performance of dropout regularization when applied in practice with SGD.

### Questions
1. Assumption 1 seems to be quite strong? Any concrete example for this?

2. Do the results hold for any activation functions? Considering the impact of different activation functions on the behavior of dropout regularization would contribute to a more comprehensive understanding

3. The main theoretical result presented in this paper is an informal theorem, which may look a little bit weird.

### Summary
This paper examines the dropout algorithm in deep learning. The authors provide a theoretical framework by deriving stochastic modified equations to analyze the dynamics of dropout. In addition, the paper presents experimental findings that explore the relationship between the Hessian matrix and the covariance of dropout's noise

### Strengths
The optimization dynamics and generalization benifit of dropout is lack of understanding. This paper offers a rigorous theoretical analysis of the Stochastic Modified Equations associated with dropout. In addition, they conduct comprehensive experiments to explore the relationship between the Hessian matrix and the covariance of dropout's noise, which can unveil the genralization benifit of dropout. In summary, this article makes a substantial contribution to the understanding of dropout.

### Weaknesses
Theoretical analysis focused on two-layer neural networks, but it is indeed a meaningful step towards understanding dropout.

### Questions
- In Wu et al (2022), they provide an upper bound for the Hessian of the solution found by SGD based on the analysis of SGD noise, using dynamic stability analysis. Is it possible to develop a similar analysis that can offer an estimate of the Hessian for the solution found by dropout?

- As shown in Figure 3, the alignment measure $\alpha(\theta_t)$ appears to strengthen after the initial training phase. What could be the potential factors contributing to this observed phenomenon?

### Summary
The authors study dropout in a one hidden layer neural network. They first compute the gradient after one step averaged over the dropout randomness, and show that this is the gradient of a modified loss which penalizes the mean squared value of each neuron's contributions to the output. The authors then write down an SDE which attempts to establish an approximation of dropout dynamics which is locally consistent with the real dynamics to second order. They conclude with theory and experiments that suggest the dropout noise covariance is aligned with the Hessian.

### Strengths
The setup and analysis of dropout is well presented. The work uses relevant techniques to paint a picture of the inductive biases and some of the dynamical effects of the dropout procedure. The modified loss is easy to interpret, and it seems that at least at low learning rate the SDE performs quite similarly to the actual dynamics.

### Weaknesses
Overall, there is a question of the impact of the contribution. Everything within the paper is well executed (up to some minor comments addressed in questions), but the main result seems to be writing down the modified loss and SDE. The results about the alignment of the Hessian and dropout noise seem somewhat incomplete; I have given suggestions for improving those analyses as well.

In particular I wonder if the conclusions will generalize to the case of deeper networks, or if the qualitative picture changes, both in terms of the modified version of the loss, and the Hessian alignment. A related question is whether or not the results hold for the larger learning rates which are common in practical ML settings, and in the SGD+dropout setting. Even additional numerical evidence would be sufficient here in my opinion. Perhaps focusing experiments more on sweeps over $\epsilon$ and $p$ can improve this.

Some of the figures can also use improvement; see "Questions" for more detailed comments.

I'm looking forward to comments from the authors on these points and am open to changing my review score if they are sufficiently addressed.

Update: after author responses, many of the weaknesses were addressed and I have updated my review score.

### Questions
How do the results change for deeper networks? Is there evidence that the same structure should remain?

The theorems in the paper rely on small learning rate; however, typically neural networks are trained with large stepsizes (which are far from gradient flow for example). Which aspects of the theory will hold at larger learning rates?

Figure one and its related experiments could use improvement. For one, it would be better to plot e.g. panel 2 as a 2-D heatmap versus $\epsilon$ and $p$, so one can understand the effects of varying each (and any interaction that occurs). Additionally, I think its important to probe some smaller $p$ values (1e-2, 1e-1 perhaps) as the effects of dropout get more interesting with sparser activations.

For Figure 2, it is better to label each panel by the parameters directly rather than (setting 1, setting 2).

For the discussion of matrix alignment, it is worth pointing out that random PSD matrices have non-trivial correlation even in high dimensions. In particular, for random PSD matrices the alignment is related to the average eigenvalue. Therefore the statement

```
It is noteworthy that the cosine similarity between two random matrices of the same dimensions is highly improbable to exceed the threshold of 0.001.
```

is not the right one. It would be helpful to add a comparison to the plots of the covariance of two matrices with random eigenvectors, but the same eigenvalues as each of the relevant matrices. This will provide a better null model.

I would suggest finding a different notation for the stepsize (currently $\epsilon$). This will bring the notation more in line with what practitioners use, which I think will help the paper find a broader audience.

As a minor point: this line in the abstract:

```
These dual facets of our research, encompassing both theoretical derivations and empirical observations, collectively constitute a substantial contribution towards a deeper understanding of the inherent tendency of dropout to locate flatter minima.
```

doesn't really add anything for the reader - the content of the paper is what will convince me if the contribution is substantial or not!

### Summary
This work analyzes the generalization capabilities of dropout through the lens of stochastic modified equations. The authors derive a weak-sense stochastic continuous time limit approximation of the discrete dropout algorithm and use this modified ODE to explain the phenomenon of dropout. This SDE is driven by a deterministic modified loss (due to dropout) and a stochastic Brownian motion with a covariance vector that also depends on the dropout parameter. The authors derive their conclusion from the similarity between the strcuture of the Hessian and the stochastic noise covariance matrix which could aid in getting flatter minimas as sharper directions would have more stochastic noise (due to similarity between Hessian structure and covariance matrix).

### Strengths
1) The paper is moderately well written. 
2) Analyzing the effect of droput for generalization is an important problem in ML.

### Weaknesses
Although the paper seems to be easy to read at first glance, there are some portions where the authors do not clearly mention how they obtain certain equations, for example:

1) In section-4.1, how the modified loss was derived is not very clear. It seems clear from the appendix. Better to refer it to the appendix or provide a statement on how it was derived. 

2) It's not evident how the authors get equation 8 from section 4.1. I missed the part where the stochasticity V comes into the picture from section 4.1. From Theorem-1, it is not clear, what effect dropout is having as the author's do not clearly mention the source of stochasticity. 
It is well known a stochastic discrete algorithm can be well approximated by Euler-Maruyama discretization of an SDE, but in the manuscript the connection/derivation is not clear. 

Now here are some technical concerns I had:

3) The role of the modified loss $L_{S}$ from the SDE is not clear in terms of generalization. Authors only use the flatness argument from the Hessian-covaraince alignment, but the deterministic part driving the SDE seems to not play any role ?

5) It's not quite clear how the Hessian alignment with the covariance matrix is aiding to flatter minimas. Does the eigenvector directions of the covariance matrix also correspond exactly as that of the Hessian? Given, the equations in 5.2, it is not clear how the structure of the Hessian and the Cov matrix are the same. The coefficients (involving $e_{i}$) seem to suggest that the alignment may not be same. Infact near convegence, $l_{i,2}$ tends to 0, making the second term in the covariance term vanish. 

6) How the effect of dropout is in aiding to flat minima correspond to that of SGD and parameter noise injection. In some sense, dropout has some correspondace to both. Parametrer noise injection is well known as the explicit hessian regularizer (more explicitly on the trace of the hessian https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.04613). In my opinion, a comparison between SGD, parameter noise-injection and dropout are critical. 

minor: 

4) Which SME is used in the experiments?  The order-1 approximation or the order-2 approximation .

### Questions
Answers to questions posed in 3 to 7 are critical in my opinion as they form the basic claims and crux of the paper. 
Some sections in the manuscript need to be modified to make reading easier, see point 1 and 2.
