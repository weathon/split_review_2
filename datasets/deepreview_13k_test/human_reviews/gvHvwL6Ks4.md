# Privacy-Preserving Data Quality Evaluation in Federated Learning Using Influence Approximation

- Decision: Reject
- Scores: 5, 5, 5, 3

## Abstract
In Federated Learning, it is crucial to handle low-quality, corrupted, or malicious data. However, traditional data valuation methods are not suitable due to privacy concerns. To address this, we propose a simple yet effective approach that utilizes a new influence approximation called \emph{"lazy influence"} to filter and score data while preserving privacy. To do this, each participant uses their own data to estimate the influence of another participant's batch and sends a differentially private obfuscated score to the central coordinator. Our method has been shown to \emph{successfully filter out biased and corrupted data} in various simulated and \emph{real-world} settings, achieving a recall rate of over $>90\%$ (sometimes up to $100\%$) while maintaining \emph{strong differential privacy} guarantees with $\varepsilon \leq 1$.

### Summary
The paper proposes a simple yet effective approach that utilizes a new influence approximation called ”lazy influence” to filter and score data while preserving privacy. To do this, each participant uses their data to estimate the influence of another participant’s batch and sends a differentially private obfuscated score to the FL server.

### Strengths
- The approximation of the influence is efficient, which reduces the computational complexity for the influence score.
- The proposed method increases the model's performance on the benchmark datasets.
- Leveraging strong and well-known privacy-preserving mechanism.

### Weaknesses
- The work seems incremental with limited novelty since it applies existing works for privacy protection.
- Lacking of theoretical analysis for privacy protection.
- The computation over-head is high since at every epoch, a client has to communicate with all other clients and the FL server.

### Questions
1. How the privacy accumulation over multiple updating rounds is computed in your proposed method?
2. McMahan et al. 2017 proposed User-level DP and RAPPOR provides local differential privacy. Therefore, in the proposed method, what is the level of privacy that you are providing?
3. Since using the proposed method from McMahan et al. 2017, the gradients are clipped which will clip out the information induce from local data. Therefore, the data filtering process might filter out important data points. What is the impact of the clipping bound toward the data filtering process ?

### Summary
This paper considers the problem of federated learning in the setting where we want to preserve privacy under local differential privacy, and want to be robust to mild corruptions. Specifically, corruptions in this setting are not the same as the adversarial corruption notion in other works in this area, such as Byzantine robustness. They assume the users and the servers are honest but curious, and a fraction of the data they have might be corrupted non-adversarially. Their approach draws insights from influence functions. They employ a method which they call lazy iteration that utilizes the influence signs of each new (local) update.

Their approach is as follows: at each round each contributor user privately sends their updated last layer to another set of users that act as validators. Then each validator checks whether this new update will improve accuracy over the data they have or not, and sends a private vote to the server. Privacy of the vote is both with respect to the data that the validator has and over the data that the contributor has used to provide the update. After that the server decides whether to accept the update of the contributor or not by checking whether the number of accept votes is above some threshold or not. They decide the threshold by doing $k$-means on the total number of positive votes and then setting the average of the two clusters as the threshold.

They run experiments for 25 communication rounds and compare their results with other methods in this area that provide byzantine robustness as their baseline, for example KRUM [Blanchard et al.] (2017), and Trimmed-mean [Yin et al.] (2018), and Centered-clipping [Karimreddy et al.] (2021). They run their experiments on CIFAR 10 with IID and random labeling and label shift and non iid data with label shift. The way they generate non-iid samples is by sampling from a Dirichlet distribution. They present their experiments and compare with the above Byzantine robustness baselines. Their methods can also be employed together with other Byzantine robust algorithms such as Centered Clipping.

### Strengths
In their experiments their performance is close to the performance of the oracle in the IID with random labeling setting and their approach, and their approach on top of centered clipping outperforms Byzantine robust methods in the label shift with non-iid data.

I think there's value in studying the setting where the verification of updates is decentralized. Most of the previous work focuses on the setting where the task of verification / filtering is done centrally.

Their approach can work on top of the Byzantine robust algorithms.

### Weaknesses
The main conceptual criticism I have is that it is not clear whether this method provides substantial improvements over a private version of Byzantine robust approaches or an alternative central model that is robust under mild corruption assumptions as in this paper. There's definitely some improvements in the experiments, but I think the cost of communication between verifiers and participants may outweigh that. For example, it seems like in this approach, in each round we are going to have quadratic in the number of users total communications, compared to the Byzantine robustness algorithms in previous work that only require a linear number of communications.

I have some other concerns that I will share in the questions section below.

### Questions
It is not clear whether the baselines in the experiments are also privatized or not.

In Algorithm 1, does each user send their updated last layer of the model to C as well?

It is mentioned that the output of the validation being private helps with the other users not being able to tailor their updates to the validation data. From adaptive data analysis we know that such an approach only holds out for a limited number of interactions. How many rounds of interactions / validation can this approach tolerate given say $n$ validation examples? I think this is important because the number of interactions with the hold-out validation data of each user seems to scale with the number of all users, which could be much larger than the amount of validation data a single user has.

It is mentioned that a drawback of other work int this area is the they may eliminate "minority" distributions due to their large distance relative do other model updates. Isn't that also the case in your setting as well? For example if a user has data that comes from a minority distribution, the rest of the users that have validation data that comes from a majority distribution would vote negatively for its update and therefore omitting that update.

It is mentioned that LDP is a generalization of DP, I'm not sure if generalization is the right word to describe the relationship here.

In the challenges section, it is mentioned that the Koh & Liang (2017) result requires, O(p) many operations but p is not defined anywhere.

In the paragraph after figure 2, it is mentioned that even under really strict privacy guarantees, the aggregated influence signs will match the true value in expectation. I'm not sure how to interpret this sentence. The way I interpret it is $\sum_i \mathbb{E}[v_i'] = \sum_i v_i$, which is not true, in fact we have $\sum_i \mathbb{E}[v_i'] = (1-p) \sum_i v_i$.

In Figure 3, it's not clear to me what communication rounds means here. Does it mean that for 25 rounds all users have sent their proposed updates to the server?

### Summary
This paper works on data filtering in Federated learning with differential privacy. The idea is to estimate the influence of each batch of training data by 1) first updating a small fraction of model with training data and 2) then evaluating the performance of the updated layer on validation data. During the process, suitable noise is added into the transmitted information so that differential privacy is enforced. Experiments show great improvement even in the non-IID settings.

### Strengths
The idea is elegant and easy to follow. Multiple strategies, like model freezing and bit compression are used to reduce communication. The experiment results look promising.

### Weaknesses
- Theoretical analysis, or some kind of high level intuition for the proposed method is highly appreciated. For instance, why can the proposed method work in non-IID settings? What type of data can be filtered out by the proposed method? Currently it is not clear to me why or when the proposed method can work.

- Data collection is very challenging for federated learning. In the proposed method, data is further split into training data and validation data. Will this hurt the performance of the model? For instance, if we just use all the data for training, will this be a much stronger baseline? In the current setting 1/3 data is used for validation. More justification is appreciated for this setup.

- Scalability seems to be a question. Say there are $n$ parties. Compared to standard federated algorithm like FedAvg, each party needs to conduct $n$ times more validation computation. And the overall communication seems to scale in $O(n^2)$ since essentially every pair of parties need to communicate with each other.

- Sign SGD [1] seems to be a related reference and needs to be cited.

### Questions
Is the overall distribution of training data and test data identical? If not, then it is not clear why validation data can be helpful for filtering training data.

### Summary
This work presents a new method for data valuation in FL by using an approximated version of data influence (termed lazy influence) which can be used to perform data filtering and guide the training process

### Strengths
The work is well motivated and easy to follow. The framework that authors propose offers a novel solution to data selection (and performance improvement) problems in FL. Particularly nice to see that authors considered non-IID settings, as these can often really offset the contributions.

### Weaknesses
However, I have a number of concerns regarding the experimental setting, interpretation of DP and the scalability of the method.

One note on the epsilon value: it is incredibly misleading to say that the achieved score (<1) is lower (and hence better, or more private) than the rest of the literature. Epsilon does not exist in a vacuum, its meaning for the user is affected (among other things) by: modality, dataset composition, which part of FL falls under DP etc. That being said: it is possible to achieve the same MAGNITUDE of epsilon when these components are vastly different, but this also means that the interpretation of epsilon is no longer the same (i.e. saying that a randomised response epsilon of <1 is more private than DP-SGD of 10 is strenuous at best and fundamentally incorrect at most, as these cannot be directly compared against each other by magnitude alone).

Having an assumption of a holdout server-side dataset is a bit too strong and not necessarily standard for FL settings.

### Questions
By the description of the protocol I am not super convinced this is actually FL: it looks more like some variation of P2P learning, given that clients communicate with each other directly? 

From what I understood this method is also not applicable to a general FL setting and forces the federation into synchronous FL? Otherwise I am struggling to see how the stale updates would be filtered+handled. Additionally, do all clients assume to be selected each round? The client selection section really does not expand on this.

Is CIFAR-based evaluation the only one considered? Not only are there no results in other modalities (which is typically a limitation, but not always a major one), but there are also no results on more complex image classification datasets either?

One other point which is missing from the discussion is the concept of influence altogether: here it is presented that positive influence improves the model and it is hence better to consider updates with positive influence. This is in general the case, but I have not seen any discussion on the meaning of influence i.e. higher influence does not always imply that model is improving (as it is possible, particularly in FL with small datasets, to overfit on individual clients). Same goes for tracking influence: having negative influence in round 1 does not prevent the client from having a positive one in a later one (and, in fact, does not always convey that certain clients are ‘better’, they may simply have simpler, more typical data). I would like authors to discuss/show what happens to influence of the same client over time w/out filtering to see if there is any long-term benefit.

Could authors also point me to how well the method performs (e.g. training time compared to vanilla FL) computationally? Since you mention how prohibitive Shapley values are, I would have expected how much better the proposed method performs. 

Overall, I find this work to be rather limited in scope and to have several potential issues, which I would like to be clarified before I can recommend acceptance.
