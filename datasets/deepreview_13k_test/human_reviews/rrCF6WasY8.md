## Abstract
Differentially private massively distributed learning poses one key challenge when compared to differentially private centralized learning, where all data are aggregated at one party: minimizing communication overhead while achieving strong utility-privacy tradeoffs. The minimal amount of communication for distributed learning is non-interactive communication, i.e., each party only sends one message.

In this work, we propose two differentially private, non-interactive, distributed learning algorithms in a framework called 
Secure Distributed \helmet. This framework is based on what we coin blind averaging: each party locally learns and noises a model and all parties then jointly compute the mean of their models via a secure summation protocol (e.g., secure multiparty computation). The learning algorithms we consider for blind averaging are empirical risk minimizers (ERM) like SVMs and Softmax-activated single-layer perception (Softmax-SLP). We show that blind averaging preserves privacy if the models are averaged via secure summation and the objective function is smooth, Lipschitz, and strongly convex. We show that the objective function of Softmax-SLP fulfills these criteria, which implies leave-one-out robustness and might be of independent interest.

On the practical side, we provide experimental evidence that blind averaging for SVMs and Softmax-SLP can have a strong utility-privacy tradeoff: we reach an accuracy of $86$ \% on CIFAR-10 for $\varepsilon = 0.36$ and $1{,}000$ users and of $44$ \% on CIFAR-100 for $\varepsilon = 1.18$ and $100$ users, both after a SimCLR-based pre-training. As an ablation, we study the resilience of our approach to a strongly non-IID setting.
On the theoretical side, we show that in the limit blind averaging hinge-loss based SVMs convergences to the centralized learned SVM.
Our approach is based on the representer theorem and can be seen as a blueprint for finding convergence for other ERM problems like Softmax-SLP.

### Confidence
4: You are confident in your assessment, but not absolutely certain. It is unlikely, but not impossible, that you did not understand some parts of the submission or that you are unfamiliar with some pieces of related work.

### Summary
This paper aims at exploiting the property that in part of hyperparameter space the average of SVM models learnt on partial datasets is the same as the model learnt on the full dataset, and hence in a federated setting a single secure aggregation operation is sufficient to combine local models into a global model.

### Strengths
In scenarios (data sets, problems) where this property holds, reducing the number of MPC rounds is indeed an important gain.

The paper is understandable, even though the presentation is not perfect.

### Weaknesses
The key limitation (also explicitly mentioned in Section 7) is that "there exists a regularization parameter \Lambda" means that potentially (for some scenarios, data sets, problems) the only values of \Lambda for which the proposed technique works are unsuitable values of \Lambda, i.e., values which don't lead to a satisfactory model.  While this limitation is recognized, the paper does little effort to investigate when \Lambda values for which the proposed technique works also are satisfactory and lead to good models.  While the paper shows a small empirical evaluation, it isn't fully clear how widely applicable the proposed methods can be.


There are quite a number of points where the text is insufficiently precise.  E.g., only already in Section 2:
* Contributions: (1) Output sensitivity suffices for strong privacy results in blind averaging. : O((\cup_i D_i)^{-1}) : you can't invert a set, only the size of a set.  Why not say O((\sum_i |D_i|)^{-1}) ?
* "the size of each communication round" : Please define the "size of a round".  There are probably less ambiguous formulations such as "the communication cost of a round", "the computation cost of a round", "the number of messages in every round", ....
* "It does need a communication round per training iteration M." -> M is undefined and looks here like a variable representing a training round.  From the use of M much later in the text, I guess you mean "Let M be the number of training iterations.  It (the algorithm?) needs only one communication round per training iteration."
* Table 1: where log(M) is used, looking in the cited paper suggests you probably mean the logarithm of the number of users rather than the number of training iterations, but even then this seems to represent the number of rounds per training iteration rather than the global number of MPC invocations.
* Algorithm 1: parameter h is taken as input but never occurs (explicitly) in the code of the algorithm.  Probably it is some implicit parameter to the l_huber function.
* Algorithm 1: in every iteration, f_m^{(k)} is computed, but one would expect that f_m^{(k)} depends on f_{m-1}^{(k)}, i.e., the result of the previous iteration.  This can't be seen in the code.
* Just after Algorithm 1: How do you get to the specific number of "1920 rounds?"

### Questions
* Just after Algorithm 1: How do you get to the specific number of "1920 rounds?"  (more generally, I understand little of the provided argument here as the cited papers not always allow for finding easily the claim for which they are cited).

* What evidence is there is the extent to which the proposed method is applicable to more than just a few simpler datasets satisfying some desirable properties (being balanced, having little noise, being separable, ...) ?

### Summary
This paper studies the problem of differentially private distributed optimization. More specifically, the authors consider the setting where only one round of communication is allowed during the optimization. The authors consider the private variant of two specific methods, i.e., SVM and Softmax-SLP in this setting.

### Strengths
The strengths of the current paper:
1. The problem considered in this paper, i.e., secure aggregation+differential privacy, is interesting and promising.

### Weaknesses
The weaknesses of the current paper:
1. The presentation of the current paper is unclear, and it is very hard to follow the results and discussions. 
2. It is unclear whether the utilities for different methods in Table 1 are correct.
3. The computation and memory cost of the secure summation is unclear.

### Questions
I have the following addition concerns besides the weaknesses:
1. In Table 1, where are the references for the DP-FL, Centralized training, and the utility for your proposed method?
2. I find it is very hard to follow the main results in the current paper. For example, in Corollary 4, why do you have the constraint on $\epsilon$ and what is the meaning of adding random noise to a set of outputs and why do you need to define $I_d$?
3. I don't understand the claim about tight composition results under Corollary 4.
4. How will the number of local updates $M$ affect your privacy and utility guarantees?
5. How will the rescaling step in your algorithms (e.g., projected SGD) affect your utility guarantees?
6. What is SimCLR, and how will it affect your results?
7. What is the definition of the honest user? In addition, why the noise magnitude will be reduced by a factor of $t$ when you have $t$ fraction of honest users?
8. How do you implement secure aggregation? 
9. I don't understand $\nu$ in Theorem 8.
10. I don't understand Theorem 14, what do you mean by the results belongs to $O(1/M)$?

### Summary
/!\ the template ICLR is not used
This paper proposes to learn a private federated model with only one communication step. For doing so, it focuses on models where the final model can be computation by an averaging step (that could be done with secure aggregation), namely SVM and Softmax-activated single-layer perception. The paper assumes a fraction t of honest users, and only passive attackers. Differential Privacy is ensured by noise injection on the client side to the local model and by bounding the sensitivity for this model. Finally, the paper provides experiments on CIFAR10 and CIFAR100.

### Strengths
- The paper is clearly written and could easily be re-implemented and adapted to real use-case, the experiments are polished with all the parameters details and baselines included.
- The motivation of having a global model but with only one-communication round could make sense and having a precise analysis for SVM could be useful
- The solution is really privacy-oriented, because the approach uses the feature extractor to benefit from public knowledge rather than consuming privacy budget. Then, the strong convexity gives a very small sensitivity and finally reducing communication also reduce privacy loss. I really appreciate this design.

### Weaknesses
- The scope is narrowed to problems that can be learnt efficiently with SVM/SLP, and it scales poorly with the number of classes as seen on CIFAR100
- The privacy results doesn't seem a big contribution from the mathematical point of view, and the proofs are a bit messy (see below)
- The privacy results are only at the row level, and not at the user level. Overall, motivation and real-use cases for this privacy and communication setting could have been more developed
- No heterogeneity is tackled, despite the fact it is likely to be an issue is real-use cases

### Questions
- In my understanding, your setting would be quite nice for personalization: As every client learns the best model from itself, and as models can be averaged by designed, it could be worth to do a weighted averaging between global and local model, what do you think about it?
- Have you try to do experiments with some heterogeneity and other datasets? Even "fake" heterogeneity with just class unbalance would be a good complement
- I have quickly browsed the proofs, I saw that Lemma 24 is the usual technique of scaling by the sensitivity constant. The proof with developing the ratio seems unnecessary difficult and p27 in the calculation of the line starting by "due to the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality", you put square on the norms, but there are not. Maybe going through the appendix and simplify or highlights the key points could help
- I am not sure that the title is optimal to describe the paper, in particular it makes it sounds more theoretical.

### Summary
This paper proposes a novel federated learning algorithm based on differential privacy, secure multi-party computation and transfer learning. The goal is to minimize MPC Invocations. This work manages to use only 1 round of secure aggregation by taking averaging of local SVM models. Experiment results show that the proposed method achieves a better utility-privacy trade-off compared to DP-SGD.

### Strengths
The problem of privacy in federated learning is important. The proposed method is novel. Theoretical analysis is given for the proposed method.

### Weaknesses
There have been several existing works on the combination of differential-privacy and secure aggregation. Essentially you can turn local DP into a central DP via secure aggregation. In particular, [1] (which is already included in the submission) gives an implementation of distributed DP mechanism that has matching utility with central DP. In Table 1, you claim that DP-FL has noise scale of $O(1/m\sqrt{n})$, which could be too large.

If I understand correctly, 1 round of secure aggregation is enough because the average of local SVM models converges to global SVM optimal. This seems to limit the use case, because in practice we do not often use SVM in FL. Indeed we observe good performance in experiments, but it may also come from the use of pretrained feature extractor. More justification of the importance of SVM learning is highly appreciated.
