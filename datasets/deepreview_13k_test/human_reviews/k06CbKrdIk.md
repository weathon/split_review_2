# A Effective Variance Change Detection Method under constantly Changing Mean

- Decision: Reject
- Scores: 5, 5, 5

## Abstract
Effectively evaluating the viability of a procured organ in the transplant patient prior the procedure is of critical importance. Current viability assessment methods rely on evaluating the organ’s morphology and/or laboratory biopsy results with limited effectiveness. A recently proposed, well-designed noninvasive method evaluated the viability status of organs by detecting the variance change point of their surface temperature through exploring the entire data profile. However, most part of the data in a temperature profile barely contains the change information, which yields a waste of computational resources of their method. This paper proposes an accelerating algorithm with a well-designed dual control windows scheme that can be extended to online change detection. The proposed method significantly improves the computational speed and retains the same change detection power as the method Gao19 through the removal of redundant data. Simulation and application results demonstrate the robust performance of the proposed method.

### Confidence
3: You are fairly confident in your assessment. It is possible that you did not understand some parts of the submission or that you are unfamiliar with some pieces of related work. Math/other details were not carefully checked.

### Summary
This article describes a procedure to detect variance changes in surface temperature signals of organs. The authors assume that the signal mean is a smooth function, which makes the task more difficult. The proposed approach is a fast extension of [1] and [2]. Roughly, the authors restrict the number of candidate change-point indexes of the original method.

The original method simultaneously estimates the smooth mean function and the potential variance change-point index. The proposed algorithm splits the two operations. In addition, the authors introduce two "control windows": one limits the number of indexes on which change detection is performed, and the other limits the number of indexes on which the mean estimation is performed.

### Strengths
The algorithm solves a complex task with an interesting application. The fact that is can be applied to real data is also a strength.

### Weaknesses
The main objective of the article is to describe a fast alternative to an already existing method [1, 2]. The authors should better explain the complexity gain of their algorithmic contribution. Without this, the processing time improvement could merely result from a better implementation.

If there are other contributions, the authors should better highlight them.

### Questions
- Thanks to the proposed approach, the processing time of a thermal image of a porcine liver decreases from 1h to 30 minutes. I cannot tell if this improvement is significant as I am unfamiliar with this application. If 30 minutes is an acceptable execution time, could it be obtained by simply parallelizing the current algorithm? Since each pixel of the thermal video is processed independently, a 3x or 4x speed-up is expected on a personal laptop.

- It is not clear to me if the variance change point detection procedure (Section 2.4) is a contribution of this work. Can you clarify?

- The new algorithm seems more accurate because the candidate change points are restricted to a window. This can prevent false detection on the edges of the signal. How is your method better than a post-processing of the change-points of Gao19 (e.g., by computing a window on the results of Gao19)? 

Minor comments:
- In the title: "An Effective Variance Change Detection Method under Constantly Changing Mean".
- L124: "Large sample size will slow down the computational speed." This statement is vague. You could provide the computational complexity, for instance.
- How are the initial change-points estimated at the beginning of the algorithm (Step 1)?
- "Equation 1" instead of "equation 1".

### Summary
A previous JASA paper (Gao et al., 2019) has proposed a method for variance change point detection, with application to studying the surface temperature of transplanted organs and their viability. Motivated by the high computational time and complexity of this method, this paper proposes an approach to speed up the computation through uses of dual control windows. Numerical experiments are presented parallel to the original paper (Gao et al., 2019).

### Strengths
1. The paper has a good motivation
2. Description of the application is clear

### Weaknesses
1. The contribution is very limited. Except from the proposed dual control window in section 2.2, all of the rest contents are from the paper (Gao et al., 2019).
2. Using the dual control window only speeds up the computation time by 40%, but incurs quite significant estimation bias compared to the result in Gao et al. (2019), as show in the application section.
3. The algorithm for dual control windows is not well described and the details are a bit confusing, e.g. regarding the iterations over data profile index m and the iteration j in Algorithm 1.
4. The test statistic \Delta_n is shown in Gao et al. (2019) to asymptotically follow an extreme value distribution, which is how a rejection criterion can be chosen with control of the type I error. This is not included in this paper, and the proposed rejection criterion in section 2.4 could have a really high type I error.

### Questions
See weaknesses.

As discussed in section 2.1, the objective (1) doesn't have a global minimizer since \sigma and \delta can go all the way to infinity, so only a local minimizer is searched for. While I am aware that the same objective is used in Gao et al. (2019), I wonder why not to use the objective taking the form of penalized log-likelihood of a Gaussian model, such that \log\det(\Sigma) is added to the objective and global minimizers now exist?

### Summary
The viability detection of the transplanted organs is an important biomedical issue. In organ transplantation, timelines are the most important thing. Gao19 proposed a well-designed noninvasive method evaluated the viability status of organs by detecting the variance change point of their surface temperature through exploring the entire data profile. However, most of the data in a temperature profile are redundant, which yields a waste of computational resources of their method. This paper proposes an accelerating algorithm with a well-designed dual control windows scheme that can be extended to online change detection. The proposed method significantly improves the computational speed and retains the same change detection power as the method Gao19. Simulation and application results demonstrate the robust performance of the proposed method.

### Strengths
1. In terms of originality, this paper proposes a new accelerating algorithm and designs a dual control window scheme, which eliminates redundant data for mean estimation and variance change point detection, preserves information data, and improves computational efficiency.
2. In terms of quality, this paper is technically correct, experimentally rigorous and reproducible.
3. In terms of clarity, this paper clearly describes the motivation, notation, details of the dual control window scheme, model, and algorithm.
4. In terms of significance, this paper focuses on viability detection of the transplanted organs and provides an online version based on Gao19 method, which reduces detection time. The proposed change detection method has a very high application value in the field of clinic.

### Weaknesses
1.The core of this paper is that it improves the computational efficiency of the algorithm, so it is necessary to supplement the theoretical proof of convergence speed and compare it with the Gao19 method to make the new method more convincing.
2. This article lacks novelty and is an improvement on the Gao19 method. The mean estimation method and variance change point detection method, as well as the experimental design, are the same as the Gao19 method.

### Questions
1.There are some errors in the details, such as the mixing of upper and lower case N. It is recommended to modify t in the test statistic to k. Reversed the numerator and denominator of the ratio defining the parameter theta. There are also some professional terms such as ‘hypothesis’ instead of ‘assumption’ on page 5. It is necessary to explain the use of "eta" in the objective function.
2.The paper mentions algorithm convergence and needs to introduce which convergence criterion to use.
3. The representation of 'y_i' in the algorithm is incorrect and needs to be modified.
4. This paper pre executed a preliminary variance change point detection program to obtain a set of change points. Please provide a detailed explanation of the method used to obtain this set.
