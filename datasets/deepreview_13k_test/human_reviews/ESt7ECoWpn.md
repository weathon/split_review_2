# Differentially Pivate Per-Instance Additive Noise Mechanism: A Game Theoretic Approach

- Decision: Reject
- Scores: 6, 3, 3, 6

## Abstract
Recently, the concept of per-instance differential privacy (pDP) has gained significant attention by virtue of its capability to assess the differential privacy (DP) of individual data instances within a dataset.
Traditional additive mechanisms in the DP domain, which add identical noises to all data instances, often compromise the dataset's statistical utility to guarantee DP. 
A main obstacle in devising a per-instance additive noise mechanism stems from the interdependency of the additive noises: altering one data instance inadvertently affects the pDP of others. 
This intricate interdependency complicates the problem, making it resistant to straightforward solutions. 
To address this challenge, we propose a per-instance noise variance optimization (NVO) game, framed as a common interest sequential game. 
We show that the Nash equilibrium (NE) points of this game inherently guarantee DP. 
We leverage two algorithms to derive strategies for achieving the NE: 1) an approximate enumeration (AE) using a genetic algorithm, and 2) best response dynamics (BRD). 
To validate the efficacy of our approach, we evaluate the NVO game on various statistical metrics including regression experimental results.
The source code to reproduce the results will be available soon.

### Summary
This paper proposed a game theoretical approach to achieve data dependent privacy guarantees. Specifically, based on the per-instance differential privacy (pDP) definition, a per-instance noise variance optimization (NVO) game is designed and the Nash equilibrium (NE) guarantees DP. An approximate enumeration (AE) algorithm or a best response dynamics (BRD) algorithm can be used to solve the Nash equilibrium.

=======after rebuttal======

I thank the authors for the response. I would like to maintain the borderline positive evaluation. 

I think it is a cool idea to use the game theoretical approach for  instance DP. I cannot strongly champion this paper as I do not consider myself as an expert in either game theory or instance DP. Though the draft is improved during the rebuttal, the various initial sloppiness in instance DP and algorithmic convergence makes me less confident in raising the score and championing it.

### Strengths
As far as I know, the game theoretical approach for per-instance DP is new. The proposed approach looks technically solid. The privacy utility trade-off of pDP is better than the baseline Laplace \epsilon-DP.

### Weaknesses
Unfortunately, I am not an expert on either game theory or per-instance DP, so I would rather use this opportunity to ask questions below. 

In general, my questions are around intuition, experiments and baseline methods.

### Questions
Could the authors provide more intuition of theorem 4.1: e.g., why does it hold intuitively; how realistic is condition (8)? 

Could the authors comment on the guarantees of AE and BRD Algorithms in Section 5 for the NE? Please provide necessary intuition, or properly cite references if it is well known. 

In Section 6 Experiment, it would be nice to actually verify the per-instance \epsilon is achieved using the game theoretical algorithms; the dataset does not seem to be large, and I would hope to see some discussion on the scalability of the approach. 

Finally, I am a little surprised that the only baseline is the worst-case \epsilon-DP with Laplace noise. Are there no other pDP or data dependent DP methods to compare with?

### Summary
This paper proposes an algorithm for optimizing the additive noise variances for achieving per-instance differential privacy, and then demonstrates the algorithm's performance on real data sets.

### Strengths
* The game-theoretic formulation of noise distribution optimization for DP (and variants of DP) is a new idea, to the best of my knowledge.
* There is an extensive set of experiments assessing the performance of the proposed algorithm and comparing with existing noise addition algorithms.

### Weaknesses
* Lack of problem formulation. A central premise of the paper is that "ensuring pDP for a particular data instance is inherently dependent on the noise distribution of other instances". However the claim is not formulated in mathematical terms, making the paper difficult to follow for those readers who are not already convinced of this claim before reading the paper. The lack of problem formulation also makes it confusing why existing noise mechanisms (for example the per instance Gaussian mechanism in Wang (2019)) are not desirable.  

* Ambiguous scope. The first 2.5 pages of the paper give an impression that the new noise addition mechanism, similar to the Laplace mechanism for DP, is suitable for general queries, but on page 3 it is then stated that "we focus on the random sampling query" and $q$ is defined to be the random sampling query. Later, in Remark 4.1 on page 4, the utility function uses $q$ to refer to generic queries. It is ambiguous whether the paper's results are applicable to queries other than the random sampling query.

* Some minor issues: 
     * In "Relation to ($\epsilon, \delta$)-DP" under Section 2, the citation for Gaussian mechanism is incorrect: Dwork and Roth (2014) is an expository work; the Gaussian mechanism appeared in the literature much earlier. 
     * The definition of pDP is imprecise. Compared to the original definition in Wang (2019), Definition 3.1 in this paper does not explicitly fix the data set $\mathcal Z$
    * There is an incorrect statement above Definition 3.2: pDP holding for "every $z$ within $\mathcal Z$" does not guarantee DP, if the data set $\mathcal Z$ is fixed.

### Questions
* Can you formulate the difficulty of optimizing noise distribution for pDP in mathematical terms? What target is being optimized? What is the relation of your work to, for example, the Gaussian mechanism in Wang (2019)?

* Is your work, in the present form, limited to the random sampling query?

* Is the algorithm in Section 5.2 trying to find an approximate instead of an exact solution? If so, does the pDP guarantee hold for the approximate solution? It appears that we only know from Theorem 4.1 that the exact solution satisfies pDP.

### Summary
This paper investigates the problem of computing good noise variances for a Laplace mechanism used to implement per-instance pure DP.  There is a well-known trade-off between the amount of noise and the level of privacy achieved, and so generally, the goal is to minimize the amount of noise required to achieve a certain privacy level. In the regular pure DP case in full generality, the amount of noise to be added is easily computed, but the per-instance definition leads to significant complications. 

The authors frame this as a game and implement a best-response dynamics to compute a good noise variance. Results are compared in simulations to some baselines

### Strengths
* The algorithm seems correct and intuitive
* The performance does seem to be good when compared to baselines
* The approximate enumeration baseline is as interesting as the main result

### Weaknesses
This paper certainly has its redeeming qualities, but the negatives cannot be ignored. I found this paper very difficult to read due to the poor writing and errors.

I think the game theoretic framing is not meaningful. Perhaps it was included as a way to justify the optimization procedure. I would prefer if it was removed because I believe it does not add anything to the paper, but makes things more confusing.

My interpretation of what you are doing is setting two objective functions for both the utility and privacy, then you are optimizing their sum in a greedy way. With this understanding, I think this work falls below the standard for this venue. 

There are some errors, even in very important mathematical statements, for example, as written, the LHS of (1) is always 0 since $z \in \mathcal{Z}$. I had to read the original reference to understand what pDP was. Please address this.

### Questions
1.  Why did you decide to use a game-theoretic presentation? 

2. What does (1) mean, as the current statement seem meaningless?

3.  What does it mean to take a union of vectors as in Algorithm 1?

4. What is $\mathbf{b}_j$ in the inner for loop of Algorithm 1?

### Summary
This paper presents a novel perspective to solve the pDP problem by a game-theoretical modeling. In particular, they introduce a per-instance noise variance optimization (NVO) game, which is designed to find suitable non-identical per-instance additive Laplace noises within a dataset. The authors use two algorithms to derive strategies for achieving the NE: 1) best response dynamics (BRD).1) best response dynamics (BRD), and 2) an approximate enumeration (AE) using a genetic algorithm. The paper demonstrates the efficacy of the NVO game on various statistical metrics and shows that it can achieve better statistical utility while maintaining the same level of DP as the conventional Laplace mechanism.

### Strengths
1. The problem of pDP is well motivated, considering that conventional DP often introduces substantial noise into the dataset, which can significantly diminish its statistical utility. The introduction of a game-theoretical modeling approach is indeed a novel and well-suited method for tackling this challenge, with the aim of optimizing per-instance noise.

2. The paper is commendably presented and effectively communicates its core contributions. It adeptly addresses fundamental questions within this domain, namely, 1) how to ensure the preservation of statistical utility, and 2) whether this alternative modeling approach maintains a sufficiently high level of privacy protection.

### Weaknesses
1. The experiments conducted in this study were carried out with a relatively low level of privacy protection, specifically $\epsilon = \{1,2,4,8\}$. It is worth noting that, in practical scenarios, an even lower value of $\epsilon$ (i.e., $\epsilon<1$) is often preferred. I would greatly appreciate it if the authors could either provide further justification for their choice of $\epsilon$ or consider conducting additional experiments with smaller values of $\epsilon$ to address this concern comprehensively.

2. I am genuinely curious about the computational cost associated with this approach. The datasets used in the experiments consisted of roughly one thousand samples, and the variance set was defined as relatively small. For the best response dynamics (BRD) approach, it would be valuable if the authors could present the computational time required. Regarding the approximate enumeration (AE) approach, I have some reservations about its privacy protection level, as Theorem 4.1 can only guarantee privacy protection for a Nash Equilibrium (NE) point. However, there is a possibility that AE may fail to obtain any NE point, which raises questions about the robustness of privacy protection in this context.
