## Abstract
Exploration strategies within continuous action spaces often adopt heuristic approaches due to the challenge of dealing with an infinite array of possible actions. Previous research has established the advantages of policy-based exploration in the context of deterministic policy reinforcement learning (DPRL) for continuous action spaces. However, policy-based exploration in DPRL presents two notable issues: unguided exploration and exclusive policy, both stemming from the soft policy learning schema, which is famous for DPRL policy learning. In response to these challenges, we introduce a novel approach called Bold Actor Conservative Critic (BACC), which leverages Q-value to guide out-of-distribution exploration. We extend the dynamic Boltzmann softmax update theorem to the double Q function framework, incorporating modified weights and Q values. This extension enables us to derive an exploration policy directly for policy exploration, which is constructed with the modified weights. Furthermore, our theorem offers substantial support for utilizing the minimum Q value as an intermediate step in policy gradient computation for policy optimization. In practice, we construct such an exploration policy with a limited set of actions and train a parameterized policy by minimizing the expected KL-divergence between the target policy and a policy constructed based on the minimum Q value. To evaluate the effectiveness of our approach, we conduct experiments on the Mujoco and Roboschool benchmarks, showcasing superior performance compared to previous state-of-the-art methods across a range of environments. Notably, our method excels in the highly complex Humanoid environment, demonstrating its efficacy in tackling challenging continuous action space exploration problems.

### Summary
Exploring continuous action spaces can be difficult due to the vast number of possible actions, often leading to heuristic approaches. Previous research has shown the benefits of policy-based exploration in deterministic policy RL, but this approach can have issues such as unguided exploration and exclusive policy. To address these challenges, the Bold Actor Conservative Critic (BACC) approach uses Q-value to guide exploration and derive an exploration policy. This approach is evaluated on Mujoco and Roboschool benchmarks.

### Strengths
This paper studies how to improve exploration in continuous control in RL, which is a core topic in the realm of RL. The paper is also clearly written and easy to follow.

### Weaknesses
My main concern for the paper is the experimental evaluation part, where the proposed BACC method does not show significant performance improvement. In addition, as the title of the paper is "Careful at Estimation and Bold at Exploration for Deterministic Policy Gradient Algorithm", it would be better to investigate how well the value function estimates by studying the estimation error.

### Questions
> As shown in Figure 3, our method achieves promising results on this benchmark.

Indeed, the gap is quite marginal. In addition, what is the interval you used for the moving average? The plots seems to be too smooth, and doe not show clear benefits empirically.

> When evaluating the quality of exploration solely based on the results in Fig. 3, it might not provide a clear understanding of what is happening.

Can the authors better explain how this is done? Is it evaluated purely by the exploration method and do not use any kind of exploitation? In addition, it should compare with other exploration methods, e.g., random network distillation. Otherwise, the claim for improved exploration is not well-supported.

### Summary
The paper proposes an exploration method BACC for off-policy reinforcement learning. The method replaces the conventional blind action perturbation and exclusive policy with a Q-value-guided exploration scheme. The intuition is that a well-learned Q function could guide out-of-distribution exploration beyond the current policy. The method is instantiated under the double-Q framework. The major difference between the proposed method and the conventional double Q learning is in the exploration policy. In this work, the exploration policy distribution is estimated using the exponential of the maximum of Q functions. Experiments conducted on simulated continuous control tasks show slightly better performance of BACC than the baselines.

### Strengths
1. Enhancing exploration using guidance from value networks to jump out of the sub-optimality of the policy is a reasonable idea.
2. Motivating the BACC algorithm from the dynamic Boltzmann softmax update theorem and grounding the algorithm into double-Q learning sounds novel to me.

### Weaknesses
1. The paper is difficult to follow especially when reading Section 4. I actually cannot understand how all the introduced components fit together into the proposed method until reading Algorithm 1. I think it would be better to explicitly state how the DDQS operator is instantiated in Sec 4.2 and 4.3 for the readers to understand the method more easily. Also, I am still confused about why the objectives for Q and $\pi$ learning are induced using the conservative policy $\pi_O$; it does not match the implementation where the transitions are obtained using the exploration policy distribution $\pi_E$.    
2. The experimented tasks are general RL testbeds, which may not be the best fit to verify the exploration ability of different methods. I would recommend that the authors experiment on sparse-reward control tasks, such as ``FetchPush'' from OpenAI Gym robotics suite.
3. The related literature of this paper is not sufficiently discussed. In the related work (Sec 4.5), many general-purpose exploration methods (not designed for specific RL algorithms) such as exploration with intrinsic motivation [1][2], exploration with randomized networks [3][4], explicitly separating out exploration [5] are not thoroughly discussed.

4. The BACC algorithm is similar to the ``hybrid actor-critic exploration'' technique in AW-OPT[6], although it is motivated from a more practical aspect. I recommend the authors compare with or at least discuss this related technique.

5. The empirical results seem not significant. In Fig. 3, the performance of BACC is close to the baselines except in ``Humanoid-v2''. In Fig. 5(a), the average performance of BACC is better but the big variance of the baseline OAC covers the confidence range of BACC, while in Fig. 5(b) BACC fails to gain advantage over SAC. It might be due to the benchmark tasks being too easy (dense reward, the learning agent could make progress even without proper exploration) and not favorable to methods with strong exploration abilities. Therefore, the authors are encouraged to investigate other tasks with stricter requirements for exploration.

### Summary
This paper proposes a novel approach called Bold Actor Conservative Critic (BACC) to address the problems of unguided exploration and exclusive policy in policy learning. BACC uses Q-value to guide exploration. Suppose the high Q-value actions far from the policy can also be sampled. In this case, the exclusive policy issue can also be avoided. The experiments on the Mujoco and RoboSchool benchmarks demonstrate the advantages of the proposed policy.

### Strengths
1.	The paper is well-written and has good readability.
2.	The combination of bold actor learning and conservative critic learning seems interesting.
3.	Experiment results illustrate the advantages of the proposed method.

### Weaknesses
1.	In this paper, there are some assumptions that should be demonstrated by the theoretical analysis or the examples in real-world environments. (See the Questions part)
2.	Running time comparison should be given.
3.	The author did not explain the characteristics of the definition of DDQS. (See the Questions part)
4.	In the experiment, the numerical results should be given in different time steps.

### Questions
1.	I am confused about the assumption that policy learning lags behind Q-function learning, meaning that actions collected from the policy have relatively lower Q-values. There can be some theoretical analysis for this assumption. 
2.	I am also confused about the assumption that the Q-function is multimodal. There can be some examples and experimental results. 
3.	This paper supposes that the high Q-value actions far from the policy can be sampled. How can we get the “high Q-value actions” that are far from the current policy in policy learning?  There may be some noises or guided exploration functions for policy learning as in TD3 and SAC. These operations will not make actions far from the current policy.
4.	Why DDQS works? It seems that DDQS will select the actions that have the high values of $Q^{max}(s,a)$ and $Q^{min}(s,a)$. Why DDQS is better than other definitions based on $Q^{max}(s,a)$ and $Q^{min}(s,a)$, such as $\sum_{a}(Q^{max}(s,a)$+ $Q^{min}(s,a))/ \sum_{a}Q^{max}(s,a)$.
