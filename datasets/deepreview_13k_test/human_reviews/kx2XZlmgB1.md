# Enhancing Contrastive Learning for Ordinal Regression via  Ordinal Content Preserved Data Augmentation

- Decision: Accept
- Scores: 6, 6, 6, 6, 5

## Abstract
Contrastive learning, while highly effective for a lot of tasks, shows limited improvement in ordinal regression. We find that the limitation comes from the predefined strong data augmentations employed in contrastive learning.  Intuitively, for ordinal regression datasets, the discriminative information (ordinal content information) contained in instances is subtle. The strong augmentations can easily overshadow or diminish this ordinal content information. As a result, when contrastive learning is used to extract common features between weakly and strongly augmented images, the derived features often lack this essential ordinal content, rendering them less useful in training models for ordinal regression. To improve contrastive learning's utility for ordinal regression, we propose a novel augmentation method to replace the predefined strong argumentation based on the principle of minimal change. Our method is designed in a generative manner that can effectively generate images with different styles but contains desired ordinal content information. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our proposed method, which serves as a plug-and-play solution and consistently improves the performance of existing state-of-the-art methods in ordinal regression tasks.

### Confidence
4: You are confident in your assessment, but not absolutely certain. It is unlikely, but not impossible, that you did not understand some parts of the submission or that you are unfamiliar with some pieces of related work.

### Summary
The authors aim to enhance contrastive learning methods for ordinal regression tasks. They propose to disentangle ordinal content from non-ordinal content in latent factors and focus on augmenting non-ordinal information. Experiments on 3 public datasets are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

### Strengths
1. The proposed method can be easily integrated into existing methods.

2. The experiment results look promising.

### Weaknesses
**Majors:**

1. If one latent feature (non-ordinal content) does not contribute much to an ordinal regression downstream task, then how much help could its augmentation provide? I would like to see some analysis about it.

2. The authors use an example in Figure 1 to show that "the commonly used strong augmentations can distort or even erase these essential features in ordinal regression data." Can you try some strong augmentation methods to demonstrate this claim in Tables 1, 2, and 3?

3. What about the performance of OCP-CL when the mask sparsity ($\lambda_1$) changes?

4. For results in Tables 1-4 and Figure 6, are they average of multiple runs? What about the standard deviations?

**Minors:**

5. The proposed OCP-CL is somehow similar to feature selection for content disentangling. Can feature selection methods be applied to learn ordinal and non-ordinal content?

6. How did you get the numbers in Table 5? By setting a threshold for $M$?

### Summary
The motivation of this paper is very clear and has strong guiding significance for applying contrastive learning to the related field of Ordinal Regression. In view of the fact that strong data enhancement methods in existing contrastive learning will destroy or weaken localized and subtle ordinal content information, this paper proposes a generative data augmentation method that decouples ordinal content factors and non-ordinal content factors. In this method, the author adopts the principle of minimum change for variables related to ordinal content to maintain the invariance of ordinal content during the generation process. A series of experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed generative data augmentation approach.

### Strengths
1. The motivation of the paper is clear and the generative data augmentation method that decouples ordinal content factors and non-ordinal content factors is quite novel. I believe that the generative data augmentation method proposed in this article is more advanced than traditional methods such as Gaussian blur and color dithering, which will provide a new sight for both ordinal regression and contrastive learning community.
2. The manuscript is well organized and thus it is clear and easy to understand.
3. The experiments in this paper are sufficient, which fully demonstrates the effectiveness of the model.

### Weaknesses
1. The symbols in Section 3.1 are very confusing. Some mathematical symbols add hat, some add tilde, and some add both at the same time, which is easy to confuse readers.
2. As we all know, it is difficult to adjust the parameters of generative adversarial models in most practical applications. Therefore, I hope the authors can tell me how difficult it is to tune the parameters of the proposed generative model, which is important for practical tasks.
3. I think the experiments in this article did not fully verify that zo is an ordinal content factor and zn is a non-ordinal content factor. For example, the former obtains wrinkles or gray hair through the generator alone, while the latter obtains other features unrelated to age. From my point of view, the experimental part can only prove that the generated data-augmented images can maintain the ordinal content, which may benefit from the powerful generation ability of the generator itself. So I'd like to see more visual experiments verify this.
4. In the data augmentation results produced in Figure 4, in the first group of augmentations from 4 to 6 years old, although the age range of the characters remains unchanged, the gender has changed. I think the ordinal invariant data augmentation produced by the proposed model may introduce additional noise, but there is no analysis of this additional noise in the paper. Will this additional noise generally affect the results?

### Confidence
3: You are fairly confident in your assessment. It is possible that you did not understand some parts of the submission or that you are unfamiliar with some pieces of related work. Math/other details were not carefully checked.

### Summary
In this paper, the authors aim to improve contrastive learning’s utility for ordinal regression. They find that strong data augmentation could lead to distortion of certain discriminative information (content information) in the image, which is crucial for ordinal regression. To this end, they propose to use a generative model to create augmented images, which diverse in different styles but have the same content information as the original image. Experimental results show that this approach enhance the performance of existing methods.

### Strengths
The motivation of this work is clear and reasonable, which provides a valid approach to tackle the problem of potential negative effects on performance caused by excessive augmentation. The experiments are sufficient to support the effectiveness of this method.

### Weaknesses
- The improvement in effectiveness comes at the cost of increasing computational overhead. The time and space required to train the generated model is no less than (or even greater than) that of training the ordinal regression model, yet the performance gain is not so significant.
- It is unclear whether the proposed framework could guarantee that to what extent the content information can be maintained in the invariant ordinal content factors $\hat{\tilde{z}}_O$, which is crucial for the quality of generated images and further affect the performance of the ordinal regression model.

### Questions
Q1. Do the performance of the model sensitive to the setting of $\lambda_1$ in Eq. (4)?

Q2. The authors choose GAN as the generative model. It seems that the proposed data generative process could also be implemented by other model families (e.g., VAE or diffusion models).

Q3. Could you explain that to what extent the content information can be maintained in $\hat{\tilde{z}}_O$, either in theory or experiments?

### Confidence
4: You are confident in your assessment, but not absolutely certain. It is unlikely, but not impossible, that you did not understand some parts of the submission or that you are unfamiliar with some pieces of related work.

### Summary
In this paper, the authors concentrate on the ordinal regression task. They address the challenge that strong augmentations can often overshadow or dilute the ordinal content information. To mitigate this issue, they propose an augmentation method based on the principle of minimal change to replace the predefined strong augmentations.

### Strengths
1.The author has provided a clear statement of the paper's motivation.

2.The paper is well-organized.

### Weaknesses
1.The experimental results appear to be based on a single run, and the author should consider conducting multiple experiments to reduce the influence of randomness. Notably, the performance on the MWR in Table 1 seems to exhibit minimal variation. The author should provide clarification regarding whether this consistency is a result of chance or if there are specific underlying reasons. Additionally, the author should explore novel ways to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

2.Further clarification is needed for the meaning of "M" in Formula 2. The specific process of obtaining "zo" through Formula 2 also requires detailed explanation, as this is a critical aspect that is currently lacking in the current version.

3.Formula 4 in the paper lacks sensitivity analysis for "lambda1."

4.Ablation experiments should be conducted to effectively demonstrate the impact and effectiveness of the proposed method.

### Summary
The article proposes to apply contrastive learning to the ordinal regression problem and suggests that strong augmentation could eliminate task-related features when generating augmented images. To address this problem, the authors propose a plug-and-play method based on the principle of "minimal change" to generate the augmented images via GAN. This method could retain the desired ordinal information and consistently improve the performance of existing state-of-the-art methods in ordinal regression tasks.

### Strengths
1.The article points out the possible reliance on detail features in ordinal regression.
2.The authors propose to generate augmented images via GAN with the guidance of “minimal change”. The augmented images are applied in contrastive learning to boost performance for ordinal regression. 
3.Experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate the improvements in performance.

### Weaknesses
1.The quality of the writing needs to be improved, and some important concepts are not explained. 
(1)“Deep Sigmoid Flow” is not explained in detail. By the way, in the reference paper, there is only “deep sigmoidal flows”. Is "Deep Sigmoid Flow" a typo, or is it a completely different concept than “deep sigmoidal flows”?
(2)The detailed implementation of mask is not explained. I think it's important to clarify whether it's a category-wise operation or not.
2.The experiments are not sufficient.
(1)Image augmentation is not necessary in supervised contrastive learning. The article lacks comparisons with contrastive learning without image augmentation and with contrastive learning using conventional image augmentation. The benefits of additional image augmentation are unclear.
(2)The article does not conduct experiments based on conventional GANs and does not demonstrate the superiority of the proposed generation methods.
3.The proposed method is only appropriate for data augmentation in the supervised scenario, while most of the contrastive learning methods that have a strong dependence on augmentation are unsupervised.

### Questions
1.What is the difference between the proposed generative method and [1]?
2.How does minimal change ensure that content information related to ordinal is preserved? 
3.Is the mask operation category-wise? if not, how does the model select whether or not to treat hair as ordinal information based on different age groups?
4.Can you provide more generated images? The two sets of images in Figure 5 are not from the same age group. In real life, most infants do not have hair and most children have. I think that if hair is not ordinal information, it is more beneficial to improve the performance of the classifier if part of the generated images have hair while others do not have hair.
