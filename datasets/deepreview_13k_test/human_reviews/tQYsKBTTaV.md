- Decision: Reject
- Scores: 6, 5, 8, 6, 3

## Abstract
Explainable AI (XAI) is a rapidly growing domain with a myriad of proposed methods as well as metrics aiming to evaluate their efficacy. However, current literature is often of limited scope, examining only a handful of XAI methods and employing one or a few metrics. Furthermore, pivotal factors for performance, such as the underlying architecture or the nature of input data, remain largely unexplored. This lack of comprehensive analysis hinders the ability to make generalized and robust conclusions about XAI performance, which is crucial for directing scientific progress but also for trustworthy real-world application of XAI. In response, we introduce LATEC, a large-scale benchmark that critically evaluates 17 prominent XAI methods using 20 distinct metrics. Our benchmark systematically incorporates vital elements like varied architectures and diverse input types, resulting in 7,560 examined combinations. Using this benchmark, we derive empirically grounded insights into areas of current debate, such as the impact of Transformer architectures and a comparative analysis of traditional attribution methods against novel attention mechanisms. To further solidify LATEC's position as a pivotal resource for future XAI research, all auxiliary data—from trained model weights to over 326k saliency maps and 378k metric scores—are made publicly available. The benchmark is hosted at: https://github.com/kjdhfg/LATEC.

### Summary
The authors developed a large-scale benchmark that critically evaluates 17 XAI methods using 20 distinct metrics, using three guiding questions of current interest. The authors perform non-trivial statistical analyses to compare different methods along 3 evaluation criteria (faithfulness, robustness, and complexity), with special attention to the specifics of each method/dataset, as well as the interplay between attribution and attention (as in Transformer models). The authors go the extra step by making all their data available, e.g., model weights and saliency maps, to further facilitate future work.

### Strengths
- Well thought out presentation, detailing all steps taken and analyses applied, with high quality figures.
- Excellent reproducibility.
- Evaluates on point cloud and image volume inputs, beyond traditional evaluations on 2D images.
- Clear summary of main findings and takeaways.

### Weaknesses
Nothing stands out beyond the few points raised below.

### Questions
**Presentation:**
- Section 1:
    - The citations on the first few sentences aren't directly tied to the citing text. Perhaps better references can be used, or the text can be modified slightly to better link to those cited article. Please clarify whether those articles provide supporting evidence, focused on subproblems or application domains, or whether their authors simply echoed similar opinions.
    - Follow-up: it seems this discussion at the beginning is focused on saliency maps specifically. If so, please clarify the scope on the onset to be focused on XAI for computer vision models, with saliency methods as the primary approach being discussed. General statements about state-of-the-art in XAI would require an equally general selection of citations.
    - Indeed, the authors seem to repeatedly use "XAI research" to solely mean works on computer vision.
    - Please also clarify why saliency methods were chosen as the primary approach for this study, with a forward reference to a literature review highlighting other approaches.
- Section 2:
    - Please include a reference to Fig.1 in the main text.
    - S2.1: it would help to include a brief description of each XAI method, e.g., in an appendix, together with references to recent surveys. (perhaps in a form similar to Appendix B.2)
    - Figure 3/4: it seems the legend shows significance indicators that don't actually appear in the figures.

**Nitpicking:**
- Page 3: without adaptions -> adaptation? (I found 7 or so other occurrences)
- S2.2: Due to the LATEC dataset -> Thanks to? Using?
- S3.1: Transformer architecture inherit attention -> inherent?
- Page 6: commendable more robustness

### Summary
Explainable AI (XAI) is an important and rapidly growing research area that aims to propose XAI methods for a better understanding of complex machine learning decisions. This paper performs a comprehensive evaluation of existing XAI methods to analyze their advantages and disadvantages in three aspects, including faithfulness, robustness, and complexity. Specifically, the proposed LATEC is a large-scale benchmark that evaluates 17 XAI methods using 20 distinct metrics. Furthermore, it extends the evaluation from 2D images to 3D point clouds. As a result, it incorporates vital elements like varied architectures and diverse input types, resulting in 7,560 examined combinations. The code, models, and data are publicly available.

### Strengths
1. The proposed LATEC performs an extensive evaluation of 17 XAI methods using 20 distinct metrics, which incorporates 7,560 examined combinations. The evaluation results are solid.
2. LATEC proposes solutions to extend the evaluation of XAI methods from 2D images to 3D point clouds, leading to more comprehensive benchmark results. 
3. The code, models, and data are available to evaluate customized XAI methods or metrics.

### Weaknesses
1. The presentation is hard to read and understand. It is an experimental report rather than a well-organized research paper.
2. As a benchmark and analysis work, The takeaways from this paper are not insightful but rather just some straightforward observations. After reading this paper, I am not able to gain good insights about the good way to evaluate XAI methods.

Overall, this paper makes solid experiments. However, it fails to reveal convincing explanations and insightful comments. This paper is an experimental report rather than a well-prepared paper.

### Summary
The paper proposes a benchmark for XAI methods LATEC. 

- *Methods to benchmarks:* This benchmark includes 17 different methods, this include both traditional (i.e saliency/gradient-based) methods trained on CNNs and Transformers and attention-based methods trained on transformers. 

- *Datasets:* The benchmark considers 3 computer vision data modalities Images, volume(3D data) and point cloud. For each modality 3 different datasets were considered.

- *Benchmarking Metrics:* The paper investigates 3 aspects of XAI methods faithfulness, robustness and complexity. While the paper does not introduce any metrics itself it investigates the performance of different XAI methods on 20 previously proposed metrics and groups them into the 3 aspects.

 Overall the LATEC consists of 7,560 different combinations that were tested, after running this benchmark the paper summarizes the takeaways as follows:
- No XAI method ranks consistently high on all evaluation criteria. 
- The rankings of XAI methods generalize well over datasets from the same modality.
- The complexity metrics proposed for CV tasks does not always have to match the perception of low complexity.

The paper then uses LATEC to answer 3 open XAI questions:

 - How does the performance of attention versus attribution methods differ in practice? They found a large difference in complexity (attention methods are more complex)  and a smaller difference in robustness  (attribution methods are more robust), while the difference in faithfulness is substantially insignificant. However, the paper does mention that the complexity methods are generally debatable since they favor methods that attribute to the smallest set of single pixels.

- Does the efficacy of XAI methods vary across different computer vision modalities? The performance varies across different modalities. 

- With the ascendency of Transformer architectures, is there a potential misalignment with established attribution-based XAI methods?  The benchmark showed that the faithfulness of different attribution methods highly fluctuates for transformers and that attribution based methods are not necessarily a wrong choice when using a transformer architecture.

### Strengths
The main advantage of this benchmark is:
- (a) It considers different neural architectures.
- (b) It considers different data modalities.
- (c) It considers both traditional XAI methods and attention-based methods for transformers.
- (d) It considers different aspects in XAI that researchers or users might care about (i.e faithfulness, robustness and complexity).
- (e) Most of the popular XAI metrics were included.
- (f) It's very comprehensive overall, 7,560 different combinations were tested.
-(g) The code is structured in a way that it is very easy to add to either a new method or a new metric, which can make it an excellent resource for open-source collaborations in the future.


The paper is well-written and easy to follow. The takeaways from the experiments are clearly stated.

### Weaknesses
Novelty is limited: No new datasets or evaluation metrics were introduced in this benchmark.

Although different data modalities were considered, this benchmark only applies to computer vision tasks, the performance of different   XAI methods on other data types like tabular, time series, and language was not investigated.

### Questions
- Do you think the ranking of methods would have varied if synthetic baselines with ground-truth were included?

### Summary
This paper proposes LATEC, a benchmark for large-scale attribution and attention evaluation in computer vision tasks. It evaluates 17 prominent XAI methods, with 20 different metrics. The dataset has been made publicly available.

### Strengths
* Overall I appreciate the effort of curating such a large-scale benchmark for XAI methods and metrics. I am not an expert in this particular field but I do believe it can be beneficial to the community. 
* The presentation and description of the benchmark as well as the dataset is quite clear. 
* The empirical study which aims to address the three pivotal questions makes a lot of sense. 
* The discussion on insights and main takeaways are very clear and easy to follow.

### Weaknesses
* Particularly for faithfulness, from the dataset it is very much uniformly distributed. Does that mean this is not a meaningful metric to consider? 
* Is there any interesting interplay between faithfulness, robustness and complexity? 
* It is mentioned that theoretically biased XAI methods are less faithful on Transformers, but it is not clear why (from Sec. 3)? At least can you give some intuitions? 
* Texts in some images, e.g. Fig 2 are a bit small and difficult to read.

### Summary
The authors propose a framework for benchmarking attribution-based XAI methods, which combines many previously proposed metrics regarding faithfulness, robustness, and complexity of the attributions. Using this framework, the authors evaluate a wide range of different attribution methods on a variety of models and datasets, including CNNs and ViTs, as well as 2D, 3D, and point-cloud inputs. 

The authors analyse and discuss their results and specifically aim to answer three questions they deem relevant in the context of attribution-based XAI methods, namely whether (1) attention-based attributions differ from 'classical' attribution methods, (2) whether the applicability of attribution methods depends on the modality, and (3) whether 'classical' methods still work for transformer models.

### Strengths
The following aspects that strengthen this submission:

**S1**: The experimental evaluation is very extensive, covering a wide range of attribution methods, models, and evaluation metrics on multiple datasets. To achieve this, the authors adapt existing approaches and models to point-cloud and 3D volume inputs when necessary.

**S2**: By making not only the code but various intermediate results publicly available (model weights, attribution maps, metric scores), the framework proposed by the authors allows for easily integrating additional evaluations, methods, and models. This is an important step to increase comparability and allow researchers to fairly test new XAI methods against existing approaches.

**S3**: The experimental details are clearly described and code for reproducing the results has been made available.

### Weaknesses
While the publicly available benchmark can surely prove useful to fellow researchers, I am hesitant to recommend the submission for acceptance for the following reasons.

**W1**: In order to deal with the large number of metrics across multiple datasets, modalities, and models, the authors heavily summarise the results into the broad categories of _faithfulness_, _robustness_, and _complexity_. While this seemingly allows to 'zoom out', I am concerned that this effectively hides much of the complexity of the design choices involved and makes it difficult to understand what one can really deduce from the results. E.g., as the authors note, the _complexity_, which is supposed to be a proxy for the subjective 'human interpretability' of the attributions does not seem to actually coincide with the perceived complexity. What is the value of this measure then? How do we know that the same is not true for faithfulness (see also W2)?

**W2**: For every subcategory, the authors essentially treat all metrics as being equally relevant and adequate for measuring, e.g. _faithfulness_. However, it is unclear to me whether it is meaningful to summarise these metrics into a single score, as each of them measure a different aspect of the models and define 'faithfulness' differently. This can also be observed in Fig. 9 in the appendix, as the different metrics for faithfulness do not seem to exhibit a reliable and general trend (compare, e.g., monotonicity and deletion). Further, they are sometimes based on assumptions that might not hold for a given model. E.g., models might be differently robust to pixel insertion or deletion and it is thus unclear whether these metrics measure aspects of the _underlying model_ or the _XAI method_. How stable are the findings when computing the ranks on different subsets of the metrics? If they are highly dependent on the chosen set of metrics, what do we really learn from the summary?

**W2b**: The authors missed highly relevant studies that also extensively study a wide range of attribution methods according to different criteria (e.g., Hesse et al., 2023, Rao et al. 2022). A comparative discussion to such works seems necessary, especially as those works explicitly try to avoid the pitfalls raised in W2 (i.e., disentangling model behaviour from the attribution methods).

**W3**: The implications and relevance of questions Q1-Q3 as well as their answers are not fully clear to me and I would appreciate if the authors could elaborate. 

**W4 (minor)**: The manuscript is very dense and not easy to read and I encourage the authors to place a particular focus on making the writing more accessible. For example, using non-standard abbreviations for the various methods makes it tedious to read the main text, as one needs to constantly look up what a particular abbreviation stands for (e.g., LI for LIME or LA for 'LRP Attention', etc.). Further, it is difficult to understand a given table or figure from figure + caption alone, which makes the results much less accessible (this is heavily aggravated by the non-standard abbreviations, see e.g., Fig. 3c). 

**W5 (minor)**: The relevance and implications of the discussion of Fig. 3a are unclear to me and the 'distinct clusters' that form seem to be an exaggeration of what is visible in the plots. Without the distinct colourings and the boxes drawn around some of the points, these points seem fairly uniformly distributed to me.

### Questions
Please see weaknesses. If the authors convince me that my concerns are unwarranted, I will consider raising my score.
