# TRAM: Benchmarking Temporal Reasoning for Large Language Models

- Decision: Reject
- Scores: 6, 6, 8, 6, 3

## Abstract
Reasoning about time is essential for understanding the nuances of events described in natural language. Previous research on this topic has been limited in scope, characterized by a lack of standardized benchmarks that would allow for consistent evaluations across different studies. In this paper, we introduce TRAM, a temporal reasoning benchmark composed of ten datasets, encompassing various temporal aspects of events such as order, arithmetic, frequency, and duration, designed to facilitate a comprehensive evaluation of the TeR capabilities of large language models (LLMs). We evaluate popular LLMs like GPT-4 and Llama2 in zero-shot and few-shot scenarios, and establish baselines with BERT-based and domain-specific models. Our findings indicate that the best-performing model lags significantly behind human performance. It is our aspiration that TRAM will spur further progress in enhancing the TeR capabilities of LLMs.

### Confidence
4: You are confident in your assessment, but not absolutely certain. It is unlikely, but not impossible, that you did not understand some parts of the submission or that you are unfamiliar with some pieces of related work.

### Summary
This work introduces various temporal reasoning tasks in MCQ format with a single correct answer. These tasks include Ordering, Frequency, Duration, Time, Ambiguity Resolution, Arithmetic, Relation, Temporal NLI, Causality, Storytelling. This work also includes the results of these datasets on various LLMs like GPT-4, GPT-3.5, Llama2, and Palm2 in settings like zero-shot, few-shot with standard prompting, and Chain of Thought. Furthermore, they also include results from BERT and RoBERTa. The authors also did a thorough error analysis to find out where the models were going wrong and gain a better understanding of the mistakes the models were making.

### Strengths
* Detailed description of dataset creation, sources, templates, and prompts used.
* Insightful error analysis, which investigated every specific error type at a task level.
* Results on several LLMS like GPT-4/3.5, Llama2, Palm2

### Weaknesses
* There are many specifically designed models to solve temporal reasoning. None of these models are included in the benchmarks. Without these, it is difficult to compare results between LLMs and RoBERTa or BERT. What goodness that LLMs bring in which tasks compared to these special models which are smaller compared to LLMs?

### Summary
This paper introduces a temporal reasoning benchmark for large language models. The benchmark is run on a collection of ten datasets containing thirty-eight subtasks related to time reasoning problems. The datasets used for the temporal reasoning task are formulated as multiple-choice problems, reconstructed from several existing datasets. The paper evaluates the performance of several LLMs on the curated datasets in few-shot learning settings. The experimental results show that there is still room for improvement in enhancing the temporal reasoning abilities of these models.

### Strengths
1, The author introduces a new dataset and benchmark for evaluating the temporal reasoning capabilities of large language models with sufficient amounts of data in different time-related domains, including duration, frequency, ordering, etc. 

2, The author provides an in-detail description of the format of the benchmark dataset. 

3, The author provides a comprehensive experimental evaluation of popular LLMs, including GPT-4, GP3-3.5, and Llamma2 on the TRAM benchmark. 

4, the author provides error analysis on different task groups, this can help researchers prioritize their efforts and further improve the temporal reasoning abilities of LLMs in the future.

### Weaknesses
1, As the paper primarily focuses on the area of datasets and benchmarks in large language models, it is better to provide an anonymous GitHub page, for example (https://anonymous.4open.science/) with code for dataset curation and empirical evaluation, as well as simple documentation on running the LLM’s assessments. 

---

2, At this point, the overall contribution of the dataset curation done by the authors is unclear. It is better to provide some examples for comparing the differences between the source dataset and the provided curated dataset. 
With some manual comparison between the shared supplementary materials and the source dataset repos (https://github.com/CogComp/MCTACO/tree/master) and (https://rajpurkar.github.io/SQuAD-explorer/). The author seems to simply reformulate multiple original Yes/No questions in one multiple-choice question. For example, in the ‘frequency’ task, the original question from MCTACO looks like:

Q1: For example, buy local produce at a farmers market, like the one in Figure 2.20. How often do they buy produce from the farmers market?	
twice a week	yes	Frequency

Q2: For example, buy local produce at a farmers market, like the one in Figure 2.20. How often do they buy produce from the farmers market?	he says for example	no	Frequency

……

Q8: For example, buy local produce at a farmers market, like the one in Figure 2.20. How often do they buy produce from the farmers market?	once a second	no	Frequency

However, the provided dataset in this paper takes the above 8 original questions and reformulates the question as (in file frequency.csv): 

Q1: For example, buy local produce at a farmers market, like the one in Figure 2.20. How often do they buy produce from the farmers market?	

Answer A: twice a second

Answer B: he says for example	

Answer C: twice a week	

Correct Answer: C

First, the reconstructed candidate choices contain answers that do not correlate with time (Answer B), which is caused by the error from the original data source. It’s better to provide an overall evaluation of the data quality.  Second, it is better to explain the advantages of converting several existing Yes/No questions to one multiple-choice question. 

---

3, It is better to provide an overall description of the dataset following the datasheet for datasets [1] (or other similar sources), I believe this may address most of the concerns. 

---

4, The experimental results show a disparity in performance across different Large Language Models (LLMs). In addition, with the integration of chain-of-thought prompting, the results show only minor improvements. In addition, GPT-4 appears to outperform every other model by a large margin. It is unclear whether the provided model is already trained on the source dataset (MCTACO) from which this benchmark dataset is derived. Here is the answer I got from the GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 by prompting the question: ‘Please provide a detailed description of the MCTACO dataset for temporal reasoning.’ 

GPT-3.5: 
I'm sorry, but as of my last knowledge update in January 2022, I do not have specific information about the "MCTACO" dataset for temporal reasoning. It's possible that this dataset was created or became publicly available after my last update, or it may not be a well-known dataset in the field of natural language processing…….. 

GPT-4:
The MCTACO (Multiple Choice Temporal Commonsense Reasoning Assessment) dataset is a collection of questions designed for evaluating the temporal commonsense reasoning abilities of machine learning models. This dataset is particularly focused on the aspect of understanding time-based common sense or temporal common sense, which is essential for natural language understanding systems…….
It is better to provide some justifications for the problem mentioned above.

### Questions
My questions are listed in the weakness, and can be summarized into three folds:

1, Did the author do a lot of data preprocessing on curating the benchmark dataset?

2, What are the advantages of reformulating the original data sources into the TRAM dataset? What is the major differences between the source dataset and the curated dataset? 

3, What causes the significant disparity in model performance? Is it because some LLMs are already trained on the source dataset?

### Summary
This paper proposes  a benchmarking dataset for temporal reasoning named TRAM. The TRAM benchmark evaluation is exemplified with BERT-style pretrained-finetuned models  and GPT style prompting-based LLMs. The authors intended to provide TRAM as a comprehensive benchmark to spur the LLM research progress in temporal reasoning capabilities.

### Strengths
• A comprehensive benchmark covers various temporal reasoning abilities: ordering, frequency, duration, typical time, ambiguity, arithmetic, relation, temporal NLI, causality, storytelling. 
• The overall  size of the dataset is big, being 526,068 problems for benchmarking.
• Pretraining-finetuning and prompting paradigms of LLMs are both evaluated using the benchmarking providing reasoning evaluation conclusions. It is a good starting point from which the community can evolve the LLM techniques  or other LLM alternatives for temporal reasoning.

### Weaknesses
• The benchmark currently is only in the form of multi-choice questions.
•  The sizes of different categories of problems are imbalanced. For example, causality is of only 600 problems. This might render the benchmarking evaluation results misguiding. Especially for the pretraining-finetuning paradigms. 
•  The texts are mostly from existing datasets. Latest LLMs might have seen them through the pretraining phrase crawled dataset. It might make the benchmarking results over-estimate the performance of LLMs in the temporal abilities. It is an issue beyond just the temporal reasoning abilities extending to all other LLM benchmarking datasets. It calls for more organic benchmarking approaches for LLMs and their iteration which can be pretrained with all kind of available data in human world including benchmarking data.

### Questions
1. For the terms "commonsense", "analogy inference", "comparison" and so on, it would be better to have a formal definition and ensure that the datasets and the reasoning follow the formal definitions with verifiable criteria (automatically verifiable would be even better).
2. Page 7, it would be better to include a more comprehensive list of the settings for human expert annotators evaluation. For example, how the experts are drawn from the population, how to ensure they are capable experts or their level of expertise. How will an ordinary person performance comparing to experts? Such a systematic study of human experiments might also provides hints for comparing human performance variation with LLM performance variation.
3. Page 18, appendix B, for self-contained please detail a little bit more for SP with examples. The whole section is essentially about CoT with little information regarding how SP is constructed.

### Summary
This paper presents a new LLM-focused benchmark suite named TRAM. It consists of a variety of temporal reasoning tasks, and is aimed at driving progress. Experimental results demonstrate a gap between human-level and machine-level performance, suggesting progress to be had.

### Strengths
+ I generally like good benchmarks. I think they serve an important purpose in the community, which is to systematize comparisons (and ideally, drive progress).

+ This benchmark seems well thought out, with a thoughtful and diverse set of temporal reasoning tasks.

+ The empirical results suggest that (1) the benchmark discriminates between different models, highlighting their performance discrepancies, and (2) shows a gap between human and machine performance.

### Weaknesses
- I like good benchmarks to be hard. I'm a bit concerned that SOTA performance on this benchmark starts at 84%; this perhaps suggests that the benchmark isn't hard enough.

- I'm a bit concerned that some of the questions were sourced from other benchmarks. This could be problematic if it were, for example, included in a larger suite of benchmarks such as Google's BigBench.  I worry that some questions would be double-counted, leading to incorrect conclusions about model performance.

### Questions
What percentage of questions, exactly, come from other benchmarks?

### Summary
This paper focuses on introducing a new benchmark for temporal reasoning tasks in a multi-choice format to evaluate the temporal reasoning capabilities of LLMs. There are 10 tasks collected in the benchmark covering Ordering, Frequency, Duration, Typical Time, Ambiguity Resolution, Arithmetic, Temporal Relation, Temporal NLI, Temporal Causality and Temporal Storytelling. The authors evaluated several leading LLMs including Llama2, PaLM2, GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 against the tasks, and reported the evaluations results. In addition, the authors also conducted error analysis of the results to understand where current LLMs are still struggling in temporal reasoning.

### Strengths
The set of tasks is very comprehensive to cover a wide variety of temporal reasoning task types. The dataset size is quite large, bigger than 3K samples for 9 out of 10 tasks, making the evaluation results robust against variance. The LLMs evaluated are also quite comprehensive covering both the SOTA proprietary and the SOTA open-source LLMs. The error analysis is also quite useful for understanding where the current LLMs still fall short in temporal reasoning.

### Weaknesses
There are two major weaknesses to this work:
1. The task difficulty of the TRAM benchmark is not enough to serve the purpose for ongoing evaluations of future more powerful LLMs. 8 out of 10 tasks have close to or better than 90% accuracy when evaluated on the SOTA LLM GPT-4 (5S, CoT). For the same 8 tasks, the gap between GPT-4 and Human is within 5%. This leaves very little headroom for improvement to validate future more powerful LLMs. 

2. While the benchmark is designed specific for temporal reasoning, it is not entirely clear how much failure in the errors are due to the model's lack of general reasoning capability, rather than specific to the time dimension. A more careful separation and attribution to either general reasoning and temporal reasoning failures is needed to make the benchmark really useful for gauging temporal reasoning progress.

### Questions
1. The difference between TRAM and previous temporal reasoning benchmarks is unclear: for instance Duration and Frequency are already covered by earlier benchmarks. A more detailed and convincing comparison is needed to establish the necessity of the newly introduced TRAM benchmark.

2. In Section 4.3, the authors claimed that they prompted the model to explain its decisions, and used these explanations to identify errors, understand the reasons, and categorize error types. This is very concerning as LLMs are known to not know what they don’t know. Relying on LLMs to provide the explanations for error analysis puts a big question mark on the reliability of the error analysis conclusions themselves.
