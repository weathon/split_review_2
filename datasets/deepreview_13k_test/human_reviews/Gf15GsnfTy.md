# REValueD: Regularised Ensemble Value-Decomposition for Factorisable Markov Decision Processes

- Decision: Accept
- Scores: 5, 6, 6

## Abstract
Discrete-action reinforcement learning algorithms often falter in tasks with high-dimensional discrete action spaces due to the vast number of possible actions. A recent advancement leverages value-decomposition, a concept from multi-agent reinforcement learning, to tackle this challenge. This study delves deep into the effects of this value-decomposition, revealing that whilst it curtails the over-estimation bias inherent to Q-learning algorithms, it amplifies target variance. To counteract this, we present an ensemble of critics to mitigate target variance. Moreover, we introduce a regularisation loss that helps to mitigate the effects that exploratory actions in one dimension can have on the value of optimal actions in other dimensions. Our novel algorithm, REValueD, tested on discretised versions of the DeepMind Control Suite tasks, showcases superior performance, especially in the challenging humanoid and dog tasks. We further dissect the factors influencing REValueD's performance, evaluating the significance of the regularisation loss and the scalability of REValueD with increasing sub-actions per dimension.

### Summary
This paper studies RL in large discrete action space with factorization structure. Building upon the value decomposition idea proposed in past work, this paper presents some theoretical analysis which motivates the use of an ensemble of critics to control the variance as well as a new regularization term for better coordination over sub-actions. Experiments on discretized version of DeepMind control suite shows competitive performance.

### Strengths
- Writing is clear. 
- Strong empirical results showing better performance than the baselines considered. 
- Ablation studies show the effect of regularization term and ensemble size, which is helpful for future readers who may want to adopt the proposed method.

### Weaknesses
- The theoretical analysis on "DecQN target estimation bias and variance" should be made more rigorous, and some of the conclusions in this paper seems to contradicts previous results in an uncited related work. 
- The justification for the "Regularized value-decomposition" seems more of a heuristic rather than a formal justification. 
- The authors should consider adding a few missing baselines to the main experiment in Figure 1 for a fairer comparison

These are elaborated in Questions below.

### Questions
- Bias and Variance
  - In Tang et al. 2022, the authors showed that using Q decomposition may **increase bias** and **decrease variance**. In theorem 1 of this paper, the authors claim using Q decomposition may **decrease bias** and **increase variance**. These results seem to contradict each other. Could you clarify any difference in the analyzed settings? 
  - Eqn (3.1) is valid to write since we are defining the parameterization of the Q-function $Q_{\theta}$, however, in Eqn (4.2) for the term related to $U_i^{\pi_i}$, the decomposition of the true Q-function $Q^{\pi}$ might not exist, as discussed in Tang et al. 2022. Could you elaborate what assumptions is the current analysis operating under? 

- Fairer comparisons with baselines
  - The proposed method appears to be modifying DecQN to incorporate (1) ensemble and (2) regularization. In Fig 1, REValueD should be compared to ensembled DecQN and ensembled BDQ for a more "apples-to-apples" comparison. 

- Other questions: 
  - In Fig 2, why does BDQ perform well on this task but not the tasks in Fig 1? Would BDQ with ensemble perform even better? 
  - Minor presentation suggestion: in Table 2, can you bold best results for each task to make it easier to read?

### Confidence
3: You are fairly confident in your assessment. It is possible that you did not understand some parts of the submission or that you are unfamiliar with some pieces of related work. Math/other details were not carefully checked.

### Summary
The paper proposes REValueD to enable Q-learning algorithms on tasks with high-dimensional discrete action space. With the same concept of value decomposition, REValueD improves DecQN by mitigating the target variance with an ensemble of critics and mitigating the effects of exploratory actions with a regularization loss. Experiments on the DeepMind Control Suite tasks show that REValueD consistently outperforms DecQN and another baseline.

### Strengths
1.	This paper is well-written and well-structured. Although the ideas of the ensemble and regularization is incremental, they are straightforward and make sense.
2.	The theoretical analysis shows that REValueD could reduce the target variance of DecQN while maintaining the expectation of the target difference of DecQN unchanged with the help of the ensemble technique.
3.	The experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method and ablation studies are given to further validate each component of REValueD.

### Weaknesses
1.	In the experiments, only two baselines (DecQN and BDQ) are compared although the authors list several works in the related works.
2.	An introduction and analysis of the action pace and sub-action space in humanoid and dog tasks may help the readers understand the setting and motivation more clearly.

### Questions
1.	In Equation (3.1), the value-decomposition form is the direct sum operator and REValueD follows this form, why do the authors not use other value-decomposition forms such as weighted sum?
2.	Could the authors explain more about the design of |δi|? Why “for large |δi|, the reward/next state is likely influenced by the effect of other sub-actions.”?

### Summary
This paper studies a factorized Q-learning approach to solve continuous control problems. The approach builds on the recent Decoupled Q-Networks agent and makes two extensions: (1) critic ensembling to mitigate value variance, (2) a regularization objective to mitigate credit assignment issues stemming from exploratory sub-actions. The resulting REValueD agent improves learning efficiency as measured by gradient step count on common DeepMind Control Suite tasks.

### Strengths
-	The ensembling and regularization objective are natural extensions to the DecQN agent 
-	The resulting REValueD agent yields strong performance on the tasks being studied
-	Ablations on individual components highlight the benefit of each addition in isolation
-	The tabular FMDP experiment in Appendix G is a nice addition
-	The paper is well-motivated, structured and written

### Weaknesses
-	The results focus on DeepMind Control Suite tasks from **proprioceptive inputs**. The primary baseline additionally evaluated on MetaWorld, Control Suite from vision, and an Isaac Gym-based locomotion task with a single set of hyperparameters (some minor variations). The results presented here would benefit from additional evaluations on more diverse environments.
-	**Control Suite performance** (Figure 1): the results would benefit from displaying reference performance of a strong recent continuous actor-critic agent. The benchmark results (throughout) are provided with “Gradient steps” on the x-axis, which deviates from the conventional “Time steps” metric. Readability would be improved by adding Figure 1 with “Time steps” to the Appendix and providing the necessary conversion values between “Gradient steps" and "Time steps” (e.g. gradient steps per time steps ratio).
-	**Increasing discretization** (Figure 2 & 4): the robustness of REValueD over increasing discretizations is impressive. Figure 6 of the DecQN paper showed approximately the same performance on both Dog-Walk and Finger-Spin when using 3 vs 21 bins – do you have an intuition for where this difference is coming from (Figure 6 of DecQN yields ~950 on Finger-Spin and ~850 on Dog-Walk for 21 bins). Is this in part due to the hyperparameter modifications over the original DecQN agent mentioned in Appendix B?
-	**Stochastic environments** (Figure 3 & 5): the DecQN paper also introduced a distributional DecQN agent based on the C51 critic in Appendix I with experiments in stochastic environments in Appendix J. Distributional critics can be viewed as an alternative method to ensembling in accounting for variability resulting from exploratory sub-actions, potentially side-stepping the computational overhead of explicit ensembles. Discussion and/or experimental comparison between DecQN+C51 or a distributional version of REValueD and ensembled REValueD would further strengthen the paper (this was briefly mentioned in the conclusion).
-	A potential downside of ensembles is the **computational overhead** required for training. It would be interesting to see how the plots compare when plotting time on the x-axis. While Appendix B notes that there is “minimal slowdown” for relatively small ensemble sizes, it would be helpful to quantify this.

### Questions
-	How would REValueD ensembling compare to distributional DecQN?
-	How was the ensembling set up to ensure efficiency / what is the computational overhead?
-	What was the benefit of altering certain hyperparameters (exploration decay, Polyak averaging) and are these sufficient to explain the performance mismatch between DecQN in Figure 2 & 4 (REValueD) vs Figure 6 (DecQN)?
