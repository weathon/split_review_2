# Set-based Neural Network Encoding

- Decision: Reject
- Scores: 5, 3, 8, 3

## Abstract
We propose an approach to neural network weight encoding for generalization performance prediction that utilizes set-to-set and set-to-vector functions to efficiently encode neural network parameters. Our approach is capable of encoding neural networks in a modelzoo of mixed architecture and different parameter sizes as opposed to previous approaches that require custom encoding models for different architectures. Furthermore, our \textbf{S}et-based \textbf{N}eural network \textbf{E}ncoder (SNE) takes into consideration the hierarchical computational structure of neural networks by utilizing a layer-wise encoding scheme that culminates to encoding all layer-wise encodings to obtain the neural network encoding vector. Additionally, we introduce a \textit{pad-chunk-encode} pipeline to efficiently encode neural network layers that is adjustable to computational and memory constraints. We also introduce two new tasks for neural network generalization performance prediction: cross-dataset and cross-architecture. In cross-dataset performance prediction, we evaluate how well performance predictors generalize across modelzoos trained on different datasets but of the same architecture. In cross-architecture performance prediction, we evaluate how well generalization performance predictors transfer to modelzoos of different architecture. Experimentally, we show that SNE outperforms the relevant baselines on the cross-dataset task and provide the first set of results on the cross-architecture task.

### Summary
This paper proposed a set-based neural network encoder for predicting the generalization performance given access only to the parameter values. They also introduce two novel tasks for neural network generalization performance prediction: cross-dataset and cross-architecture.

### Strengths
-- Compared with previous methods, the method is applicable to arbitrary architecture benefit from the set-based encoder which also takes hierarchical computational structure of the neural networks into account.

-- To tackle with the large compute memory requirement, this paper proposed a pad-chunk-encode pipeline to encode the neural network layers efficiently.

-- Two new tasks were introduced for evaluating the prediction of the generalization performance.

### Weaknesses
-- The motivation of the paper is not clear enough. For a large model, it will lead to large computation overhead, and for a small model you can just simply run the model on the test set. The necessity of the task should be well discussed.

-- The applications of the proposed SNE is still limited. The architectures and datasets are very simple.

-- Lack of ablation study of their methods, such as the effect of their hierarchical computational structure position encoding.

### Questions
-- Are the methods applicable for the network with residual connections? In your settings, just given assess to the parameter values, the neural network with or without residual connection will get the same encoding and get the same prediction result. That is not intuitive.

### Summary
This paper presents a method of encoding NN architectures by using the trained parameters to predict the validation accuracy of a NN. The proposed set-based encoding improves upon prior work that investigated this problem when evaluated on the same set of benchmarks that include 30k different hyperparameter variations of training small NNs on MNIST-level tasks.

### Strengths
Interesting methodology for the set-based encodings. More general than prior approaches.

### Weaknesses
Very marginal empirical improvements. Also, I find the motivation for predicting post-training network performance quite lacking. Why is the evaluation on a small validation set insufficient in this case? How does this method compare to things like zero-cost-proxies which try to predict network performance _before_ training?

Additionally, the baseline accuracy for some of these NNs is very low (0.45 on MNIST?)

Minor: SNE is an overloaded acronym in the paper.

### Summary
This paper focuses on solving the problem of predicting the model accuracy performance given only access to the model parameters. The authors proposed a new method to encode the neural network parameters with set-to-set and set-to-vector functions. The proposed method encodes the model layer types and the layer positional information to retain the model order properties. Experiments show that the proposed SNE not only outperforms existing baselines in terms of the model accuracy prediction correlation, but also has good generalization ability cross different datasets and architecture.

### Strengths
- The paper is easy to follow.
- The experiments are convincing and the results are good.

### Weaknesses
- The method part is a little bit hard to follow because of so many notations involved.    
Please refer to the questions part for more details. Thank you.

### Questions
- In Section 3.2, when applying flattening, padding, and chunking operations on a convolutional layer, they are applied on the kernel dimension. I'm wondering why is the case? I have the question because really we have $3\times3$ kernel size for Convs. Do we really need to chunk it anymore?
- Why Equation 2 will convert a vector in size of $c\times1$ to $c\times h$? As mentioned in Section 3.6, $\Phi_{\theta_{1}}$ is SAB(SAB(X)), while SAB(X) is MAB(X,X) in Equation 10. It seems that MAB(X,X) should have the same size as X. How can we get from  $c\times1$ to $c\times h$? You may want to add the dimensions for Equations 10 to 13 for clarification.
- To my understanding, the encoding process from Section 3.3 to 3.5 is like a nested process. Is it possible to provide a pseudocode for it?
- It seems that the "specific dataset $d$" in Section 3.1 is never used. You may want to get rid of it.
- About the experiments, could you have some results on popular CNN architectures like ResNet? Residual links are nowadays important part of the CNN models.

### Summary
The authors propose an approach to take neural network parameters as input. They treat the parameters as a set and process it with a variant of transfomers. In order to disambiguate weights of different layers with appropriate position encodings based on the layer type and layer number. Chunking of weights is used in order to make the method practical in terms of execution speed.

### Strengths
- SNE is a generic technique that is mostly (see second weakness) architecture-agnostic. This is a notable difference from recent work and as such a valuable contribution. This makes the method more widely applicable than prior work.
- Results on the newly proposed datasets appear decent, good experimental evaluation on the proposed datasets.

### Weaknesses
- The method is not "minimally equivariant" (see [1] for the definition). In essence, there exist permutations of the weights which *do* change the function, but are considered equivalent by SNE. Consider the flattened weights [1 2 3 4 5 6] with a chunk size of 3. The weights [4 5 6 1 2 3] would be considered exactly the same, since the set of chunks {[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]} are the same. As such, the proposed SNE is not capturing the correct equivariance of the task: it is unable to distinguish between models that are clearly different. This is the primary reason why I'm giving a 1 in terms of soundness. Given the lack of discussion and evaluation of this issue in the paper, I cannot recommend acceptance at this point.
- The authors do not consider the case of architectures with branches and how the position encoding needs to be adapted for them
- There is a lack of comparison against existing methods on established datasets. For example, there are no experiments on implicit neural representations, which DWSNet [2] and NFN [Zhou et al., 2013] are evaluated on extensively. There is no reference to DWSNet in the text.

### Questions
Can you state the specific equivariance that SNE has in more detail and the relationship as to how accurately it models the symmetry group of parameters of neural networks?
How does the position encoding work when the model has branches, and as such, there is no total order on the layers?
