- Decision: Reject
- Scores: 5, 5, 3, 3, 5, 3, 8

## Abstract
In Federated Learning (FL), the focus has predominantly been on uni-modal scenarios, limiting the system's ability to leverage multi-modal data. This paper introduces a novel setting, Modality-Collaborated Federated Learning (MCFL), designed to facilitate collaboration among uni-modal clients with different data modalities. Unlike existing frameworks that emphasize multi-modal clients and tasks, MCFL aims to be more practical by focusing on uni-modal clients and ensuring performance gains across individual modalities. To address the challenges of model heterogeneity and modality gaps in MCFL, we propose Federated Modality Collaboration (FedCola), a framework based on a modality-agnostic transformer. FedCola explores optimal strategies in cross-modal parameter-sharing, model aggregation, and temporal modality arrangement. Our comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that FedCola significantly outperforms existing solutions, serving as a robust baseline for MCFL and marking a substantial advancement in federated learning.

### Summary
The paper presents "Modality-Collaborated Federated Learning (MCFL)," a new approach in Federated Learning (FL) that facilitates collaboration across uni-modal clients with diverse data modalities. It introduces the Federated Modality Collaboration (FedCola) framework, utilizing a modality-agnostic transformer for effective cross-modal parameter sharing and model aggregation. The authors demonstrate FedCola's superiority over existing FL solutions, making it a robust baseline for MCFL in multi-modal data environments.

### Strengths
1. The paper is well-written, exhibiting clear and coherent logic that is easy to follow.
2. The authors have introduced a scenario in the field of Federated Learning (FL), specifically how to facilitate collaboration among uni-modal clients with different data modalities. This consideration is crucial for advancing the field and demonstrates a deep understanding of real-world challenges in FL.
3. In the process of proposing their methodology, the authors explore three key questions, each meticulously analyzed to formulate the final Federated Modality Collaboration (FedCola) framework. The logical progression through these questions strengthens the validity of the proposed method.

### Weaknesses
1. The paper's applicability is questioned due to the two-modal settings. Federated learning between many different medical centers, each with multi-modal and multi-domain data, presents a more realistic scenario. The author should provide a stronger motivation for the new setting, demonstrating why traditional multi-modality and personalized methods are not suitable, as without this it might be challenging to determine whether the methods are specifically designed for the limited scenario.
2. The reason for combining disparate single-modality datasets like CIFAR-100 and AGNEWS is unclear. The paper does not adequately explore the impact of modality similarity on collaborative learning. This raises the question of whether combining unrelated modalities, such as medical images and arbitrary internet text, would be beneficial for the training.
3. The experimental setup, only including OrganAMINIST and MTSamples, lacks sufficient diversity in multi-domain modalities. A simple and straightforward setup would involve clients with single modality and domain, such as three clients with distinct imaging datasets (NIH Chest X-rays, OrganAMINIST, BraTS) and two with textual datasets (MTSamples, MIMIC-III).
4. The effectiveness of larger models remains unexplored. The choice of a small model (ViT-Small) and datasets limits the study’s relevance to larger-scale, cross-modality scenarios typical in medical institutions. Moreover, the baseline selection is too limited (FedAvg and CreamFL). The inclusion of existing multi-modal alignment strategies is necessary for a more comprehensive evaluation.

### Summary
This manuscript aims to address a significant problem in federated learning - enabling multimodal learning collaboration among uni-modal clients. The proposed solution of decomposing the modality-agnostic transformer into embedding layers, the feature extraction transformer layers, and task-specific head is reasonable and promising. The experimental results are also provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

### Strengths
It provides a simple but useful framework for multmodal learning collaboration among uni-modal clients.

### Weaknesses
However, I have the following three main concerns:
- Different modalities shared the transformer layers, which assumes that the outputs for these layers of different modalities are in the same semantic abstract levels.
- It lacks visualizing the representations of the samples from different modalities are well aligned in the feature spaces.
- The solution should be verified on the widely used multimodal learning datasets, e.g., COCO-Captions.

### Questions
How can we guarantee that the feature representations from different shared transformer layers for different modalities are in the same semantic abstract levels?

5: You are absolutely certain about your assessment. You are very familiar with the related work and checked the math/other details carefully.

### Summary
This paper investigates model aggregation strategies in multi-modal settings, where clients may possess diverse data modalities. To tackle the challenges arising from model and data heterogeneity, the authors introduce the FedCola framework, incorporating the following key elements: 1) aggregation of embedding layers within each modality, and 2) aggregation of only the attention layer in the transformer block across multiple modalities. By employing additional techniques such as modality compensation and warm-up, the authors showcase enhancements in the overall performance of the global model.

### Strengths
1.	The paper delves into a novel setting within federated learning, with practical applications highlighted, such as in real-world scenarios like hospital data.
2.	The logical presentation of the paper, addressing challenges before presenting potential solutions, enhances its overall coherence and ease of comprehension.
3.	The authors offer comprehensive details on experimental settings, particularly in the context of heterogeneous data distribution, adding depth to their exploration.

### Weaknesses
The following feedback highlights specific areas for improvement, including addressing surprising findings, clarifying counter-intuitive results, completing incomplete sections, providing comparisons with alternative methodologies, and adopting a more uniform writing style.

### Questions
1)	It is a bit surprising for the reviewer to see the performance on CIFAR-100 could be significantly boosted (5%-10%) by training with AGNews. Given the general perception of the two datasets as having irrelevant data classes, the paper draws a highly counter-intuitive conclusion.  This paper draws a (very) counter-intuitive conclusion, but does not provide sufficient reasoning. 
2)  In table 1, the performance of image acc drops to 3% by model aggregation in a traditional FL way. The authors attribute this decline to data imbalance. Notably, data imbalance also exists in Attention sharing and FFN sharing, yet these exhibit good accuracy levels, presenting a counter-intuitive scenario. The paper lacks sufficient explanations for these observations. Moreover, based on the presented results, aggregating FFN or Attn only maintains a good performance. But why aggregating them together leads to a significant drop? 
3)	Section 5 is not complete. The modality compensation in Sec 5.2 is supposed to be more clear, whereas the authors leave the algorithm in appendix. It also remains unknown to me how the warm-up is set in Sec 5.3, e.g., what is the round of warm-up or when should we be confident the warm-up is complete. 
4)	In table 3, the warm-up for vision leads to acc improvement on AGNews, but a significant drop on MTSamples. As such, readers are not sure such a warm-up is necessary for vision tasks.
5)	The reviewer suggests that a straightforward approach to federated learning (FL) on multi-modality data would involve performing model aggregation for each modality and subsequently using a classical method for multi-modal information exchange, such as latent vector alignment. The paper is expected to include a comparison of results obtained through this methodology, providing a benchmark for evaluating the proposed approach against a more conventional FL strategy for multi-modal data.
6)	The reviewer strongly recommends that the authors refrain from overemphasizing words or sentences in multiple ways throughout the paper. Instances such as using italic font, underlining, employing colored text (e.g., orange) for phrases like "Equal-weighted arithmetic mean", and using bold font for "Top-1 Acc" after Eq 1 are noted. Adopting a more uniform and straightforward writing style is advised to enhance the overall readability and professional appearance of the paper.

In general, the reviewer believes this paper should undergo a major revision, and is not ready to be accepted based on its current status, especially for a top-tier conference like ICLR.

### Summary
This submission discusses a scheme where in the multi-modal setting, modality-agnostic transformer models used in different modalities can share parameters of self-attention layers. Authors further suggest parameters specific to individual modality that are not shared can still be augmented to to the cross-modal models and averaging can be taken for the augmented model (referred to as “cross-modal aggregation). Together with warming-up training for each individual modality, authors suggest a framework named FedCola to do federated learning across image-text modalities. Experimental results on CIFAR100 and AGNEWS datasets are reported.

### Strengths
The topic of this work is highly relevant to the theme of ICLR.


I very much appreciate authors’ effort to make the narrative to be direct and concise, and to formulate several questions in the text that outline key points in the proposed methodology.

### Weaknesses
Several technical details should be further clarified to let the paper to be more convincing.

### Questions
- on methodology: what is the frequency of doing inter-modality update of the shared parameters and that of doing intra-modality update of modality-specific parameters? 
- on methodology: as the number of training data points/clients in different modalities could be different, the shared parameters should be far more frequently updated compared to modality-specific parameters. It seems that authors have proposed the aggregation step to address this problem. It remains unclear to me how gradient back-propagation works with respect to those parameters which are manually aggregated/augmented into a model, and how these external parameters function during the inference process of a certain modality?
- on methodology: under the assumption of data homogeneity and absence of Byzantine workers, should the Uni-FedAVG method show better performance on the dataset CIFAR100? i.e., for the vision modality itself, I am expecting that the accuracy should be somehow higher than that reported in Table 4. [Benchmarking FedAvg and FedCurv for Image Classification Tasks, Casella et al., 2023]
- on results: regarding reported average accuracy results in tables 1 and 3, how are the average computed? Is there any weighting assigned to each modalities?
- on results: intuitively, when comparing the balance of clients for different modalities, why not show the accuracy change in each modality under different $(N_v, N_l)$ setup?
- on methodology: Convolutional networks are perhaps a simpler type of models for vision related tasks. As in the CIFAR100 case, transformer-based models seem to be somehow below par of the performance of convolutional networks, I wonder if it is possible to incorporate convolutional networks in the study and see relevant results.

### Confidence
3: You are fairly confident in your assessment. It is possible that you did not understand some parts of the submission or that you are unfamiliar with some pieces of related work. Math/other details were not carefully checked.

### Summary
The paper introduces a novel setting in Federated Learning (FL), termed Modality-Collaborated Federated Learning (MCFL), which focuses on collaboration among uni-modal clients with different data modalities. A new framework termed Federated Modality Collaboration (FedCola), which leverages a modality-agnostic transformer, is proposed to address the challenges in MCFL. Several strategies were probed to optimize the parameter-sharing, aggregation, and temporal modality arrangement in the FedCola. Empirical studies were conducted with two modalities, vision and language, and FedCola showed promising performance for both.

### Strengths
- The research investigates an under-explored area in FL, moving from uni-modal to multi-modal data, which more realistically reflects the nature of real-world data.
- The paper presents a very thorough investigation leveraging several strategies to optimize the MCFL framework, including parameter-sharing, aggregation, and temporal modality arrangement.
- The proposed framework, FedCola, is practical and adaptable to more intricate FL scenarios, not limited to the two-modal setting that was experimented.
- The authors provided comprehensive experiments and comparisons, demonstrating the superiority of FedCola over other methods in terms of both performance and resource requirements.

### Weaknesses
- The experiments are primarily conducted on two-modal settings, and the adaptability of FedCola to more complex scenarios with more modalities was not thoroughly studied. Could the proposed framework be extended to scenarios with more modalities?
- The effectiveness of temporal modality arrangement was linked to the correlation between different modalities. Will the performance be influenced by the semantics of different modalities?
- Limited discussion on privacy issues: The consideration of privacy issues in federated learning is critical; however, the paper did not sufficiently address this issue in the MCFL.

### Questions
- The motivation of the modality compensation is based on an equation based on the number of training samples. However, in the figure provided, the misalignment is based on the number of sampled clients. Can the authors further explain the subtle differences here?
- Is the server model the same as the client models? Can the authors explain more about the relationship between the client and server models?

### Summary
This paper focuses on the research problem of uni-modal clients with different modalities in federated learning. It explores several strategies, including cross-modal parameter sharing, model aggregation, and temporal modality arrangement. The authors provide empirical results to discuss their statement and compare the performance with the selected baseline CreamFL.

### Strengths
1. The writing of this paper is easy to follow, and the logic is clear.
2. The main perspectives in Sec. 5 are sound in the multi-modal federated learning.
3. The authors provide extensive experiments.

### Weaknesses
1. I have concerns about the motivation of this work. In this paper, each client has one single modality, which is not practical in the real-world setting. Though the authors use the hospital as an example, it is more practical that different clients may have different ratios of different modalities of data.
2. Also, if I understand correctly, as stated in Sec. 5.2, the authors expect a better-aligned global model. However, assuming each client has one single modality, it should fall into the personalized federated learning domain, where we care more about the clients’ local performance.
3. Section 5 is one of the key parts of their proposed work. However, some of the parts are put in the appendix.
4. About the model compensation, I am concerned about the extra communication cost and practicality that we require all the clients’ models to have all the parameters.
5. I am concerned if the core of the technique is still based on the power of transformers which are able to handle different modalities of data.

### Summary
The paper addresses the limitations of current federated learning (FL) frameworks by introducing a novel setting called Modality-Collaborated Federated Learning (MCFL) that focuses on collaboration among uni-modal clients with different data modalities. MCFL aims to leverage the shared knowledge among uni-modal clients while ensuring performance gains across individual modalities, making it a practical and appealing approach for scenarios with diverse uni-modal data. The proposed framework, FedCola, addresses the challenges of model heterogeneity and modality gaps through strategies such as modality-agnostic transformers, attention sharing, and modality compensation.

### Strengths
- The paper addresses a significant issue in federated learning and proposes a novel solution.
- Showcases an optimal combination of parameters and strategies to enhance performance.
- The well-designed evaluation is provided across multiple scenarios to affirm the efficacy of the proposed solution.

### Weaknesses
Major:

- The proposed framework is based on FedAVG, can other model aggregation methods be applied to further improve the performance?
- Although the proposed framework requires fewer resources than other methods when transformers are applied, what about the resources compared with CNNs?
- During the warm-up stage, are participating clients sampled from only one modality? If so, the comparison might be unfair since more clients on the warm-up modality are participating.

Minor:

- Can this framework handle clients with multi-modal data? For the pointed-out healthcare scenario, one client with multi-modal data is also common.
- Security and privacy are not discussed. Considering the application scenarios (i.e., hospitals), security and privacy are highlighted.
