## Abstract
Transductive node prediction has been a popular learning setting in Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). It has been widely observed that the shortage of information flow between the distant nodes and intra-batch nodes (for large-scale graphs) often hurt the generalization of GNNs which overwhelmingly adopt message-passing. Yet there is still no formal and direct theoretical results to quantitatively capture the underlying mechanism, despite the recent advance in both theoretical and empirical studies for GNN's generalization ability. In this paper, the $L$-hop interplay (i.e., message passing capability with training nodes) for a  $L$-layer GNN is successfully incorporated in our derived PAC-Bayesian bound for GNNs in the semi-supervised transductive setting. In other words, we quantitatively show how the interplay between training and testing sets influence the generalization ability which also partly explains the effectiveness of some existing empirical methods for enhancing generalization. Based on this result, we further design a plug-and-play ***Graph** **G**lobal **W**orkspace* module for GNNs (InterpGNN-GW) to enhance the interplay, utilizing the key-value attention mechanism to summarize crucial nodes' embeddings into memory and broadcast the memory to all nodes, in contrast to the pairwise attention scheme in previous graph transformers. Extensive experiments on both small-scale and large-scale graph datasets validate the effectiveness of our theory and approaches.

### Summary
This paper aims to propose a theory to derive a PAC-Bayesian bound for message-passing GNN in the transductive node classification and interpret the structure imbalance phenomenon. Based on the theory, authors propose the InterpGNN-GW to enhance the interplay between distant and intra-batch nodes via an attention-based global workspace mechanism.

### Strengths
1. The derived bound in this paper shows that more information interaction between test and training nodes can lead to smaller generalization errors and interpret the structural imbalance phenomenon.
2. To address the problem, the authors proposed a new method called InterpGNN-GW which leverages the attention mechanism to global workspace.
3. Sufficient experiments on different graph datasets have been conducted. The proposed InterpGNN-GW outperforms many baseline methods both on small-scale graphs and large-scale graphs.
4. The paper presentation is good and the organization is clear and easy to follow.

### Weaknesses
1. In the ‘Theorem 1 interpret the structure imbalance phenomenon.’ part, authors claim that stronger interplay with training nodes brings small generalization error, and nodes with smaller degrees engage in fewer interactions with training nodes thus having the trend in Fig2. However, it seems like a mistake according to the authors' theory. Nodes with smaller degrees engage in fewer interactions with training nodes should have bigger generalization error, while in fig2 nodes with fewer degrees have better performance.
2. The Experiment part mainly concentrates on node classification performance and ablation study. It would be better to design experiments to show how InterpGNN-GW increases the interplay between training and test nodes, which also strengthens the claims in theory and interprets the structure imbalance phenomenon.
3. Lack the motivation to concatenate positional encoding. Authors may add motivation such as position embedding containing the interplay with training and test nodes.
4. It would be more convincing if authors could provide full ablation study results on all datasets instead of separating ablated models to Tab 5 and Fig 6 and using different datasets.
5. Can InterpGNN-GW be used in a non-rigorous inductive setting? If yes, what about performance? For example, train InterpGNN-GW on the training nodes and broadcast the workspace to test nodes with test nodes still unseen to the training process. It should be similar to interplaying among out-of-batch nodes mentioned in the intuition part.
6. Why does InterpGNN-GW fail to outperform some baselines on CoraFull, any in-depth or intuitive analysis?

### Summary
This paper focuses on understanding and improving the generalization ability of Transductive Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) by enhancing the interplay between training and test nodes. The authors address the problem of information flow shortage between distant nodes and intra-batch nodes in GNNs, which hampers their generalization ability. They propose incorporating the L-hop interplay for an L-layer GNN in a PAC-Bayesian bound to quantitatively analyze the influence of the interaction between training and testing sets on generalization ability. Additionally, they introduce a plug-and-play module called InterpGNN-GW, which enhances the interplay between distant and intra-batch nodes using a Graph Global Workspace and key-value attention mechanism. The authors validate their theory and approaches through experiments on small-scale and large-scale graph datasets.

### Strengths
Solid theoretical analysis and interesting idea.

### Weaknesses
See below

### Questions
1. "results concerning graph structure is missing". Homophily/Heterophily is one of the most important properties of the graph structure, but is missed in this paper[1-4].
See [4] for a study with PAC-Bayesian generalization bound.
2. "more information interaction between test and training nodes can lead to smaller generalization error" I doubt the correctness of this claim on heterophilic graphs, see [3].
3. Compared to the graph transformers based on inner-batch pair-wise attention, the global workspace can provide global consistency." The idea of building global consistency is interesting.
4. "Implicit connection" [5] estabilsh graph rewiring method to rebuild some implicit connection between nodes.
5. "the labels of training set $S_Y$ , the features of both training and test nodes $X = [S_X,U_X]$". The notations are wierd. I suggest "$S_Y$" --> "$Y_S$", "$X = [S_X,U_X]$" --> "$X = [X_S,X_U]$".
6. "premise that embedding exchange among connected nodes leads to closer output logits" This premise is invalid for heterophilic graphs. See examples in [1-3].
7. "Theorem 1 interpret the structure imbalance phenomenon." How does theorem 1 interpret the structure imbalance phenomenon? You need to elaborate it in the main paper. You only test on homophilic datasets (Cora, CiteSeer, PubMed). To make claims about grouping effect, you need also test on heterophilic datasets.
8. Ablation study on memory and the gate control of memory doesn't show the effectiveness of memory and the gate control. The proposed models doesn't show statistically better performance than SOTA. Again, the model needs to be tested on heterophilic graphs.

Although missing lots of related works and analysis on heterophilic graphs, I still find this paper interesting. I will consider raising my score if the authors address my concerns well.

### Summary
In this paper, the authors derive transductive PAC-Bayesian bounds for GNNs, by which they reveal that the interplay between training and testing nodes effects the generalization ability of GNNs. With this observation in mind, they design a plug-and-play module to enhance this interplay. This module maintains a memory bank of node embedding and adopts key-value attention mechanism to update the embedding and the model weights. Their framework is validated on both small- and large-scale graph datasets.

### Strengths
- The theoretical results are interesting and provide new insights to the generalization of GNNs.
- The proposed module is reasonable, and the experimental results are sufficient to demonstrate its effectiveness.

### Weaknesses
- There is a discrepancy between theory and practice. The ''transductive'' or ''semi-supervised'' setting the authors adopt is the same as that in [1], where the randomness come from the labels of nodes. However, in real-world applications, including the experiments of this paper, both nodes features and their labels are fixed, and the randomness come from the random partition of training and test nodes [2,3,4]. Therefore, I think that the authors should use the results in literatures [5,6], e.g., Corollary 7 in [6] to derive similar results as Lemma 1. This can be done by incorporating the techniques in works [7,8]. Otherwise, the authors should conduct some synthetic experiments that treating labels as random variables to verify their theoretical results.
- The authors claim that the proposed module is plug-and-play, which means that it can be applied on any GNNs. However, they only equip GCN with this module. Performing more experiments that applying this module to other type of GNNs is encouraged.

### Questions
- The experiments show that the proposed module could also reduce structural unfairness. Can you provide a further explanation for this phenomenon? If the reason is the interplay between training and testing nodes induced by attention mechanism, I guess that graph transformer models can also reduce structural unfairness.
- Graph Transformer models (e.g., GraphGPS) could also enhance the interplay between training and testing nodes more or less. Why these methods perform inferior to the proposed method?

### Summary
In this paper, the authors derive a PAC-Bayesian bound specifically tailored for message-passing Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) within the context of transductive node classification. They present a novel approach called Graph Global Workspace (InterpGNN-GW), designed to enhance the interaction between nodes both within and across batches. In this method, nodes equipped with positional encoding engage in a competitive process, allowing them to write to and read from a shared global workspace using key-value attention mechanisms. The results of their experiments, conducted on both small- and large-scale graph datasets, reveal the remarkable effectiveness of InterpGNN-GW in node classification tasks when compared to other scalable GNNs and graph transformers. This signifies a noteworthy advancement in the field of graph-based machine learning.

### Strengths
1.	They have introduced a PAC-Bayes bound for message-passing Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) in the context of semi-supervised transductive learning. This bound sheds light on the quantifiable relationship between test and training nodes and its impact on the generalization capacity of GNNs in node classification tasks, making it a noteworthy contribution.

2.	Their approach demonstrates superior performance over advanced baseline methods in node classification tasks across a range of dataset scales, thereby highlighting its efficacy and scalability. Moreover, the article exhibits a well-structured and in-depth exploration of the background and related research concerning the generalization bounds of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). Remarkably, the authors skillfully integrate the utilization of the graph global workspace with the PAC-Bayes bound they have developed in practical applications, offering a significant advantage in terms of global consistency compared to conventional graph transformers.

3.    The comparative experiments are well thought out, taking into account factors such as GNN variants with the inclusion of dummy nodes and historical embeddings.

### Weaknesses
1.	The idea of the Global Workspace is intriguing, but it has already been extensively explored in previous research mentioned by authors, diminishing the novelty of this work.
2.	Some concepts lack a comprehensive explanation, such as W_{r,k} in Eq. (10). Further refinement is needed for these elements, including a clearer explanation of the dimensions of linear layers, which would enhance the clarity of the paper.
3. Table 5 does not provide standard deviations.
4. Results provided in table 3 and 4 are limited.

### Questions
1.	In Figure 2, the criteria for grouping based on node degree are somewhat confusing. For example, what do the numerical values on the x-axis in the figure represent? I assume these values are simply categories for grouping, rather than actual node degrees. I believe the authors could provide a clearer explanation of the grouping criteria.

### Summary
This paper proposes a PAC-Bayesian generalization error bound for GNNs and shows the influence of the interplay between training and testing sets on the generalization ability. Based on the theoretical analysis, the authors design a plug-and-play Graph Global Workspace module to enhance the generalization capability.

### Strengths
1. The PAC-Bayesian generalization error bound for GNNs is interesting and it shows how the interplay between training and testing sets influences the generalization ability.

2. The proposed method outperforms most baseline methods across multiple graph datasets.

3. The presentation of this paper is good and the paper is easy to follow.

### Weaknesses
1. Although the authors derive PAC-Bayesian bound for GNNs in the transductive setting and show how the interplay between training and testing sets influences the generalization ability, I fail to see the strong connection between the theoretical analysis and the proposed method. The proposed method seems to simply adopt the idea of the self-attention mechanism from the transformer and apply it to the graph. It's not clear to me how the proposed method enhances the generalization for the distant nodes.

2. My major concern about the proposed method is the graph partition as partitioning the graph usually leads to information loss. Though node2vec is used for positional encoding purposes, it only encodes the local topological structure, and it cannot compensate for the lost information between different subgraphs. Based on algorithm 1 in Appendix E, there is no information exchange between different subgraphs. The nodes in a subgraph can only receive the information from other nodes within this subgraph and these nodes are isolated from the nodes from other subgraphs. The performance seems to highly depend on the quality of the graph partition algorithms. However, it's unclear whether different graph partitions will influence the performance of the proposed method or not.

3. Some experimental setups are not quite clear. See questions below.

### Questions
1. In equation 7, why do you need max operation since $L-r+1>0$ always holds?

2. In Figures 1 and 2, the group 2 usually have the higher accuracy and smaller generalization error. Do you have any explanation for this observation?

3. In the experiment on comparison with GNN variants using Dummy nodes, what is the method (denoted as Dummy nodes in Figure 7) used for comparison? This experiment is confusing.
