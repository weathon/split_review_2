# STanHop: Sparse Tandem Hopfield Model for Memory-Enhanced Time Series Prediction

- Decision: Accept
- Scores: 8, 5, 8, 5

## Abstract
We present \textbf{STanHop-Net} (\textbf{S}parse \textbf{Tan}dem \textbf{Hop}field \textbf{Net}work) for multivariate time series prediction with memory-enhanced capabilities.
At the heart of our approach is \textbf{STanHop}, a novel Hopfield-based neural network block, which sparsely learns and stores both temporal and cross-series representations in a data-dependent fashion.
In essence, STanHop sequentially learn temporal representation and cross-series representation using two tandem sparse Hopfield layers.
In addition, StanHop incorporates two additional external memory modules: a Plug-and-Play module and a Tune-and-Play module for train-less and task-aware  memory-enhancements, respectively.   
They allow StanHop-Net to swiftly respond to certain sudden events.  
Methodologically, we construct the StanHop-Net by stacking STanHop blocks in a hierarchical fashion, enabling multi-resolution feature extraction with resolution-specific sparsity. 
Theoretically, we introduce a sparse extension of the modern Hopfield model (Generalized Sparse Modern Hopfield Model) and show that it endows a tighter memory retrieval error compared to the dense counterpart without sacrificing memory capacity.
Empirically, we validate the efficacy of our framework on both synthetic and real-world settings.

4: You are confident in your assessment, but not absolutely certain. It is unlikely, but not impossible, that you did not understand some parts of the submission or that you are unfamiliar with some pieces of related work.

### Summary
This paper extends the recent Sparse Modern Hopfield Network construction of Hu et al (2023) to use the alpha-entmax family of sparse probability mappings (alpha=1 giving Ramsauer et al softmax MHNs, alpha=2 giving the Hu et al (2023) sparsemax HSN), and prove some nice theoretical advantages of this construction.

Further, the paper constructs some neural network layers based on the proposed Generalized Sparse MHN for time series prediction and demonstrates its empirical performance in some benchmarks, with competitive performance.

### Strengths
- The GSH construction is a nice and intuitive extension of Sparse Modern Hopfield Networks
- Quite nice theoretical results about the GSH construction  and the impact of alpha.
- Good empirical performance.

### Weaknesses
- Some theoretical inaccuracies (perhaps typos?) casting a bit of doubt.
- Missing a few comparisons and reports that I would be very interested in (details below).

### Questions
Some experiments and results that I would have liked to see and found valuable:
 - You treat $\alpha$ as a learnable parameter: how is it parametrized and what do the learned values converge to?
 - The case $\alpha \to \infty$ corresponds to using an argmax instead of softmax, i.e., retrieving the most compatible pattern in one step. How would such a "argmax"-based lookup memory perform like in the experiments? (Some of the gradients will be zero, but the same happens some of the times with high alpha too, even if not always.)

Some theoretical issues in definitions:

- in the definition of the Tsallis entropy (3.1), the bottom branch for alpha=1 seems wrong, as it gives the negative of what would be the top branch for alpha=2. I expected by continuity to define alpha=1 as the Shannon entropy -sum p log p. Am I missing something?

- In equation (3.2), the definition of $\Psi_{\alpha}^\star$ seems surprising: $\alpha$-entmax is a vector-value function, thus so should be its integral, but the energy H(x) should be scalar-value. I expect (as stated also elsewhere in the paper) that $\Psi_\alpha^\star$ should be the Fenchel convex conjugate of $\Psi_\alpha$, i.e. $\Psi_\alpha^\star(z) = \sup_{z^\star \in \operatorname{dom}{\Psi_\alpha}} \langle z^\star, z \rangle - \Psi_\alpha(z^\star)$. Could you please clarify?

Other questions:

 - It was not clear to me how the memories Y are constructed; in section 4.3 it seems like the memories must be the same length as the input sequence R. Is this a strong requirement or could it be avoided? A nice property of attention models is that they should support variable length data.
- The qualitative change at alpha=2 in Theorem 3.1 seems surprising and interesting. Could you discuss the difference a bit, especially the difference between the Max terms that show up, and give some intuition about why we see this change? Is one of the bounds always tighter than the other or does this depend on choices of (m, M, d, beta, etc?) I did not have the time to read the proof.

### Confidence
2: You are willing to defend your assessment, but it is quite likely that you did not understand the central parts of the submission or that you are unfamiliar with some pieces of related work. Math/other details were not carefully checked.

### Summary
The work introduces a novel neural network model called STanHop-Net, which is based on the Hopfield model and offers memory-enhanced capabilities for multivariate time series prediction. The model incorporates sparsity and external memory modules, which enable it to respond quickly to sudden events and achieve good results in both synthetic and real-world settings.

### Strengths
1. The paper is is well-written and comprehensive.
2. The authors present case studies demonstrating the effectiveness of the model in practical applications.

### Weaknesses
1. The paper does not provide available code source to reproduce the experiments.
2. The paper's contributions are limited in scope.
3. The model is too complex, it's may difficult to optimize.

### Questions
1. How does the sparsity of STanHop-Net affect its performance and memory usage?
2. Can the author provide the time complexity and number of the parameters of the model?
3. Can the author provide the limitation section?

### Summary
In this work, authors augmented hopefield network with external memory. They introduce the Sparse Tandem Hopfield Network which was tested on  multivariate time series prediction task and the proposed model exhibits improved memory capabilities. To be specific the memory module has Plug-and-Play module and a Tune-and-Play module for train-less and task-aware memory improvements. The model is theoretically motivated and series of simulation studies show proposed model achieves consistent gain compared to other transformer-based models.

### Strengths
1. Well-written paper
2. Proofs are incremental, mainly based on Hu's et al work in 2023, however, the presentation is neat.
3. good set of experiments
4. Hypothesis is backed by ablation study

### Weaknesses
1. Comparison against stateful models such as RNNs is missing, also, the proposed work focuses on external memory, a comparison against memory-augmented is needed.
2. Explanations for Lemma 3.1, 3.2, and other lemmas in the main paper, can be written in a better way. Rather than stating to refer to proof, you should try and provide the simplest explanation of what each proof talks about.

### Questions
Adding memory to NNs is not a new concept, it has been out since early 90’s [1], and are even extended to modern NNs [2-4]. Similar to Hopfield networks these networks are shown to reach stable point [5-6]. Thus it is important to mention these relevant work.

Second, improving the memory capability of Hopefield network is widely studied these days [7-9], thus comparison should be done with these relevant approaches, especially 8 and 9.

I would like to see a comparison against RNNs and memory-augmented RNNs, given that the proposed model is focused on time-series which is a stateful problem.

Finally, what is the memory footprint? How much time model takes per epoch? Model size?
Do you observe faster convergence? How stable is the model? All these questions should be addressed.

I would like to see the variance of the model, including baseline models.

### Summary
The paper presents a new transformer-like architecture (STANHOP) that uses a new form of sparse Hopfield layers. The layers use a form of Tsallis α-entropy regularization so as to induce sparse encoding. The authors provide several theoretical results on the capacity and convergence speed of new Hopfield model. Besides the use of this layer, the STANHOP architecture adopts several new solutions, such as the use of Plug-and-Play and Tune-and-Play memory plugin modules.

The experiments are solely focused on timeseries prediction tasks and compare several versions of the STANHOP architecture with several existing Transformers baselines.

### Strengths
- The introduction and analysis of alpha-entropy regularized Hopfield models and of the associated Transformer layers is interesting and potentially very useful.
- The design of the proposed architecture has several interesting components.
- The paper is well written.
- The experiments compare the results with a large number of relevant baseline models.

### Weaknesses
The main issue with this work is that it tries to introduce too many innovations packed together in a single specialized architecture. This results in a paper that lacks a cohesive narrative, as it is unclear why these different novel parts should fit together. As a consequence, it is difficult for the reader to properly evaluate the merits of the different contributions. In my opinion, the main contribution is the introduction of the alpha-entropy regularized sparse Hopfield layers and their analysis. However, it is unclear to me why these layers should only be validated in multivariate timeseries prediction problems.  All in all, the specialized nature of the application does not match well with the general nature of the analysis in the first half of the paper. 

While the experimental analysis on timeseries data is rigorous, the results are rather disappointing since the main focus of the paper was to solve this specialized problem. The proposed architecture performs worse than at least one baseline model (DLinear) and in general it performs very similarly to the other methods.

### Questions
What are the advantages of using the alpha-entropy regularization instead of the Gini entropy used in the original sparse Hopfield network paper?
