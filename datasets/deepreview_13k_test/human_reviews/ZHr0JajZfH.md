# A Simple Unified Uncertainty-Guided Framework for Offline-to-Online Reinforcement Learning

- Decision: Reject
- Scores: 5, 5, 3, 3

## Abstract
Offline reinforcement learning (RL) provides a promising solution to learning an agent fully relying on a data-driven paradigm. However, constrained by the limited quality of the offline dataset, its performance is often sub-optimal. Therefore, it is desired to further finetune the agent via extra online interactions before deployment. Unfortunately, offline-to-online RL can be challenging due to two main challenges: \textit{constrained exploratory behavior} and \textit{state-action distribution shift}. To this end, we propose a \textbf{S}imple \textbf{U}nified u\textbf{N}certainty-\textbf{G}uided (SUNG) framework, which naturally unifies the solution to both challenges with the tool of uncertainty. Specifically, SUNG quantifies uncertainty via a VAE-based state-action visitation density estimator. To facilitate efficient exploration, SUNG presents a practical optimistic exploration strategy to select informative actions with both high value and high uncertainty. Moreover, SUNG develops an adaptive exploitation method by applying conservative offline RL objectives to high-uncertainty samples and standard online RL objectives to low-uncertainty samples to smoothly bridge offline and online stages. SUNG achieves state-of-the-art online finetuning performance when combined with different offline RL methods, across various environments and datasets in D4RL benchmark. \footnote{This work has been submitted to the IEEE for possible publication.

### Summary
The paper proposes a unified methodology for offline to online reinforcement learning based on an out of distribution sample identifying mechanism that employs a variational autoencoder for density estimation and ultimately to quantify uncertainty. The authors propose the SUNG (simple unified uncertainty guided) framework to work on top of most model-free offline RL algorithms & evaluate the approach with CQL & TD3+BC as base algorithms. Since a key limitation when moving from offline to online learning is the conservatism that hinders collection of new data, the algorithm employs the concept of optimism in the face of uncertainty so that the policy should in the online phase choose actions that have both high value and high uncertainty. Since the distribution shift induced by this exploration scheme makes value estimation harder and can hinder learning, an adaptive uncertainty guided exploitation scheme is introduced, which regularizes the policy based on the samples' OOD-ness.
The empirical evaluation compares SUNG with two base algorithms against multiple other baselines on D4RL tasks and finds SUNG to outperform prior works substantially.

### Strengths
Offline to Online learning is still a relatively new discipline and the authors appear to have found a simple yet effective method to outperform prior works. Selecting actions optimistically in the face of uncertainty seems like a good exploration strategy for O2O, since it's been proven to work in prior works on other exploration tasks. Especially the fact that the method is compatible with many offline RL algorithms that can be used under the hood as base algorithm appears to be a practical advantage.

### Weaknesses
I find the formulation of the SUNG framework a bit counterintuitive: The authors mention that they want to have high-uncertainty actions, yet at the same time they only sample "near-on-policy actions for exploration", which appears contradicting. Further, during the optimization / policy improvement part (green arrows in fig 1), the same percentage p of the batch is always labeled as OOD, which is not consistent, since the absolute uncertainty value at which a sample could be labeled OOD can vary (it could even be the case that the same sample is sometimes OOD and sometimes not, depending on the other samples in the batch).

Generally, I have a bit of an issue with the additional OOD detection in the adaptive exploitation - the regularizer in offline RL algorithms is mostly already doing OOD detection (often also based on some measure of uncertainty), so it should already automatically detect low and high uncertainty samples and thus assign low or high regularization accordingly. While this is normally not done in such a binary nature, I don't see how the adaptive exploitation scheme is not doing pretty much the same thing again. It seems to just amplify the regularization tendency that is already there. The emperical ablation in fig 2d shows it to be important, but to me it is unclear why that is the case - is the normal regularization simply not yet enough? or is the VAE based OOD detection in some qualitative way better than the base algorithms own regularization?

In the exploration scheme, where actions are ranked & selected based on value and then sampled based on uncertainty (or the other way around), you mention the possibility to adapt the trade-off preference between value and uncertainty - what do you mean by that? Would you adaptively change the trade-off during the training process or is it something you set in advance (and based on what information)? I'm also not sure whether you mention which way around you ended up doing filtering + sampling (first value or first uncertainty or maybe some combination) and why.

In the empirical evaluation I'm assuming you report final performances (i.e. after the 100k environment steps). Prior works that you mention (like Cal-QL, AWAC) have shown that during O2O, algorithms commonly suffer from immediate performance drops right after online learning starts due to distribution drift - it would be extremely interesting to see how SUNG performs in this context, which is why another performance metric reporting during the beginning of online learning could be useful or directly plotting the test returns over training time.

I believe some other prior works that are currently not contained should also be considered in the related work section:

[1] introduces MOOSE, which is a model-based offline RL method that uses a VAE as a regularizer. While your adaptive exploitation scheme is using it in a different way, I still believe it should be mentioned. The works [2-4] are also concerned with offline to online learning, just that their online phase is a little shorter and their adaptations thus look a little different than the one you consider. Still, when thinking about O2O they are closely related and should be considered.

More a sidenote: Fig. 2b is labeled "Optimistic Exploration without Uncertainty". As far as I understand, this method is greedily selecting best actions based on value - it is unclear to me how that is optimistic (i.e. optimisim in the face of what) so maybe the different ablations should be named more clearly.

I realize the weakness section is a bit lengthy, but I think your paper has merits and I am prepared to increase the score if you are able to address my concerns.

### Summary
This paper proposes a generic framework SUNG for sample-efficient offline-to-online RL, which introduces an optimistic exploration strategy via bi-level action selection to select informative actions for efficient exploration and develops an adaptive exploitation method with OOD sample identification to smoothly bridge offline RL and online RL objectives.

### Strengths
1. This paper is well-written and easy to follow. 

2. The problem studied in this paper is important and has attracted increasing attention.

3. The experiment is thorough, and the authors compared SUNG against a large pool of recent methods.

### Weaknesses
This paper incrementally adds many existing techniques, making evaluating its contribution difficult. For example, the utilization of VAE for uncertainty quantification cannot distinguish SUNG from MANY offline-to-online or offline RL methods [1,2]. The bi-level action selection is a relatively heuristic strategy; the authors did not provide any theoretical analysis/insight into why it is effective, especially for the claim "we establish the ranking criteria for the finalist action set as uncertainty for value regularization-based methods and as Q value for other offline RL methods". Why does SUNG use Q value for other offline RL methods?

Moreover, SUNG introduces many new hyperparameters to be tuned. However, hyperparameter tuning has proven to be a challenging task in offline or offline-to-online RL.

Overall, SUNG is not an elegant and "simple" method.

### Questions
The claim in section 4.3 " Note that offline RL methods do not suffer from state distribution shift during training, since policy evaluation only queries Q functions with states present in the offline dataset." seems to be incorrect in some model-based offline RL methods, e.g., MOPO, in which policy evaluation will query Q function with states generated by the model.

---post-rebuttal comment---
Thanks so much for providing the detailed responses. Unfortunately, I am not satisfied with them, especially those to Q2-4. I will reconsider the score if the authors can respond to my questions directly.

### Summary
The paper presents the Simple Unified Uncertainty-Guided (SUNG) framework as a solution to the challenges encountered in offline-to-online reinforcement learning (RL). To address issues related to exploratory behavior and state-action distribution shifts, the framework leverages a VAE-based state-action visitation density estimator to quantify uncertainty. It also employs an optimistic exploration strategy to select actions with both high value and uncertainty, facilitating efficient exploration. Furthermore, SUNG incorporates an adaptive exploitation method that applies conservative offline RL objectives to high-uncertainty samples and standard online RL objectives to low-uncertainty samples, enabling a smooth transition from offline to online stages.

### Strengths
Research into the domain of online finetuning holds significant importance within the field of offline learning.

The experimental evaluation suggests that there is potential for improvement in the finetuning performance when the proposed approach is combined with various offline RL methods across a range of environments and datasets from the D4RL benchmark. These findings indicate the adaptability and practicality of the suggested technique in different settings.

The paper demonstrates a high degree of clarity and well-structured writing, rendering it easily understandable for readers.

### Weaknesses
The primary concern raised with regard to this paper pertains to its novelty. The concept of leveraging uncertainty in the context of offline learning is a well-established one. From the perspective of reviewers, the key innovation in this article lies in the utilization of a VAE for quantifying uncertainty, which does not represent a notable departure from conventional methods.

While this paper introduces a straightforward empirical method, it is notable for its absence of a comprehensive theoretical analysis to substantiate the advantages of the proposed approach relative to existing methods. Offering a theoretical foundation and analysis would be valuable in bolstering the method's credibility and potential impact, providing a more solid basis for its effectiveness.

### Summary
This work investigates fine-tuning pretrained offline RL policies via further online interactions, aiming to address two challenges: constrained exploratory behavior and state-action distribution shift. Building on uncertainty quantification, this work introduces a 
fine-tuning framework that alternates between optimistic exploration and adaptive exploitation.

### Strengths
+ Overall, the paper is well written and easy to read. The challenges and motivation are clearly phrased.

+ The studied problem, offline-to-online RL, is an important problem,  especially when fine-tuning large-scale policy models.

+ The proposed methods introduce some new ideas (e.g., uncertainty-weighted online exploitation) capable of benefiting the development of this field.

### Weaknesses
One main weakness of this work mainly lies in (i) the explainability and usability of the proposed methods, and (ii) the gap between the motivation and evaluation (please see the details below).

- This work utilizes VAE to characterize the uncertainty of state-actions, whereas the paper does not provide the specific definition of uncertainty, and it’s not convincing why VAE is superior to other methods, e.g., Q-ensemble learning. 

- The reviewer is concerned with the highlighted OOD (distributional shift) issue. In Section 4.3, the paper claims that the OOD state-actions can harm the performance of online fine-tuning. Wouldn’t the collected online data, that contain reward signals, enhance the data support of the offline dataset? 

- There is a lack of clear explanation towards the unique challenges in the exploration-exploitation of the offline-to-online problem. For instance, a major issue could be the “forgetting” - during the model updates  the fine-tuned policy can quickly forget what it has learned from offline, which is neglected by this work.

- The motivation and evaluation are isolated. In the Introduction, the paper claims “the proposed method provides a generic solution for offline-to-online RL to enable finetuning agents pretrained with different offline RL objectives.” However, in the experiment, the tuning policy is pretrained from the same task.

### Questions
There are a set of hyper-parameters introduced in the proposed method without reasonable guidelines on how to determine these parameters, e.g., N, alpha, lambda, etc. It would hinder the usability of the algorithm, and it would help if the authors can provided theoretical guidance on how to select the hyper-parameters to optimally balance the exploration-exploitation tradeoff.

- As shown in Eq. (9), is the fine-tuning method dependent on the pretraining algorithm?
