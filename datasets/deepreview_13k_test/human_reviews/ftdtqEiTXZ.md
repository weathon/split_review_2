## Abstract
Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and Transformer have been increasingly adopted to learn the complex vector representations of spatio-temporal graphs, capturing intricate spatio-temporal dependencies crucial for applications such as traffic datasets. Although many existing methods utilize multi-head attention mechanisms and message-passing neural networks (MPNNs) to capture both spatial and temporal relations, these approaches encode temporal and spatial relations independently, and reflect the graph's topological characteristics in a limited manner. In this work, we introduce the Cycle to Mixer (Cy2Mixer), a novel spatio-temporal GNN based on topological non-trivial invariants of spatio-temporal graphs with gated multi-layer perceptrons (gMLP). The Cy2Mixer is composed of three blocks based on MLPs: A message-passing block for encapsulating spatial information: a cycle message-passing block for enriching topological information through cyclic subgraphs: And a temporal block for capturing temporal properties. We bolster the effectiveness of Cy2Mixer with mathematical evidence emphasizing that our cycle message-passing block is capable of offering differentiated information to the deep learning model compared to the message-passing block. Furthermore, empirical evaluations substantiate the efficacy of the Cy2Mixer, demonstrating state-of-the-art performances across various traffic benchmark datasets.

3: You are fairly confident in your assessment. It is possible that you did not understand some parts of the submission or that you are unfamiliar with some pieces of related work. Math/other details were not carefully checked.

### Summary
This paper focuses on the intricate dependencies in the spatio-temporal traffic graph. Starting from cyclic subgraphs of the traffic network, the paper proposes topological non-trivial invariants based on the homotopy invariance of fundamental groups and homology groups. Consequently, the cyclic subgraphs are transformed into cliques to enhance the relations between different nodes at different timestamps. The CY2MIXER encoder layer is devised to introduce cycle messages-passing blocks. The model is evaluated in various datasets and ablation studies are conducted to verify the effectiveness of each block.

### Strengths
1. Unlike other studies on spatio-temporal traffic graphs driven by findings in the transportation system, the theoretical analysis of topological non-trivial invariants is intriguing as it demonstrates how to model the correlations in this scenario.
2. The manuscript is easy to follow and well-organized.
3. The experimental results attain nearly all state-of-the-art or second-best performance across six datasets.

### Weaknesses
1. While the paper provides theoretical analysis, the conclusions drawn are not particularly insightful. It's fairly evident that "solely analyzing pre-existing edges cannot address temporal traffic data", a focus of many recent spatio-temporal traffic graph forecasting studies. Additionally, the concept of transforming cyclic subgraphs into cliques in a transportation system isn't clearly explained in real-world scenarios.  
   
2. The model's performance on the PEMS07 dataset is not so satisfactory. The stated reason is "there are no cyclic subgraphs for the PEMS07 dataset", which leads to concerns about the model's limitations; it appears to only handle traffic graphs with cycles. Therefore, it would be beneficial to conduct experiments on traffic graphs with varying proportions of cycles.  
   
3. Despite the results surpassing most baselines, the improvements are marginal. It is unclear whether the same hyperparameter search process was conducted with other baselines. Also, the reasons for only reporting STAEFormer's results on three datasets in Table 1 are not explained.

### Summary
This paper proposes a novel spatiotemporal graph neural network called Cycle to Mixer (Cy2Mixer) for traffic forecasting. The key contributions are: 1) Provides mathematical analysis using topological invariants to show that cyclic substructures in the traffic network graph can influence predictions. 2) Proposes the Cy2Mixer architecture composed of three main blocks: a temporal block, a spatial message passing block, and a cycle message passing block. 3) Achieves state-of-the-art results on multiple traffic forecasting benchmarks including PEMS04, PEMS07, PEMS08, NYTaxi, TDrive, and CHBike datasets.

### Strengths
1) The proposed Cy2Mixer architecture is simple yet effective at integrating spatial, temporal, and topological information through the three blocks.
2) Empirical results surpass prior state-of-the-art methods on multiple traffic forecasting benchmarks.
3) Ablation studies clearly demonstrate the value of the cycle message passing block.

### Weaknesses
The writing in this manuscript lacks clarity, and the notation is unclear. For example, on page 2, the meaning of symbols Z1 and Z2 is not well-defined, and k_m does not appear in any formulas. Furthermore, on page 3, the variable 'g' in the equation is not adequately explained. 

The theoretical part of this paper is challenging to follow, and it is unclear why the theoretical result (Theorem 3.1) indicates the importance of a cycle basis for the task. I would, therefore, suggest that the authors work on improving the presentation to make the logic behind certain statements more apparent.

Key ablation study is absent from the manuscript. It would be valuable for the author to investigate the effectiveness of the preprocessing step and possibly compare it to other edge-enhancing methods.

### Summary
This paper studies the problem of traffic forecasting and proposes a new design of spatio-temporal graph neural networks to improve performance. Specifically, an extra "clique adjacency matrix" is introduced in the framework to further explore the spatial connections between nodes across different time steps. Comprehensive empirical comparisons with other baseline methods are included in the paper to validate the performance improvement of the proposed method, and codes are provided as supplementary files.

### Strengths
1. The empirical comparisons presented in the paper with other $11$ baseline methods, under $3$ metrics, and over $6$ benchmark datasets are fairly comprehensive and extensive. The results show that the proposed method Cy2Mixer can outperform or on par with other sota methods designed for traffic forecasting tasks.

### Weaknesses
In summary, I think the problem itself is very interesting, but the quality of this paper is not ready for publication yet. The main weaknesses of this paper are listed as follows:

1. The contribution of this paper is not clear. For the theory part, Theorem 3.1 is a direct result/derivation from a corollary in [1]. Moreover, the connection between the theory and the proposed method is not explicitly shown in the paper. In other words, the theory does not bring any theoretical insights to the readers to understand the proposed method. For the methodology part, the clique adjacency matrix is proposed in [2], the embedding is proposed in [3], and the gated MLP is proposed in [4]. None of these major components within the proposed computing framework is new. Maybe stacking them together can lead to better empirical performance on some datasets, but it seems to be not enough for a publication, unless we have a deeper understanding of why this combination creates better results. I do not think the theory presented in the paper answers this question, at least not in its current form.

2. It is hard to interpret the real contribution of the extra clique adjacency matrix based on the ablation studies. We do not know if the performance improvement comes from extra parameters (since an extra new block is added), or the newly added/rewired edges in the clique adjacency matrix. Moreover, we do not know if the clique adjacency matrix is the best way to add/rewire the edges regarding the performance. For example, spectrum-based rewiring approaches [5, 6] have been widely adopted to resolve the oversquashing issue for graph classification tasks. So I believe more discussions are needed to claim the importance of the usage of clique adjacency matrix.

3. The writing of this paper can be improved. Some sentences do not read well, and some notations are not explained. For example, on page 2, $Z=\sigma(HU)$, what is $H$ here? Since the input is $X$, should it be $Z=\sigma(XU)$? Again on page 2, $s(Z) = Z_1 \odot Proj(Z_2)$, what is exactly the linear projection? Maybe it is better to just keep the original notation which makes more sense, $f_{W,b}(Z)=WZ+b, s(Z)=Z_1 \odot f_{W,b}(Z_2)$. On page 8, what does "tiny attention" refer to? Maybe a reference or a short explanation will help the reader better understand the case study part.

### Questions
Besides the ones listed in the Weaknesses section, I have the following questions:

1. It is mentioned on page 3 that "$A$ and $A_C$ are time-independent input variables since the structure remains unchanged over time". However, in practice, we usually have a (spatial) graph/network that changes dynamically. In the case of long-term traffic forecasting, the changes in the network can be a) some sensors are down due to technical issues; b) rearrangement of the sensors. How would the proposed method change when the graphs can change over time?

2. In intro the authors claim that "the proposed model not only exhibits minimal computational cost but also proves to be highly efficient", but the comparison between the computational costs is not presented in the paper. I think it would be better to add those to the paper as well.

### Summary
This work introduces a novel spatio-temporal GNN based model, Cy2Mixer, to extract topological non-trivial invariants of spatio-temporal graphs with gated multi-layer perceptrons (gMLP). The Cy2Mixer is composed of three blocks, i.e., a message-passing block for encapsulating spatial information, cycle message-passing block for enriching topological information through cyclic subgraphs, and a temporal block for capturing temporal properties. Extensive experiments validate the good performances of proposed Cy2Mixer.

### Strengths
S1. This paper is well-organized with good mathematical definitions, backgrounds, and an intuitive overview of proposed framework.

S2. The experiments on six datasets are extensive and convincing, along with sufficient ablation studies and case studies. Most experimental results demonstrate the improvement of proposed Cy2Mixer.

S3. The idea of temporal clique is a bit new to the community of spatiotemporal learning.

### Weaknesses
W1. Although this paper clarifies that they propose to identify the topological non-trivial invariants in graphs, they have not specified how to find out the invariant graph with temporal dimension.

W2. As this work introduces the temporal cyclic structures, the authors still do not demonstrate how to identify the temporal cycled clique in the spatiotemporal graph.

W3. The title does not match well with this study. Actually, spatiotemporal learning consists of plenty of tasks, which is not limited to traffic forecasting. To name a few, dynamic graph learning for both electricity and air quality forecasting in [1],[2],[3].

W4. The technical contribution is limited. The proposed solution comprises of temporal block, spatial message-passing and a cycle message-passing where the cycled clique is realized with a Clique adjacency matrix 𝑨c (a newly defined adjacent matrix). To this end, first, the three blocks are trivial as usual work, while second, the new solution is inherently a new design of 3D-adjacent matrix. For techniques, the construction process of Ac, how to identify the temporal clique (a temporal cyclic subgraph of the topological space) are lacking, and how the new adjacency contributes to final results is still unclear. More details should be clarified and added.
