# Large Language Models Are Not Robust Multiple Choice Selectors

- Decision: Accept
- Scores: 8, 8, 8, 5

## Abstract
Multiple choice questions (MCQs) serve as a common yet important task format in the evaluation of large language models (LLMs).
This work shows that modern LLMs are vulnerable to option position changes in MCQs due to their inherent ``selection bias'', namely, they prefer to select specific option IDs as answers (like ``Option A'').
Through extensive empirical analyses with 20 LLMs on three benchmarks, we pinpoint that this behavioral bias primarily stems from LLMs' token bias, where the model a priori assigns more probabilistic mass to specific option ID tokens (e.g., \texttt{A/B/C/D}) when predicting answers from the option IDs.
To mitigate selection bias, we propose a label-free, inference-time debiasing method, called \pride{}, which separates the model's prior bias for option IDs from the overall prediction distribution.
\pride{} first estimates the prior by permutating option contents on a small number of test samples, and then applies the estimated prior to debias the remaining samples.
We demonstrate that it achieves interpretable and transferable debiasing with high computational efficiency.
We hope this work can draw broader research attention to the bias and robustness of modern LLMs.

### Rating
8

### Rating Number
8

### Confidence
4: You are confident in your assessment, but not absolutely certain. It is unlikely, but not impossible, that you did not understand some parts of the submission or that you are unfamiliar with some pieces of related work.

### Summary
This paper investigated the LLMs' sensitivity to position changes in multiple-choice questions, discovered that token bias is the main cause/ Furthermore, the authors proposed a way to efficiently suppress this bias and improve accuracy.

### Strengths
1. It flows! The writing is perfect. All sections follow each other naturally, from problem to observation, to diagnosis, to ruling out simplistic solutions, to proposed solutions. In each step, there are corresponding experiments to substantiate it.
2. There are some clever experiment designs in diagnosing the cause, and the experiments are carried out with caution (e.g. replacing symbols to confirm).
3. Comprehensive experiments on many models and datasets.

### Weaknesses
1. When the compute budget is unbounded, the proposed method sometimes has a slight accuracy disadvantage compared to full perm.

### Questions
1. In deriving the method, there are a few key assumptions, e.g. Prior for option IDs depends mostly on q. Is it possible to empirically verify this assumption?

### Confidence
2: You are willing to defend your assessment, but it is quite likely that you did not understand the central parts of the submission or that you are unfamiliar with some pieces of related work. Math/other details were not carefully checked.

### Summary
This paper experimentally discovers an issue that LLMs are vulnerable to option position changes, or the Option-Order Sensitivity problem, in MCQs due to their inherent “selection bias.” It proposes a label-free, inference-time debiasing method(PriDe) to mitigate the selection bias. The experimental results demonstrate the claim and the usefulness of the PriDe.

### Strengths
I really appreciate the paper conducted extensive experiments to demonstrate and analyze the Option-Order Sensitivity problem. Some observations are really interesting; for example, even the same models with different parameter sizes but trained using the same data exhibit different position preferences. 

The PriDe is intuitive but also effective.

### Weaknesses
It would be better to cite "Leveraging large language models for multiple choice question answering" or other related papers when mentioning the Option-Order Sensitivity problem since they have found the problem earlier than the work of this paper.

It would be better to analyze more technicals, including self-consistency.

### Questions
Please refer to the weakness.

### Confidence
3: You are fairly confident in your assessment. It is possible that you did not understand some parts of the submission or that you are unfamiliar with some pieces of related work. Math/other details were not carefully checked.

### Summary
This work presents a comprehensive analysis of the selection bias issue in large language models (LLMs) when dealing with multiple choice questions (MCQs).
The experimental results identify the root cause of this bias as the LLMs' token bias, which leads to a preference for specific option IDs when predicting answers.
Based on these observations, this work proposes a label-free, inference-time debiasing method called PriDe, which effectively mitigates selection bias.

### Strengths
1. The empirical analysis is thorough, involving 20 LLMs and three benchmark datasets. This extensive evaluation provides strong evidence for the existence of selection bias in LLMs and its impact on their performance in MCQ tasks. The identification of token bias as the primary source of this issue is a valuable insight that can inform future research on LLMs and their limitations.

2. The proposed PriDe method is effective when the computing cost is limited. Further analysis on generalizability reveals that the prior estimated by PriDe can be generalized across tasks.

### Weaknesses
1. It seems that PriDe achieves comparable performance with simple baselines when the computation cost is not limitated. In application scenarios, we always first estimate the prior without concerning the computation cost, then apply this prior to serve applications.
It would be better if PriDe could have a higher upper boudn performance.

### Questions
1. The generalization analysis indicates that the bias for a certain model is consistent across different tasks.
Could you further demonstrate this with more statics or results?
It would also help to enhace the claimed interpretability.

### Summary
The paper studies the issue of sensitivity to answer option order in large language models (LLMs), which can lead to biased predictions. It introduces a new method called PriDe to mitigate this sensitivity by estimating and correcting for the model's bias during inference. The results show that PriDe can reduce the prediction sensitivity.

### Strengths
- This paper studies the LLMs' sensitivity to order of answer options, which is an important problem in current LLM evaluation, and provides empirical analysis of the underlying reasons.
- The proposed method PriDe operates on test time without introducing extra computational cost, which is suitable for current LLMs. 
- The authors conduct extensive experiments including different models, tasks, ablation studies, cross-task evaluation, etc.

### Weaknesses
- The proposed method requires sampling test samples first to estimate the prior, which may introduce another dimension of sensitivity of the selection of the test samples. The accuracy of this estimation might vary based on the quality and representativeness of these samples.
- I understand the procedure of cyclic permutation and full permutation, but how are they used as the debiasing methods? Do the authors take the best result of the permutations as the prediction?
- The authors use the balance of recalls and Rstd as the major metrics throughout the paper. Can the authors formally define this? I didn't immediately get it.
- The writing and presentation need more improvement, e.g., I think the proposed PriDe is quite intuitive but the authors introduce too many unnecessary notations ($d_i, o_i, g_i, x_i, .... $) before getting into the real introduction of the method, which makes the reading difficult.

### Questions
- The proposed method basically follows estimate-then-mitigate, which is somewhat similar to the calibrate-before-use (Zhao et al. ICML 2021) paper, though this one targets a different setting and is not directly applicable to MCQs. But it would be interesting to compare the differences and know if calibrate-before-use can also help with MCQ sensitivity.
