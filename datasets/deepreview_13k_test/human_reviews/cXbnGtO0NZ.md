## Abstract
Generating 3D graphs of symmetry-group equivariance is of intriguing potential in broad applications from machine vision to molecular discovery. Emerging approaches adopt diffusion generative models (DGMs) with proper re-engineering to capture 3D graph distributions. In this paper, we raise an orthogonal and fundamental question of in what (latent) space we should diffuse 3D graphs. ❶ We motivate the study with theoretical analysis showing that the performance bound of 3D graph diffusion can be improved in a latent space versus the original space, provided that the latent space is of (i) low dimensionality yet (ii) high quality (i.e., low reconstruction error) and DGMs have (iii) symmetry preservation as an inductive bias. ❷ Guided by the theoretical guidelines, we propose to perform 3D graph diffusion in a low-dimensional latent space, which is learned through cascaded 2D–3D graph autoencoders for low-error reconstruction and symmetry-group invariance. The overall pipeline is dubbed latent 3D graph diffusion. ❸ Motivated by applications in molecular discovery, we further extend latent 3D graph diffusion to conditional generation given SE(3)-invariant attributes or equivariant 3D objects. ❹ We also demonstrate empirically that out-of-distribution conditional generation can be further improved by regularizing the latent space via graph self-supervised learning. We validate through comprehensive experiments that our method generates 3D molecules of higher validity / drug-likeliness and comparable or better conformations / energetics, while being an order of magnitude faster in training.

### Summary
This paper investigates the appropriate latent space for generating 3D graphs. The authors derive several conclusions through theoretical analysis:

- The lower the dimensionality of the latent space, the higher the performance limit of diffusion.

- Higher quality of the latent space (i.e., lower reconstruction error) corresponds to a higher performance limit of diffusion.

- Preserving symmetry (maintaining graph properties after translation, rotation, etc.) is an inductive bias of the latent space, contributing to an increased performance limit of diffusion.

Guided by these theoretical insights, the authors propose a method named "latent 3D graph diffusion." This approach utilizes cascaded 2D-3D graph autoencoders to learn a latent space with low-error reconstruction (learning topological graphs) and symmetry invariance (learning geometric graphs). Furthermore, the authors extend this method to conditional generation given SE(3) invariant properties (rotation-translation invariance) or equivariant 3D objects.

Experimental results demonstrate that appropriate regularization of the latent space through graph self-supervised learning can further enhance the robustness of conditional generation. The comprehensive experimental findings indicate that, compared to existing competitive methods, this approach can generate 3D molecular graphs with enhanced effectiveness/drug similarity and is at least an order of magnitude faster in diffusion training. The speed advantage increases with the size/complexity of molecules.

### Strengths
- Demonstrates superior generation quality, rapid generation capabilities, and conditional generation proficiency in 3D graph generation, while enhancing robustness through regularization.

### Weaknesses
- Limited generalization capability in comparison.

### Questions
- How to improve generalization capability?

### Summary
This study investigated the generation of 3D graphs from latent space using diffusion models and conditioned on different properties. The model is based on a cascaded 2D-3D graph autoencoders combined with diffusion models. The authors investigated the usefulness of generating 3D graphs from the latent space with symmetry preserved, and explored latent diffusion for conditional 3D graph generation.

### Strengths
The paper is well written and the rational is straightforward and convincing. The authors have conducted multiple numerical experiments and the conditional generation based on various properties show great potentials of such method. In general I find this is an interesting paper.

### Weaknesses
Please see my questions below.

### Questions
The authors trained the topological AE and the geometric AE separately with different constrains. I understand the difficulty in training them in one shot, but I'm wondering the influences from each of the AE, e.g., would it be possible information about the topology is lost while training using the geometric AE? If so, how much is lost/kept?

While GSSL improves the results on OOD, it seems it can worse the results on ID. Can the authors provide more insights on this?

Considering one utility of the model is for generating new drugs, model interpretability could be important. In the latent space, would it be possible for the authors to provide some visualization on the learned features and if available, colored by some topological and geometric features of the graph? If there are certain patterns there then it may be useful to help better understand what features are mostly kept in the latent space and enhance the interpretability of the model.

### Summary
This paper proposes an algorithm for diffusion-based 3D graph generation through latent space. This paper claims that low-dimensional projection is the key factor of the graph generation due to satisfy the equivariant property. The experiments are conducted using 3D molecules datasets.

### Strengths
The writing is clear. The introduction section is wonderful. I clearly understand the scope of this work and what factors that the authors mainly addresses about. The meaning of the latent space and the 2D-3D autoencoder is well aligned in that the latent space could be understood as down-dimensional projection from 3D to 2D. Also, the experiments look okay and outperforms the previous works. 

However, I am not sure of the clear contribution of this work. Let me write down my questions and worries in the following sections.

### Weaknesses
# W-1. Why latent space?

According to this paper, I did not clearly catch how the authors project the 3D molecules into the 2D latent space. The technical details are missing. It naively mentioned that the authors borrow the architectures from previous works and such simple comment is not self-contained, in my opinion.

However, let's assume that this issue is okay with me. Then, the following question is ... why the latent space is typically important to the graph generation? I know that the several recent studies utilize the latent space for the representation of the diffusion-based generative models. Nonetheless, I could not find any theoretical analysis behind the bridge between 

- _'the necessity of the latent space'_  and 
- _'the properties of the 3D graph representation, typically for the 3D molecules'_. 

For me, this is naive extension of latent diffusion models into graph representation.

# W-2. Overclaim.

Can the authors exactly prove this equation in Sec 3 of this manuscript?

_3D Graph Diffusion Performance <= Latent Space Reconstruction Quality + Symmetry Preservation * Data Dimensionality_

 # W-3. Lack of experiments

If the main contributions of this paper is about the analysis of the latent space into the 3D graph representation, I think that the authors should have provided the clear results or ablation study about the this contribution. 

For instance, using the same baseline model from (Hoogeboom et al., 2022), the authors could slightly modify the architecture while maintaining the number of parameters for fair comparison. However, I could not find such kind of analysis or experiment.

### Questions
Please address my concerns listed in Weakness section.

# Q-1. Proposition 1

While the authors describe full of equations with comments, the concept itself is highly straightforward. For instance in the manuscript, the authors said that '__Proposition 1.__ _Performance bound of 3D graph diffusion is related to feature dimensionality_'.
In my opinion, simply if we increase the network capacity by adding more layers or increasing the channel-length with lots of training data, the diffusion models surely have the performance gain. Honestly, I cannot catch the authors' intension from this propositions.

# Q-2. Ablation study

What if the authors intentionally omits the latent space encoding? I mean instead of using 2D-3D autoencoders, what happens if the network only consists of the 3D autoencoders? How much gain could we obtain if we adopt the latent space encoding?

# Q-3. Clear difference between the previous works.

Can the authors create one table to clearly demonstrate the difference? I read the paper (Hoogeboom et al., 2022) and it seems like this paper also split the geometry and topology for the diffusion process. Not just this factor itself, I hope to know the clear footsteps that this paper newly takes.

### Summary
The paper proposes to perform 3D Graph (molecule) generation in latent space instead of during it directly in the 3D space as usually done now. The author show that diffusion in a lower dimensional space should be more efficient for diffusion. They also propose to use a cascaded auto encoder (AE) instead of a one-shot AE to build such latent space. These changes are shown to help improve the quality of generated samples and are also applicable in the conditioned case.

### Strengths
The authors provide a nice and sensible motivation, that smaller latent spaces should be more efficient for diffusion. The proposed approach also outperforms the chosen baselines. The proposed formulation is nicely extended to include conditioning on both scalar and 3D properties, which allows for a wider range of applications.

### Weaknesses
The novelty of the work is somewhat limited. It takes existing 3D molecule genration setup with diffusion models and transforms it into latent diffusion, which is a known concept in general and some latent 3D models do exist (e.g. GEOLDM), using mostly off the shelf architectures.

One of the main contributions of this work is the cascaded auto encoder and main motivation for why it is needed stems from the fact that one-shot AE effectively failed to train. I find it a bit strange that the one-shot AE fails to train completely as there are 3D molecule generative models that generate 2D and 3D graph features jointly (e.g. MIDI or the example I reference in the paragraph below). They do usually re-weight the losses for 2D and 3D terms, but they do work. So I would like to see a more detailed analysis on why it doesn't work and potentially an ablation on the one-shot AE architecture and losses. I can understand one-shot AE working worse than the proposed cascaded AE with teacher forcing, but it essentially performing like a random initialization makes me wonder if it was tested sufficiently carefully.

As I also point out below, it would make sense to use for example https://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.17296.pdf as the baseline instead of an older EDM model, even though that paper is somewhat recent, so I understand its exclusion for the initial version of the paper. Still it would be nice to have for the rebuttal.

### Questions
In section 3.1 it is stated that graph matching is used for the AE training loss to ensure permutation and SE3 invariance. This can be computationally expensive. How fast is the AE training? In terms of wall time, but also asymptotically (in O notation)? Without knowing this the comparison of training time of the proposed method vs EDM is also a bit complicated. As I understand Table 4. does not account for the AE training time (yes, it can be trained once, but it still needs training).

Also, since AE is trained on a much larger dataset, it might be fair to also pre-train the EDM on general molecule genration. It has been shown that pretraining helps molecule generation (https://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.17296.pdf). While this paper is quite recent it would still make more sense to compare against such properly tuned state-of-the-art molecular diffusion setup instead of vanilla EDM, which is an older baseline (first ever diffusion model for 3D molecule generation).

Why is MIDI, which is cited numerous times in the paper is not compared against in the experiments? It does in certain metrics perform a lot better than the EDM, which is used as the main baseline here.

Also, in 3.2 Setup sections authors say that connectivity is commonly later determined based on domain rules and cite MIDI among others. Its true, that such domain-based rules are used to recover connectivity in e.g. EDM, but in MIDI connectivity is modeled explicitly if I remember correctly?

### Summary
In this paper, the authors introduce the generation of 3D graphs characterized by symmetry group equivariances, a feature with useful implications for machine vision and molecular discovery.The paper focuses on the optimal latent space for 3D graph diffusion, emphasizing its benefits over traditional methods. By strategically using cascaded 2D-3D graph autoencoders, the authors reveal a model called "latent 3D graph diffusion". Notably, this innovative approach demonstrates remarkable efficacy when adapted to the molecular context and enhanced by graph self-supervised learning. The experimental results highlight its ability to rapidly generate remarkable 3D molecular conformations.

### Strengths
1. This study provides a detailed analysis of the underlying methodology. It illustrates the overall relationship between diffusion performance, latent space reconstruction quality, symmetry conservation, and data dimensionality. The depth of this analysis demonstrates the thoroughness and precision of the research.

2. In this work, researchers adopt graph contrastive learning as a strategy to refine and enhance latent space representations in 3D graph autoencoders (AEs). The approach stands out for its innovative nature.

3. In terms of application evaluation, the authors conduct an exhaustive evaluation of the model for various scenarios. This includes unconditional generation of 3D molecules, conditional generation based on (invariant) quantum properties, and conditional generation in relation to (equivariant) protein targets. These diverse evaluations reinforce the model's laudable versatility and adaptability.

### Weaknesses
1. For the objective of unconditional 3D molecular generation, I noticed the absence of results from "Ours-GSSL". Including these would be crucial to validate the effectiveness of GCL.

2. Regarding the unconditional 3D molecule generation, the 'molsta' metric, which gauges molecular integrity, seems paramount. From the data presented, your findings exhibit significant variances when juxtaposed against the previously introduced 3D latent diffusion model, GeoLDM. Additionally, the AtomSta and MolSta metrics for the Drug dataset appear to be omitted.

3. In the context of conditional generation based on (invariant) quantum properties, it's essential to evaluate both ID and OOD. Yet, the "Ours-GSSL" performance doesn’t exhibit a noteworthy distinction compared to "ours", "Random", and similar methods. In some instances, it even underperforms. This might cast a shadow on the robustness of conclusions articulated in Section 4.2, especially point (v).

4. Concerning the experiments related to conditional generation associated with (equivariant) protein targets, I'd recommend broadening the evaluation scope by incorporating metrics such as the Vina Score and Vina Dock in your findings. Furthermore, beyond Targetdiff, newer techniques like DiffSBDD[1] and DecompDiff[2] have emerged. Comparing your approach with these could provide a more holistic view. As per the metrics currently displayed, the method delineated in your manuscript doesn't seem to lead the pack.

Minor:

1. In Figure 4, there appear to be some omission errors; the circled references seem to be missing.

2. The structure of "Proofs for Analysis" in Appendix A could be refined for better readability.

[2] Guan, Jiaqi, et al. "DecompDiff: Diffusion Models with Decomposed Priors for Structure-Based Drug Design." (2023).

### Questions
1. The design of latent diffusion appears to be complex. Have you considered simplifying it by merely applying KL divergence to $z^{{0}}$ and deriving a VAE-like model using the encoder and decoder as proposed in this paper? An ablation study should be added here.

2. Could there be a more comprehensive validation of GCL's efficacy in Section 4?

3. Given your assertion that your model "produces superior 3D molecules faster" owing to latent diffusion, could you perhaps contrast it with GeoLDM, a previously introduced 3D latent diffusion model?

4. Is it possible to conduct a more in-depth evaluation and comparative study of experiments related to the generation of conditions related to equivariant protein targets?

### Summary
The paper "Latent 3D Graph Diffusion" explores using generative AI for 3D graph generation with symmetry-group equivariance. It emphasizes the importance of choosing the right latent space for diffusion, proposing a compact and symmetry-preserving space called "latent 3D graph diffusion." They extend this to conditional generation, showing its potential in molecular discovery with improved speed and quality compared to existing methods. The paper's contributions include motivational analysis, latent space construction, and extensions to conditional generation, all supported by experimental results. The conclusion suggests future research areas, including semantics-specific regularization of the latent space.

### Strengths
Strengths:
1.	Novel Approach: The paper addresses an important and under-investigated question regarding the latent space for 3D graph diffusion, introducing a novel concept of latent 3D graph diffusion. This approach is innovative and could lead to significant advancements in the field.

2.	Theoretical Foundation: The paper provides a theoretical analysis to motivate the use of latent spaces for 3D graph diffusion. The performance bound of 3D graph diffusion in a latent space is discussed, which adds a valuable theoretical perspective to the work.

3.	Comprehensive Contributions: The paper offers a multi-faceted approach to 3D graph generation, addressing the choice of latent space, the construction of compact and informative spaces, conditional generation, and regularization of the latent space. This comprehensive approach demonstrates the authors' commitment to advancing the field.

4.	Empirical Validation: The paper supports its claims with empirical results, showing that the proposed method outperforms existing techniques. Various settings are adopted, including unconditional generation, invariant generation conditioned on quantum properties, and equivariant generation conditioned on protein targets.

### Weaknesses
I have several questions:

1. What's the difference between a one-shot AE and a Cascaded AE? The paper claims that "a one-shot AE embeds and reconstructs molecule data, evaluating both structure topology and geometry simultaneously." How does a Cascaded AE differ? Are topology and geometry independent from each other in a Cascaded AE?  

2. I would recommend adding an algorithm section to improve clarity. Based on my current understanding, a graph is initially encoded by an encoder in the latent space, then it undergoes diffusion in the latent space, and finally, it is transformed back to the graph space. Please correct me if I'm mistaken. Could you also clarify which diffusion model is used for the diffusion process in the latent space?  

3. The paper asserts that "a latent space should possess (i) low dimensionality, (ii) low reconstruction error, and (iii) preserve group symmetry." How do you ensure that the autoencoder can meet these objectives? Have you conducted any analysis in this regard?
