# Learning to Compute Gröbner Bases

- Decision: Reject
- Scores: 3, 6, 8

## Abstract
Solving a polynomial system, or computing an associated \gb basis, has been a fundamental task in computational algebra. However, it is also known for its notorious doubly exponential time complexity in the number of variables in the worst case. This paper is the first to address the learning of \gb basis computation with Transformers. 
  The training requires many pairs of a polynomial system and the associated \gb basis, raising two novel algebraic problems: random generation of \gb bases and transforming them into non-\gb ones, termed as backward \gb problem. 
  We resolve these problems with 0-dimensional radical ideals, the ideals appearing in various applications. 
  Further, we propose a hybrid input embedding to handle coefficient tokens with continuity bias and avoid the growth of the vocabulary set.
  The experiments show that our dataset generation method is a few orders of magnitude faster than a naive approach, overcoming a crucial challenge in learning to compute \gb bases, and \gb computation is learnable in a particular class.

### Summary
Grobner basis computation is an important problem in computational algebra, and has applications in cryptography. In this problem we are given as input a non-grobner set, and the output is a grobner basis of the set. The problem is NP-hard, and is also considered to be in hard in practice. This paper investigates the use of transformers in speeding up the solving.

Training a transformer requires a large set of input output pairs from a distribution resembling the distribution of interest,  and this set is not available for the grobner basis problem, due to the computational complexity of generation. To solve this issue, the authors propose a novel method to uniformly sample from the output domain, i.e. set of grobner bases and then find a corresponding input in polytime. The authors then train a transformer on this set and demonstrate the efficacy of their approach. Interestingly, even in the cases where the grobner computation is wrong, the support is correct, which is enough material for other tools to efficiently compute the bases.

### Strengths
The paper overall is written and arranged well. The data generation approach proposed by the paper might be of independent interest.

### Weaknesses
I found the experimental evaluation unconvincing. 

1) The test set seems to be randomly generated instances, rather than problems arising out of some real applications.  Moreover they are generated from the same distribution as the training set. The authors mention the problem of out of distribution generalisation, however it is not addressed at all as far as I could tell. 

2) It is usual for solvers to test their performance on some standard datasets (for ex. the SAT competition for SAT solvers), and random instances are usually considered irrelevant. It is not clear whether the state of the art Grobner basis tools have been optimised for random instances or practical instances, hence the comparision may not be fair. 

I felt that the use of transformers for this problem is not motivated well enough. The paper does mention that transformers have been used for other math problems, including for a step in the related Buchberger algorithm; however it is not at all clear why they should be used here. Why transformers and not something more basic?

### Questions
1) Does the backward generation process induce a uniform distribution on the input space as well?
2) Do typical Grobner basis problems come from use cases which match the distribution of the backward generation?

### Summary
This paper discuss using Transformer technology to solve a really hard problem from computational linear algebra: computing the Grobner basis. This problem is known to be NP-hard (with best known double exponential algorithms). Thus, using heuristic methods like ML can be attractive. 

Most of the focus of the paper on how to generate the training set. To that end, the authors solve two problems: generating random Grobner bases, and computing non-trivial varities with a prescribed basis. The authors claim that these problems have not be explored before.

I need to qualify my review: I am not an expert, nor even knowledgable, regarding computational algebra. Thus, my review is based on the author's background and claims. I cannot verify the correctness of their claims from an algebraist point of view. This is a low confidence review.

### Strengths
- Solving an important problem, which required solving problems not considered before, and allow solving problems that are very expensive to solve without a lot of computational power.
- Part of growing literature on using transformers for symbolic mathematics.
- Good empirical results.
- Well executed study.

### Weaknesses
- Limited applicability: 
a) The authors acknowledge that transformers may only perform well for in-distribution samples, citing Dziri et al 2023. They do dismiss this as a "a fundamental challenge of transformers, and outside the score, but nevertheless this limits the applicability of their algorithm.
b) In particular, due to the limitations of transformers, they can learn only with instances of bounded size. I am unclear whether this limits also testing, but regardless in means that in-distribution is only of limited size. As a side note, is the problem of finding the Grober basis also NP-hard for bounded size instances?
c) The authors impose additional restrictions on instances in the tranining set, and they claim these are reaslistic. 

- Limited theory. although there are some theorems, they are simple and their proofs seem straightforward. The  contribution from the mathematical side seem very limited. 

- Algorithm for randomly generating Grobner bases seems very simple, and seem to "engineer" the problem a lot.  There is no analysis of the actual distribution of the instances the algorithm will generate. Is it uniform in any way?

- Contrary to what they authors claim, no real light is shed on the algebraic problems themselves. 

- Seems that only experiments on synthetic data was considered. 

- Will interest only specialist on work on computational algebra.

### Questions
- Did you try you method on "real world" problems?
- I understand that learning can only be done on limited size instances. But does this limit testing as well? If no, why not report experiments. 
- On page 6, where you say that you sample O(s^2) polynomails, how are these sampled? What distribution?

### Summary
This paper studies the problem of generative model-learned algorithm for Grobner bases. Grobner bases are ubiquitous object for solving polynomial systems, but currently most known libraries that compute Grobner bases do require doubly exponential runtime in the worst case. It is therefore crucial to use tools such as transformers to facilitate this task. This paradigm also poses new interesting problems for Grobner bases: given a Grobner basis, how can one generate a polynomial set that is not a Grobner basis but spanned by the given basis (they call this problem backward Grobner problem)? Moreover, how can one randomly sample a Grobner basis? This paper shows how to solve these problems whenever the polynomials are in shape position and thus for zero-dimensional radical ideals. For the backward Grobner problem, they show a suitable linear mapping can indeed generate a non-Grobner basis while preserving the target set. Their characterization of such linear mapping is rather general, and they show how to sample a subset of these maps via Bruhat decomposition. Finally, experiments are performed, and the accuracy are relatively good. Interestingly, their experiments show that transformers perform much better for lexicographical order instead of graded reverse lexicographical, which is the most popular ordering to my knowledge.

### Strengths
This paper studies a very important problem, namely generating Grobner basis for polynomial system solving. Many algorithms for solving polynomial systems and related do require Grobner basis. However, Grobner basis algorithm is notably inefficient, so studying machine learning-based approaches is crucial. 

The study of transformer-based approach also elucidates new problems for Grobner bases, such as how to sample them, and how to generate a non-Grobner basis given a Grobner basis. These are novel and intriguing problems and might have further applications. This paper attempts to address the first problem by sampling over zero-dimensional radical ideals, so that most polynomials are in shape position that are easy to handle. It is worth noting that zero-dimensional ideals is a vast and popular family in which many applications lie in. For the backward Grobner problem, they provide a characterization of linear maps that do enable the transformation from Grobner basis to non-basis.

Overall, I think the problems imposed in this paper are interesting, and the theoretical results while not super surprising, are solid.

### Weaknesses
While the main selling point is to use transformers for solving the Grobner bases problem, the actual experimental results are not that good. In particular, for the popular grevlex order, the transformer-based approach is very bad. It is surprising that the support accuracy is much higher than the actual accuracy for basis generation. One can argue that the blackbox nature of transformers makes it very hard to interpret the bottleneck of this method, but I do hope other architectures are tried to obtain a better empirical result. This is essential, as the main selling point of this paper is to use machine learning blackbox method to compute Grobner bases more efficiently.

Even though the main motivation of this paper is to use transformers, the theoretical parts and the two problems regarding Grobner bases are intriguing to me than the experiments.

### Questions
Typo: on page 2, summary of contributions the second item, it should be "we uncover..." instead of "we uncovered...".

Q: How fast is your transformer-based approach compared to standard algorithms?
