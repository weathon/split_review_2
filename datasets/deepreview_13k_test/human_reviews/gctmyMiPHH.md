# Feature Collapse

- Decision: Accept
- Scores: 5, 6, 8, 6

## Abstract
\noindent We formalize and study a phenomenon called \emph{feature collapse} that makes precise the intuitive idea that entities playing a similar role in a learning task receive similar representations. As feature collapse requires a notion of task, we leverage a simple but prototypical NLP task to study it. We start by showing experimentally that feature collapse goes hand in hand with generalization. We then prove that, in the large sample limit,  distinct words that play identical roles in this NLP task receive identical local feature representations in a neural network. This analysis reveals the crucial role that normalization mechanisms, such as LayerNorm, play in feature collapse and in generalization.

### Summary
The paper delves into the concept of "feature collapse," where entities with similar roles in a learning task are given analogous representations. To understand this, the authors use a synthetic task where a learner classifies 'sentences' made of L tokens. Their experiments reveal a direct relationship between feature collapse and generalization. They demonstrate that, with sufficient data, distinct tokens with the same task roles have identical feature representations in a network's first layer. The research conclusively proves that neural networks, when trained on this task and equipped with a LayerNorm module, develop interpretable and meaningful representations in their initial layer. The paper's key contributions include defining 'good features' mathematically and deriving analytical formulas for a two-layer network's weights.

### Strengths
Strength:
1. Paper is well organized
2. The settings of experiments and assumptions of theoretical analysis are carefully designed.

### Weaknesses
Weakness:

In general, I am not sure how the results could be useful.
* For the theory part, it would be helpful to highlight core technical challenges the authors met and addressed in the proofs, or any new proof techniques the authors developed.
* For the experiment part, I am not sure how it could help design or explain applications. I totally agree that semantically similar instances would lead to similar representations. But is it benign or not for the network to assign exactly the same representation to equivalent instances? If it is benign, how to ensure it happens in practice? If not, then how to avoid it? It would be helpful for the authors to give some convincing scenarios that people care about this phenomenon.

In addition, I suppose there should be a section for conclusions and limits.

### Questions
Questions:
1. Maybe a simpler and more intuitive experiment to demonstrate this “feature collapse” behavior, is to assign two embeddings (to be learned) to one token, but during training this token is randomly mapped to these two embeddings, and see if these two embeddings become similar after training.
2. Does the condition assumed on λ (in Thm. 2) align with the choice of λ in experiments? 
3. Can we empirically verify the feature collapse in deeper layers?
4. I have concerns about the difficulty of learning equivalence from the data by the model itself without special treatments, including data augmentations and introducing explicit invariance into models. I think the root is: if the optimization objective is not the equivalence, the network could ignore the equivalence and just memorize the data. Another related and broader phenomenon is the failure to learn “A = B” equals to “B = A” in language models [1]. In computer vision, semantically equivalent inputs (pixels, small image patches, whole images, etc.) may not lead to the same feature, for both early layers and deep layers/final outputs. This is easy to understand, because even for contrastive learning where the network is forced to learn invariant features under augmentations, different views (augmented images) cannot guaranteed to lead to the same feature after training.

### Summary
The paper investigates feature collapse and "good" features learned at the first few layers. The good features should be invariant for entities serving the same concept for tasks at hand. The authors construct a synthesized task to investigate how feature collapse works. The paper reveals three kinds of feature collapse through synthetic experiments and theories and can be roughly summarized as follows: (1) Type-I feature collapse for models w/o LayerNorm, which collapses in both magnitudes and directions and will happen with uniform distribution. (2) Type-II feature collapse for models w/ LayerNorm will still collapse in both directions in magnitudes under long-tail distribution due to the help of LayerNorm. (3) Type-III feature collapse for models w/o LayerNorm, which collapses in directions but not magnitudes and will happen with long-tail distribution.

### Strengths
1. The paper proposes a view to understand the feature collapse with good definitions of "good" features. The understanding of LayerNorm functionality in the feature collapse, which is a key component in the modern Transformer architecture, would help the community further understand language models.
2. The paper's presentation is extremely clear and easy to follow. The synthetic experiments in Section 2 are sound, plausible, and offer reasonable intuitions.

### Weaknesses
My major concern is if the Type-II feature collapse still holds when LayerNorm has trainable parameters. The reason is that LayerNorm w/ trainable parameters will not force the word features to have a fixed magnitude. A simple experiment would suffice. 

While I tend to vote for acceptance, I am not an expert in this field, so I will keep my score modest.

### Summary
The manuscript introduces the concept of "Feature Collapse," which states that input features with analogous semantic meanings would receive identical representations. This phenomenon is examined under two distinct scenarios: the first being a 2-layer network, and the second incorporating LayerNorm on the 2-layer network. Empirical evaluations reveal that in a uniform setting, both network configurations attain feature collapse in terms of representations and weights. However, in a non-uniform context, the integration of LayerNorm becomes essential for the complete feature collapse. The study concludes with theoretical findings that prove feature collapse.

### Strengths
1. The work is well presented and all notions included in the paper are discussed clearly.
2. The concept of feature collapse is interesting and intuitive.
3. The paper potentially offers an explanation regarding the impact of LayerNorm.

### Weaknesses
1. While the reviewer appreciates the feature collapse concept and believes this phenomenon is not limited to the simple network settings used in the manuscript, the absence of empirical validation within more complex networks or datasets constrains the soundness and significance of the findings.
2. The authors differentiate their work from the Neural Collapse (NC) concept by emphasizing that, unlike NC, Feature Collapse inherently suggests enhanced generalization and transfer learning capabilities. But once again, this claim lacks strong empirical evidence, the 2-layer network used in the paper is not comprehensive enough to demonstrate this point.

### Questions
1. The work devotes to study word representations, would similar phenomenon happens in vision as well (e.g., VisionTransformer uses image patches, does image patch with similar sematic also receive identical representations)? 
2. The work primarily studies that features of words with similar semantics would collapse, how about words that sharing similar syntactic in a sentence? Would something similar happen as well?

(The reviewer is not asking for empirical evidence, just curious to hear the authors' thoughts.)

### Summary
This paper defines the notion of "feature collapse" which relates to the intuition that entities that play a similar role should receive similar representations. This notion is made precise for a toy NLP task. Here, labels are invariant to substitutions of input tokens within certain equivalence classes. The paper then studies, both theoretically and empirically, under what conditions tokens within such an equivalence class are assigned similar representations, i.e. "feature collapse" has occurred. The paper shows that for this toy task, feature collapse corresponds to stronger generalization in the presence of tail tokens. The paper also empirically shows that feature collapse only occurs when the network includes layer norm. Otherwise, the norm of representations depends on the frequency of the tokens in the training data. A major contribution is a theoretical proof that explains why the magnitudes of the learned representations depend on their frequencies.

### Strengths
* The proof that token embeddings depend on token frequencies in the proposed setting may provide a useful theoretical insight for future work to build on. The proofs in the paper are non-trivial.
* The paper may help explain a reason why layer normalization can improve generalization.

### Weaknesses
* While the key contributions of the paper are theoretical, the motivation for the theoretical results would have been clearer if a stronger connection could be made to more realistic settings. For example, the connection between feature collapse and generalization outside the context of the toy task does not seem to be well established. Additionally, the degree to which feature collapse sufficiently occurs or does not occur in the context of more realistic models and tasks is not clear. While perhaps not strictly necessary for such a theoretical paper, addressing such questions would have improved the motivation for this work.
* The role of the L2 regularization term in equation 2 could be clarified. The authors state "The regularization terms play no essential role apart from making proofs easier; the empirical picture remains the same without weight decay". Could the authors include the experimental results that support this claim? This also seems to diminish (although not completely) the key theoretical contribution. It is not surprising that in the presence of L2 regularization, feature magnitudes would depend on their frequency in the training data. It would be more interesting if we had theory that elucidated why the learned embeddings for rarer tokens have lower magnitude in the absence of explicit regularization.

Minor typos:

* Intro paragraph 1 - "gives same features"
* Intro contribution bullet 1 - "how a network learn representations"

### Questions
* Is there any setting where feature collapse may *not* be desirable? For example, consider a task with a significant degree of label noise and with limited data samples to learn from. Intuitively, features that are observed more frequently during training may be more reliable predictors of the label. Therefore, to the extent that the magnitude of word embeddings relates to their salience in making predictions, it seems that feature collapse may not be strictly desirable in such a setting.
