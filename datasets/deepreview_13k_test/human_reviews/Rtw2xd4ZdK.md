- Decision: Reject
- Scores: 5, 8, 5, 5

## Abstract
Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) have shown impressive results in modeling large-scale scenes. A critical problem is how to effectively estimate the occupancy to guide empty-space skipping and point sampling. Although grid-based methods show their advantages in occupancy estimation for small-scale scenes, large-scale scenes typically have irregular scene bounds and more complex scene geometry and appearance distributions, which present severe challenges to the grid-based methods for handling large scenes, because of the limitations of predefined bounding boxes and grid resolutions, and high memory usage for grid updating. In this paper, we propose to learn a compact and efficient occupancy representation of large-scale scenes. Our main contribution is to learn and encode the occupancy of a scene into a compact MLP in an efficient and self-supervised manner. We achieve this by three core designs. First, we propose a novel Heterogeneous Mixture of Experts (HMoE) structure with common Scene Experts and a tiny Empty-Space Expert. The heterogeneous structure can be effectively used to model the imbalanced unoccupied and occupied regions in NeRF where unoccupied regions need much fewer parameters. Second, we propose a novel imbalanced gate loss for HMoE, motivated by the prior that most of the 3D points are unoccupied. It enables the gating network of HMoE to accurately dispatch the unoccupied and occupied points. Third, we also design an explicit density loss to guide the gating network. Then, the occupancy of the entire large-scale scene can be encoded into a very compact gating network of the HMoE. As far as we know, we are the first to learn the compact occupancy of large-scale NeRF by an MLP. We show in the experiments that our occupancy network can very quickly learn more accurate, smooth, and clean occupancy compared to the occupancy grid. With our learned occupancy as guidance for empty space skipping, our method can consistently obtain $2.5\times$ speed-up on the state-of-the-art method Switch-NeRF, while achieving highly competitive performances on several challenging large-scale benchmarks.

### Summary
This paper proposes a new approach to learning compact occupancy for large-scale neural radiance fields (NeRF) called LECO-NERF. The authors address the challenge of efficiently encoding the occupancy of a scene into a compact MLP, which can be used to guide empty-space skipping and point sampling. They propose a Heterogeneous Mixture of Experts (HMoE) structure to model unoccupied and occupied regions in NeRF, which is trained using a novel imbalanced gate loss. The authors demonstrate that LECO-NERF achieves state-of-the-art results on several large-scale datasets while being more efficient and compact than previous methods. Overall, the paper presents a promising approach to improving the scalability and efficiency of NeRF for modeling large-scale scenes.

### Strengths
Overall the paper is based on a similar idea of Switch-NeRF, and developed based on that by adding novel modules including HMoE and imbalanced gate loss. Strengths including:
- The proposed Heterogeneous Mixture of Experts (HMoE) structure is a novel way to model unoccupied and occupied regions in NeRF and is trained using a novel imbalanced gate loss.
- The authors demonstrate that LECO-NERF achieves state-of-the-art results on several large-scale datasets while being more efficient and compact than previous methods.
- The paper provides a detailed analysis of the occupancy statistics related to the points of scene experts and the empty space expert with respect to the occupancy training steps, which helps to understand the behavior of the model.

### Weaknesses
My major concern with the paper is limited novelty and improvement over existing literature on large-scale neural rendering, as well as inadequate evaluation of related benchmarks.

- The general idea of using MoE to improve the performance of large-scale neural radiance fields has been explored by Switch-NeRF. The work is rather incremental by modifying the homogenous mixture of experts into the heterogeneous mixture of experts (HMoE). 
- The reconstruction quality, when compared to the original switch-nerf, seems to be only on par or marginally improved (Tab. 2, Tab.3)
- Tab.3 is confusing, can you elaborate more on how S-NeRF* is different from S-NeRF? Maybe include a curve showing how the test PSNRs change against training time.
- The reviewed and evaluated baselines in this paper are quite limited. Sparse occupancy-based methods (\eg NSVF, PointNeRF, 3D Gaussian Splatting, nerflets) are not covered in related works. Possible hash-encoding, plane-encoding, or hybrid-encoding methods for large-scale NeRFs are not covered adequately as baselines in the main experiments.

### Questions
Check the weaknesses for details:

- Improve the related work section.
- Adding/discussing more possible baselines in the main experiments.
- Discuss more about how this method improves over the plain MoE/Switch-NeRF.
- Including some visualizations (of reconstructed images) for the main experiment.
- Including more details about Tab. 3.
- Minor: Tab. 3 caption: ->MegaNeRF.

### Summary
The paper introduced LeCO-NERF, a novel representation of large scenes. There are several novelties of the paper, including a new Heterogeneous mixture of expert structure to effectively model occupied/unoccupied regions in NERF, as well as corresponding loss functions to guide the learning of this new network. As a result, the learned NERF is highly accurate and compact with the help of the occupancy network. The proposed algorithm on public benchmarks achieved 2.5x speed-up while maintaining state-of-the-art accuracy.

### Strengths
- The paper is trying to solve a very important problem of learning a compact and efficient occupancy representation of large-scale scenes. 
- The introduction of the Heterogeneous Mixture of Experts (HMoE) structure is novel, and ablation studies shows this design is essential
- The newly introduced loss functions are proven to be useful as well in practice
- LeCO-NERF is highly efficient compared to state of the art approaches, while getting very high accuracy on public benchmarks on large scenes
- The overall presentation of the paper is good

### Weaknesses
I think this is a nice paper, and I couldn't find highly concerning issues and weaknesses. I do have some minor questions, and they will be listed in the following section

### Questions
- The paper introduced an algorithm to handle very large scenes. However I wonder if there are intuitions that can be shared on 1) how big of the scene can the algorithm handle in theory (and in practice), and 2) how small of the scene can LeCO-NERF become effective (against existing SOTA NERF variants for 3D objects).
- I spent considerable amount of time trying to understand the blue box with white contents of Fig.1, before learning more context about what it represents. I wonder if this visualization can be better improved by providing more explicit notations in the caption or in the main text
- in Fig 4b, with L_d,  it seems that the rendering is all blank, is this a mistake?
- will the code be available upon publication? I think this would be useful for reproducing this research work

### Summary
The proposed LECO-Nerf is a reconstruction method for large scale scenes. The major contribution is the Occupancy Net that predicts whether a 3D point is occupied or not. If occupied, the Occupancy Net predicts which expert (i.e., nerf network) the point belongs to. To facilitate the training of the Occupancy Network, the Imbalanced Gate Loss is used to allocate more points to the empty expert, the Density Loss is used to enforce that points classified as empty are of small occupancy \sigma. Experiments show that the training speed is improved, with competitive reconstruction quality.

### Strengths
1. It is the first method that models the occupancy space with a MLP. Experiments show that the design is effective. Most points are empty, and the predicted sigmas are close to zero for those empty points.
2. The imbalanced Gate Loss is inspiring to control the number of points belongs to each nerf network.

### Weaknesses
1. The HMoE design is questionable. According to Section 4.5 HMoE, the reconstruction quality droped with MoE (The empty expert is as large as scene experts). 
(a) I believe it is the density loss that enforces the small sigma for empty points. If a larger empty expert leads to failure, that means the density loss is invalid / not-effective.
(b) If a larger empty expert fails, the authors need to justify how "small" the empty expert should be. It would be impractical if the HMoE is sensitive to the network design. Probably it requires different network designs when working with different scenes.

2. I am confused about the statement "we can use our frozen occupancy network to guide the sampling and training of NeRF methods". The occupancy network can be trained end-to-end according to the design. Why do we need to freeze the occupany network and train the nerf models again? 

3. Unfair experiment design. Most experiments are of fixed training time, e.g. 23.8h for Table 2, 12-15h for Table 3. Indeed the HMoE gives better results with limited training time. However, we need to compare the final result with enough training time. Does the HMoE still out-performs the baselines with enough training time, e.g., 40+ hours for Table 2 & 3.

4. For Figure 2, why do we need an empty space expert? Why do we need sigma and RGB if we believe a point is empty? An obvious alternative is that occupancy network serves as a classifier. That is:
(a) Remove the empty space expert
(b) The empty points do not involve in the rendering, in another word, set \sigma=0 if a point is predicted as empty.

### Questions
Overall I like the idea of modeling occupancy with a MLP. I would lean to acceptance if the above questions are solved.

### Summary
This work aims to learn and encode the occupancy of a scene into a compact MLP in an efficient and self-supervised manner.
First, this paper proposes a Heterogeneous Mixture of Experts (HMoE) structure with common Scene Experts and a tiny Empty-Space Expert. Second, an imbalanced gate loss is proposed for HMoE, motivated by the prior that most of the 3D points are unoccupied. It enables the gating network of HMoE to accurately dispatch the unoccupied and occupied points. Third, an explicit density loss is introduced to guide the gating network. Then, the occupancy of the entire large-scale scene can be encoded into a very compact gating network of the HMoE. With the learned occupancy as guidance for empty space skipping, our method can consistently obtain 2.5× speed-up on the state-of-the-art method Switch-NeRF, while achieving highly competitive performances on several challenging large-scale benchmarks.

### Strengths
This paper proposes a novel Heterogeneous Mixture of Experts (HMoE) network to learn the occupancy of a large-scale scene. The HMoE network consists of several Scene Experts designed to encode the occupied points.

An imbalanced gate loss is introduced for the gating network in HMoE. Since a large portion of the space is unoccupied, the decision of the gating network can explicitly model the imbalance of occupancy.

To better learn the occupancy of a large-scale scene, a density loss is proposed to guide the training of the gating network.

Experiments show that after training, the occupancy network can be utilized to guide the point sampling in the large-scale NeRF method, i.e. Switch-NeRF (MI & Xu, 2023), and achieve a 2.5× acceleration compared to Switch-NeRF, while obtaining highly competitive performance.

### Weaknesses
This paper devotes large efforts to learning and encoding the occupancy of a large-scale scene into a compact MLP, which can be used to guide the point sampling (mainly for skipping the points in empty space) of other NeRF models.
However, I have several major concerns about this work.

There are many representations to cache the occupancy/density of the scene, such as the MLP, grid, hashgrid, tensoRF, and triplanes. This paper only compares a grid representation with a resolution of 128^3. Even under this setup, the improvement of S+Ours over S+Grid is minor and even worse in PSNR on Residence (S+Grid 22.18 vs S+Ours 22.10), as shown in Table 3.

I think using a larger resolution (e.g., 256) of the grid can achieve better results. I understand that using a large resolution, dense grid will occupy more memory. In this case, this method should compare with the more efficient hashgrid representation, which can represent a very high-resolution grid (e.g., 1024) with small memory and be optimized in a small amount of time (typically a few minutes on a single GPU). In comparison, the proposed occupancy method requires 1.6h to 1.8h to train on 8 NVIDIA RTX 3090 GPUs. 

Overall, I feel that this method is heavy and the advantages over existing representations are very limited.

### Questions
Please kindly provide comparisons with more efficient representations, such as hashgrid, TensoRF, and K-planes. And justify why we need such a complicated method to learn occupancy.

Please also compare the runtime of different methods in learning the occupancy.
