# Causal Structure Recovery with Latent Variables under Milder Distributional and Graphical Assumptions

- Decision: Accept
- Scores: 5, 8, 6, 5

## Abstract
Traditional causal discovery approaches typically assume the absence of latent variables, a simplification that often does not align with real-world situations. Recently, there has been a surge of causal discovery methods that explicitly consider latent variables. While some works aim to reveal causal relations between observed variables in the presence of latent variables, others seek to identify latent variables and recover the causal structure over them. The latter typically entail strong distributional and graphical assumptions, such as the non-Gaussianity, purity, and two-pure-children assumption. In this paper, we endeavor to recover the whole causal structure involving both latent and observed variables under milder assumptions. We formulate two cases, one allows entirely arbitrary distribution and requires only one pure child per latent variable, and the other requires no pure child and imposes the non-Gaussianity requirement on only a subset of variables, and they both avoid the purity assumption. We prove the identifiability of linear latent variable models in both cases, and our constructive proof leads to theoretically sound and computationally efficient algorithms.

### Summary
The authors address the problem of causal discovery in the presence of latent variables.  As opposed to most approaches that aim to handle latent variables, which focus on estimating the causal dependence among the observed variables in the presence of latent variables, the authors focus on identifying the latent variables and the dependence structure between them and the observed variables.  Other similar methods in the literature have stricter assumptions, generally requiring either at least two pure children of each latent variables or non-Gaussianity.  The authors' proposed method has milder assumptions, requiring at a minimum only a generalized pure child pair and a latent neighbor for each latent variable.  The authors go on to describe increasing sets of assumptions that allow for stronger identifiability and present the algorithm PC-MIMBUILD.

### Strengths
The paper addresses an interesting problem and the initial motivation is strong.  Rather than presenting a single set of relaxing assumptions, I appreciate the authors' presentation of multiple sets that can be used depending on the situation.  The writing is generally good, and the notation is consistent and clear.  In addition, as someone largely new to this specific sub-field of research, the authors do a good job at summarizing the state of the art and positioning their work within it.

### Weaknesses
I have two primary concerns about this paper: the awkward presentation order of the narrative and the lack of any empirical results.

Throughout, this paper has an issue with referencing terms and concepts extensively before actually defining them.  While some level of this is often inevitable (e.g., you're not going to have defined everything by the introduction, yet you still need to give a high level overview), this is rampant enough in this paper that it often hinders understanding.  For example, in the introduction, the mentions of a "pure child" in the second paragraph, while a bit unclear, were largely fie (despite not knowing what a "pure child" was on a first read, I could at some level get that a "two-pure-children assumption" was lighter than a "three-pure-children assumption".  However, the fourth paragraph of the introduction continues to talk about "the purity assumption" and "pure children", without even trying to provide a high-level intuition of these terms.  Similarly, the fifth paragraph of the introduction has the line "the two structures in Figure 2 cannot be discriminated against each other, where {O3, O4) in Figure 2(a) is called a pseudo-pure pair." - this is essentially meaningless with any basic terminology or intuition.  I'd recommend keeping the introduction at a higher level and providing some of this discussion after Section 2.

This pattern persists, on a much smaller scale, throughout Section 3.  For example, in Section 3.1, the paragraph before Theorem 1 reads as though it assumes some familiarity with Theorem 1.  Presenting them the theorem and then presenting a description of the intuition afterwards would lead to a much clearer flow.

In general, Section 3 is high on technical detail and low on intuition.  Some of the assumptions (e.g., |Nei(L)| >= 4 in Assumption 2) feel very specific and arbitrary.  While I'm sure there's a strong motivation behind it, no discussion is provided to help the reader along in understanding where it comes from.  I'm sure that fitting everything into the page limit was a challenge, but as it stands, I think the lack of discussion and intuition makes the paper challenging to follow.

I see that empirical results are present in the appendix.  However, I wish at least some experiments were included in the main paper.  For those experiments, it also appears (though I may be mistaken) that all of the synthetic data graphs conform to the assumptions made by the authors.  I'd be interested to see how the author's approach performs under mild assumption violations, and how it compare to other algorithms when all of them have their assumptions violated in different ways.

This is a minor point and doesn't contribute to my score, but the authors use the phrase "relatively milder" a lot in this paper, and it feels awkward.  Sometimes, as in the first paragraph of Section 3, an assumption is referred to as "relatively milder" when no alternative is being discussed, leaving the comparative "milder" feeling strange.

### Questions
Section 2, in the second sentence, says that no observed variable can be a parent of a latent one.  This seems like a non-trivial assumption, yet it is not treated as an assumption, or justified, anywhere that I can see.  Is this a standard assumption in this sort of latent-variable identification literature?  Is there a reason to believe that, in practice, that this assumption is reasonable?

In Section 3.1, what is "latent commission"?  I don't see it anywhere in the paper apart from this mention.

Is there any guidance for how to choose which algorithm/set of assumptions to go with?  For example, in the experimental results in the Appendix, Algorithm 1+2 or Algorithm 1+3 are chosen depending on the underlying graph.  In practice, however, we won't have access to the underlying graph.

### Summary
Expanding on previous work on causal discovery for linear latent models, this work allows for causal relationships between observed children of latent variables. Specifically, they give 2 conditions under which such models are identifiable. One under which the latent has to have at least one pure child and sufficient number of neighbours. Another under which children of latents with a causal edge are allowed given that they are non-Gaussian distributed. With these weaker assumptions when compared to previous works, the authors devise an algorithm that can identify latent linear models.

### Strengths
- Really well written and structured
- Claims are well justified and theory is very neat.

### Weaknesses
- The main weakness would be the empirical evaluation. Currently, the results are only for 10 models, and the standard deviation of the accuracy is not reported. A lot of the methods discussed are not compared against. For example: Huang et al. (2022), Xie et al. (2023b) just to name a few. 
- The fact that the experiments had to be deferred to the Appendix is an indication that this paper is too long already.

Minor points: 
- It would be useful to readers to have graphical depictions for what causal graphs your algorithm does and does not allow. To further delineate from previous works, it may be useful to have depictions of graphs that previous works allow as well.

### Questions
- Given that the assumptions required are mostly on latent variables, is it possible at all to get an indication of when these assumptions might hold given a dataset?

### Confidence
2: You are willing to defend your assessment, but it is quite likely that you did not understand the central parts of the submission or that you are unfamiliar with some pieces of related work. Math/other details were not carefully checked.

### Summary
The paper studies new identifiability criteria for linear SCMs with latent variables. They generalize several prior works on identifiability of latent variable SCMs.

### Strengths
- The paper seems to generalize previous results in several directions.
- As latent confounding is ubiquitous, an important problem is adressed.
- The presentation appears to be sound and clear. I did not check proofs after C.7 but until then, I found no issues.

### Weaknesses
- Careful proofreading would improve the paper further
- While there are several different results in the paper, it would be great if a common theme could be established, e.g., a more systematic understanding of the right identifiability conditions.
- This might be a bit much to ask, but can the conditions be tested? 
- The graphical conditions are still quite restrictive (but probably unavoidable). An interesting direction might be to consider when can we answer some 'causal queries' without full identifiability under milder assumptions.


Overall, I don't have major complaints, but I am a bit hesitant because I am not too familiar with the field.

### Questions
- First, part of Section 3 was not very helpful for me because the results are not established at this point.

- The definition of the set $\mathbb{S}$ seems to be missing. (only in Algorithm it becomes clear what it is).

- I could not follow Assumption 2. Maybe this can be clarified. Does it mean $Nei(L)\geq 4$ and, moreover, in the case where $Nei(L)=4$ such that there is one latent and three observed neighbours then there is a pure pair....?

- Why does each variable need a latent parent? It would be nice to generalize the case without latent variables.

- 'All assumptions allow\textbf{s}'

-'It is rather milder'

- Did you normalize the data? I think it should be (I should not make a huge difference but potentially for threshold choices in your algorithm)

3: You are fairly confident in your assessment. It is possible that you did not understand some parts of the submission or that you are unfamiliar with some pieces of related work. Math/other details were not carefully checked.

### Summary
Most of the causal discovery approaches assume sufficiency constraint of the causal factors; this work aims to go beyond that, identifying the latent causal factors and the relation between them and observed features. Resulting in learning a full causal graph with observed and unobserved latent structures.

### Strengths
- The authors do a great job of setting up the motivation and providing an exhaustive list of related works
- The paper attempts to address the important problem in causal discovery

### Weaknesses
- Linear relations: authors make a linearity assumption between latent-latent, latent-observed, and observed-observed features. The linearity assumption between observed-observed features seems very strong 
- Generalised pure pair seems to be a very strong requirement; how do you ensure this is followed in practice? For that matter, how do you test for this?
- Algorithmic description is missing; please provide a detailed description of the algorithm along with the intuition for the steps
- I understand the limited space constraint, but it would be nice to have some details on the experimental setup and the results in the main paper and discuss their implications 
- The proposed method for finding all the generalised pairs is strongly dependent on relations between latent and observational factors being linear, which is not that convincing. It would be nice to see some discussion on relaxing this behaviour or ways to test this behaviour of real datasets
- It would be useful to consider synthetic datasets with known latent nodes and their interactions and compute the standard metrics in causal discovery like SHD, SID 

- Presentation concerns: please introduce all the assumptions before referencing them for easier readability 
- The paper is not self-contained; please consider including a background section briefly describing previous methods which are directly involved in your framework
