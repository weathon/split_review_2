# Memoria: Hebbian Memory Architecture for Human-Like Sequential Processing

- Decision: Reject
- Scores: 8, 6, 6, 6, 5

## Abstract
Transformers have demonstrated their success in various domains and tasks. However, Transformers struggle with long input sequences due to their limited capacity. While one solution is to increase input length, endlessly stretching the length is unrealistic. Furthermore, humans selectively remember and use only relevant information from inputs, unlike Transformers which process all raw data from start to end. We introduce Memoria, a general memory network that applies Hebbian theory which is a major theory explaining human memory formulation to enhance long-term dependencies in neural networks. Memoria stores and retrieves information called engram at multiple memory levels of working memory, short-term memory, and long-term memory, using connection weights that change according to Hebb's rule. Through experiments with popular Transformer-based models like BERT and GPT, we present that Memoria significantly improves the ability to consider long-term dependencies in various tasks. Results show that Memoria outperformed existing methodologies in sorting and language modeling, and long text classification.

### Summary
It is well-understood that the computational requirements of the context window is a major concern for transformer models. This paper introduces a new method, Memoria, that maps reasonably well onto models of human memory that were popular in the 1970s.  There are three stages in Memoria that map roughly onto iconic memory, short-term memory and long-term memory in the classic Atkinson & Shiffrin ``modal model.''  The memory module can be trained largely via Hebbian learning. When transformer models are equipped with this form of memory, they perform better than when they do not.  Results are shown for a sorting task and also for a variety of language corpora.

### Strengths
This is a really interesting and creative approach.  We know a lot about human memory and it is a great idea to incorporate ideas from human memory into language models.

There is a pretty good correspondence to models from human memory.  The connection is actually stronger to later computational models using ideas about short-term store and long-term store.  See especially
https://doi.org/10.1016/S0079-7421(08)60162-0

### Weaknesses
There are no error bars on the results of any of the experiments.  Although this is a poor practice, I think it's unlikely that it's affecting the conclusions. It's pretty convincing that there's a systematic effect of sequence length for the sorting experiment and the differences with the language corpora are pretty modest in any event.

There has been at least some progress in the field of human memory research since the 1970s, when the modal model was at its peak of influence.  It could be valuable to illustrate the properties of the memory component per se.  There are some suggestions along these lines below.

More could be done to isolate the effect of Memoria on long-range dependency per se.  For instance taking corpora permuted at different scales could allow one to establish that Memoria is helping because of long-range dependency.

### Questions
How would humans perform on the sorting task?  I would assume that people do not do nearly as well as the models.  

Presumably the memory component shows a recency effect in the first two components.  Operationally, what is the autocorrelation of each of the modules (activation of the same engrams) during a pass through a connected corpus?   

In human memory there is a very reliable finding referred to as the temporal contiguity effect.  After learning a long sequence of unrelated words, participants tend to sequentially recall words that were presented close together in the list.  If I've understood the paper, Memoria would show this effect, no?  Interestingly the temporal contiguity effect extends across a very wide range of time scales, for instance 
https://doi.org/10.1177/0956797618808474 
The long-range temporal contiguity effect has been taken as evidence against fixed capacity buffer, as is present in Memoria, which is one of the reasons the Atkinson & Shiffrin model is not as influential in cognitive science as it once was.

The observation that the age of retrieved engrams goes up with step (Fig 5) could mean that the model has large history effects.  Is the model curriculum-dependent?

### Summary
This paper introduces Memoria, a novel memory module that improves the ability of Transformers to learn long-term dependencies.
Memoria is inspired by biological intelligence, specifically Hebbian learning and the Multi-Store Memory Model theory developed in psychology.
The memory module is separated to 3 levels: working memory, short-term memory, and long-term memory.
Stored memories are organized into a memory graph with directed weighted edges that connect them to one another.
The weights of the graph are learned via Hebbian learning.
The authors empirically show that Memoria significantly improves the performance of Transformers on tasks that require learning long-term dependencies, and outperforms current methods, including Transformer-XL, Compressive Transformer, and ∞-former.

### Strengths
- The design of Memoria is novel. It takes inspiration from theories in neuroscience and psychology, and categorizes memories into multiple levels, which appear to improve performance. As far as I know, this is the first work to implement a multi-store memory model for transformers.
- Memoria achieves strong empirical performance. The authors compare Memoria to several current methods on 3 datasets, and show that they achieve state-of-the-art results.

### Weaknesses
- Several claims this paper makes regarding Hebbian theory and biological plausibility are inaccurate, or not sufficiently qualified. 
    - Hebbian theory is not a theory of human memorization, as the authors state, but rather a theory for explaining synaptic plasticity, i.e. changes in synaptic strength between neurons.
While we can use Hebbian learning as a learning algorithm to train computation models for associative memory (such as Hopfield Nets), there is insufficient evidence to suggest that such models are an accurate reflection of how the brain store and retrieve memories (in fact, they typically require symmetric weights, which make them biologically-implausible).
   - Similarly, claims like “Hebb’s rule […] explains how humans form memories” and “Memoria replicates the human process of encoding information” are too strong; current neuroscience does not understand biological intelligence well enough to validate such statements.
Ideally, to claim biological plausibility, you should also perform experiments to compare the behavior of your method with that of corresponding biological processes and show agreement.
Alternatively, if bio-plausibility/similarity is not a main selling point for you, it may be easier to just drop those claims, and simply state that your method is inspired by Hebbian learning and memory models developed in psychology.
- The authors compare the performance of Memoria against several previous methods. However, there appears to be a large discrepancy between the performance of those previous methods in the authors’ experiments, versus the experiments of their original papers. This makes it difficult to judge the performance of Memoria in comparison to current methods. I’ll elaborate in the questions section.

### Questions
- An important novel contribution of Memoria to me is the introduction of a 3-level memory model inspired by the Multi-Store Memory Model; this is significantly different from previous approaches. But I’m not sure how each of these stages each contribute to the model’s performance (in other words, is the complexity justified? Can the same results be achieved with a simpler design?). Have you conducted any ablation studies? I think demonstrating how each part of your memory model improves performance would better convince the audience of the necessity of your design, and the importance of your contributions.
- The perplexity and BPC achieved by Transformer-XL, Compressive Transformer, and ∞-former in this paper all differ quite significantly from the results their respective papers claim.
For example, in their original papers, on WikiText-103, Transformer-XL claims to achieve 18.3 perplexity, Compressive Transformer claims 17.1, and ∞-former claims 16.61.
But in the authors experiments, their perplexities are 24.543, 24.794 and 24.685 respectively, which are much higher.
Is this discrepancy mostly attributed to differences in network hyperparameters?
If so, are the hyperparameters you select in your experiments biased to favor Memoria over these other methods in any way?
How would Memoria compare with these methods under the conditions they achieve their published results— would its lead still hold?
- There’s been a lot of research on auto and heteroassociative memory models that employ Hebbian learning, dating back to Hopfield Networks and their heteroassociative counterpart Sparse Distributed Memories. 
Some more recent papers include Krotov et al. (2016), Demircigil et al. (2017), Rae et al. (2018), and Ramsauer et al. (2020), to name a few.
This line of work seem intimately relevant to Memoria, as both aim to use Hebbian learning to train memory models for deep learning.
How does Memoria compare to these approaches, in terms of design, performance, and potential applications?

While I can't accept this paper as-is, I am certainly willing to increase my score if my concerns are addressed.

### Summary
Inspired by Hebbian theory, this paper presents Memoria, a new external memory for Transformer. Memoria employs a general memory network that stores and retrieves information, called "engrams," at multiple memory levels, including working memory, short-term memory, and long-term memory, These engrams are linked via connection weights that change according to Hebb's rule. Memoria retrieves engrams from the short-term memory prioritizing the most correlated ones with those in working memory while collecting engrams from long-term memory using graph search toward the highest value connection edges. Connections of co-retrieved engrams are enhanced while useful engrams's lifespans are increased. The results show that Memoria helps popular Transformer models outperform existing methods in tasks such as sorting, language modelling, and long-text classification.

### Strengths
- The idea is interesting and novel
- The memory is examined with various Transformer backbones

### Weaknesses
- The method is over-complicated with many memory retrieval steps. The authors need to consider the running times and computing resource requirements when comparing their methods and other baselines.
- The baseline set should include more recent memory-augmented Transformers such as  Recurrent Memory Transformer (Bulatov et al., 2022) and Memorizing Transformers (Wu et al., 2022) or long-range modelling techniques (Mehta et al., 2022)

### Summary
The paper proposes to augment transformers with memory module, which is motivated by neuroscience studies. The proposed architecture is evaluated on sorting task, language modelling, and text classification.

### Strengths
The main idea seems to be interesting and the authors nicely motivate it by highlighting similarities with how human process inputs. The empirical results look promising.

### Weaknesses
The main problem when reading this submission is insufficient details on the proposed memory module and intuition on why this specific instantiation of memory is chosen. I have read the paper several times (including the appendices), but I still don’t have a clear understanding of what is actually done in this paper. My main request to the authors is to expand section 3 (possibly in the appendix C) on the mathematical implementation of their architecture so that each operation performed by their memory module is clearly defined in the text. 

The module has 3 components: working memory, short-term memory, long-term memory. It is unclear to me, what kind of information is transferred between these modules and when this transfer occurs. It seems that memory graph plays some role in counting the number of times a given memory has been used, but the precise details of how this graph interacts with other parts of the memory are unclear to me.

*******Post discussion comments*******

Dear Authors, 

thank you for the extensive responses. I have read the revised paper and the discussion with other reviewers. The general idea of augmenting Transformers with a memory is very promising, and is a strong merit of this paper. For me, the main problem is that even after reading the revised paper and the answers to my questions I still find the proposed solution overly complicated. For this reason, I am inclined to keep my original score. If this work gets accepted, I would encourage the authors to find a more intuitive way to present this potentially valuable architecture.

### Questions
Q1. Could the authors please expand section 3 or appendix C with step by step operations that are performed in the memory module both during training and inference? 

Q2. It is unclear to me what is illustrated to Figure 2 (remind process). Could the authors please explain in the text how this is done in their architecture? 

Q3. The only reference to Appendix D seems to be in section 3 “We provided the visualizations of changes of connection in Appendix D to help understand these processes”. It remains unclear to me what these visualizations are, given that there are no any explanations in that Appendix D. 

Q4. It seems that the proposed memory module is very complicated with many operations and sophisticated plasticity rules. Is this complexity all necessary for the performance? I would appreciate seeing some ablation studies, or at least qualitative discussion about which aspects of the proposed architecture are important and which are not. 

Q5. Given the high complexity of the proposed architecture, could the authors please comment on its computational complexity (both theoretical and empirical)? It seems to me that it would be pretty resource demanding to run it?

### Summary
This paper proposes a memory management module, dubbed Memoria, with which transformer sequence models can be augmented. This architecture is loosely inspired by principles from human cognitive neuroscience, and reportedly yields strong performance improvements relative to un-augmented sequence models.

### Strengths
I must preface my review with the caveat that I know very little about high-level cognitive science models for memory, so I cannot assess how the proposed architecture relates to existing computational cognitive science models. That said, the authors demonstrate reasonably clear performance improvements on language modeling tasks. Given the recent interest in improving the ability of transformer models to process long sequences efficiently, this work has the potential to be impactful.

### Weaknesses
My biggest concern regarding the proposed architecture is its computational cost. Unless I've missed something obvious, the authors do not quantify the cost of their method (relative to the previously-proposed extensions to transformer models with which they compare their model's performance), which is a key determinant in whether it can prove useful in machine learning. The cost will in turn depend on the values chosen for Memoria's many hyperparameters, which the authors do not seem to systematically sweep.

### Questions
1. Can the authors state precisely how the computational and memory cost of Memoria scales with its various hyperparameters, and quantify the cost incurred in the performance tests shown?

2. The authors do not justify the hyperparameter choices used in their experiments, nor do they probe how sensitive performance is to those choices. Some exploration of these effects is required. 

3. In Appendix B.2, the authors write "Furthermore, to prevent potential interference with the learning process, we periodically reset all memory in Memoria every 500 steps during training (1500 steps for enwik8 dataset). This was done to avoid referencing memory generated at stages where learning was insufficient, as it could impede the training progress." This procedure is a substantial alteration of the memory architecture described in Section 3, and is not mentioned in the main text. Can the authors quantify how much performance is degraded if this step is not included? This suggests that the proposed architecture is unable to gracefully forget low-quality or corrupted memories, which is a substantial limitation.

4. There are many typos and grammatical errors, which can make parts of the paper harder to parse. I will not give line-by-line comments, but, for instance, the opening sentences of Section 3.3 do not read cleanly. Moreover, the citation to Atkinson and Shiffrin is duplicated, with one instance being corrupted with acknowledgements in the title field. 

5. The authors motivate their memory architecture in terms of interest in Hebbian learning rules, but they do not mention what is perhaps the most impactful memory model based on Hebbian learning: the Hopfield network. For completeness, Hopfield's original work should be cited, along with its recent extensions (Krotov & Hopfield 2016) and relationship to transformer attention (Ramsauer et al., 2020). 

6. It would be useful to include smaller versions of Figures 6 and 7 in the main text.
