# Sparse Labels Node Classification: Unsupervised Learning for Mentoring Supervised Learning in Sparse Label Settings

- Decision: Reject
- Scores: 5, 3, 5, 3

## Abstract
Despite their huge success, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) still require lots of labeled examples (per class) at training time in order to perform well on the Semi-Supervised Node Classification (SSNC) task. This is a major drawback since labels are usually expensive and time-consuming to get. Though several attempts have been made to address this problem, most attempts still require; a significant amount of labeled examples for at least some classes (considered base classes), as well a minimum amount of labels per class (for other classes). In this work, we attempt to alleviate these hard requirements. Our problem thus differs from the traditional SSNC settings in the sense that in this work we try to address the setting in which we only have extremely few labeled nodes seen at training time, and in addition, these labeled nodes are not provided (chosen) on a per-class basis. We name this task Sparse Labels Node Classification (SLNC). To address this problem, we Estimate Label Information (ELI) from a pseudo space by leveraging unsupervised learning techniques. We use this estimated label information to enhance reformulations of well-known semi-supervised learning (SSL) frameworks, as well as guide the labeled nodes selection process for training. We show that our approach outperforms baselines on SLNC by 10-20% when the number of labeled nodes seen at training is extremely few.

### Confidence
4: You are confident in your assessment, but not absolutely certain. It is unlikely, but not impossible, that you did not understand some parts of the submission or that you are unfamiliar with some pieces of related work.

### Summary
This paper introduce a new task Sparse Labels Node Classification (SLNC) in graph learning. Compared to the existing task Semi-Supervised Node Classification (SSNC), only an extremely small portion of the labels are known, and the labels are not distributed equally across classes. The authors propose a new framework by estimating label information. The authors conduct experiments and show their proposed framework achieves performance better than existing approaches.

Post-rebuttal: I have read the rebuttal and would like to keep my scores.

### Strengths
The authors introduce a new task Sparse Labels Node Classification (SLNC) in graph learning and propose an Estimate Label Information (ELI) framework to solve this new task. Empirical results show the efficacy of the proposed approach.

### Weaknesses
While the authors claim that only an extreme small amount of labels are known in the newly proposed setting, it seems that at least a small portion of labels are actively selected---e.g., the first l_H data points are labeled according to the approach proposed in Section 4.2. What would happen if all labels are randomly selected?

The presentations of the paper can be improved. For instance, Algorithm 1 is not written in a clear way---one has to going back and forth between Algorithm 1 and Sections 4.2, 4.3, 4.4.

### Summary
This paper studies the problem of node classification when there is a very limited number of labelled nodes. The authors propose to utilize existing unsupervised method for clustering attributed graphs as a heuristic to estimate the node labels, and then incorporate the estimated node labels into a label propagation procedure in the form of a regularizer in the optimization objective. The authors conduct experiments over several real-world datasets to demonstrate the effectiveness of their method.

### Strengths
- The problem of node classification in the sparse label regime is an interesting problem and can potentially have many practical applications.

### Weaknesses
- Overall, the proposed method is just a very heuristic combination of an existing unsupervised method for clustering attributed graphs and label propagation. Therefore, the novelty of this work is very limited. Moreover, I think that the performance of the proposed method will be heavily affected by the performance of the label estimation step. There is no principled guarantees for the proposed method to work well in general, especially when there are more labels than what the authors considered in the experiments. More on this in the next point. 

- I am not really convinced by the empirical section that the sparse labels setting is important. (The sparse labels setting may be a relevant and important problem for many practical settings, but the empirical section fails to demonstrate that. ) The datasets used in the experiments are standard benchmarks for node classification on graphs. In the standard train/test splits, these datasets already have a very low label rate, ranging from ~1.5% on Computers to ~5% on Cora and CiteSeer. Existing methods already perform very well at this label rate. The authors considered scenarios where there are only 3 to 60 labels in these datasets. This looks like a made-up setting to me. I would recommend the authors find alternative datasets where it is genuinely hard to obtain many ground-truth node labels, and thus we can only have access to a few dozen labels.

- The clarity and writing can be significantly improved. When I read the paper, I often have to read a couple of places twice or three times in order to understand what the authors trying to explain. Let me just give an example. In Section 4.2, the authors wrote "..., nodes in $l_H$ were chosen ...". This is confusing due to previously $l_H$ was defined to be a number, but in this sentence $l_H$ seems to be a set of nodes. I would recommend the authors spend serious effort to polish the writing of this paper.

### Questions
- Based on the description given in Section 4.4, in your experiments, did you simply use $\mathbf{A}_{\mathcal{G}_H}$ as the adjacency matrix of the KNN graph, as opposed to $HH^T$? In that case, is the information in $H$ being used anywhere?

### Summary
This paper proposes an effective graph-based semi-supervised learning approach for sparsely labeled nodes. The proposed approach uses an unsupervised learning approach to compute a pseudo-label distribution and a semi-supervised learning approach to estimate labels. The paper conducted experiments to show the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

### Strengths
- I like the paper's motivation; it is quite a fundamental research problem to improve the accuracy of graph neural networks. 
- This paper is well structured and easy to follow.
- The related works are well presented in the paper.

### Weaknesses
- The proposed approach should be compared to more recent approaches. 
- The parameter setting of the proposed approach is not justified in the paper.
- The theoretical properties of the proposed approach should be discussed in the paper.

### Questions
Why is the proposed approach effective for sparse label node classification? The motivation for the method described in the paper is unclear from the descriptions of the paper.

In the experiment, this paper compared the proposed approach to LP, SGC, DGI, GMI in which GMI is the most recent approach published in 2020. However, the compared approaches are not state-of-the-art. Since graph neural network is one of the popular research topics in machine learning, the proposed approach should be compared to more recent approaches. Could you compare the proposed approach to more recent approaches to show its effectiveness? The proposed approach should be compared to the approaches listed in Section 2. 

As described in Section 4.4, beta_1, beta_2, and beta_3 are set to 1/3 due to the simplicity. However, it is unclear why this parameter setting is recommended in the paper. The proposed approach can handle other parameter settings. Why is this parameter setting recommended in the paper?

The paper should reveal the theoretical property of the proposed approach. As described in Section 4.3, it needs a high computation cost to compute Equation (4) directly. Therefore, the proposed approach approximately computes it using an iterative solution, as shown in Equation (5). I am interested in the theoretical difference between direct and approximate computations. Similarly, the proposed approach approximately computes the adjacency A_GH, as shown in Section 4.4. Please discuss the theoretical properties of the approximate computations.

In addition, I am interested in the theoretical computational cost and empirical processing time of the proposed approach. The proposed approach is more efficient than the previous approaches?

### Summary
This paper focuses on the problem of Sparse Label Node Classification (SLNC). Specifically, the authors first introduce a framework for estimating the label distribution information of nodes on the entire graph, and then select representative nodes for pseudo-labeling. The proposed method is integrated into existing models (SGC, LP) and experiments are conducted on seven datasets to validate its effectiveness.

### Strengths
1. The paper proposes a challenging graph semi-supervised learning scenario, where labels are sparser and more random (some classes may not even have labels at training time).
2. The paper provides relevant code and has a certain degree of credibility.
3. The paper conducts relevant experiments on 7 public benchmark datasets to verify its effectiveness.

### Weaknesses
1. The writing is not standardized, with too many formatting, grammatical, and presentation errors. For example, the tenses in the introduction part of the experiment are not uniform, and symbols are repeatedly used.
2. The solutions to the given field problem are: 1) Capture the label distribution information in the graph, and 2) Pseudo-label the representative nodes. For the former, the paper does not give an explanation based on intuition or related theory but only introduces existing strategies. For the latter, this is a common method in semi-supervised scenarios. At the same time, the introduction to the selection of representative nodes is not clear.
3. The paper proposes a semi-supervised learning scenario under sparse labels, but the experimental part is not clear about the setting of this scenario.
4. As far as I know, there are related works that consider graph learning under limited labels, such as CGPN[1], but this article does not mention and compare
5. In the experiment, the comparison methods are not new enough. The display of experimental results is not intuitive enough, there is no specific data, only charts. Meanwhile, the analysis of the experiment is unclear and there are many complex model names, such as in 5.7. It is recommended to simplify it.

### Questions
1. The paper proposes that the label distribution information in the graph needs to be captured to assist classification. What is the intuition behind this approach? A new filter is introduced in the approach, which can make the large eigenvalues in the Laplacian matrix smaller. Why do we do this? At the same time, how is the parameter k set?
2. The paper proposes that pseudo-labels should be given to representative nodes. Where is the representativeness reflected here?
3. Why is the introduction of related work not divided into chapters? How relevant is it to your question?
4. Regarding the design of LA in Chapter 4.3, it is necessary to maintain at least three N*N adjacency matrices. Will this bring a large amount of calculation and memory usage? Please analyze the complexity of the algorithm.
5. The paper gives a set of experimental hyper-parameters in 5.5.1, such as learning rate, hidden layer size, etc. Does this mean that the settings are the same for each data set?
6. It is recommended that the author compares the method with semi-supervised learning models and advanced methods. Meanwhile, the experimental results need to be clearly presented.
