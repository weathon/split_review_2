- Decision: Reject
- Scores: 8, 5, 6, 5, 5

## Abstract
We tackle the general category discovery problem, which aims to discover novel classes in unlabeled datasets by leveraging the information of known classes. Most previous works transfer knowledge implicitly from known classes to novel ones through shared representation spaces.
However, the implicit nature of knowledge transfer in these methods poses difficulties in controlling the flow of information between known and novel classes. Furthermore, it is susceptible to the label uncertainty of unlabeled data learning.
To overcome these limitations, our work introduces an explicit and adaptive knowledge transfer framework that can facilitate novel class discovery. This framework can be dissected into three primary steps. The initial step entails obtaining representations of known class knowledge. This is achieved through a pre-trained known-class model. The subsequent step is to transform the knowledge representation to enable more targeted knowledge transfer, realized through an adapter layer and a channel selection matrix. The final step is knowledge distillation, where we maximize the mutual information between two representation spaces.
Furthermore, we introduce a challenge benchmark iNat21 which is comprised of three distinct difficulty levels. 
We conduct extensive experiments on various benchmark datasets and the results demonstrate the superiority of our approach over the previous state-of-the-art methods.

### Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of generalized category discovery (GCD). Unlike prior methods that rely on implicit knowledge transfer via shared representation spaces, this work introduces a framework for explicit and adaptive knowledge transfer to facilitate the discovery of novel classes. The proposed method consists of three main steps: (1) capturing known class knowledge through a pre-trained model, (2) transforming this knowledge via an adapter layer and a channel selection matrix for more effective transfer, and (3) employing knowledge distillation to maximize mutual information between representation spaces. It also presents a new benchmark, iNat21, designed with varying levels of difficulty to assess GCD methods.

### Strengths
1- It introduces an innovative solution to the complex issue of generalized category discovery (GCD)

2- The paper is articulate and well-structured, providing clear explanations for the motivations behind the approach and the intricacies of the loss functions used.

3-The literature review is exhaustive, offering a thorough overview of related work in the area.

4- Ablation studies and experiments are rigorously conducted, encompassing a broad spectrum of the method's components, which solidifies the validity of the research.

5-The introduction of the iNat21 benchmark is a valuable asset that will likely drive and shape future research in GCD.

### Weaknesses
A potential weakness of the paper could be the use of ReLU activations, which are known for their "dead neuron" issue, potentially leading to some neurons becoming inactive due to poor initialization. This characteristic of ReLU could result in the unintentional filtering out of certain channels that might otherwise be useful for learning a more robust embedding space.

### Questions
1-How would the model's performance be impacted if activation functions other than ReLU, such as GeLU, were utilized?

2-Regarding Figure 2, is the 'Cls' in the lower branch designed exclusively for labeled samples? Additionally, in the upper branch, what mechanism allows the model to generate categories for the unknown classes after the classification step?

### Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of generalized category discovery, which involves the identification of novel classes in unlabeled data by leveraging information from known classes. Existing methods typically employ a shared encoder to transfer information between labeled and unlabeled data. In contrast, this paper presents a novel framework for explicit knowledge distillation, ensuring effective knowledge transfer from labeled to unlabeled data. The framework incorporates an adaptive layer, a channel-wise selection matrix, and a naive mutual information loss. Additionally, the paper introduces a benchmark dataset called iNat21, along with several data split schemes that consider the semantic gap between labeled and unlabeled data. Experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed method compared to existing state-of-the-art approaches.

### Strengths
(1) This method demonstrates consistent effectiveness across multiple datasets and split schemes, surpassing the performance of previous state-of-the-art approaches.

(2) The main contribution of this work is the introduction of a channel-wise selection matrix, which plays a crucial role in facilitating effective knowledge distillation.

(3) Furthermore, the proposed framework incorporates a naive Mutual Information loss, which is compatible with various formats such as InfoNCE loss, MSE loss, and KL divergence. This compatibility enhances the flexibility and applicability of the framework in different scenarios.

### Weaknesses
(1) Some experiments and tables in this paper lack explanation and details. For example:
a) The "BL" and "Clu" settings in Table 1 require further clarification.
b) The specification of the baseline model used in the ablation study needs to be provided.
c) Implementation details of crNCD are missing.

(2) The key idea of knowledge distillation under the NCD setting has been explored in the literature, for example [1, 2], while discussion and analysis are missing.

(3) The paper lacks an explanation of how the naive Mutual Information loss is derived in the format of InfoNCE from the objective of mutual information.

(4) Herbarium is also a commonly used dataset to evaluate the performance of GCD. However, this is missing in the experiments.

### Questions
(1) The paper mentions training the model for 20 epochs on labeled data in the first stage, but it lacks an explanation for choosing this specific number. It would be beneficial to provide a rationale for selecting 20 epochs and elaborate on how this choice impacts the results.

(2) In the ablation study concerning the adapter layer, each layer is composed of a linear layer and a ReLU layer. It would be helpful to include an experiment using only one ReLU layer to assess the impact of this specific component.

(3) Table 4 exclusively utilizes fine-grained datasets. To provide a more comprehensive evaluation of the proposed method, it would be also important to analyze each component on a coarse-grained dataset.

(4) Previous work [3] suggests that supervised knowledge is beneficial for the task of NCD when the semantics of labeled and unlabeled data are similar. However, this paper demonstrates that even under a data split where the semantic gap between labeled and unlabeled data is significant, knowledge from a fixed labeled encoder remains helpful. It would be helpful to demonstrate how labeled knowledge transfers to unlabeled data across different scales of semantic differences.

(5) The paper mentions the usage of techniques such as dynamic conception generation [4] and cluster size regularization [5]. Analyzing the effects of these techniques would further reveal contributions to the overall performance of the proposed method.

### Summary
This paper presents a unique adaptive knowledge transfer framework designed for generalized category discovery, aiming to create a clear connection for knowledge transfer between known and novel classes. The framework is divided into three main components: knowledge generation using a model trained on known class data, knowledge alignment with an adapter layer and a channel selection matrix for more precise knowledge transfer, and knowledge distillation to maximize mutual information between two representation spaces. 

Extensive evaluations demonstrate the superiority of this approach over existing methods, and the framework provides a new perspective for advancing knowledge transfer in generalized category discovery, showing great potential to address the challenge of transferring knowledge from known to novel classes effectively.

### Strengths
1. This paper introduces a novel framework, meticulously deconstructing the GCD task into three pivotal stages: knowledge generation, knowledge alignment, and knowledge distillation. This explicit dissection embeds a layer of human prior knowledge into the design of the network architecture, showcasing an innovative and finely crafted approach.
2. The results across the majority of datasets indicate that the method achieves state-of-the-art performance.

### Weaknesses
The ablation study section on the Adapter Layer (AL) contains several perplexing aspects that raise questions about the method's efficacy, generalizability, and the readability of the paper.

1. In Table 4, the inclusion of AL appears to result in a performance decline on the Scars benchmark, yet the authors provide no explanation for this, which makes me question the generalizability of the method.

2. In Table 5, the distinction between AL and ours seems to be inadequately clarified, rendering this part somewhat hard to follow.

### Questions
As noted in the Weakness, I wonder why there is a observed decline in results on the Scars dataset following the incorporation of the Adapter Layer (AL). Is this reduction in performance linked to specific characteristics of the dataset itself, or are there elements of the method that may not be as effective when applied to Scars? I am looking forward to the authors' elucidation on this matter.

Additionally, I would like the authors to clarify the distinctions between the rows for AL and ours in Table 5, with a particular emphasis on the columns where the values are 0.

### Summary
This paper tackles the generalized category discovery problem. Three steps are proposed to improve the performance. The first step is to learn a pre-trained model with known classes. Then an adapter layer and a channel selection matrix are further learned for knowledge transfer. The last step is to use knowledge distillation. The experiments are conducted on conventional benchmarks and a new benchmark with different difficulty levels.

### Strengths
(1) It is clearly written and easy to follow.
(2) Table 1 and Figure 1 show clear motivation for the proposed ideas.
(3) The experimental section is comprehensive and the performance gain is significant in some cases.

### Weaknesses
(1) The proposed techniques are well-known in the field and I have the feeling that they are not specifically designed for the GCD problem.
(2) The channel selection seems too simple, I am wondering if there are more sophisticated options.
(3) The experimental results on some datasets are much better than the others but worse on CUB, It would be good to discuss the possible reasons why this is happening.

### Questions
The contrastive loss used in the paper is quite common and it would be good to further discuss the novelty of the method.

### Summary
This paper targets the task of generalized class discovery (GCD), and argues that the explicit knowledge transfer is a necessity that is largely ignored by existing works. To this end, the authors propose to achieve this goal with three steps: 1) knowledge generation, 2) knowledge alignment and 3) knowledge distillation, which are implemented in a two-stage training procedure. The authors conduct extensive experimental evaluations, which demonstrate that the proposed method largely outperforms existing works.

### Strengths
- The paper is well organized and clearly written. 
- The experiments on six existing benchmarks and a newly introduced iNat21 are extensive.
- The experimental results showcase the superiority of the proposed method.

### Weaknesses
- I believe the idea of knowledge utilization is good, but the proposed terms seem a bit of "big" to me. Technically speaking, knowledge generation, alignment and distillation are respectively training on labeled data, filtering out the important feature dimensions and applying contrastive loss. If there is no obvious significance, I would suggest using more focused terms that better convey the precise purpose.

- As far as I am concerned, the most important component is regarding the "knowledge distillation" (as shown in Tab. 4), where an InfoNCE-like loss is used to do the trick. Within this loss, the MixUp-based negative sample generation seems an important ingredient, yet with no proper ablation studies. Given the potential similarity between the proposed generation procedure and the ones used in [a,b], the authors should provide more theoretical and empirical insights on the difference and significance.

### Questions
In Fig. 6, does the visualizations mean that there are more channels transferred in generic datasets like ImageNet, yet less channels transferred in fine-grained datasets?
