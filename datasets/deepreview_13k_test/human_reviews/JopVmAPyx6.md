- Decision: Reject
- Scores: 5, 5, 5, 3

## Abstract
In-context learning, i.e., learning from in-context samples, is an impressive ability of Transformer. However, the exact mechanism behind this learning process remains unclear. In this study, we aim to explore this aspect from a relatively unexplored perspective of representation learning. In the context of in-context learning scenarios, the representation becomes more complex as it can be influenced by both model weights and in-context samples. We refer to these two conceptual aspects of representation as the in-weight component and the in-context component, respectively. To examine the impact of these two components on in-context learning capabilities, we create a novel synthetic task, which allows us to develop two probes - the in-weights probe and the in-context probe - to evaluate the respective components. Our findings reveal that the quality of the in-context component is closely related to in-context learning performance, signifying the connection between in-context learning and representation learning. Additionally, we discover that a well-developed in-weights component can positively affect the learning of the in-context component, suggesting that in-weights learning should serve as the foundation for in-context learning. To gain a deeper understanding of the in-context learning mechanism and the importance of the in-weights component, we demonstrate through construction that a simple Transformer, using pattern matching and a copy-paste mechanism for in-context learning, can achieve comparable performance to a more complex, best-tuned Transformer under the assumption of a perfect in-weights component. Overall, our discoveries from the perspective of representation learning provide valuable insights into new approaches for enhancing in-context capacity.

### Summary
This paper sets out to shed further light on the in-context learning abilities of transformers. The paper studies. The authors consider a synthetic pattern-matching tasks called Shapes3D, in which the transformer is tasked with predicting the value of a certain factor that changes in images of 3D shapes (e.g. shape, color, background, etc.). The task can be learned by in-context examples of images of shapes and the corresponding value of the relevant factor (which is unknown). The authors attempt to distinguish between what is learned through the in-context component and what is learned through the in-weights component by analyzing the predictive power of their respective representations. The authors find that they play complementary roles and correlations are elucidated that reveal what is necessary for strong in-context learning capabilities.

### Strengths
- The paper studies an important problem. Understanding what is important to achieve in-context learning is quite clearly a very important topic that can have critical downstream applications in understanding and improving the robustness of models such as language models.
- The paper is presented fairly clearly, but there are some things that I would suggest listed below.
- The concepts that the paper attempts to elucidate are fairly new to my knowledge, compared to prior work and the methodology of looking at representations potentially analyzes concepts that were previously not analyzed, which I greatly appreciate. This approach to probing could be  a useful technique to study in-context learning (although probing itself is not new).
- The theory is useful to have a construction that achieves the desired results. However, it is limited to linear attention, but I think this is fine given the precedents.

### Weaknesses
Despite these strengths, I have some reservations about the inferences that can be drawn from the study. 

- A fundamental (somewhat unstated) assumption is that the in-context comp and in-weights comp are decomposed via this probing analysis and thus we can see the impact of both of them. However, the in-context component is clearly also impacted by concepts learned in the weights. It also already seems obvious that one would need to be able to achieve a high in-context comp score in order to achieve high in-context accuracy. For example, I fail to see what we learn regarding the second major claim ‘in-weights comp plays a crucial role in learning the in-context comp’. I am confused about (1) why this is surprising (2) if it is surprising, which of the experiments justifies this. I could see 6A potentially supporting this, but there are other factors at play. In 5, one trains from scratch so clearly there is some ‘warm up’ that is needed to get in-context learning ability.
- One of the other fundamental pieces of the results is training on D_fix and then evaluating on D_rnd or some variation of this. I am concerned that the conclusions that are drawn from these experiments are not necessarily results of in-context learning properties but are just generally issues related to distribution shift. After all, the transformer is not trained on D_rnd. The trend of the results is the following: when we use D_rnd in training, the results get better when evaluating on D_rnd (Fig 5, 6). Is this somehow unexpected?
- Given this, perhaps the most surprising result is that the in-weights scores on 5A with D_rnd are poor and 6A does not improve to what is achievable training full on D_rnd, but only the in-context score improves. I’m not sure what to make of this though. For instance, this could be explained by saying that it just may not be important to form a representation that is predictive of the factor values without the context for this particular task since the task can be inferred from the context. Perhaps the authors can shed some light on that.

### Questions
In addition to some questions, I also suggest some minor changes that I think would improve the paper.


- It would be helpful to more formally define the in-context and in-weights components earlier in the paper. Throughout the intro and early parts, it is clear what th paper wants to do, but it’s difficult to discern what quantifiably one wants to measure since ‘in-weights components’ and ‘in-context components’ are sort of nebulous terms until one reaches section 2.3. Honestly, I don’t know the best way of presenting it, but I just want to raise this as a potential issue for future readers in case the authors have alternatives.
- when you compute the in-context comp score, are you using the very last element of the sequence at L?
- when producing the probes, are you doing a train and test split and are we looking at the test accuracy. How is this split being done? Are we looking at the test score when we look at the plots?
- FYI I don’t think E is defined before being used in Section 2.3.
- Fig 6A should be D_fix->rnd not D_rnd->fix I think.
- Fig 6A why is it D_rnd^fix => D_fix and not D_rnd^fix => D_rnd? Isn’t it more relevant to understand the in-context score on D_rnd?
- In, D_rnd^fix, do you use twice the amount of data as D_rnd? That is, does each epoch contain twice the data or are they both halved so the total is the same?
- I don’t really understand the last paragraph that starts with “Comparison with previous work in analyzing the in-context learning mechanism.”
- It would be helpful to compare 6A directly with 5B since they are plotting the same kind of results. It seems that in both you get good performance starting at roughly the same epochs. This I think supports my question about how much of this is just attributed to distribution shift: once you start training on the same data as you test on, performance improves.
- Some typos: “copy-past” “fead forward” “How transformer solve this problem?” “analysis is to analysis”

### Summary
This paper investigates the effects of in-weight and in-context components on In-Context Learning (ICL) capacity. The authors conduct a series of experiments demonstrating the significant role of the in-context component in the success of ICL. They also show that a well-trained in-weight component enhances the learning of a high-quality in-context component. Remarkably, the authors establish that, with an optimally pre-trained in-weight component, it is possible to construct additional Transformer layers (three in total) to effectively learn the in-context component. This yields performance on par with certain pre-trained Transformer models.

### Strengths
1.  The authors adopt an approach to evaluate the implicit in-context and in-weight components by employing probes. This is a significant departure from direct parameter analysis, which is challenging since in-weight and in-context parameters are tightly integrated. They develop a scoring system for the in-context and in-weight components, a novel and logical idea.

2. The paper is well-structured, and the authors provide numerous relevant experiments followed by comprehensive discussions.

3. The paper not only empirically demonstrates the impact of the in-context and in-weight components on ICL capacity but also provides theoretical evidence proving the existence of construction that can perform in-context learning using three additional Transformer layers, given perfectly pre-trained in-weight component. This claim is further validated through experimental evaluation.

### Weaknesses
1. There are areas in the manuscript that require attention, such as citation error in Section 2.2.

2. The data settings $D_\text{rnd}$ and $D_\text{fix}$ used in the experiments do not sufficiently capture the separate impacts of in-context and in-weight components.

    - $D_\text{rnd}$ seems to still take the in-weight component into consideration, given its nature as a statistical classification problem.
    - $D_\text{fix}$, on the other hand, seems to be more aligned with in-weight learning. However, it does not fully represent the in-weight component implicit in the original dataset. Given that in-context learning involves numerous classification tasks with shared inputs but varying labels, a more holistic approach considering all these tasks is necessary to capture the complete in-weight component.
3. The probe methodology requires further clarification. There is a lack of clarity regarding from which layer features are drawn and how the choice of layer affects the results. It is possible that some layers dominantly contain in-context components, while others are richer in in-weight components. Additionally, the rationale behind training each classifier for only one epoch, as opposed to ensuring thorough and adequate training, is not explained.

### Questions
1. Could the authors provide more details on the implementation of the probe methods, as mentioned in the Weaknesses section of this review?

2. In Section 2.3, the statement "we disable the attention layer in the Transformer" is made. Could the authors detailed on this?

### Summary
In this paper, the authors explain in-context learning in Transformers. They break down learning into two components: in-context and in-weight and introduce two probes to investigate these components. The in-context probe measures how well the model predicts the correct factor in a task sequence, while the in-weight probe assesses how well the model learns the overall task. To investigate this empirically, they use a synthetic dataset where an image of a 3D shape is given, and the model predicts one of six factors.  They evaluate the effectiveness of probes by look at its predictions on model trained on four different dataset variations. They find that (1) the in-weight component is effective with a fixed mapping between factor values and labels; (2) The in-context component is effective with randomly shuffled mappings, and in-context learning from random mappings generalizes to fixed mappings; (3) Switching from fixed to random mappings accelerates in-context learning; (4) Training on a mix of fixed and random mappings is more effective than training on each individually. Overall, the authors observe a strong correlation between the in-context component and  in-context learning performance and also that in-weight component influences in-context learning but is not sufficient. Furthermore, they show that a  constructed Transformer model with perfect in-weight component matches the performance of a trained GPT2 model, highlighting the importance of the in-weight component for in-context learning. Lastly, they suggest that two-mechanisms used by the constructed transformer - pattern matching and copy-paste - might be the mechanisms underlying in-context learning in larger models, such as Large Language Models (LLMs).

### Strengths
- the paper is addressing a relevant topic and ICLR is an appropriate for the submission
- the approach of probing in-context and in-weights representation is definitely an interesting and the authors take a look at it from representation learning perspective unlike previous who have looked into from data-distributional perspective (Chan et al. 2022) and casting it as gradient-based learning problem (von Oswald et al. 2022).
- details of task, the model and the experimental setup is quite clearly laid out. For most results, the hypotheses were mentioned along with the intuition before presenting the results which made following the results quite straight forward.
- although the organisation of the text is a bit unconventional, the authors managed to successfully get across the main points pretty well. apart from a few minor typos the figures also manage to convey the results quite well.

### Weaknesses
- given how the different experiments and probes are set-up, the results look a bit obvious to me.  For example, `D_fix` → `D_rand` results was quite trivial as during training time the model never saw such tasks. It would be interesting to understand within the same framework under what conditions does in-context learning does not emerge. Are there cases where in-weight learning interferes with in-context learning and vice-versa? For example, what if you overtrain on `D_fix`/ `D_rand` or under/over parameterise the model? what would your prediction be for this case?
- one of the strengths of the task is that it requires  the model to do both in-context and in-weight learning to do well. Have the authors investigated the phenomenon in purely language setting where this is also a requirement?

### Questions
- what is the loss function? is it `cross-entropy loss`?
- the proof by construction was a bit convoluted to understand, quite a few notations where missing or unclear. atm, I am unsure if I fully understand it. Perhaps this was because of the lack of space or written a bit at the end but I would be happy to go through it again if expanded with intuitions.

### Summary
This study investigates how Transformers learn from in-context examples, a process still not fully understood. It explores this phenomenon through representation learning, considering both model weights and in-context samples. The findings show a strong link between the quality of in-context representations and learning performance. A well-developed in-weights component enhances in-context learning, suggesting it should be foundational. Besides, a simple Transformer, using pattern matching and copy-paste for in-context learning, matches complex models assuming perfect in-weights. These insights offer new perspectives for enhancing in-context learning abilities.

### Strengths
- The research topic is realistic and important. In-context learning has attracted lots of attention from the research community. It is significant to understand its inherent mechanism for the development of more advanced techniques. 
- The provided perspective that analyzes in-context learning is interesting and may inspire follow-up research.

### Weaknesses
- Technical contributions of this paper are limited. 
- The writing should be polished further. For the current form, there is a series of unclear explanations, descriptions, and justifications. 

More details and concerns can be checked in "Questions".

### Questions
- This paper claims that it attempts to understand in-context learning from representations. However, throughout this paper, there is no clear definition of the representation in in-context learning. 
- How to understand "a good in-weight component" in Section 1.1. Could the paper provide more details? This is hard to understand from the current descriptions. 
- I am confused about the approximation that uses a very simple network to estimate the large language models (LLMs). This is a bit incredible. If the approximation can be so good with respect to performance, why do we still increase the scale of LLMs? Would the approximation bring some disadvantages?
- Could the paper provide representative examples of the data of NLP not just images (c.f., Figure 2)?
- In this paper, $i=40$ and $j=0$. I am confused about the determination of such values. 
- At the beginning of this paper, it claims PCA is employed. However, after checking the paper, the technical details and importance of PCA are not clearly stated. 
- Could the paper supplement some intuitive explanations about Definition 2 for better understanding? 
- The limitation of this paper (which is also stated in Section 4) is worrying. Perhaps, due to the issue, the obtained conclusion is not general. 
- This paper looks like it was submitted in a hurry. There are many typos in the current form. For example,   
(1) It should use upper and lower quotation marks but not all lower quotation marks.   
(2) On the citation of the Adam optimizer.   
(3) In-weights comp. but not in-weights comp.  
(4) There should be a blank space between descent and (von Oswald et al., 2022). Similar, between Transformer and (Vaswani et al., 2017), between this sequence and According, and between semantic” and i.e..   
Please check them carefully for better representations. 

Due to the above concerns, before rebuttal, I am negative for the current form of this paper. I am glad to hear responses from authors and comments from other reviewers, and increase my score accordingly.
