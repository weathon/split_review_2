## Abstract
We study the problem of computing an $(m\epsilon, \delta)$-differentially private majority of $K$ $(\epsilon, \Delta)$-differentially private algorithms for $m < K$ and $\delta \geq \Delta \geq 0$. Standard methods, such as subsampling or randomized response, are widely used but do they provide optimal privacy-utility tradeoffs? Surprisingly, we show that an $(m\epsilon, \delta)$-private majority algorithm with maximal utility can be computed tractably for any $m < K$. Specifically, we introduce Data-dependent Randomized Response Majority (DaRRM), a general privacy framework characterized by a data-dependent noise function $\gamma$ that allows for efficient utility optimization over the class of all private algorithms subject to privacy constraints. By deriving a structural understanding of DaRRM, our novel learning approach is made tractable by critically reducing infinitely many privacy constraints into a polynomial set. Theoretically, we show DaRRM enjoys a privacy gain of a factor of 2 over common baselines under i.i.d. teachers and $\delta = 0$. Lastly, we demonstrate the empirical effectiveness of our first-of-its-kind privacy-constrained utility optimization for ensembling labels and gradients from private teachers through applications of private semi-supervised knowledge transfer and private distributed Sign-SGD, highlighting the outstanding performance of our DaRRM framework with an optimized $\gamma$ against several baselines.

### Summary
This paper studies how differentially private is the majority vote of K (epsilon,delta)-DP classifiers.

### Strengths
The paper studies the interesting question of reducing the cost of majority voting in terms of privacy budget, in particular, a very naive approach would say that $K$ classifiers are computed, and hence we can say (by the post-processing property) the majority vote is $(K\epsilon,\delta)$-DP.  The paper studies the interesting question whether we can have a noisy majority vote which is $m\epsilon$-DP with $m<K$.

### Weaknesses
While the problem studied is interesting, the text is insufficiently rigorous.

The main idea of the text is mostly clear, but sometimes overloading of notations and other elements lead to confusion.  For example:
* In Algorithm 1 line 4, $\gamma$ is a real number
* In Eq (1), $\gamma$ is a function $\gamma:\mathbb{N}\to \{0,1\}$
* In Lemma 3.2, $\gamma$ is a function taking as input $S\in\{0,1\}^K$
* In Theorem 4.1, $\gamma$ is a function $\gamma:\mathbb{N}\to\{0,1\}$
* In Eq (3), $\gamma$ is a tuple of $(K+1)/2$ (not $K$) real numbers (not booleans), i.e., $\gamma\in[0,1]^{(K+1)/2}$

While the $\gamma$ confusion is not very harmful, some issues are more problematic, e.g., the formulation of Theorem 4.1:
* Theorem 4.1 says: "Consider Problem 1.1 when $p_i = p$, ..." but Problem 1.1 does not feature a variable $p_i$, $p_i^\prime$,
* Theorem 4.1 says: "Given a privacy budget $m \in [K]$", but usually $\epsilon$ is called a privacy budget and $\epsilon$ is rarely restricted to be an integer.  Is $m$ really to be interpreted as a privacy budget?  In fact, according to Algorithm 1, $m\epsilon$ (not just m) is the "target privacy cost".
* Theorem 4.1 says "Given a privacy budget $m$, if one sets $\gamma(l) = ...$ when $m\ge (K+1)/2$".  The sentence seems ill-structured, I suppose you mean "if" rather than "when", and it becomes easier to break the sentence down into smaller parts, i.e., "Let $m\in[K]$.  If $m\ge (K+1)/2" then set $\gamma(l) = ...$, else ....".
* Theorem 4.1 mentions $\gamma$, which does not occur in Problem 1.1, while Problem 1.1 mentions the majority function g not used in Theorem 4.1.

Other notation and related issues:
* Lemma 3.1 says $\gamma_{subsampling}$ depends on $\mathcal{L}$ and next defines $\gamma_{subsampling(l)$ rather than $\gamma_{subsampling}(\mathcal{L})$.
* Eq 1 defines both $\gamma$ and $\gamma_{subsampling}$.  What is the difference in meaning between the two notations?
* In Lemma 3.3, what are $\mathcal{D}$ and $\mathcal{D}'$ ?  Are these arbitrary datasets, or do you assume they are adjacent datasets?
* In Lemma 3.3, $\gamma$ is required to be a "symmetric function".  What does this mean exactly?  I guess that the meaning of "symmetric" depends on the signature of $\gamma$, for example, if $\gamma$ is a function of a single variable, we could call a function for which $\gamma(l)=\gamma(K-l)$ symmetric.  If $\gamma$ is a function of tuples $S$, then we could call $\gamma$ symmetric if it is invariant under permuting $S$.

There are a few minor language issues, e.g.,
* Title of Section 5: "Optimizing $\gamma$-function" -> "Optimizing the function $\gamma$"
* Section 5: "On the other hand, one can to optimize for such $\gamma^*$ but this involves solving “Semi-infinite Programming”, due to the infinitely many privacy constraints.":  Especially the first part of the sentence doesn't make sense grammatically.  Also, you probably mean 'solving a semi-infinite programming problem' rather than 'solving "semi-infinite programming"'.  

Some claims are too optimistic.  For example, Lemma 3.3 says " ... is $(m\epsilon, \delta)$-differentially private if and only if ...".  There doesn't seem to be a proof (in particular, Appendix B is about preliminaries while appendix C is already about Section 4).  I doubt a proof can exist for this statement, since under the provided conditions DaRRM_\gamma could be $(m\epsilon,\delta$-DP even if Eq (2) is not satisfied, for example if the individual mechanisms $M_i$ are $\epsilon'$-DP for some $\epsilon' < \epsilon$, or if the mechanisms $M_i$ satisfy other favorable conditions.  So while I believe one can prove "if", I don't believe one can also prove "and only if".

Similar issues arise in the appendices, which provide a number of proofs but with insufficient rigor to easily determine what is the exact claim nor to easily verify them.

### Summary
The paper studies an intriguing question: If we have K $(\epsilon, \delta)$-DP mechanisms, can we release their majority vote with a privacy guarantee that's better than $(K\epsilon, K\delta)$-DP? This paper focuses on the binary voting scenario, and presents a data-dependent randomized response mechanism where the probability of releasing the true majority vote is based on the count of the actually majority vote. To maximize the utility, the paper identifies the worst-case distribution pair and reduces the problem into a constraint optimization problem which can be solved in acceptable runtime.

### Strengths
This work identifies a very interesting problem. Releasing the majority voting for an ensemble of DP mechanisms is a very good extension for the well-known private selection problem (release the index of the maximum among an ensemble of DP mechanisms. 

The formulation of a semi-infinite program for maximizing the utility sounds a very interesting technique, and the author shows it's practical through Gurobi.

### Weaknesses
The writing of the paper can be improved. For example:
- in the last line of Problem 1.1, $S_i$ does not need $(D)$. 
- line 6 of Algorithm 1 should be $S_i$ instead of $M_i$.
- Lemma 3.2: have you defined $f$?
- Lemma 3.3: there is another $f$. 

I am quite worried about the experiment. For Figure 3, could you plot privacy-utility tradeoff instead? (i.e., change the x-axis from communication rounds to $\epsilon$). The same thing also applies to Table 1. For DP experiments, the comparison is only fair when the $\epsilon$ of different techniques are aligned to be the same. 

What is the dimension of the gradient? And how is the privacy parameter for releasing a single dimension being composed? For sign-sgd experiment, the total number of composition is gradient dimension x number of rounds, which seems to be very very large and I am not sure what's the final privacy parameter. 

Also, it seems the author assumes each client trains DP models, but for PATE each teacher does not need to be trained differentially private. Therefore, I am not sure whether the comparison in the experiment is fair given that each teacher is already DP but still adds the same noise as what is stated in PATE. Can the author provide a comparison with the original version of PATE for both experiments in Section 6.2 and 6.3?

### Questions
Is it possible to extend the proposed framework to a multi-class setting? (this does not affect the score given the technical contribution of the paper is rich enough, but I am curious about authors' opinion)

Could you provide some intuition for Theorem 4.1? Especially why when $m > K/2$ the privacy improvement seems to be automatically applied?

### Summary
This paper focuses on the problem of exploring the optimal utility of an (m\epsilon,\delta)-DP mechanism to compute the majority function under mild conditions. In this paper, the authors proposed the Data-dependent Randomized Response Majority (DaRRM) framework that approaches the problem of interest by improving the classical Randomized Response (RR) mechanism on the subsampling probability. The authors provides theoretical guarantees and compare the mechanism to the baselines empirically.

### Strengths
1. The paper is sound in theory and supported by empirical comparison with the state-of-art benchmarks.

2. The paper is well organized and written, and lays out its contributions clearly.

3. Empirical results in the paper showed that the proposed DaRRM framework outperforms the state-of-art benchmarks for different tasks.

### Weaknesses
Although the authors proposed the optimization procedure to tackle the problem of designing $\gamma$ in general DP setting, it is in general computationally intractable to optimize a set of $O(K^7)$ constraints in the $(\epsilon,\delta)$-DP setting.

### Questions
How will different priors of $p_i$ affect the result both theoretically and computationally? Have the authors try any experiments without assuming uniform distribution?

### Summary
Authors show that a private majority algorithm with maximal utility can be computed tractably under certain assumptions. They introduce a privacy framework characterized by a data-dependent noise function  called "Data-dependent Randomized Response Majority" (DaRRM) that allows for efficient utility optimization  subject to privacy constraints. Considerable theoretical results and some empirical evidence is presented.

### Strengths
The proposed framework called "Data-dependent Randomized Response Majority" (DaRRM) is interesting and innovative. There seems to be some significant breakthroughs arising from this framework. Designing the tuning parameter $\gamma$ with provable privacy amplification, and optimization for $\gamma$ are important developments as well. 

Significant theoretical details have been established (although I dd not check the proof in details). The reported results from the experiments are plausible and seem reasonable.

### Weaknesses
The writing is dense in some parts. The technical assumptions and the mathematical details are not clearly stated in the main paper (although they can presumably be found in the supplementary materials), and hence the various theoretical results referring to Problem~1.1 lack adequate discussion and contextualization.

### Questions
While realizing that there is limited space, I would request authors to discuss the main technical assumptions they need for their theoretical results. This looks like a very solid work otherwise.
