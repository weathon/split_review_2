# LayerNAS: Neural Architecture Search in Polynomial Complexity

- Decision: Reject
- Scores: 5, 8, 5, 5

## Abstract
Neural Architecture Search (NAS) has become a popular method for discovering effective model architectures, especially for target hardware. As such, NAS methods that find optimal architectures under constraints are essential. In our paper, we propose LayerNAS to address the challenge of multi-objective NAS by transforming it into a combinatorial optimization problem, which effectively constrains the search complexity to be polynomial. 

For a model architecture with $L$ layers, we perform layerwise-search for each layer, selecting from a set of search options $\mathbb{S}$. LayerNAS groups model candidates based on one objective, such as model size or latency, and searches for the optimal model based on another objective, thereby splitting the cost and reward elements of the search. This approach limits the search complexity to $ O(H \cdot |\mathbb{S}| \cdot L) $, where $H$ is a constant set in LayerNAS.
Our experiments show that LayerNAS is able to consistently discover superior models across a variety of search spaces in comparison to strong baselines, including search spaces derived from NATS-Bench, MobileNetV2 and MobileNetV3.

### Confidence
4: You are confident in your assessment, but not absolutely certain. It is unlikely, but not impossible, that you did not understand some parts of the submission or that you are unfamiliar with some pieces of related work.

### Summary
This paper proposes a novel progressive search method and decouples the search constraints from the optimization objective in order to reduce the search space.

### Strengths
1. The proposed method provides a new idea for progressive architecture search strategies.
2. Extensive empirical experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of LayerNAS.

### Weaknesses
1. Figure 2 is somewhat confusing and seems to have little relevance to the description of Algorithm 1. It would help the reader to understand the details of the algorithm if the authors could give a concrete example of a LayerNAS that contains specific hyperparameters
2. Assumption 4.1 is too strong. This strategy means that a large number of candidate architectures will be ignored. It is promising in terms of experimental performance. However, the authors do not give some theoretical or other analysis to justify their hypothesis.
3. I'm not sure if most of the search space meets the assumptions of the proposed approach. If not, a specific transformation of the search space is necessary to satisfy the assumptions of the search algorithm, however the transformation may be very complex. This makes me concerned about the ease of use and generalizability of the algorithm.

### Questions
In the experimental part, the analysis for the hyperparameter $H$ is missing. I am curious how the performance changes when $H$ is greater than 100.

### Summary
This paper propose a simple method to break down the neural architecture search approach into a layer-wise one. Specifically, for a search space of L-layer network, it only searchs for one layer at each training iteration instead of all layers. Experiments are conducted on MobileNetV2, MobileNet-V3, NASBench101 and NATS-Bench spaces.

### Strengths
The paper is well-written and easy to follow. The authors provide clear explanations and examples throughout the paper.

Breaking down the search problem into a Combinatorial Optimization problem seems novel and interesting, and reducing the search cost to polynomial time, which is clearly a breakthrough to the research community.

LayerNAS can be applied to operation, topology and multi-objective NAS search

Results on ImageNet seems to surpass state-of-the-art methods by a clear margin, evidencing their effectiveness of LayerNAS.

### Weaknesses
I do not particular have a question, this paper seems to be easy enough to follow.

### Summary
This papers shows layerwise NAS approach to search a neural architecture layer by layer under computational constraints.

### Strengths
1. They propose a new layerwise NAS approach for search neural architecture under constraints. 
2. LayerNAS can find out some interesting architectures that outperform the previous NAS algorithms.

### Weaknesses
1. What does the improvement of LayerNAS networks over other networks actually come from is uncertain. As mentioned in the end of Sec. 5.1, the architecture mechanisms of the searched networks in this work and other networks are not the same: for example, the authors used SE and Swish while others did not. These details including the undisclosed training strategy (like the learning, weight decay, data augmentation) might largely affect the accuracy, as demonstrated in [1], ConvNeXt [2], and many other followups. This is the key issues to evaluate this paper. Without the claim of using the exact same architecture and training strategy for fair comparison across methods, it is hard to evaluate this paper.

2. Strong assumption based. This paper has to search per-layer. For layer i, it has to assume all the succeeding layers use the default operation (e.g. the most expensive operation) as stated in the first paragraph of Sec. 4. There is no theoretical analysis why this simple and strong assumption leads to better searched architecture than other NAS algorithms. 

3. Lack of literature.  Named as LayerNAS, this work lacks comparisons to pioneering work in layerwise NAS: SGAS [3], TNAS [4], and many other followups. Please compare with these works in related work.

A detailed example of LayerNAS could have been provided. For example, you can show the step-by-step details of LayerNAS on ImageNet. What are the 100 candidates in each searching layer and which one is chosen.

### Summary
The author attempted to solve NAS via dynamic programming. In order to do so, they made an approximation about the search space that the optimal decision for the i-th layer does not depend on the decision for layers afterward, i.e., the searching problem is simplified to satisfy the optimal substructure requirement (e.g., an optimal solution can be obtained from optimal solutions of its subproblems). In order to make the search complexity manageable, the proposed method, LayerNAS, relies on a grouping/bucketing function which splits the search space into groups/buckets, with each group/bucket only keeping a small amounts of model architectures.

### Strengths
The authors provided a new way of tackling the search problem in NAS: dividing the search space into sub-problems and adding the assumption that satisfy the requirements of dynamic programming. To the best of my knowledge, no one has done similar things before. In the task of size search on ImageNet, and both size search and topology search on NATS-Bench, the authors demonstrated the effectiveness of LayerNAS.

In general, the idea is clearly described and easy to follow.

### Weaknesses
- The whole idea of LayerNAS is based on the assumption that the optimal decision for the i-th layer does not depend on the decision for the succeeding layers. The paper didn't investigate the soundness of this assumption. For example, in algorithm 1, for a certain layer l and a certain value of h, only a few models with better performance are kept. Is it possible that in the final optimal model, the selected options for some layer i are different from ones that are kept during the search? This situation may become more likely given that each candidate is only trained for a small amount of epochs (e.g., 5 epochs used in the paper), as some architectures are easier to converge (e.g., showing lower loss at the early stage) but cannot keep the momentum till the end (e.g., the loss stop decreasing and the model is eventually surpassed by models with higher loss at the early stage).

- In Table 2, the comparisons stops at FLOPs 627M. How does LayerNAS compare with EfficientNet-B1 and B2? It seems that the comparison with OFA is missing. OFA achieves 76.9% at 230M FLOPs and 80.0% at ~600M FLOPs.

- It is unclear to me how LayerNAS can save some search cost by designing the mapping function $\varphi$, in the case of topology search. The search space in the experiment "NATS-Bench topology search" is too small.

### Questions
I'd like to see the authors' response to my questions in the weakness section, especially the second and the third question. For the first question, it is acceptable that LayerNAS may miss some promising architectures under the assumption as long as the final model has good performance.
