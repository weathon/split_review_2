# Spectrum-guided Multi-view Graph Fusion

- Decision: Reject
- Scores: 5, 3, 3, 5

## Abstract
Multi-view graphs capture diverse relations among entities through graph views and individual characteristics via attribute views, presenting a challenge for unsupervised learning due to potential conflicts across views. Existing approaches often lack efficacy, efficiency, and the ability to explicitly control view contributions. In this paper, we present SMGF, a novel graph fusion framework that approximates underlying entity connections by aggregating view-specific graph structures. We construct a multi-view Laplacian $\mathcal{L}$ from normalized Laplacian matrices representing all views. View weights are determined through the optimization of two objectives derived from $\mathcal{L}$'s spectral properties, which exploit the eigenvalue gap and enhance connectivity.
Comprehensive experiments on six real-world datasets showcase the superior performance of SMGF in node embedding and clustering results, along with its efficiency and scalability. SMGF offers a promising solution for unsupervised learning on multi-view graphs, addressing the challenge of interpretably combining diverse and potentially conflicting information from both graph and attribute views.

### Weaknesses
1. For attribute views, how to construct G_X? Since X has multiple views, how many G_x should be constructed?
2. The presentation of the paper is confusion, I cannot see what is the final objective function.

### Summary
The paper introduces SMGF, a novel framework for graph fusion in the context of multi-view graphs, which aim to capture diverse relations among entities and individual characteristics through both graph views and attribute views. The primary motivation for this work is the limitations observed in existing approaches, including issues related to efficacy, efficiency, and explicit control over view contributions. SMGF approximates the connections between entities by aggregating view-specific graph structures and constructs a multi-view Laplacian matrix from normalized Laplacian matrices representing all views. View weights are determined through the optimization of two objectives based on the spectral properties of the Laplacian matrix, leveraging eigenvalue gap and connectivity enhancement. The paper presents comprehensive experiments conducted on six real-world datasets, demonstrating that SMGF outperforms existing methods in terms of node embedding, clustering results, efficiency, and scalability.

### Strengths
1.The motivation is clear
2. The paper is well written and well structured

### Weaknesses
1. The first issue is that the topic of graph fusion in multi-view settings is relatively outdated. Currently, the explanation and performance of existing approaches are quite satisfactory. The motivation stated in this paper, "Existing approaches often lack efficacy, efficiency, and the ability to explicitly control view contributions," is not valid. There are various methods for weighting different views and plenty of adaptive weighting techniques. The algorithms also exhibit linear time complexity. Therefore, I find this motivation less convincing.

2. The second concern is the use of spectral properties based on spectral clustering, which doesn't appear to be a novel contribution. The method section mainly revolves around basic concepts, and I believe the essence of the graph fusion process is not adequately explained. It remains unclear why a particular view dominates, and the approach based on "eigengap and connectivity objectives" appears rather ordinary.

3. The third issue is the mediocre performance of the algorithm. It seems that the improvement in algorithm performance is minimal, and the paper lacks statistical analysis to support the claimed enhancements. Additionally, there is no significant analysis demonstrating the effectiveness. Moreover, the algorithm's performance on the IMDB dataset is considerably worse compared to URAMN.

### Summary
This paper proposes  a multi-view graph fusion method which can be used in representation learning and clustering. It designs an eigengap objective and a connectivity objective for Laplacian learning. The exeperimental results demonstrate the effectiveness.

### Strengths
1. The multi-view graph learning setting is interesting.
2. The experimental results are good.

### Weaknesses
1. Although the multi-view graph fusion problem is interesting, the method to tackle this problem is somewhat straightforward. It directly contruct the graph for each attribute view and transfer the problem to the conventional multiple graph fusion setting. Therefore, the proposed method is still a multiple graph fusion method essentially and do not provide any deeper insight to the multi-view graph fusion problem. After constructing the Laplacian matrix for each attribute view, the method only uses the Laplacian without the attribute view, and thus the rich information behind the attribute view is abandoned. However, I think it is the information in the multiple attribute view that is the key difference between the multi-view graph learning and the conventional multiple graph learning.

2. Since the method uses multiple Laplacian, whose size is n-by-n, for fusion. The space complexity should also be provided. In the experiments, the authors use the MAG data set, which is a large scale data set. Intuitively, the proposed method may suffer from the out-of-memoty problem on this data set, but the experimental results show that the proposed one can run a result. It would be better to explain why and how the proposed method can handle this large scale data set. Could you report the memory consumed by the proposed method?

3. The optimization is a two-step method, i.e., it first optimize the eigengap objective and then it optimizes the connectivity objective. I think it is a suboptimal and need to be justified. For example, in the second step, when optimizing the eigengap objective, it is very probably that the eigengap objective will increase a lot. How to balance these two objectives?

4. It would be better to provide the time complexity of the COBYLA algorithm in Lines 4 and 5 in Algorithm 1.

### Summary
This paper presents SMGF, a novel graph fusion framework that approximates underlying entity connections by aggregating view-specific graph structures. The authors construct a multi-view Laplacian L from normalized Laplacian matrices representing all views. View weights are determined through the optimization of two objectives derived from L’s spectral properties, which exploit the eigenvalue gap and enhance connectivity. Comprehensive experiments on six real-world datasets showcase the superior performance of SMGF in node embedding and clustering results, along with its efficiency and scalability

### Strengths
1. The originality, quality, and significance is supported by the proposed SMGF, which is addresses performance and interpretability with a graph fusion framework.

2. The clarity of this paper is satisfied based on the clearly presented motivations and contributions in Introduction part and good organizations in Methodology part.

### Weaknesses
1. The biggest problem of this paper is the limited novelty of the formulation in introducing a weighted graph fusion mechanism that directly aggregates the single-view Laplacians. The rationality of the weighted graph fusion is not clear based on the related parts in this paper.

2. The Theorem 1 and Theorem 2 are built on the existing works as the cited works. Then directly placing them on the methodology part will more or less limit the novelty of this paper. I think placing them on the Section 2 will be better and the authors can add more explanation of rationality of the proposed method.

3. What are the major differences between the proposed SMGF and the most related works? I think the authors can add more analysis and comparison in Introduction part. Then the novelty of this paper is more clear.

4. In the experimental part, the authors can add more descriptions of experimental settings in validating the proposed SMGF. Then the authors are easily follow up this work.

5. The authors can add more datasets with large scales and compared methods in the experiment to better demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

6. A '.' should be added in the end of an equation, i.e., Eq. (4) and Eq. (6).

### Questions
I wonder whether there exist relations between eigengap and connectivity as shown in 3.2.1 and 3.2.2.
