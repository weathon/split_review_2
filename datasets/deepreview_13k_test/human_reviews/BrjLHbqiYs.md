## Abstract
\vspace{-2mm}
    In many machine learning systems that jointly learn from multiple modalities, a core research question is to understand the nature of \textit{multimodal interactions}: how modalities combine to provide new task-relevant information that was not present in either alone. 
    We study this challenge of interaction quantification in a semi-supervised setting with only labeled unimodal data and naturally co-occurring multimodal data (e.g., unlabeled images and captions, video and corresponding audio) but when labeling them is time-consuming.
    Using a precise information-theoretic definition of interactions, our key contribution is the derivation of lower and upper bounds to quantify the amount of multimodal interactions in this semi-supervised setting.
    We propose two lower bounds: one based on the \textit{shared information} between modalities and the other based on \textit{disagreement} between separately trained unimodal classifiers, and derive an upper bound through connections to approximate algorithms for \textit{min-entropy couplings}. We validate these estimated bounds and show how they accurately track true interactions. Finally, we show how these theoretical results can be used to estimate multimodal model performance, guide data collection, and select appropriate multimodal models for various tasks.

### Summary
This paper explores the challenge of understanding how different modalities combine to provide new task-relevant information in a semi-supervised multimodal learning setting. The authors derive lower and upper bounds to quantify the amount of multimodal interactions, with the lower bounds based on shared information and disagreement between unimodal classifiers, and the upper bound derived through connections to min-entropy couplings. The authors also propose a practical algorithm to estimate the lower bounds in practice. The theoretical results in this paper could be used to guide data collection or select appropriate multimodal models for a specific task. Overall, this paper provides a valuable contribution to the field of multimodal learning by providing a framework for quantifying interactions between modalities.

### Strengths
1. The paper provides a novel contribution to the field of multimodal learning by deriving lower and upper bounds to quantify the amount of multimodal interactions in a semi-supervised setting. This provides a framework for understanding how different modalities combine to provide new task-relevant information.

2. The paper is theoretically rigorous, with the authors providing a detailed information-theoretic analysis of the problem. The authors also propose a practical algorithm to estimate the lower bounds in practice. The authors show that synergy bounds can be used to predict the performance of multimodal models on held-out data, and to identify modalities that are most important for synergy. This information can be used to guide data collection efforts and improve the performance of multimodal models.

3. The theoretical results in this paper could be used to guide data collection or select appropriate multimodal models for a specific task. This has important practical implications for the development of multimodal learning systems in a variety of domains.

### Weaknesses
1. The synergy bounds are only approximate. The authors acknowledge that the synergy bounds are not tight, and that they may underestimate or overestimate the true amount of synergy in a dataset. This is a limitation of any information-theoretic approach to synergy quantification. While the paper provides a theoretical framework for quantifying interactions between modalities, there is limited empirical evaluation of the proposed approach. The authors only provide a proof-of-concept experiment on a small dataset, which may limit the generalizability of the results.

2. The synergy bounds are sensitive to the choice of auxiliary distributions. The authors use a set of auxiliary distributions to compute their lower bound on synergy. The choice of these auxiliary distributions can affect the tightness of the bound. The authors do not provide any guidance on how to choose the auxiliary distributions, which leaves this as a practical challenge for users of the proposed method.

3. The synergy bounds are not applicable to all types of synergy. The authors focus on quantifying synergy that arises from the disagreement between unimodal predictors. However, there are other types of synergy, such as synergy that arises from the complementary strengths of different modalities. The proposed synergy bounds are not applicable to these other types of synergy.

4. The paper does not provide any theoretical guarantees on the performance of multimodal models trained using synergy bounds. The authors show that synergy bounds can be used to predict the performance of multimodal models on held-out data. However, they do not provide any theoretical guarantees on the accuracy of these predictions. This is a limitation of the paper, as it would be useful to know how accurately synergy bounds can predict the performance of multimodal models in practice.

### Questions
1. In section 3, what is D_M? Did you consider number of modalities over 2?

2. In Table 3, can you give more details of multimodal or unimodal, and what are the evaluation metrics to define the best models?

3. In section 4.2 RQ1, what performance to estimate? I think authors could have provided more explanations or examples to make the paper more accessible to a wider audience.

4. The authors mentioned observing only labeled unimodal data and some unlabeled multimodal data, did authors conduct experiments on these kind of data or any ablation studies on incompleteness of unimodal data?

3: You are fairly confident in your assessment. It is possible that you did not understand some parts of the submission or that you are unfamiliar with some pieces of related work. Math/other details were not carefully checked.

### Summary
This paper provides two lower bounds and one upper bound to quantify the interactions between modalities for the proposed multimodal semi-supervised setting. One lower bound is based on mutual information between modalities and the other is based on disagreement between separately trained unimodal classifiers. The upper bound is approximated by min-entropy coupling methods. The performances of the bounds to track true interactions on synthetic and real-world datasets are evaluated by experimental results. Examples are shown to use the bounds to guide modality or model selection in multimodal learning.

### Strengths
1. The performances of the lower bounds are tight, which demonstrates the effectiveness.
2. The proposed bounds can be used for modality or model selection, which are helpful for multimodal learning.

### Weaknesses
1. The performance of the proposed upper bound is not very ideal, more explanations can be provided.
2. No related work is compared in the experimental results. The superiority of this work is not demonstrated.

### Summary
This study develop a system of information-theoretic definitions and theories that quantify multimodal interaction in a semi-supervised setting. The semi-supervised setting being investigated contains only labelled unimodal datasets and unlabelled co-occurring multimodal data. The authors derive 2 lower bounds and 1 upper bound for Synergy information - emerged information when all modalities incorporate. Additionally, the research demonstrates how these theoretical results can be applied to estimate multimodal model performance, guide data collection, and select appropriate multimodal models for various tasks.

### Strengths
Contribution:

- The definitions are set out in accordance with real scenarios and datasets (e.g. MIMIC, MUSTARD,…) and in accordance with previous literatures, which increase the credit and sensibility of the definitions.
- The line of theorem following and based on those definitions are set out reasonable and come with rigorous proof in Appendix.
- By extracting 4 information factors given pairwise marginal distributions, the authors derive the bound of accuracy for optimal multimodal model. This can be used to analyse whether to collect more data and choose a different fusion approach

Prepresentation: 

- The authors provides trackable notation system and use those notations throughout the manuscript, which increase its consistency and coherence.
- Clear instructions via reference system and details in Appendix, make it more readable and trackable (e.g. we refer reader to …).

### Weaknesses
- Upon deriving lower bound using uniqueness, the reliance on optimal unimodal classifiers seem not practical in most scenarios.
- Upon deriving the upper bound, the relaxation using min-entropy coupling problem might not produce a tight upper boundary.
- While the empirical result support the correct boundary of *Synergy*, there is no investigation on how the bound is closed to *Synergy*, or what is the gap can be determined as close enough.

### Questions
How to determine the closeness of the derived boundary?
