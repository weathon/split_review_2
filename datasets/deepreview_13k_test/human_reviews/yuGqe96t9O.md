# Stoichiometry Representation Learning with Polymorphic Crystal Structures

- Decision: Reject
- Scores: 8, 3, 6

## Abstract
Machine learning (ML) has seen promising developments in materials science, yet its efficacy largely depends on detailed crystal structural data, which are often complex and hard to obtain, limiting their applicability in real-world material synthesis processes. 
An alternative, using compositional descriptors, offers a simpler approach by indicating the elemental ratios of compounds without detailed structural insights. 
However, accurately representing materials solely with compositional descriptors presents challenges due to polymorphism, where a single composition can correspond to various structural arrangements, creating ambiguities in its representation.
To this end, we introduce \proposed, a novel approach that employs probabilistic modeling of composition to capture the diverse polymorphs from available structural information.
Extensive evaluations on sixteen datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of \proposed~in learning compositional representation, and our analysis highlights its potential applicability of \proposed~in material discovery.

### Summary
This paper tackles the problem of learning representations of stoichiometries (ratio of chemical elements in a compound) for materials property prediction. In particular, this papers addresses the challenge of polymorphism, which refers to the fact that a single stoichiometry can correspond to multiple, diverse materials due to the different ways in which atoms can be arranged to form thermodynamically stable structures. The paper presents a machine learning algorithm where the structural information of compounds available in a data set is used to train a probabilistic embedding of the stoichiometry via a contrastive loss. The model optimises the parameters of a multivariate Gaussian distribution such that the graph representations of a stoichiometry and the structural graph representations of its polymorphs is minimised, while maximising the distance to other structures. The evaluation includes various data sets focused on different material properties and comparisons with a diverse set of methods.

### Strengths
I have enjoyed reading this paper, it is interesting and well written and generally the strengths of the paper outweigh my concerns, which I mention in the next section. I will highlight here some of these strengths.

First of all, the paper identifies an important challenge in the application of machine learning methods for materials discovery. Namely, that the structural information of new materials is not readily available, as the standard way to obtain it depends of computationally expensive simulations, for example with Density Functional Theory (DFT). Therefore, many of the most accurate methods in the machine literature for modelling materials and molecules, which are GNNs that use the structural information as input, cannot be effectively applied to new candidates of which we may only know the composition. This is an important subject that has received relatively little attention and this paper proposes a method that seems to obtain good results on various benchmarks.

The extensive evaluation of the method is also a strength of this paper. The authors compare their method against several diverse baselines, on an array of data sets focused on different materials properties and they include an ablation study of some of the most important components of the algorithm.

Regarding the method itself, I think it is an original and reasonable idea to use a contrastive loss between the structural representation of polymorphs and the stoichiometry representation of their composition. This still leverages the potential of GNNs to learn good structural representations, but allows using only the stoichiometry representation at inference time. I believe there could be multiple variations of the proposed method and I was initially skeptical of some of the specific details of the method, but the results seem to support the choices, and future work may explore other alternatives.

Finally, the paper is for the most part well written and easy to follow - with some exceptions I discuss below.

### Weaknesses
I would encourage the authors to improve the clarity of the last part of the paper, namely Section 5. While the quality is not poor, I did notice a decrease in the quality and clarity of this section with respect to the methods part of the paper, which I found very clear. Note that the first paragraph of 5.1 contains a few typos or grammar mistakes. Also, the size of the figures in this section are too small.

An exception of this clarity in the methods section is Section 4.3, where I believe the notation is a bit confusing. For instance, $\mathcal{P}^b$ is used here for the first time to refer to what I believe is the structural graph, previously referred to as $\mathcal{G}^b$. Also, should the superscript not be $b$ instead of $a$ because it refers to the structural graph? In fact, the superscript of $z_p$ is $b$. Or perhaps I am missing something. In this section as well, $m$ is used in the conditional probability without defining it.

Although there is additional information in the appendix, I would suggest to include some details regarding the data splits (train, validation, cross-validation) in the main paper as well to describe the evaluation protocol.

Machine learning models that predict the structure given the stoichiometry can be reasonable or even better alternatives to richer representations of the stoichiometry as proposed here. I would have appreciated to find a discussion of the pros and cons of these two approaches and ideally a review of crystal structure prediction methods.

### Questions
Some disconnected questions or comments:

- Why the figure of merit metric is not included in the Table with transfer learning results?
- Several times throughout the paper it is mentioned that there exists a one-to-many relationship between the stoichiometry and the possible structures. Does the structural graph contain information about the atoms species? I wonder if it is also the case, otherwise, that one structures actually corresponds to more than one stoichiometry. 
- Regarding the "collapsed dimensions" of the representation, I wonder whether it is actually due to the fact that some stoichiometries have no known polymorphs in the data sets and therefore their variance should in fact be zero. What do you think?

### Summary
The paper attempted to generate a probabilistic representation of stoichiometry from structural information of crystalline materials.

### Strengths
The authors should be highly praised for studying important real objects such as solid crystalline materials. 

The paper is generally well-written and contains enough details that helped understand the difficulties.

### Weaknesses
The keyword "stoichiometry" was not explained but the authors likely meant the chemical composition of a given material, more exactly ratios of weights of involved elements.

The question “Is it possible for stoichiometry-based models to also capture the structural information of crystals?” has the trivial answer "no". Both diamond and graphite in Fig. 1c only a few lines before the question consist of pure carbon but have different crystal structures and vastly different properties, which is known even to school students.

Atomic types were used as easy attributes in almost all past representations, especially for property prediction. Hence there is no need to separately talk about stoichiometry.

The word "problem" appears once (in the quote below), though a writing a rigorous problem statement might have helped the authors to understand the unresolved challenges. 

Quote: "it is still an open problem to construct appropriate descriptions of materials, there is a general agreement on effective descriptors that encompass the following principles "Descriptors should 1) preserve the similarity or difference between two data points (preservativity), 2) be applicable to the entire materials domain of interest (versatility), and 3) be computationally more feasible to generate compared to computing the target property itself (computability)". 
 
Comment. If the problem is to find a complete invariant description of a periodic crystal, crystallographers solved this problem nearly 100 years ago by using Niggli's reduced cell of a lattice and then recording all atoms in so-called standard settings, see the book "TYPIX standardized data and crystal chemical characterization of inorganic structure types" by Parthé et al, which applies to all periodic crystals, not only inorganic. 

However, all these standardizations have become obsolete in the new world of big and noisy data because the underlying lattice (not even a unit cell) of any periodic crystal is discontinuous under almost any perturbation, which is obvious already in dimension 1.

For example, the set Z of all integers is nearly identical to a periodic sequence with points 0, 1+ep_1, ..., m+ep_m in the unit cell [0,m+1] for any small ep_1,...,ep_m close to 0, though their minimal periods (or unit cells) 1 and m+1 are arbitrarily different. 

This discontinuity was reported for experimental crystals already in 1965, see Lawton SL, Jacobson RA. The reduced cell and its crystallographic applications. Ames Lab., Iowa State Univ. of Science and Tech.

A more recent example from Materials Project shows two nearly identical crystals whose unit cells differ by a factor of (approximately) 2

Moreover, atoms in any material always vibrate above absolute zero temperature, so their positions continuously change. As a result, any crystal structure with fixed atomic coordinates in a database is only a single snapshot of a potentially dynamic object, especially for proteins whose structures are often determined often by crystallization. 

Hence the new essential requirement for any (better than the past) representations of crystals is a proved continuity under perturbations of atoms. 

Any graph representation of a crystal or a molecule is discontinuous because all chemical bonds are only abstract representations of inter-atomic interactions and depend on numerous thresholds on distances and angles, while atomic nuclei are real physical objects.

Quote: "we propose a novel multi-modal representation learning framework for stoichiometry that incorporates readily available crystal structural information"

Comment. If the problem was to determine stoichometry only from a crystal structure, this problem was resolved by the Crystal Isometry Principle, which (briefly) says that any real periodic crystal (with all atomic types, hence stoichometry) is uniquely determined (without any uncertainty) by the geometric structure of atoms (without chemical elements). 

See Widdowson et al (NeurIPS 2022) for theoretical proofs and 200+ billion comparisons on the world's largest collection of materials (the Cambridge Structural Database). The underlying invariants have a near-linear time in the motif size and were used for property predictions by Ropers et all (DAMDID 2022) and by Balasingham et al (arxiv:2212.11246). 

Since atomic coordinates have continuous real values, the space of materials is continuously infinite. Hence any sixteen (16 million or any large number of) finite datasets cover an infinitely tiny subspace of measure 0 in the full representation space.

### Questions
What are the reasons to invent a new word such as "preservativity" in the first introductory paragraph without giving a definition, while the concepts of invariants (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invariant_(mathematics)), metric (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metric_space) and continuity (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_function) have been used for centuries? 

On what probabilistic space is the random variable below defined?

Quote: "we propose Polymorphic Stoichiometry Representation Learning (PolySRL), which
aims to learn the representation of stoichiometry as a random variable of polymorphs instead of a single deterministic representation"

Quote: "assuming that polymorphs with an identical stoichiometry follow the same Gaussian distribution, PolySRL models each stoichiometry as a parameterized Gaussian distribution"

Is it a realistic assumption that all existing polymorphs of any fixed stoichiometry can be synthesized with probability proportional to a Gaussian distribution? Could you please specify this distribution in the case of pure carbon, including diamond and graphite? 

How many CPU hours and hidden parameters were used in the experiments of section 5?

Did the authors know about the classical results in crystallography cited above, starting from Niggli (1927), Lawton (1965), and Parthe (1987)?

2: You are willing to defend your assessment, but it is quite likely that you did not understand the central parts of the submission or that you are unfamiliar with some pieces of related work. Math/other details were not carefully checked.

### Summary
This paper proposes PolySRL, which is a combination of previous self-supervise learning technics, to the task of crystal property preidction using structural and compositional information during training and only compositional information during inference. They show that instead of using deterministic way to obtain representations from crystal compositional information, it is better to use a distribution and a sampling process, due to the one-to-many nature between compositional information and structures.

### Strengths
- The first work to discuss using self supervise learning technics for crystal property prediction tasks without structural information.
- Clear writing, with informative figures and extensive experiments

### Weaknesses
- The novelty is limited, due to the fact that the proposed pipeline is a combination of previous technics.
- Improvements beyond baselines without structural information during training is not significant but in the near range. The errors are not very small and I'm a little concerned how practically useful the predictions will be.
- The global idea of predicting properties based on crystal compositional information is a little bit tricky, due to that crystal properties are largely determined by the structure. As you mentioned in your figure 1, diamond and graphite have totally different properties.

**I have viewed the rebuttals from authors.**

Thank you for providing detailed information in the Appendix H and in your rebuttals. **I read into details in your responses and now my concern about predicting a property value with an uncertainty value is addressed.**

It is addressed because, when filtering potential compositions of crystals for downstream tasks, one can use the property prediction together with the uncertainty value to have an approximation property upper and lower bound, e.g., (prediction - uncertainty, prediction + uncertainty). And I tend to believe this is of good value and potential to decrease the potential exploration space of compositions.

Since this is the major concern I had when I gave the score of 5, I tend to increase the score to 6, with confidence 2. **The final recommendation will be, this is a borderline paper with an interesting proposal, however, more experiments about the usage of uncertainty are needed, and the novelty in terms of methodology is a little limited.**
