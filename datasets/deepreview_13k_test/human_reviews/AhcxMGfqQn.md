# Collaborative World Models: An Online-Offline Transfer RL Approach

- Decision: Reject
- Scores: 5, 6, 3, 3, 5

## Abstract
Training offline reinforcement learning (RL) models with visual inputs is challenging due to the coupling of overfitting issue in representation learning and the risk of overestimating true value functions. Recent work has attempted to alleviate the overestimation bias by encouraging conservative behaviors beyond the scope of the offline dataset. This paper, in contrast, tries to build flexible constraints for the offline policies without impeding the exploration of potential advantages. The key idea is to leverage an off-the-shelf RL simulator, with which can be easily interacted in an online manner. In this auxiliary domain, we perform an actor-critic algorithm whose value model is aligned to the target data and thus serves as a “$\textit{test bed}$” for the offline policies. In this way, the online simulator can be used as the $\textit{playground}$ for the offline agent, allowing for mildly-conservative value estimation. Experimental results demonstrate the remarkable effectiveness of our approach in challenging environments such as DeepMind Control, Meta-World, and RoboDesk. It outperforms existing offline visual RL approaches by substantial margins.

### Summary
The authors introduce Collaborative World Models (CoWorld), a method for offline reinforcement learning (RL) that conceptualizes the challenge as an online-to-offline transfer learning problem. CoWorld aims to reduce the representation learning issue of overfitting that emerges from using limited visual data and mitigate the common tendency of value function overestimation in offline RL.

The method utilizes an auxiliary online simulator and learns separate source and target world models and source and target actor-critic agents, each with its own policy and value function. Regularization of the target agent value function is designed to prevent over-estimation without being overly conservative. They tackle the representation overfitting problem by aligning the target and source model's latent spaces. CoWorld iteratively performs a three-stage learning procedure: aligning the latent spaces between source and target world models, target-inclined source model tuning, and behavior learning with min-max value regularization.

### Strengths
- *Strategic Integration of Transfer Learning*: The authors utilize an online simulator to serve as a 'test-bed" and gather more data from an analogous task. This parallels multi-task and meta-learning approaches that rely on transfer learning across tasks. 

- *Empirical Validation*: Experimental results show that the method works well. They also demonstrate the effectiveness of a simple pretraining with fine-tuning baseline, which suggests that transfer between tasks is crucial. 

- *Cohesive Methodological Design*: The components of CoWorld contribute synergistically to the overall performance enhancement, as validated by ablation studies.

### Weaknesses
- *Dependence on Auxiliary Simulators:* The CoWorld framework's performance is critically dependent on the availability of an online simulator in a domain that is sufficiently similar to the target domain. This reliance may limit the method's applicability in situations where such simulators are unavailable or where the source and target domains do not share sufficient similarity to ensure sufficient knowledge transfer.

- *Decoupling Rationale*: While it is easy to understand how getting more data from an online simulator in the source domain is beneficial, the rationale behind the decision to maintain two separate world models (rather than a single, jointly trained model on both offline and online data) is not sufficiently explained or supported by evidence.

### Questions
- Have you considered training on multiple source domains?
- I would be curious to see experiments that use only one world model.
- Were all other approaches you compare to (except for the "Finetune" baseline) trained only on the offline data?

### Summary
The paper presents Collaborative World Models (CoWorld), a novel approach to offline reinforcement learning (RL) with visual inputs. CoWorld uses an existing online RL simulator as a 'test bed' for offline policies, allowing for moderate value estimation without hindering the exploration of potentially beneficial actions. 

CoWorld treats offline visual RL as an online-to-offline transfer learning problem and is designed to address the trade-off between overestimation and over-conservatism in value functions. The approach involves three stages: training world models and aligning latent state spaces, incorporating target reward information into the source model and performing model-based behavior learning in the offline domain.

Experiments demonstrate that CoWorld significantly outperforms existing methods in offline visual control tasks across various environments, including DeepMind Control, Meta-World, and RoboDesk.

### Strengths
1. This paper proposes an online-to-offline transfer learning approach to tackle offline RL with visual inputs. To my best knowledge, this setting is relatively new and understudied.

2. The methodology proposed seems to adequately addresses the main challenges in offline RL with visual inputs. Specifically, DOMAIN-COLLABORATIVE REPRESENTATION LEARNING (stage A) alleviates the overfitting issue in representation learning, and stage B \& C attempts to strike a balance between value function overestimation and over-conservatism.

3. The experiments are relatively comprehensive. In particular, the paper demonstrates results on three RL benchmarks: Meta-World, RoboDesk and DeepMind Control Suite. Moreover, both cross-task and cross-environment domain transfer experiments are conducted.

### Weaknesses
1. **Unrealistic assumptions**.  The paper tries to tackle offline RL by assuming the existence of an off-the-shelf simulator from a source domain. On one hand, as discussed in part 4.2, the success of this online-to-offline paradigm highly hinges on the similarity between the source and target domains. On the other hand, offline RL research is motivated by the assumption that online data collection can be too costly or dangerous on the target domain. These two conditions seem contradictory since if we cannot query large amount of online data from a target domain due to safety or economic issues, it's unlikely that we can build a high-quality simulator on a very similar source domain.

2. **Marginal or unclear performance improvement of the method**.  The paper compares CoWorld with a number of offline RL methods trained **on the target domain only** with only one exception, which is a simple transfer learning strategy which finetunes the source model on the target domain. I find the performance improvement of CoWorld not convincing enough due to the following considerations:

-  There are many potentially better baseline methods that can leverage data from both domains, which the paper doesn't compare. To name a few: finetuning the model with early stopping/soft update/elastic weight consolidation [1], or finetuning the model and source agent simultaneously, or simply co-training a policy on both domains simultaneously.

- The performance of CoWorld seems to be highly sensitive to hyperparameters such as the Target-inclined reward factor $k$. According to Figure 11, by simply changing $k=0.3$ to $k=0.7$ results in about 600 decline to ~3000 in episode return. In this case, CoWorld is inferior to both Finetune and Offline DV2 on DC $\rightarrow$ BP task according to Table 1. The improvement in Figure 9 also looks very marginal compared to the naive Finetune baseline.
 
3. **Computational complexity**: As highlighted in section 6, CoWorld achieves a marginal improvement at the cost of increase computational complexity, which is a notable limitation.

Minor issues:

1. The paper seems rushed. What follows requires further clarification:

- In figure 4, what are the source and target domains for (a) and (b)? Why do you conclude that "performance experiences a notable decline in scenarios involving a significant data distribution shift between the source and the target domains, such as in the following cross-environment experiments from Meta-World to RoboDesk"?

### Questions
1. Your method relies on the availability of an online RL simulator. Could you elaborate on how dependent the performance of CoWorld is on the quality of this simulator? How would the method perform if the simulator is not a perfect representation of the real-world task?

2. For all experiments, competitive model-free methods such as CQL consistently underperform model-based methods by a large margin. However, we generally expect that model-free methods achieve higher asymptotic performance compared to model-based methods at the cost of sample efficiency. Any explanations?

### Summary
This paper introduces a new problem statement in which we have access to an online simulator that does not match the distribution of target offline data. The presented CoWorld approach iterates between online training in a source environment and offline training in the target environment and regularizes target world models with critics learned in the source. The authors evaluate both cross-task and cross-environment transfer settings using Meta-World, DeepMind Control Suite, and RoboDesk. CoWorld outperforms offline-only training with DreamerV2, DrQ+BC, CQL, CURL, and LOMPO.

### Strengths
This paper includes an interesting discussion on the transfer learning problem within RL and presents a realistic and relevant problem statement that is currently understudied. The CoWorld training framework enables the author to study interesting questions about transfer learning for RL, especially around the difficulty in transferring from one environment or task to another (see Figure 3). The paper shows that for Dreamer-V2 the CoWorld approach improves final performance in the target environment.

### Weaknesses
It's not clear is CoWorld is a method or a new problem statement. In my opinion the paper presents two things: 

1. A new _problem statement_ where we have a simulator where we can do online RL where our objective is to perform well on an offline dataset from a target environment
2. A method for doing well in this new problem statement

Currently in the paper 1 and 2 are both presented as a method. I think it would be more straightforward and fair to separate these contributions. 

This is important because only one baseline is fine-tuned from the source online simulator to the offline data. However, based on prior work on off-line to online fine-tuning, I would expect different RL baselines to have different levels of success when provided access to a online training in a source environment. For example, the IQL [Kostrikov et. al., 2021] paper shows that different offline RL algorithms perform differently when fine-tuned online. I think to have proper baselines, all methods should be able to access the online simulator. It is also important to add baselines that focus specifically on the offline to online problem statement (namely, IQL).

### Questions
To confirm, are the DrQ+BC, CQL, CURL, and LOMPO baselines all trained fully offline without access to the online source environment?

### Summary
This paper utilizes an online RL simulator to facilitate offline RL. The main idea is to learn aligned world models for both source and target domains, and then use the source model and critic to regularize the target critic. This method is supposed to address the trade-off between over-estimation of values and over-conservatism in offline RL. Experiments on cross-task and cross-environment show that the algorithm can transfer knowledge from the source task to the target one.

### Strengths
The idea of online-to-offline transfer learning is interesting and sounds novel to me. The exprimental results verify the effectiveness of the proposed method. It is also promising to see the method work for large discrepancy between the source task and the target task.

### Weaknesses
- It is not clear how the source domain should be selected in practice. Although the paper provides a selection metric based on the ratio between the finetune model and the online model, it is not practical because we do not have access to the test-time domain (if you have them, why do you do offline learning?) Here the $R_{Online}$ should not be available during training time. It makes the experiment results less convincing, as the source domain selection is actually **leaking information from test to train**.  
- The learning process involves alternation between online and offline agents until convergence, which can be expensive and unstable in practice. Can you provide some evidence for the time complexity of the method compared to baselines?
- From the formulation and the algorithm, it is not clear how the source and the target domains are related, which makes it hard to justify the feasibility of the method.

### Questions
- For latent state alignment, it is confusing to me why you can feed the same target domain observations into the two world models and close the distance of latent states. Based on the formulation provided, the source domain and the target domain may have different observation spaces $O^{(S)}$ and $O^{(T)}$. Why does it make sense to align $p(s_t^{(S)}|o_t^{(T)})$ and $p(s_t^{(T)}|o_t^{(T)})$? Does it mean you assume the similarity between $s_t^{(S)}$ and $s_t^{(T)}$? The relation between two domains are not clear to me (e.g. how similar are $O^{(S)}$ and $O^{(T)}$). The same issue exists across multiple equations, where the regularization is to align the t-th step of the source and the target, without explaining why they CAN be aligned. 
- Can you evaluate the performance of the algorithm without the designed "source domain selection" (for the reason I specified in weakness)? What if the source domain does not match the requirement? Will it hurt the performance by a lot?

### Summary
This paper studied two challenges of training offline reinforcement learning models with visual inputs: 1) overfitting in representation learning and 2) overestimation issue. The basic idea is to harness a readily available RL simulator such that the offline agent can interact with it while the offline RL can be treated as an online-to-offline transfer learning problem. The interaction with the auxiliary RL agent allows the offline agent to assess the target policy by introducing a  regularization term in the training. Meanwhile, the online interaction is also designed to facilitate the learning of more generalized representations from the visual input. Experimental results presented in the paper demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach, comparing with the models such as CQL and offline DV2 in six robot manipulation tasks.

### Strengths
+ The paper is well-motivated, and itaims to study two challenges in offline RL.

+ The paper is overall well-written and provides a detailed description of the proposed collaborative world models (CoWorld).

+  Based on the experimental studies presented in the paper, the proposed CoWorld seems to be a promising approach for offline RL by providing better performance compared with other offline RL methods. Especially it shows to outperform offline DV2 by a large margin.

### Weaknesses
One main challenge in the proposed approach is how to choose a source RL simulator. Clearly, the key of the online-to-offline transfer lies in the quality of the source agent or the alignment between the source and target tasks. A priori,  how do you set the criteria for choosing the source task and how do you ensure the source task is sufficiently informative for the target tasks? Needless to say, one cannot  choose it arbitrarily. So how do you specify the threshold according to the values in the transfer matrix?  Also, what is the impact of the source task quality on the learning performance.  Many of these details are missing.

 Some details of the proposed method are missing or simply punted to another paper, e.g., the objective functions in Eqn. (2), Eqn. (6). In order to make this paper self-contained, it is necessary to include those details. 
 
 This work is compared with the fine-tune method, where in offline RL, there are many possible ways to fine-tune the model. It is important to specify the details of these methods, e.g., how many steps for fine-tuning for each task?

### Questions
1. When computing the transfer matrix, how many steps of online fine-tune and online learning are used, respectively? Meanwhile, how many steps of fine-tune in Table 1 and Figure 4?

2. What is the variance in Figure 3(b)?

3. In both Figure 5(a), would you explain why in iteration around 150k, the CoWorld performance is worse or similar compared with CoWorld w/o State A/B/C?

4. What is the computational complexity of the training phase of the auxiliary agent?

5. In Figure 5(b), the CQL (Kumar et al.) method seems to overestimate the value function for all the tasks, why is this the case considering that CQL is a conservative way for offline RL?
