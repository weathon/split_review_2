# Turning large language models into cognitive models

- Decision: Accept
- Scores: 8, 8, 8, 8

## Abstract
Large language models are powerful systems that excel at many tasks, ranging from translation to mathematical reasoning. Yet, at the same time, these models often show unhuman-like characteristics. In the present paper, we address this gap and ask whether large language models can be turned into cognitive models. We find that -- after finetuning them on data from psychological experiments -- these models offer accurate representations of human behavior, even outperforming traditional cognitive models in two decision-making domains. In addition, we show that their representations contain the information necessary to model behavior on the level of individual subjects. Finally, we demonstrate that finetuning on multiple tasks enables large language models to predict human behavior in a previously unseen task. Taken together, these results suggest that large, pre-trained models can be adapted to become generalist cognitive models, thereby opening up new research directions that could transform cognitive psychology and the behavioral sciences as a whole.

### Summary
The authors propose to fine-tune large language models (LLM) on real human decision making behavior / tasks from psychology to potentially better align them with people and provide better predictions of behavior. They find that fine-tuning is largely successful on two such tasks and allow for at least some generalization to a third hold out task.

### Strengths
I found this paper really interesting and worthwhile. While I suspect that there is much more work to be done in assessing the results, the main result is clear and fascinating: LLMs can quickly adapt to predict specific human behaviors. Perhaps most interesting is that this only requires linear regression. While this isn't really fine-tuning in the typical sense and could be considered a limitation (the authors could have trained a single layer or so, but with LLMs this is not easy by any means), I find it useful to know that only a simple transformation is needed. In fact, one could argue that the model didn't really have to learn anything about people. Everything the model needs appears to be located in the final input representation. One could further argue that this implies that LLMs already know how to emulate a diverse range of behavior, but that prompting is not the best way to test for it. In that sense, I think the primary contribution is strong. I don't think the authors needed to name their linear model, as the contribution is empirical and not methodological in some sense, but that's not a weakness given the aim of the paper.

### Weaknesses
The main weakness in my view is the difficulty in comparing to past work in the relevant domains and which are cited in the work. Past work appears to use different metrics, different splits of the data, and different baseline models. For example, BEAST does not appear to be the best or only relevant baseline, which is also usually evaluated using mean squared error. There is also a history of work behind the choices13k dataset with machine learning methods that the authors don't review. The authors also don't provide more interpretable metrics such as accuracy. One option to fix this would be make better comparisons using a larger set of relevant models, while another could be to focus on the success of fine-tuning more generally, which is already interesting, and less on benchmarks.

More generally, the claims of the paper could be toned down a bit. The space of human behavior is massive, and success in fine-tuning to extremely narrow ranges of behavior does not guarantee any particular success rate with other kinds. LLMs already fall short in matching human intelligence in some respects, and thus can't mimic such behavior. This may even be true or more nuanced "non-intelligent" behavior as well.

### Questions
--- What is the practical improvement (e.g., accuracy?) of fine-tuning?
--- Can BEAST be fine-tuned as well?
--- How does this compare to more typical feedforward neural networks with no pretraining.

### Summary
This paper studies the problem of using large language models to simulate human results in behavioral experiments, with a focus on decision-making tasks. The method is intuitive and effective: linear probing of a llama model with human behavioral experiment data (i.e., extract latent embeddings and feed to a linear classifier to predict the judgment). Experiment results show such a fine-tuned-based approach can well fit human behavioral experiment distribution and generalize to hold-out tasks. This work shed light on some alternative approaches besides Bayesian models for predicting human decision-making results.

### Strengths
- This paper is well written, with a clear motivation of using large language models to simulate human behaviors (or at least binary choice results on two types of decision-making tasks). The detailed implementation: extract embeddings and then do a linear probing is good enough for a scalable method.

- I like the idea of using large language models for a proxy model for analyzing human behavior. The crux is how to prob or design proper experimental methods (analogous to methods developed in experiment psychology). The proposed fine-tuning method performs well on behavior prediction tasks.

- The main results are good, showing good predictive matches to human participants compared with other common methods. The hold-out tests also confirm the validity of using large language models as a universal cognitive model for behavioral tests.

### Weaknesses
- Although using open-sourced models (e.g., llama) is a good choice, the most powerful models to date (including instruction fine-tuned ones)  are not tested as a baseline method (e.g., few-shot evaluations on GPT-3.5/GPT-4/PaLM-2/Claude/instruction-finetuned llama 2 variants), it is suggested that some of those models can also demonstrate human-like behaviors in some human decision making tasks, through prompting or few-shot evaluations [A]. The few-shot method might be done by prompting some of the training examples in the CENTaUR method. So, it might be helpful to prove that CENTaUR is better than other prompting-based methods on more powerful LLMs.

- Missing some discussions to previous works using LLMs to simulate and replicate behavior study results: [A-E]. Some similar aspects for using LLM in decision-making evaluations have already been proposed by Aher et al. [A].

- Minor problems (only suggestions, not affecting the score): please use vectorized graphics (Figure 6 is good, but Figures 1-5 look blurry).

### Questions
See weaknesses. I'm open to discussing and increasing my score. The score I'm willing to give now is ~7, but this year's ICLR only has 6 and 8 options :). Moreover, is there any statistical analysis (e.g., significance tests) for comparing the correlation between human and CENTaUR predictions?

### Summary
This work presents a novel cognitive model that uses embeddings from an LLM (LLaMa), together with a regression model, to predict human decision-making behavior. The model outperforms both the pre-trained LLM and domain-specific cognitive models, accounts for individual differences, and can generalize to a holdout task.

### Strengths
- This work presents an interesting and novel approach to cognitive modeling that outperforms domain-specific cognitive models.
- The model is shown to be capable of generating qualitative cognitive insights, in addition to superior quantitative performance.
- The model accounts for individual differences.
- The model generalizes to a novel task.
- The paper includes some interesting discussion of the broader implications of this approach for cognitive science.

### Weaknesses
- I am not sure if this is a weakness per se, but the work is primarily oriented toward cognitive science. It may be better suited to a more cog-sci oriented venue. However, I think the work generally makes a strong contribution and would be happy for it be published at ICLR.
- My primary substantive concern is that the model is only evaluated on publicly available datasets. Do the authors know whether this data is included in LLaMa's pretraining data? I'm not entirely certain, but given the open-source nature of the model I think it should be possible to determine this. This seems like an important factor for considering how generalizable the approach will be to new datasets.
- For the holdout task, is there an appropriate domain-specific model with which to compare CENTaUR?

### Questions
- Have the authors considered whether a more powerful LLM (e.g. GPT-3 or GPT-4) might perform better on these tasks without fine-tuning, or carried out any such evaluation? My sense is that LLaMa is not as effectively instruction-tuned as these other models, and thus performs poorly in the zero-shot setting, which would explain the need for fine-tuning. But I wonder whether a more effectively instruction-tuned model might perform better 'out of the box' (I'm not suggesting that the authors need to perform this evaluation, just curious to hear their thoughts).
- Have the authors tried to train LLaMa through in-context learning instead of fine-tuning? If this were effective, it might be more useful in settings where training data is limited (as is more generally the case in cognitive science).
- Is CENTaUR an acronym, and if so what does it stand for?

### Summary
Can language models capture aspects of human behaviour? In this work, these authors take a step towards this question by introducing fine-tuning an LLM (specifically LLaMA) on human behavioural data. The authors find that the resulting model – CENTaUR – is able to well-capture binary human decisions and achieves competitive performance against alternative cognitive models. In particular, the authors find that CENTaUR’s learned embeddings generalise well to new human behaviour data, raising the prospects of leveraging (finetuned) LLMs as stimuli-computable cognitive models.

### Strengths
The method proposed by the authors is sweet and simple (in a good way!). The idea of finetuning on human choice data is neat and impressively improves fits to human data. I believe the CENTaUR method therefore has value to the broader community. I think this study is a good first-step towards opening doors for the use of LLMs as fits of human data which would inspire further work in the space going forwards. 

I am particularly excited by the generalization results the authors demonstrate in Section 3.4. It would be intriguing to see how performance scales when jointly training CENTaUR on many more human behavior datasets. I believe the methodology the authors introduce in the work, and the fact that they will release their code (and nicely, are using an already open-source model, in contrast to the oft used GPT series) should set their framework up well for extension.   

I also think the inclusion of a random effects component in the finetuning layer to capute individual differences is quite a nice (and seemingly novel? To my understanding?) idea; I would encourage the authors to expand on this further as a contribution, if they indeed believe the method is more generalizable and important for extending LLMs as cognitive models. 

I appreciate the authors’ rigour in their qualitative investigations (though I believe the results could be pushed on even further; see Weaknesses). I also appreciate the authors’ couching the broader implications of their work in the Discussion; the authors do a good job of cautioning against too broad a take on their findings of these models *as* cognitive models. Some of this could be brought further to the Intro (see below)).

### Weaknesses
While I think the authors do a good job in couching the generality of their method and limitations in the Discussion, I think this could be set-up further in the Introduction. At times, I feel the motivation was a bit confused. There is a difference, in my opinion, between seeking to bridge the gap between out-of-the-box language models and fits to behavioral data, versus actually using LLMs *as* cognitive models to *predict and study* human behavior. I believe this work nicely supports and expands on the former, and teases the possibility of the latter – but the results at present do not fully convince me that these models are ready yet, or should, serve as stimuli-computable models of human behavior. 

Expanding on the above, it’s not clear to me that CENTaUR is better than BEAST (Fig 1c); yes, the NLL is objectively lower – but what about error bars? Is it significantly lower? The authors do a good job of highlighting qualitative strengths of CENTAuR, but it would be nice for a deeper dive on the gaps between CENTaUR and human performance as well? For instance, could the authors construct the inverse of Fig 5? What do examples of cases where CENTaUR did *not* match humans (but perhaps BEAST / hybrid did?) The authors note as well that there are 8 out of 60 individual participants not well-captured by the 

More broadly, it would be nice if the authors could include error bars in their results as much as possible (it should be feasible to obtain these, given the authors used 100-fold CV?). Further, why are the more classical cognitive models not included in the plots in 2a and b? 

As a minor stylistic weakness: I did not find it helpful to read the raw NLL values in the text. I think it’s best to keep these in the figures/tables and discuss the trends. It’s hard to tell what counts as a large or small gap between NLL; again, error bars would be helpful.

### Questions
Most of the hesitation in my final score stems from the Weaknesses above; if the authors are able to conduct a deeper dive into the potential gaps between CENTaUR and human performance (not just emphasizing the goodness of the fits) and further clarify the performance of CENTaUR relative to the existing cognitive baselines / broader motivation of these models as (replacement?) predictive cognitive models, I am open to raising my score. For instance, I believe that the authors resoundedly demonstrate that fine-tuning improves on LLaMA for fitting human behaviour, and this is a nice contribution; but I don't think the authors are yet ready to present their model as a stand-alone cognitive model. I realize the authors couch the limitations of this, but I think it could be further improved (per notes above).

I raise a few other points which I believe are important and/or could add to the paper, but these are worth addressing only if the authors have time.

- This is not so much a question, but would be nice for the authors to comment on (and perhaps include in the Discussion): The choices13k dataset appears to have been released in 2019? As such, it’s possible that the models were trained over this data (LLaMA performance is poor out-of-the-gate, so perhaps it is less of an issue; but it would be good for the authors to comment on as it could impact performance, and broadly a nuance in leveraging these models as cognitive models). One idea for the authors to begin to explore this is by repeating the prompt variation in Appendix A.4, but in the training set as well. 
- Was there any interesting visible structure in the embeddings learned? Have the authors run any kind of visualization over the embeddings (tSNE, etc) and perhaps looked into any possible structure there which could inform why some participants rather than others are not captured by CENTaUR? This is not necessary and the lack of such an investigation does not lower my score; but could be an exploration to strengthen the work. 
- Minor note: it would be nice if the authors could visualize the choice curves on the same graph. For instance, it looks like CENTaUR is much sharper in its curve than humans in Fig 4 (top row)? But this is a bit hard to cross-compare when the graphs are side-by-side.
