# Rethinking Channel Dimensions to Isolate Outliers for Low-bit Weight Quantization of Large Language Models

- Decision: Accept
- Scores: 6, 6, 6

## Abstract
Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated a remarkable success across various tasks. However, efficiently serving LLMs has been a challenge due to its large memory bottleneck, specifically in small batch inference settings (e.g. mobile devices). Weight-only quantization can be a promising approach, but sub-4 bit quantization remains a challenge due to large-magnitude activation outliers. To mitigate the undesirable outlier effect, we first propose per-IC quantization, a simple yet effective method that creates quantization groups within each input channel (IC) rather than the conventional per-output channel (OC). Our method is motivated by the observation that activation outliers affect the input dimension of the weight matrix, so similarly grouping the weights in the IC direction can $\textit{isolate outliers to be within a group}$. We also find that activation outliers do not dictate quantization difficulty, and inherent weight sensitivities also exist. With per-IC quantization as a new outlier-friendly scheme, we then propose Adaptive Dimensions ($\textbf{AdaDim}$), a versatile quantization framework that can adapt to various weight sensitivity patterns. We demonstrate the effectiveness of AdaDim by augmenting prior methods such as Round-To-Nearest and GPTQ, showing significant improvements across various language modeling benchmarks for both base (up to $+4.7\%$ on MMLU) and instruction-tuned (up to $+10\%$ on HumanEval) LLMs.

### Confidence
5: You are absolutely certain about your assessment. You are very familiar with the related work and checked the math/other details carefully.

### Summary
The paper focuses on the weight-only quantization of Large Language Models (LLMs) and claims the case of less than 4 bits has challenges because of the presence of large-magnitude activation outliers. Based on the observation, the authors propose a method called "per-IC quantization" within AdaDim framework, which creates quantization groups within each input channel (IC) rather than the conventional per-output-channel (per-OC). The experiment results show the proposed superiority.

### Strengths
1. The high-level idea is good. The idea of "per-IC quantization" is clear and effective solution.

2. This paper is well-written and organized.

3. I agree the issue that accelerating the memory I/O is important in some scenes, and solving this challenge is very valuable in the industry.

### Weaknesses
1. The experiment results with activation quantization is expected, and more compared methods such [1] are necessary. 

2. The result of A.3 is important, more detailed analysis with diagram is expected.

### Questions
1. Typo error: The MMLU Avg. (49.56) of GPTQ-ada is bold, but GPTQ (49.63) is higher. Similar problem in CSR Avg.

2. The improvement of GPTQ with ada is lower than the RTN in Tab. 6 and Tab. 7. Have compared with more baseline methods, and are there situations where there is no improvement?

3. I agree the issue that accelerating the memory I/O is important in some scenes, but I didn’t find related memory evaluation/analysis result. I'd be glad if you could point this to me.

### Summary
This work introduces input-channel quantization and adaptive dimension (AdaDim) for input or output channel selection. The authors analyzes the outlier distributions and observed the traditional output-channel quantization is sub-optimal on some layers. Neither input nor output channel quantization is universally optimal, so the authors proposed AdaDim for channel selection. The performance improvement over SOTA 3-bit quantization is noticeable, but the improvement over 4-bit quantization is very minor.

### Strengths
1. The analysis on input/output channel sensitivity is very interesting (figure 2 and 9). 

2. Performance improvement on WizMath and WizCoder is pretty impressive (Table 4).

3. While input channel quantization isn't new (weakness 1), AdaDim is novel.

### Weaknesses
1. Exploring non-output channel quantization isn't new. See [1] that explores input-channel and arbitrary combination of row and column groups for quantization.

2. All evaluations in this paper use sub-channel quantization with group size of 128. While this is the SOTA configuration, I suggest authors to compare per-channel quantization (without groups) which might better demonstrate the advantage of input channel quantization over output channel quantization for certain layers. This is because the analysis was compare channel-wise sensitivity instead of sub-channel sensitivity.

### Questions
1. Why did the sensitivity is done in channel-wise, but the experiments were done with sub-channel? 

2. If you perform the sensitivity analysis based on the sub-channels, do you still see a large gap between input/output channel quantization?

### Summary
This paper proposes a new quantization scheme for LLMs. Particularly, they propose to choose quantizers based on input channels rather than output channels, as it is usually done. They show that this can to some degree reduce the effect of weight outliers on the quality of the quantized network.

### Strengths
The numerical results suggest that this quantization framework can help reduce the loss of accuracy from quantization.

### Weaknesses
- First, I think the presentation of the paper is very hard to follow. The authors choose to write a paragraph rather using mathematical notations that can make the paper easier to follow. At core, given the activation as $WX$ with $W\in R^{q\times p}$, they propose to have $p$ quantizers where quantizer $i$ corresponds to column $i$ of $W$, rather than having $q$ of them each corresponding to a row of $W$. Other examples include using the term "Activation". Is activation referring to $WX$ or $X$? Or $W$ which are the weights? Isn't this work trying to circumvent outliers in $W$? Then why they talk about activation outliers in page 3? The method does not even seem to detect outliers, then why talk so much about outliers?  Overall, I find the paper confusing and hard to follow.

- It seems transposing the direction of quantization helps with accuracy. But then what happens in terms of implementing this method in practice? Note that this per-IC quantization method is not a drop-in replacement for per-OC, or at least if it is, that requires to be substantiated with experiments. As far as I could tell there are no experiments on hardware implementation and inference time performance of the proposal. The hardware implementation is very briefly mentioned in Section 3.2, but the explanation actually creates more questions than answers, as it contain a bunch of new notations that are never properly defined. The authors say "With per-IC quantization, we can maximize the performance of the GPTQ algorithm by using reordering for free without the static groups constraint." which again I don't think is numerically supported. 

Overall, I think the paper needs some rewriting to make it easier to understand, and several experiments to show the benefits of per-IC in inference time.
