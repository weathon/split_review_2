- Decision: Accept
- Scores: 8, 6, 6, 6

## Abstract
Dual-encoder (DE) models are widely used in retrieval tasks, most commonly studied on open QA benchmarks that are often characterized by multi-class and limited training data. In contrast, their performance in multi-label and data-rich retrieval settings like extreme multi-label classification (XMC), remains under-explored. Current empirical evidence indicates that DE models fall significantly short on XMC benchmarks, where SOTA methods~\citep{Dahiya23, dahiya23dexa} linearly scale the number of learnable parameters with the total number of classes (documents in the corpus) by employing per-class classification head. To this end, we first study and highlight that existing multi-label contrastive training losses are not appropriate for training DE models on XMC tasks. We propose decoupled softmax loss -- a simple modification to the InfoNCE loss -- that overcomes the limitations of existing contrastive losses. We further extend our loss design to a soft top-k operator-based loss which is tailored to optimize top-k prediction performance. When trained with our proposed loss functions, standard DE models alone can match or outperform SOTA methods by up to 2\% at Precision@1 even on the largest XMC datasets while being 20× smaller in terms of the number of trainable parameters. This leads to more parameter-efficient and universally applicable solutions for retrieval tasks.

### Summary
The manuscript considers the use of Dual Encoders (DE) models for Extreme Multi-Label Classification (XMC). In previous work using softmax loss functions, the presence of other positive classes decreases the negative loss that can be gained from a training example. This work considers decoupled softmax, in which the negative loss gained for each positive class is independent of other positive classes. The motivation for this new loss function is that some classes may "obviously" apply, which should lead to confident predictions for those "obvious" cases. In experiment with synthetic dataset where one of the samples is very obviously marked, both softmax and decoupled softmax methods latch on this obvious annotations early on, but standard softmax approaches then entice the model to give the same score to all positive samples, obvious or not, thus decreasing the model's confidence in the obvious case. In non-synthetic settings, decoupled softmax reduces the variance in gradient feedback.

Directly training with the full decoupled softmax loss is challenging when there are many labels: appendix presents how to do this training with the full loss in a memory-efficient way. Still, for higher number of labels (e.g., documents retrieval), there is a need to approximate this full loss, and some preliminary results are given in this direction. A natural extension is presented for SoftTop-k.

The Appendices were not considered as part of this review.

### Strengths
To the best of my knowledge, the work is original and significant. Although the distinction between using a single multi-class cross-entropy vs using multiple binary cross-entropies (OvA-BCE) have long been well understood, it isn't immediately obvious that the DE setting would be so different, and that the OvA-BCE loss would fail to train.

In the context of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), when the retriever is not trained in an end-to-end manner with the answerer, one often conceptualize the retrieval problem as "get that one good document that is know to suffice to answer the question". However, there could be multiple such documents that contain the desired answer: this retrieval task can be understood as a particularly extreme case of XMC. The take home message that I personally get from this manuscript is that I should exercise caution along those lines if I ever attempt to train DE retrieval models with contrastive augmentations. (continued in weaknesses)...

### Weaknesses
... (continued from strengths) However, I wouldn't have come to this realization from the manuscript's abstract nor introduction, and that nugget would have been lost on me had I encountered the manuscript outside of a reviewing context. I understand that this work mainly targets the XMC literature (of which - full disclosure - I personally don't know much), but I still believe that the authors should dedicate some of their high-level discussions (i.e., abstract and/or introduction), to the significance of their work for DE-based RAG.

More generally, the manuscript's main weakness is with organizing the content to give a clear narrative. For example, Equation (2) introduces OvA-BCE, then eschew saying what's wrong with it until Section 5.5. As a reader, I had to go back-and-forth in the document to just understand what the authors are set in doing, what goes wrong with the default approach, and what's the authors' solution. More details in Question 1 below.

### Questions
### 1
(a) What are the assumptions, goals and constraints specifying what this project is about; (b) what would be the default/status quo approach and what's wrong with it; and (c) what is the essence of the solution you propose?

I think that I managed to figure out the answer to those questions, but these things should be clearly identifiable from the introduction (or even abstract). Here's my own crude attempt at it: please complement it, clarify any disagreements, and propose edits to the manuscript.

- 1(a) There are a large number of classes, and many of them can apply to the same sample. The models being considered are DE where the representations from each encoder will be converted to a score using an inner product.
- 1(b) OvA-BCE won't train; InfoNCE disincentivizes confident predictions.
- 1(c) Decoupled softmax both trains and allows for confident predictions.


### 2
The bulk of the manuscript presumes the optimization of the the "full" loss function over all positive and negative classes. Is this standard practice in the XMC community? Some experiments sampling hard negatives are presented in Section 5.4, but there is no real discussions besides "more is better". Do you have any insights to add? Could those be added to the manuscript?


*The remaining points are more minor*

### 3
Figure 1: why express the x axis in millions, instead of replacing the $10^2$ and $10^3$ ticks by $10^8$ and $10^9$?

### 4
Please avoid notations such as "O(100)", "O(million)" and "O(billion)".

### 5
Figure 2: "Precision@1" here has a special meaning. There are 5 samples that are marked as positives, but one of them is "more positive", and "Precision@1" here means "the more positive sample must be in first position". This special setting is relatively clear in the text, but looking quickly at Figure 2 and its caption can be misleading. Please consider inventing a different term/notation.

### 6
There are multiple missing punctuations after mathematical expressions. For example, a period should be added at the end of the first paragraph of Section 3, and another one should be added after the equation at the bottom of page 4. As a side note, I would personally add a lot of commas to the English text, but I understand that this may be more a matter of style.

### 7
The text appears to use \cite or \citep everywhere, but many should actually be \citet. For example, in the second paragraph of Section 4.2, "similar to (Xiong et al., 2021)" should become "similar to Xiong et al. (2021)", and "in (Lindgren et al., 2021)" should be "in Lindgren et al. (2021)".

### 8
The style of the stackexchange citation in the paragraph following Equation (6) should be revised. Personally, I would have expected something like "... on a proposal by Ahle (2022)."

### 9
Some variables are overloaded; for example $d$ is used both for documents and dimensions. I thought that there were more cases, but I can't find them anymore, so I may be confused with another paper. Please check.

### Summary
This paper explores the use of dual encoder models for extreme multilabel classification (XMC). Dual encoder models, which as the name suggests, use two encoder models, have been generally effective for a variety of other types of tasks involving zero-shot and few-shot learning, but have underperformed the state-of-the-art on XMC tasks. Dual encoder methods are, on the other hand, desirable for extreme classification in principle because they can be much more parameter efficient than extreme classification methods whose parameter counts have a strong dependence on the number of classes. 

The authors propose a new loss function, the differentiable top-k, for dual encoder models on XMC tasks that make them competitive with the state-of-the-art methods on these tasks--often outperforming them by a significant margin.

### Strengths
- The work is well-motivated and addresses the practical problem of getting dual encoder methods to work in the extreme multilabel setting. 
- The proposed contribution is simple, as it is just a loss function paired with either a negative mining approach or a memory-efficient implementation using all negatives. 
- The ablation of the different loss variants -- soft top-5 and soft top-100 -- is compelling and shows that the method can effectively optimize precision or recall at 5 or 100, respectively.

### Weaknesses
- I might have missed something, but I think it should be made clearer earlier on in the paper that the differentiable top-k operator had been proposed previously [1]. The authors also link to the author of the stackexchange answer, but it would be ideal to cite the specific answer at the link (please correct me if this appears somewhere in the main text, but I couldn't find it). Relatedly, is there other work that uses the formulation by Thomas Ahle? For example, how does this formulation compare to the one linked in the stackexchange post [2]? In my opinion, this brings the novelty of the contribution *when posed as a new loss function* into question. 
- Again, I might have missed something, but I think the ablation involving the negative mining approach should include a comparison to SOTA methods, as the negative mining approach may be required for scaling the method up even further.

[2] https://arxiv.org/pdf/2002.06504.pdf

### Questions
- Can the authors elaborate on how $t_x$ in the soft top-k formulation is computed via binary search? As this is a crucial hyperparameter of the loss function, does this require a logarithmic number of retraining runs? How many runs are required to set this, what are the compute costs involved with setting this hyperparameter, and how strongly does the final performance depend on this choice? 
- In Table 5, why is precision at 5 reported while recall at 100 is reported? Why not both precision and recall at 5 and 100? Is this a standard choice? 
- Does the loss optimize precision at k or recall at k?

### Summary
This paper explores the performance of dual-encoder models in extreme multi-label classification (XMC) tasks. The authors first reveal the shortcomings of traditional dual-encoder training loss, which may over-penalize the correct prediction of "easy-positive" labels. To address this, the Decoupled Multi-label Loss is proposed, aiming to minimize the undesirable correlation between positive labels during training. A memory-efficient training framework is also introduced in this paper.

### Strengths
- The authors highlight a neglected problem in the XMC dual-encoder training stage. The proposed Decoupled Loss effectively solves this problem.
- The theoretical part of the paper is well-presented, with Section 3 providing clear symbol definitions.

### Weaknesses
- The main motivation for this paper is the imperfect design of current dual-encoder training loss. However, there is a lack of evidence that this has been a general issue for current XMC methods. Most discussions and experiments are designed to compare the Decoupled Loss and regular loss using the authors' own training framework. Some experiments are implemented using a synthetic dataset (Fig. 2) or pre-selected labels (Fig. 3). After reading the entire paper, I believe the proposed loss can solve the mentioned problem, but I am not convinced that this problem is a universal issue in the XMC community.
- The paper lacks novelty. A minor revision of the training loss may not be sufficient for a top conference paper.

### Questions
- Please address the questions mentioned in the Weaknesses section.

### Summary
Dual-encoder models have achieved substantial success in dense retrieval tasks for open-domain question answering, especially in zero-shot and few-shot scenarios. However, their performance in many-shot retrieval problems, where abundant training data is available, such as extreme multi-label classification (XMC), has received limited attention. Existing evidence indicates that dual-encoder methods tend to underperform compared to state-of-the-art extreme classification methods that scale the number of learnable parameters linearly with the number of classes in such tasks. Some recent extreme classification techniques combine dual-encoders with a learnable classification head for each class to excel in these scenarios. This paper explores the potential of "pure" dual-encoder models in XMC tasks and provides insights for XMC.

### Strengths
Important Research Problem: The paper addresses a significant and relevant problem in the field of machine learning - extreme multi-label classification. This is a challenging task with practical applications, and the choice of topic adds value to the existing literature.

Interesting Approach: The idea of using dual-encoders for solving the problem is intriguing and adds a novel dimension to the research. This innovative approach can potentially open up new avenues for tackling similar problems in the future.

Comprehensive Experimental Validation: One of the strengths of the paper is its thorough experimental validation. The fact that the proposed approach has been tested on multiple datasets indicates a comprehensive evaluation of its effectiveness. This enhances the credibility of the findings and their potential applicability to real-world scenarios.

### Weaknesses
I do not find obvious flaws. One notable weakness is the lack of clarity in articulating the paper's contributions. It's important for the reader to clearly understand what novel insights or advancements are being offered. The paper should explicitly state the unique contributions and why they matter in the context of extreme multi-label classification. This clarity is crucial for both researchers and practitioners in the field.
To enhance the paper, it would be beneficial to provide a more structured and explicit statement of the research's contribution and significance in introduction section. This will help the readers better grasp the key takeaways from the study. Additionally, the paper could benefit from improved organization and flow to ensure that the reader can easily follow the arguments and findings.
