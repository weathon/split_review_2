- Decision: Accept
- Scores: 6, 6, 6, 6

## Abstract
This paper studies the sample-efficiency of learning in Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs), a challenging problem in reinforcement learning that is known to be exponentially hard in the worst-case. Motivated by real-world settings such as loading in game playing, we propose an enhanced feedback model called ``multiple observations in hindsight'', where after each episode of interaction with the POMDP, the learner may collect multiple additional observations emitted from the encountered latent states, but may not observe the latent states themselves. We show that sample-efficient learning under this feedback model is possible for two new subclasses of POMDPs: \emph{multi-observation revealing POMDPs} and \emph{distinguishable POMDPs}. Both subclasses generalize and substantially relax \emph{revealing POMDPs}---a widely studied subclass for which sample-efficient learning is possible under standard trajectory feedback. Notably, distinguishable POMDPs only require the emission distributions from different latent states to be \emph{different} instead of \emph{linearly independent} as required in revealing POMDPs.

### Summary
Summary: 

The papers consider learning in POMDPs, where in addition to receiving a single observation along the trajectory as is the case for standard POMDP setting, the learner can also get K additional observations from the corresponding latent states at every timestep (but at the end of the trajectory). The authors consider structural assumptions under which learning with K-observations is statistically tractable and provide algorithms to tackle them. The main results are as follows: 
1. First, the authors show via a lower bound that even under the K observation model, we need additional assumptions to make learning tractable. 
2. Then they consider additional structural called multi-observation revealing POMDPs and distinguishable POMDPs under which statistically efficient learning is possible. The former considers a rank-type assumption on the observation matrix whereas the latter considers a separability assumption on the columns. The two assumptions are equivalent to each other up to polynomial factor blow-up in k. 
3. They provide algorithms for efficient learning under the above assumptions.

### Strengths
1. A new framework to consider POMDPs, and get statistically efficient algorithms. 
2. Easy-to-understand analysis. The paper is only 20 pages long which is rare in the modern RL theory literature. This is primarily because the approach heavily builds on the OMLE algorithm from Liu et. al. 2022a. 
3. A complete set of results.

### Weaknesses
1. The considered approaches are only statistically efficient. Can the authors provide a discussion on the possibility of getting computationally efficient or oracle-efficient algorithms? 
2. I am not yet convinced by the motivation for considering k-observation settings, or natural problem settings where one can get k-observations in hindsight at the end of the trajectory. Can the authors provide examples of settings where (a) one can get k-observations, but (b) we do not have the ability to reset to the latent state (or generative model)? My worry is that the ability to reset to the latent state needs knowledge of the latent state which is practically equivalent to hindsight observability (in the game playing example provided in the paper one seems to need knowledge of the latent state to reset).  


Another related work to compare to: "Agnostic Reinforcement Learning with Low-Rank MDPs and Rich Observations", Dann et. al. 2021. Their algorithm seems to work for POMDP settings with low-rank dynamics - while the dependence on d is exponential, their work does not seem to require any lower bound on \alpha and thus could be applicable when d is small/constant but \alpha could be arbitrarily small. I am pointing this out because the authors seem to portray \alpha-distinguishable POMDPs as the largest class of POMDPs that could be solvable statistically efficiently, however,  Dann et. al. 2021 gives another example which is solvable under orthogonal assumptions.

### Questions
Apart from the ones listed in the weaknesses above. I have a few more questions: 

1. Can the authors provide examples / settings where there is a computational or statistical separation between K = 1 and K > 1. I am guessing that proposition 3 already captures this, but can you please provide more intuition on why we can expect such separation. 
2. Are there settings where one can get k-observations but only at the end of the episode? In particular, one needs to wait to terminate to get more observations. 
3.  From what I understand, it is a feature of the algorithm that only needs full trajectory information to construct MLEs. Hence, there is no separation between getting k-observations in real-time or at the end of the episode. Is there a fundamental separation between the two settings? 
4. What is the dependence on H in the sample complexity bound?

### Summary
This paper studied how to achieve sample-efficient learning in POMDPs, which have been known to be exponentially hard in the worst case. How to identify efficient feedback model and provide efficient learning algorithms for the challenging POMDP problem has been an important problem in the community. This paper studied the settings with additional observations generated by the latent unknown states at the end of the episode. With these additional observations and the additional assumptions, i.e., definition 2 and definition 7, this paper proposed efficient learning algorithms with performance guarantees.

### Strengths
1. This paper studied the important and challenging POMDP problem, and showed two new subclasses where efficient learning is possible.

2. This paper provided efficient learning algorithms for the new subclasses with performance guarantees.

### Weaknesses
1. The model and assumptions are not well-justified.

2. The solution seems to be a simple extension of the existing results for weakly-revealing settings.

### Questions
1. Could you provide one or more practical examples for the model with multiple observations?

2. Could you explain the practical meaning of the assumptions, e.g., definition 2 and definition 7?

3. Could you give a clearer explanation for the differences between your results and those for weakly-revealing settings, since it seems the algorithm developments and performance analyses are quite similar?

### Summary
The paper introduces two new subclasses of POMDP, multi-observation revealing POMDPs and distinguishable POMDPs. The paper shows a connection between the two classes of POMDPs and shows that sample-efficient learning in both classes is possible.

### Strengths
The work builds on the ongoing effort to establish classes of POMDPs for which sample efficient learning is possible. The new classes of POMDPs are formally and rigorously defined, and their introduction is backed by practical motivation. Bounds on sample efficiency are established and proved, with some proofs using less common techniques of distribution testing embedded in the algorithm. I have read and I believe I understood the proofs, although I cannot swear that the proofs are correct.

### Weaknesses
It is not clear to me whether MO revealing POMDPs are novel --- see my question below. 

It is not clear to me from the paper how hindsight observations are related/required. It seems that MO revealing POMDPs are defined independently of hindsight observability. Definition 2 does not require or that the observations are obtained in the hindsight.

The significant results of the work seems to be only applicable to tabular POMDPs, which only becomes clear deep into the paper. I believe that should be stated early.

Minor: the bibliography is not properly capitalized. Abbreviations (POMDP, PAC etc.) and names should be capitalized.

### Questions
1. What is the difference between k-MO revealing POMDPs in this work and MO revealing POMDPs in https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/chen23ae.html, Definition 1?

2. How does obtaining multiple observations in **hindsight** affect the learnability/sample efficiency? Why the same sample efficiency cannot be achieved with the observations obtained online?

3. Shouldn't learnability for alpha-distinguishable POMPDs be established in a PAC setting rather than absolutely?

### Summary
This work studies the problem of sample-efficient learning in POMDP. Especially, a new feedback model is discussed, i.e., multiple observations in hindsight, where instead of one observation in canonical POMDP setting, after one trajectory, multiple extra observations can be obtained. This feedback model extends the canonical single-observation feedback model in POMDP and is suitable to capture applications such as game-playing where replaying or loading is enabled.

Based on this new feedback model, one new revealing condition is presented, i.e., multi-observation revealing, which is extended from canonical revealing conditions in POMDP. Based on this condition, the k-OMLE design is first proposed, which is demonstrated to be sample efficient. Then, a second class of POMDP, defined as distinguishable POMDP, is also introduced, which relies on the intuition that different states should have distinct observation generation. The relationship between multi-observation revealing POMDP and distinguishable POMDP is established. Furthermore, leveraging the techniques from closeness testing and POMDP with hindsight observation, a new design, OST, is proposed, which is also demonstrated to be sample efficient.

### Strengths
- The POMDP problem has received growing interest in recent years and this work is a valuable investigation following the line of identifying learnable subclass of POMDP, which makes reasonable contribution.

- The overall motivation is also clear, i.e., having a class of POMDP with stronger feedback than single observation while still weaker than directly revealing the true state. Having multiple observations is also a valid and practical consideration in my view as indeed replaying or loading is often allowed in settings such as game-playing.

- The paper is organized well and the overall flow is quite clear. Although being technically heavy, the key points and main intuitions are explained well.

### Weaknesses
- The major concern that I have is that this work mainly rely on techniques from previous works. Especially, k-OMLE, as the authors stated, is a different instantiation of the OMLE algorithm, and the proof is also extended rather straightforwardly. While I do believe using closeness testing and the notion of distinguishable POMDP are interesting, the OST design is then about returning to the POMDP design with exact hindsight observability.

### Questions
- First, it would be really helpful if the authors can illustrate more on the technical innovation of this work. Especially, I would love to know whether the authors believe the main contribution of this work is to identify new subclasses of POMDP while the leveraged techniques are mostly same as previous works.

- Also, in the design of OST, as stated in Theorem 11, the value of \alpha is required to determine the value of k, which seems to be a rather stringent condition. I would love to hear about the authors' opinion on this.
