# Enhancing High-Resolution 3D Generation through Pixel-wise Gradient Clipping

- Decision: Accept
- Scores: 6, 6, 6

## Abstract
High-resolution 3D object generation remains a challenging task primarily due to the limited availability of comprehensive annotated training data. Recent advancements have aimed to overcome this constraint by harnessing image generative models, pretrained on extensive curated web datasets, using knowledge transfer techniques like Score Distillation Sampling (SDS).
Efficiently addressing the requirements of high-resolution rendering often necessitates the adoption of latent representation-based models, such as the Latent Diffusion Model (LDM). In this framework, a significant challenge arises: 
To compute gradients for individual image pixels, it is necessary to backpropagate gradients from the designated latent space through the frozen components of the image model, such as the VAE encoder used within LDM. However, this gradient propagation pathway has never been optimized, remaining uncontrolled during training.
We find that the unregulated gradients adversely affect the 3D model's capacity in acquiring texture-related information from the image generative model, 
leading to poor quality appearance synthesis.
To address this overarching challenge, we propose an innovative operation termed {\em \model{}} (PGC) designed for seamless integration into existing 3D generative models, thereby enhancing their synthesis quality. Specifically, 
we control the magnitude of stochastic gradients by clipping the {\em pixel-wise} gradients efficiently,
while preserving crucial texture-related gradient directions.
Despite this simplicity and minimal extra cost, extensive experiments demonstrate the efficacy of our PGC
in enhancing the performance of existing 3D generative models
for high-resolution object rendering.

### Summary
In the field of high-resolution 3D object generation, the limited availability of training data necessitates the widespread use of knowledge transfer techniques. However, in such methods (SDS), it is challenging to control gradients at the pixel level when applying pretrained models. To address this issue, this paper proposes a method called Pixel-wise Gradient Clipping (PGC) to effectively control gradients and incorporate them into existing 3D generation models. The proposed PGC offers a straightforward approach that can greatly aid in rendering high-quality, high-resolution objects. This paper proposes a reasonable approach within the context of previous research efforts in the actively studied field of 3D object generation to achieve high-quality results in high resolution. It introduces not only regularization for Score Distillation sampling but also Pixel-wise normalized gradient descent (PNGD) to preserve the details of textures. These techniques aim to generate high-resolution outputs with excellent quality.

### Strengths
This paper provides a clear and intuitive explanation of the proposed PGC and PNGD methods, showcasing high-quality results that align with these techniques. Additionally, considering the inherent ambiguity in defining metrics in the field, the paper presents indirect yet convincing numerical values through user studies. Furthermore, qualitative results are presented through experiments on mesh optimization, demonstrating significant performance improvements.

### Weaknesses
I think it would be better if there is an in-depth analysis regarding the gradient control aspect of the proposed method. It would be beneficial to have more thorough consideration and analysis on how the gradient is influenced by the proposed method compared to the vanilla model. Presenting a more comprehensive investigation and analysis in this regard would enhance the paper. It is disappointing that the stability of the gradient through PGC and PNGD is only demonstrated through the results without further analysis.

### Questions
1. I am curious if there were any side effects that arose from applying the proposed method to 3D object generation.
2. I am curious if there are any experimental results for more unusual exceptional samples that were tested for comparison evaluation.

### Summary
This paper aims to address gradient-related issues in typical Latent Diffusion Models used for 3D generation. This paper finds that the unregulated gradients through image models are harmful for the 3D models to capture correct and fine textures. To solve this problem, this paper proposes Pixel-wise Gradient Clipping (PGC) that clips the pixel-wise gradients by norm. Experiments show improved performance over baselines such as Fantasia3D.

### Strengths
1. The paper is well-written and easy to follow and understand. For example, section 3 provides enough background on score distillation sampling and gradient clipping to motivate the observations of optimization issue in existing models and the proposals on pixel-wise gradient clipping.

2. This paper targets at an important goal: improving gradient flows that 3D models obtain from 2D diffusion models. This is critical because many existing text/image-to-3D models rely on pretrained 2D diffusion models to guide the optimization of a 3D model. An effective tool can potentially benefit lots of related work.

3. The proposed PGC seem to be effective over a few baselines such as Fantasia3D+SDXL.

### Weaknesses
1. Insufficient ablation study
The paper reviews parameter-wise normalized Gradient Descent (NGD) and Gradient Clipping (GC) in Sec. 3.2 & 3.3 and proposes pixel-wise NGD and GC in Sec. 4.3 & 4.4. Pixel gradients are computed from parameter gradients, and bounded parameter gradients may result in bounded pixel gradients too -- an alternative of the proposed Sec. 4.3 & 4.4 to limit pixel gradient magnitudes. Therefore, parameter-wise NGD and GC would have served as good baselines for ablation study. However, the paper only showed results of pixel-wise NGD and GC but not results of parameter-wise NGD and GC or other simple ways to bound pixel gradients. 

2. Insufficient experiments to show that the proposed method "benefit existing SDS and LDM-based 3D generative models"
The paper claims "PGC consistently benefit existing SDS and LDM-based 3D generative models", but experiments only compared with two baselines: Stable-DreamFusion and (SDXL variant of) Fantasia3D, which are not published state-of-the-arts and not sufficient to support the claim. For example, ProlificDreamer [Wang et al. 2023] and improved Fantasia3D (https://github.com/Gorilla-Lab-SCUT/Fantasia3D "Q7") can produce more realistic texture results than the compared baselines. Will the proposed PGC still be effective on top these two methods?

### Questions
1. Since this paper mostly focuses on addressing the gradient issues, I would suggest adding a paragraph in Sec. 2 to review general gradient-related techniques and their connections&differences with the proposed method. Example related papers include:
[a] Zhang et al. Why Gradient Clipping Accelerates Training: A Theoretical Justification for Adaptivity. ICLR 2020.
[b] Zhang et al. Improved analysis of clipping algorithms for non-convex optimization. NeurIPS 2020.
[c] Brock et al. High-Performance Large-Scale Image Recognition Without Normalization. ICML 2021. 
[d] Koloskova et al. Revisiting Gradient Clipping: Stochastic bias and tight convergence guarantees. ICML 2023.

2. Minor suggestions: 
(1) Currently the texts that refer to Fig. 2 are scattered all around. It may improve the clarity a lot by adding a few sentences in the caption to explain different columns in Fig. 2.
(2) Typo: last paragraph before Sec. 4.3: "xt-1" --> "x_{t-1}"

### Summary
The paper identifies a critical and generic issue in optimizing high-resolution 3D models by exploiting latent diffusion models. To address this problem, the paper analyzes the gradient propagation process and proposes a simple and effective gradient clipping technique. The paper demonstrates the proposed techniques can be used as a generic plug-in method to improve a body of works based on LDM.

### Strengths
The paper identifies an important problem in LDM based 3D AIGC method, and proposes a simple and effective technique to solve this problem. I like the general idea of this paper. I think it can benefit a large amount of future work in this field.

### Weaknesses
(1) The most important Figure in the paper, i.e. Figure 2, is unclear to me.
* Figure 2 is first referenced in Section 3.1. For me, it's very hard to understand the meaning and experiment setup of this Figure. What's the meaning of the three rows respectively? What's the task of Figure 2, is the mesh fixed while only optimizing the texture? Many important details are missed in my eyes; it makes me feel hard to follow the paper.

(2) Some other figures and descriptions are unclear to me. More necessary details should be provided.
* In Figure 6, what is the meaning of the 6 images in the right column? Is the gradient?
* Can the author provide more illustrations to support Section 4.5?

### Questions
(1) In Section 4.2, it says "we observe that the difference between x and \hat{x} remains strictly constrained within the interval of (0, 1) due to RGB restrictions". I think the range of the difference should be in [-1,1]. Did I miss something?

(2) Can the author provide some insights on why "this constraint plays a crucial role in stabilizing the training process for the 3D model"?

(3) Another way is to clip the gradient of the entire term, i.e. (eps_phi - eps) * dz/dx, rather than the dz/dx. Can the author comment on this alternative method?
