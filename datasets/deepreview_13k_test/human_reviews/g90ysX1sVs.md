# Adaptive Rational Activations to Boost Deep Reinforcement Learning

- Decision: Accept
- Scores: 8, 8, 8, 6

## Abstract
Latest insights from biology show that intelligence not only emerges from the connections between neurons, but that individual neurons shoulder more computational responsibility than previously anticipated. Specifically, neural plasticity should be critical in the context of constantly changing reinforcement learning (RL) environments, yet current approaches still primarily employ static activation functions. In this work, we motivate the use of adaptable activation functions in RL and show that rational activation functions are particularly suitable for augmenting plasticity. Inspired by residual networks, we derive a condition under which rational units are closed under residual connections and formulate a naturally regularised version. The proposed joint-rational activation allows for desirable degrees of flexibility, yet regularises plasticity to an extent that avoids overfitting by leveraging a mutual set of activation function parameters across layers. We demonstrate that equipping popular algorithms with (joint) rational activations leads to consistent improvements on different games from the Atari Learning Environment benchmark, notably making DQN competitive to DDQN and Rainbow. \\ \qquad %$^\star$Correspondence to \href{mailto:quentin.delfosse@cs.tu-darmstadt.de}{quentin.delfosse@cs.tu-darmstadt.de}.

### Summary
The paper argues for plasticity in RL through adaptive activation functions. It proposes using (safe) rational activation functions as a plug-in modification to existing value-based RL methods (DQN-style algorithms).

The authors first motivate the need for plasticity through activation functions in constantly changing reinforcement learning environments. They categorize environments into static, dynamic, and progressively evolving environments. The authors then show how existing methods, such as DQN and non-rational plasticity variants (PELU), fail to adapt to all changes, whereas rational activations can.

Having established Rational activation functions as promising candidates for imbuing existing neural networks with plasticity, the authors show that rational activation functions can embed residual connections. Using this insight, they develop a joint rational activation function that is a regularized form of rational plasticity through weight-sharing across activations in different layers.

The authors finally demonstrate through experiments that equipping popular algorithms such as a DQN with rational activations leads to consistent improvements in performance on Atari games, elevating them to be competitive alternatives to highly engineered and computationally expensive methods such as RAINBOW.

### Strengths
### Originality
The proposed application of the activation function to the RL pipeline is a novel contribution. 

### Quality
The quality of the work is generally high.

### Clarity
The work is generally presented clearly.

### Significance
Activation function optimization has shown considerable success in other areas, such as pruning. Therefore, applying them as an alternative to heavy architectural search and per-environment hyperparameter optimization methods is a significant step.

### Weaknesses
- The work seems to miss some previous work on plasticity in RL. Please see the questions section for more information on related works. Overall, I think discussing this would further concretize the argumentation for rational plasticity while placing this work better in the RL literature. 
- Hyperparameters are not at all discussed as a requirement for adaptation. I believe this is a critical aspect of designing RL pipelines, and therefore, a focus on only adaptable Neural architectures is limiting, in my opinion. It would make a lot of sense if the authors explicitly state how they see their work as related to this literature.
- I think the baselines need more justification. While it is understandable that the focus is on activation functions, so comparisons with static methods make sense, the authors also argue that the dynamically changing nature of rational activations allows RL agents to adapt to changing environmental circumstances. This usability argument, in my opinion, is not captured by the considered baselines since, most of the time, when we are talking about addressing changing aspects of environments, the focus is either on algorithmic improvements, continual and curriculum-based methods, or dynamic hyperparameter adaptation mechanisms. I believe either making strong arguments as to why the authors do not consider these approaches or performing comparisons to one of them would significantly boost this line of argumentation.

### Questions
- How is this rational plasticity related to previous works on plasticity in RL? [Sokar et. al, 2023, Abbas et. al, 2023,Lyle et al., 2023,Nishikin et al., 2022]
- Parametric forms to capture existing activation functions have previously been used in supervised learning [Loni et al., 2023]. How is the rational form placed regarding these works? Does the comparison to SiLU and PELU capture this already?
- It is argued in sections 1 and 2 that RL can significantly benefit from adaptive neural architectures. However, another critical aspect of RL algorithms is hyperparameter optimization, with potentially the requirement to adapt hyperparameters as an RL agent dynamically trains [Mohan et al., 2023]. To what extent can the adaptable rational activation functions in RL mitigate these requirements?
- Since the benefit of applying rational activation functions lies in their ability to adjust their parameters dynamically, shouldn't they be additionally compared to Baselines of dynamic hyperparameter optimization, such as hyperparameter schedules [Zahavy et al., 2020], progressive episode lengths [Fuks et al., 2019]? I think it makes sense to at least justify whether relationships between the use of rational activation functions for improving adaptability and methods to tackle the same issue in this literature does exist or not.

### Summary
The manuscript argues that plasticity is important for RL. The paper proposes rational activation functions for RL. It also proposes a regularized version of the activation function (joint rational). The results show that rational activation functions significantly outperform rigid activation functions like leaky-ReLU.

### Strengths
The idea of using rational activation functions to inject plasticity is very interesting, and the results are promising. DQN with rational activation functions significantly outperforms vanilla DQN. The use of rational activation in RL seems novel. I'm not aware of any work that uses these activations in RL. Most of the paper is clearly written and easy to understand.

### Weaknesses
Although the paper contains exciting ideas and promising results, there are many significant weaknesses in the paper that stop me from recommending a full acceptance. 
- **Missing literature on plasticity.** The manuscript needs to include the entire literature on plasticity. There are already many papers that show that there is a loss of plasticity when deep learning systems face a non-stationary data stream, such as in RL (Dohare et al., 2021; Lyle et al., 2022; Nikishin et al., 2022; Abbas et al., 2023; Lyle et al., 2023; Sokar et al., 2023; Nikishin et al., 2023; Dohare et al., 2023). Missing this literature also means that the paper is missing important baselines in the paper methods like CReLUs, selective reinitialization, layer normalization, etc. I realize that doing a full comparison in Atari with all of these methods might not be computationally feasible, but they should be compared in a smaller problem.
- **Unsupported conclusions.** The manuscript claims that rational activation functions help because they inject plasticity. However, the paper does not provide any direct evidence of this claim. The paper shows that deep RL methods with rational activations outperform deep RL methods with rigid activations. Better performance does not mean better plasticity. However, this problem can be somewhat reduced by comparing rational and rigid activations in a continual supervised learning problem like random label MNIST (Lyle et al., 2023) or permuted MNIST (Dohare et al., 2023). Then, we will have direct evidence that rational activations inject plasticity.

### Questions
Can you please clarify what exactly is the rational activation function? The definition says $R(x)$ where x is a real number, but the equation uses $x^j$, what is $x^j$?

### Summary
Neural plasticity has been shown to be crucial to reinforcement learning (RL), especially to environments that change constantly and/or rapidly. This work proposes the use of adaptive activation functions to increase plasticity. Particualrly, it employs a form of rational activation functions, i.e., joint-rational activation, to have greater flexibility while avoiding overfitting. Experimentally, the work shows that such functions can make DQN competitive with DDQN and Rainbow without all the additional techniques.

### Strengths
1. The work tackles the important problem of plasticity in deep RL with a novel method based on adaptive activation functions.
2. Showing using rational functions can compensate for residual block is an intriguing and insightful finding

### Weaknesses
1. Missing related works in the study of plasticity in deep RL (e.g., [1])
2. There are works out there that tackles plasticity in deep RL. They should be added as baselines to compare with the proposed method (e.g., [2], [3])
3. Results would be a lot stronger if it can show that the results transfer across algorithms too (e.g., policy gradient methods)

### Questions

2. Can the authors provide some intuition on why improved plasticity lead to reduced overestimation?

### Summary
The authors study the use of rational activation functions for RL.  They show that these functions embed residual connections.  They study them empirically.

### Strengths
An interesting, well-motivated idea, with a large number of various, potentially significant contributions.

### Weaknesses
**Small edits and minor recommendations:**

- "emphasise" spelling error in 2.1
- In the “Network Architecture” section of the appendix, there is a parentheses mismatch.
- Does “resp.” mean respectively?  This stumped me for a couple minutes, I suggest being more clear and not using abbreviations like this, or at least defining them before use.
- 2.3: “However, if we circle back to this figure” Which figure? Be more clear; don’t make your reader work unnecessarily hard to understand.

**Clarity Weaknesses:**
- 2.1: the authors say very little about the architecture.  Is it conv nets?  Is the number of units between the baselines and their approach fixed, and they replace each unit’s activation function with a rational plasticity unit (resulting in many more parameters for their approach)?  Or do they replace whole layers with a single rational plasticity unit (the parenthetical in 2.1 seems to hint at this, but it’s unclear)?  Or do they keep all units from each layer intact, and add a singe additional rational plasticity unit (if I recall correctly, this is what the original rational activation function paper did)?  These things are critically important pieces of information about this paper’s results (this is essentially an architecture paper, but the reader is left guessing about the most basic aspects of the architectures used), and this critical information should not be relegated to an appendix.  Worse, the last last question (how exactly rational plasticity units replace traditional units in an architecture) is unclear to me, even after reading the Network Architecture section of the appendix.  Update on this last: more details are given, almost parenthetically, on page 6 and again on page 8 (in the Q4 discussion).  However, the long delay hinders clarity, and even with these details, the exact details of the approach/architecture remain unclear.  I suggest clarifying all of these questions in 2.1; a figure could be very helpful.

- “To this end, we also show agents equipped with rational activations that are tempered in Fig. 2. They have been extracted from agents with rational plasticity, that adapted to their specific environment. The plasticity of the rational activation functions is then tempered (“stopped”) in repeated application to emphasise the necessity to continuously adapt during training.” I am not sure exactly what this means; it is too vague and can think of several different interpretations with very different meanings.  In the second sentence, it sounds like they freeze these rational activations after a while, but let the other network weights continue to be optimized.  But then the third sentence seems to contradict this (what does “repeated application” mean, and why would freezing some parameters “emphasize the necessity to continuously adapt”?)

- 2.2 Theorem concern: The precise meaning of this theorem is unclear.  As stated, it can easily be taken to mean that all rational activation functions implicitly contain a residual connection.  But if I’m understanding the proof correctly, it seems to indicate that it depends on the weights; that is, that a residual connection can be learned if necessary.  This is confusing and potentially misleading.  I suggest stating the Theorem more precisely.

- 2.3: “regularized joint-rationals, where the key idea is to constraint the input to propagate through different layers but always be activated by the same learnable rational activation function”.  This is incredibly vague, and does not tell the reader what this approach means (and this sentence seems to constitute the entire description of joint rationals).

**Other weaknesses:**
- Is plasticity actually causing the better results?  Q3 is a very nice analysis, and provides evidence that the proposed approach reduces overestimation.  However, it is not clearly demonstrated that: 1) the plasticity in particular is what causes this reduction in overestimation OR 2) that the reduction in overestimation is what causes the improved performance in Q1 and Q2. BOTH of these things would need to be shown to support the authors’ claims.  In fact, Figure 2 shows evidence against the former: rational activation functions in general seem to simply perform better even for stationary environments, which is nice, but seems to contradict the core thesis of the paper (rational activation functions cause better plasticity which in turn causes better performance).
- The above is even more concerning in light of the lack of details about architectures used.  Perhaps the better performance is simply due to their approach using networks with more parameters and thus more capacity?  Unfortunately, it is not even clear how the different approaches’ architectures vary, so it is difficult for a reader to even begin to evaluate this concern.


Note: Despite the many significant concerns I have about this paper, I think it already has many nice results and strengths as well, in addition to being a well-motivated work.  If a rating of 4 were an option, I would give it a 4 instead of a 3.  I encourage the authors to work to address the clarity issues and the "Is plasticity actually causing the better results?" concern, and resubmit; I think this is a potentially very strong contribution.
