- Decision: Reject
- Scores: 5, 6, 6, 6

## Abstract
When training neural networks with custom objectives, such as ranking losses and shortest-path losses, a common problem is that they are, per se, non-differentiable.
A popular approach is to continuously relax the objectives to provide gradients, enabling learning.
However, such differentiable relaxations are often non-convex and can exhibit vanishing and exploding gradients, making them (already in \mbox{isolation}) hard to optimize.
Here, the loss function poses the bottleneck when training a deep neural network.
We present Newton Losses, a method for improving the performance of existing hard to optimize losses by exploiting their second-order information via their empirical Fisher and Hessian matrices.
Instead of training the neural network with second-order techniques, we only utilize the loss function's second-order information to replace it by a Newton Loss, while training the network with gradient descent. 
This makes our method computationally efficient.
We apply Newton Losses to eight differentiable algorithms for sorting and shortest-paths, achieving significant improvements for less-optimized differentiable algorithms, and consistent improvements, even for well-optimized differentiable algorithms.

### Summary
The presented study considers the problem of training weakly-supervised problems, including differentiable shortest path or sorting algorithms. The main idea is to split the computing of the loss function in a superposition of two functions and update the corresponding parameters in an alternating manner. In particular, Newton method update is used for the first function and the standard SGD-like update is used for the second one. Also, such splitting at least preserves stationary points of the initial loss function. In Newton's method, both the exact Hessian matrix and the Fisher matrix are considered to precondition the gradient.  The authors provide pseudocode on how to incorporate the proposed approach in PyTorch-like code. The experiments demonstrate that Newton Losses lead to higher test accuracy for sorting supervision losses and shortest-path supervision.

### Strengths
The strengths of the presented study are listed below
- the main text is well-written. The motivation, appropriate context, and the proposed approach are clear and original.
- the construction of Newton's losses has a theoretical basis which guarantees the same stationary points
- experimental results are solid and demonstrate the performance of the proposed approach over the baseline

### Weaknesses
The main weakness of the presented approach is that the authors consider explicit construction of Hessian or Fischer matrices and directly inverse it. Matrix inversion is the numerically unstable operation in the ill-conditioned case, see (Higham, 1993 - https://eprints.maths.manchester.ac.uk/346/1/covered/MIMS_ep2006_167.pdf). This issue may be crucial in the single-precision format which is typically used in deep learning. In addition, storage of the full square matrix with a dimension equal to the number of model parameters can be prohibited for large models. Thus, this step in the proposed method lacks detailed analysis and requires more in-depth investigation in terms of scalability and robustness to round-off errors. For example, the iterative methods for solving large symmetrix linear systems can exploit hessian-by-vector product operation without explicitly composing the hessian matrix due to automatic differentiation tools. Also, the linear systems in the optimizing first function can be solved with different tolerances in the Inexact Newton method manner, which may significantly affect both runtime and final performance.

### Questions
1) how scalable is your approach in terms of the size of the dataset and the number of model parameters?
2) what are specific issues related to the solving of weakly supervised learning problems? The authors mention non-convexity and exploding/vanishing gradients, but the same issues arise in the classical image classification models. Please, provide more details regarding the mentioned learning problems' features.
3) the presented runtime analysis in Supplementary B confuses me since in some cases the proposed method with additional costs per iteration is faster than the baseline. Please provide a more detailed description of the reason for such a result. Also, I disagree that the inversion of the matrix is inexpensive since it is $O(n^3)$ complexity and it is small only for the small dimension $n$. Therefore, we again come to question 1) on the scalability of the proposed method
4) the authors report only mean values of the target metrics in the main text. Could you please append the standard deviations, too, for a fair comparison of the methods?
5) please, add axis labels in Fig. 3
6) also, captions to tables are typically placed above the table, not below

### Summary
This paper proposes Newton Losses, a new optimization scheme for training machine learning models with hard-to-optimize losses. The idea is to compute second-order updates of the loss with respect to the model output, and then back-propagating those to the parameters using standard first-order methods. This can be viewed as replacing the original loss with a new quadratic loss around the minimizer of a quadratic approximation of the original loss, which the authors refer to as a Newton Loss.

Two possible second-order methods are presented for approximating the original loss around a batch of model outputs, based on either the Hessian or the empirical Fisher, leading to two possible instantiations of Newton losses. Both methods are regularized with Tikhonov regularization, which controls the influence of the Newton loss compared to standard gradient descent.

The implementation is shown to be simple for the Hessian Newton Loss, which requires accessing and inverting the Hessian, and even simpler for the Fisher Newton Loss, which only requires minor modifications to the implementation of standard gradient descent.
Two weakly-supervised problem settings are considered, namely MNIST digit sorting and Warcraft shortest paths. In these settings 8 algorithmic losses are compared to their Newton loss counterparts. Both the Fisher and the Hessian Newton Loss are shown to yield improved performance, with the margin depending on the difficulty of the algorithmic loss function as well as the quality of the Hessian approximation.

### Strengths
This paper proposes a novel method for optimizing machine learning models with algorithmic losses. The paper was a good read, the method and results are presented with clarity. The experimental setup and the underlying choices were described in detail, and the improvements seem to be consistent over the setups. Good explanations were also provided for the cases in which the method does not work well, which gives a nice guideline for practitioners that want to employ this method. The authors have also been transparent about potential limitations regarding the runtime.

### Weaknesses
While the results show consistent improvements in the experiments, the improvement upon the best performing baselines seems relatively minor compared to the observed standard deviations. 
However, the method seems to especially improve performance on suboptimal baselines, which could transfer very well to potential new experimental setups.

Regarding the presentation, I think the standard deviations should also be included in the main paper and not deferred to the appendix, as they seem very important for correctly interpreting the presented results. I also have some additional questions below. If the authors adequately address these final concerns I believe this paper will make a good contribution to the conference.

### Questions
- In Tables 8-10 it looks like a wide range of the parameter $\lambda$ seems to be used in the experiments. Have the authors found these values purely empirically, or have they been chosen based on e.g. gradient norm? It would also be a useful addition to include an ablation study of how sensitive the performance is to this hyper-parameter for one of the experimental setups.
- In figure 3, does the plot show the number of training epochs on the x-Axis? It seems like this information is missing. This plot could also benefit from averaging over all seeds and including the standard deviations.
- In the proof of Lemma 3, does getting from equation 22 to the final expression require some assumptions on commutativity of the involved matrices? It would be great if the authors could present this final step in a bit more detail.

### Summary
The authors study new algorithms for weakly-supervised learning problems that involve differentiable algorithmic procedures within the loss function. These problems often result in non-convex loss functions with vanishing and exploding gradients, making them difficult to optimize. The authors propose a novel two-step approach to tackle this issue:

1. They first optimize the loss function using Newton's method to handle the gradient issues.
2. Then, they optimize the neural network parameters with gradient descent. The key innovation is the introduction of "Newton Losses," which come in two variants: one using the Hessian (if available) and another using an empirical Fisher variant when the Hessian is not available. The authors tested these Newton Losses in various algorithmic settings and demonstrated significant performance improvements for weakly-performing differentiable algorithms. 

Numerical experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the method.

### Strengths
The method proposes to study a natural gradient method, true one or approximate one in terms of samples, in solving supervised learning problems. Numerical experiments demonstrate the advantage of the proposed method.

### Weaknesses
1. There are very few analytical examples studied in the paper. This could help readers realize the importance of Fisher information matrix. 

2. There are general natural gradient methods in the literature, in particular the Wasserstein natural gradient method. This could be discussed in the introduction.

### Questions
