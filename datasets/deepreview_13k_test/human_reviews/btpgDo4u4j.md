# Efficient Planning with Latent Diffusion

- Decision: Accept
- Scores: 6, 8, 5, 8

## Abstract
Temporal abstraction and efficient planning pose significant challenges in offline reinforcement learning, mainly when dealing with domains that involve temporally extended tasks and delayed sparse rewards. 
Existing methods typically plan in the raw action space and can be inefficient and inflexible. 
Latent action spaces offer a more flexible paradigm, capturing only possible actions within the behavior policy support and decoupling the temporal structure between planning and modeling. 
However, current latent-action-based methods are limited to discrete spaces and require expensive planning.
This paper presents a unified framework for continuous latent action space representation learning and planning by leveraging latent, score-based diffusion models.
We establish the theoretical equivalence between planning in the latent action space and energy-guided sampling with a pretrained diffusion model and incorporate a novel sequence-level exact sampling method. 
Our proposed method, \texttt{LatentDiffuser}, demonstrates competitive performance on low-dimensional locomotion control tasks and surpasses existing methods in higher-dimensional tasks.

### Summary
The authors present a method that addresses offline RL using diffusion modelling. The authors combine several elements from recent work, namely using a latent representation of the path, while sampling latent variables using a diffusion model. The authors moreover make use of recent work that demonstrates effective sampling from energy based distributions. The authors demonstrate the utility of their approach on standard RL baselines and compare against a collection of other methods. They demonstrate improvement in particular for high dimensional tasks.

### Strengths
- The authors demonstrate improvement in the area where they expect their model to do well
 - The paper is well written 
 - Elements seem to fit well together

### Weaknesses
- While I think this is not a very big deal, the paper relies mostly on existing methodologies

### Questions
Overall I enjoyed seeing the elements from previous work come together in this work. I think overall the authors did quite a good job writing this paper, although the overall notation, in particular where x and y get used, together with tau, and state tuples, can be a bit confusing. While the paper is a combination of previous work, in my opinion the algorithm the authors created is novel enough in itself to warrant publication. The authors demonstrate performance in their experiments and, importantly, provide a useful interpretation with their experiments to demonstrate specifically where they expect to make a difference. The current review system precludes 7 as a score, and until I read the rebuttal I am rounding down.
Specific points:
 - Can the authors comment on how the sequence length is determined? Is the sequence terminated externally?
Small stuff
 - A reference for the proof for theorem 1 is missing.
 - Is the text inconsistent with Fig2? It seems like the initial state in Fig 2 is labelled s0, while in the text there is only ever reference to s1 
 - On page 5 typo "emploies".

### Summary
This paper proposes the use of latent diffusion models for planning, especially in tasks with sparse rewards and long horizon. The key proposal is to use continuous latent action space representations for planning, through the use of latent score based diffusion models. The novel framework takes conditional generative models for planning in the latent domain, where the authors learn a latent action representation and use the latents for planning. The authors propose a multi-stage framework to address the issues of current hierarchical offline reinforcement learning algorithms. The framework utilizes diffusion models to learn latent actions from offline datasets. This paper argues the equivalence between planning with latent action representation and energy-guided sampling.

### Strengths
This paper tackles offline RL tasks that require temporal abstraction, and proposes the use of latent action representations and latent actions for planning based on a diffusion based model. The task is formulated as a conditional diffusion problem, conditioning on returns. The paper seems to be well derived from an algorithmic viewpoint, and is one of the early works that seem to do planning based on a latent diffusion based approach. However, in its current form the paper is quite difficult to understand (see my points on weaknesses)

The proposed method scores better or on par with the baselines on multiple benchmarks with higher dimension action space and a long horizon. The paper presents the effectiveness of adding reward-to-go values in the formulation of a trajectory to learn sequence modeling.

### Weaknesses
The paper repeatedly uses terms like the latent action representation and latent action planning, without a carefully derived definition of it. For self consistency, it would be helpful to define these terms more concretely; otherwise, in its current format, the contributions of the paper can be hard to follow. 

I can see that the paper draws inspiration from the TAP paper (Jiang et al., 2023) and integrates a diffuser based latent step within this framework. The paper in its current form can be quite confusing to follow and difficult to understand. 

The model seems overly complicated to understand and it is not clear what the contributions of the paper really are. I understand the relations with the TAP paper and how the work is trying to build from it, but I believe the planning approach based on diffusion doesn’t really have any novel approach? Am I right?

Overall, equation 4 is the objective that needs to be optimzied, with the first term that generates the planning trajectory based on the latents from the diffuser? Am I correct? 

Experimental results are compared with few baselines using the D4RL setup. I believe all the results from 5.1 - 5.3 are using the same setup, although studying different aspects of the proposed algorithm? It probably would have been useful if there were much simpler proof of concept experiments, especially focusing on the planning part and how the diffuser plays a role there?

The experimental results need an explanation of performance in comparison to the baselines.

The paper requires more proofreading as it contains typos (such as “emploies”).

### Questions
Why does the proposed method work on par with the TAP baseline in the Expert dataset of the Adroit task?

Why was the GPT-2 style Transformer chosen over other choices of transformers as the encoder?

What is the total runtime of the proposed method in comparison to the baselines?

### Summary
The authors propose an algorithm to leverage latent diffusion for planning skills in offline RL. Similar to previous works using latent diffusion, this work first trains a transformer encoder/decoder with weak KL regularization to model trajectory sequences, and then trains a diffusion prior to sample these latents. Then, an energy guided sampling method is proposed to plan in this latent skill space through guided diffusion sampling. The approach is evaluated on the D4RL benchmark, where it achieves strong results.

### Strengths
1) Leveraging latent diffusion for offline RL is a very natural extension to previous raw trajectory diffusion works such as Diffuser and Decision Diffuser. Diffusion planning latent space leverages the hierarchical structure of the planning problem very effectively, leaving the low level action prediction to the skill conditioned decoder instead.

2) The experimental results on D4RL are strong and convincing.

3) The work is highly relevant to the growing interest in viewing reinforcement learning through the lens of conditional generative modeling.

4) The paper is written very clearly, with good motivation presented.

### Weaknesses
While I acknowledged the potential strength of hierarchical planning above, since the latent space is weakly regularized, we should not expect there to be too much benefit in leveraging this space for planning as compared to the raw trajectory space. Unlike the case of latent diffusion for image generative modeling where we simply require high quality samples with improved efficiency, here the primary motivation for leveraging latent planning is to plan with higher level skills.

### Questions
1) Could the authors clarify why they expect a weakly regularized latent space to be useful for planning as compared to the raw actions? I see in the appendix that the comparison is made, and raw actions indeed are shown to perform worse. But I would like some intuition for why this should be the case, and if some better hyperparameter tuning could have produced similar results with raw actions.

2) The authors use the return to go predictions from the decoder as Q values. Since TD learning is not done to learn optimal Q functions, these Q values correspond to those of the behavior policy. Is there a reason some form of offline Q learning technique such as CQL/BCQ/IQL was not done? Without doing Q learning, should we expect skill stitching to occur?

I would also encourage the authors to cite a recent paper from Venkatraman et al. [1], which proposes a very similar algorithm. I am happy to recommend this paper for acceptance, primarily due to its strong empirical results and relevance to the current trends in offline RL.
