## Abstract
Byzantine-robust distributed learning (BRDL), in which computing devices are likely to behave abnormally due to accidental failures or malicious attacks, has recently become a hot research topic. However, even in the independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) case, existing BRDL methods will suffer a significant drop on model accuracy due to the large variance of stochastic gradients. Increasing batch sizes is a simple yet effective way to reduce the variance. However, when the total number of gradient computation is fixed, a too-large batch size will lead to a too-small iteration number (update number), which may also degrade the model accuracy. In view of this challenge, we mainly study the effect of batch size when the total number of gradient computation is fixed in this work. In particular, we show that when the total number of gradient computation is fixed, the optimal batch size corresponding to the tightest theoretical upper bound in BRDL increases with the fraction of Byzantine workers. Therefore, compared to the case without attacks, a larger batch size is preferred when under Byzantine attacks. Motivated by the theoretical finding, we propose a novel method called Byzantine-robust stochastic gradient descent with normalized momentum (ByzSGDnm) in order to further increase model accuracy in BRDL. We theoretically prove the convergence of ByzSGDnm for general non-convex cases under Byzantine attacks. Empirical results show that when under Byzantine attacks, compared to the cases of small batch sizes, setting a relatively large batch size can significantly increase the model accuracy, which is consistent with our theoretical results. Moreover, ByzSGDnm can achieve higher model accuracy than existing BRDL methods when under deliberately crafted attacks. In addition, we empirically show that increasing batch sizes has the bonus of training acceleration.

### Confidence
3: You are fairly confident in your assessment. It is possible that you did not understand some parts of the submission or that you are unfamiliar with some pieces of related work. Math/other details were not carefully checked.

### Summary
In this paper, the authors show the effect of batch size on the performance of robust algorithm against Byzantine attacks. More specifically, they characterize the optimal batch size $B^\star$ to choose when the number of gradient computations is fixed. In addition, they present ByzSGDnm, a robust algorithm that uses stochastic gradient descent with normalized momentum. The authors provide a theoretical guarantee of the algorithm on non-convex functions and provide empirical results showing the efficiency of the proposed method.

### Strengths
- The paper is clear and easy to follow.
- Increasing the batch size and normalizing the gradient significantly improve the empirical performance of the model in the i.i.d case.

### Weaknesses
- The proposed algorithm is only studied in a homogeneous setting ("i.i.d. case" in the paper), which is generally not the case in real applications where data between different clients are heterogeneous. Does the author have any ideas or perhaps experimental results on the behavior of the proposed algorithm in the presence of heterogeneous data?

### Questions
Table 6 shows the execution time of the different algorithms for different batch sizes, for a specific and fixed number of epochs. Can the authors explain why they chose to show the results for a fixed number of epochs and not for a specific accuracy achieved? As far as I know, the speed gain obtained by choosing a larger batch size is naturally explained by the fact that we can benefit from the parallelization of computations (in the system side). However, I would find it interesting to understand whether the methods presented are faster to reach a given accuracy with a larger batch size.

### Summary
In this paper, the authors study the optimization problem of Byzantine-robust distributed learning in an i.i.d. case. They propose a new method, called Byzantine-robust stochastic gradient descent with normalized momentum. They prove the convergence guarantee for this algorithm and theoretically analyze the optimal value of batch size.  Also, the dependence of the rate on the batch size is studied experimentally.

### Strengths
1. The presentation of results is written well.
2. Good deep learning experiments.

### Weaknesses
1. In the experimental part of the work, the experiments do not support theoretical analysis. The authors do not compare the performance of the method with optimal batch size value and with another possible choice of it. It would be better if such experiments were in the work. 
2. Also, the experiments with the comparison of convergence rates of the proposed method and previous methods. It would be better to provide some experiments like in this paper https://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.00529.pdf (see Figure 1). 
3. In the work the authors consider a homogeneous setting. Some results in heterogeneous setup can improve the contribution of this work dramatically.

### Questions
1. There is no theoretical comparison between ByzSGDnm and ByzSGDm. Are there any theoretical benefits of ByzSGDnm compared to ByzSGDm? 

 Please see the weaknesses.

### Summary
This work studies Byzantine-robust distributed learning for the i.i.d. non-convex smooth case. The paper proposes two tricks to improve the existing methods, i.e., large batch size and normalized momentum. The authors provide theoretical arguments to show the benefits of large batch size (variance reduction) and prove the convergence of normalized momentum trick. Empirical experiments show that the combination of these two tricks outperforms existing start-of-the-art methods.

### Strengths
1. The proposed normalized momentum shows significant empirical improvement in the small batch size case as shown in table 3 and table 4. 
2. The use of large batch size also significantly boosts the test accuracy under ALIE attack and FoE attack except for KR and CM for the FoE attack cases. 
3. The combination of large batch size and normalized momentum achieves the best empirical performance in nearly every case. 
4. The use of large batch size significantly reduce the wall-clock running time for training fixed number of epochs.

### Weaknesses
1. There exist little theoretical improvements regarding to existing BRDL methods in terms of problem assumptions or convergence rates. In addition, this work only considers i.i.d. cases, which is kind of restrictive if not enough theoretical improvements are obtained.
2. The variance reduction trick using large batch size is a direct consequence of (Karimireddy et al., 2021)), so it is hard to claim that this is one of the main contributions of the current work. Furthermore, the optimization of B is conducted on the upper bounds of the convergence rates, so it does not necessarily leads to faster convergence if we set optimal B. This probably should be made clear in the paper. 
3. The technical elements in proving the convergence of ByzSGDnm are closely related to references such as (Cutkosky & Mehta, 2020), so I am not clear whether there are substantial contributions therein.

### Questions
1. SGDm is not defined before first used. 
2. In proposition 2, equation (5), why the last term has a $\sigma^2$ term, while in the work (Cutkosky & Mehta, 2020), this term is only in $\sigma$. Can you briefly explain why? 
3. Can you explain why KR fails all cases? Is that because KR does not satisfy the definition 1? 
4. Why does CM have degraded performance in table 4 after increasing batch size, this batch size should be right based on its performance in ByzSGDnm, can you provide some comments on that? 
5. In the comparison with Byz-VR-MARINA, why do you use $512\times 8$ batch size for ByzSGDnm, but never uses that for Byz-VR-MARINA?
