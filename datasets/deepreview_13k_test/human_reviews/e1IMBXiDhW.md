- Decision: Reject
- Scores: 8, 6, 6, 3

## Abstract
The maximum entropy encoding framework provides a unified perspective for many non-contrastive learning methods like SimSiam, Barlow Twins, and MEC. 
Inspired by this framework, we introduce Matrix-SSL, a novel approach that leverages matrix information theory to interpret the maximum entropy encoding loss as matrix uniformity loss. Furthermore, Matrix-SSL enhances the maximum entropy encoding method by seamlessly incorporating matrix alignment loss, directly aligning covariance matrices in different branches.
Experimental results reveal that Matrix-SSL outperforms state-of-the-art methods on the ImageNet dataset under linear evaluation settings and on MS-COCO for transfer learning tasks. Specifically, when performing transfer learning tasks on MS-COCO, our method outperforms previous SOTA methods such as MoCo v2 and BYOL up to 3.3\% with only 400 epochs compared to 800 epochs pre-training. We also try to introduce representation learning into the language modeling regime by fine-tuning a 7B model using matrix cross-entropy loss, with a margin of 3.1\% on the GSM8K dataset over the standard cross-entropy loss.

### Confidence
3: You are fairly confident in your assessment. It is possible that you did not understand some parts of the submission or that you are unfamiliar with some pieces of related work. Math/other details were not carefully checked.

### Summary
The authors introduce Matrix-SSL, an approach grounded in matrix
information theory, to improve current SSL methods.  The approach is
motivated through theory and the experiments show improved accuracy.

### Strengths
Casting various contrastive methods in a unifying notation and
framework is helpful and shows the similarity.

The related work and cited literature is extensive and I could not
make out any significant missing literature.

The findings are clearly presented.

### Weaknesses
Table 1 only reports the accuracy of up to 400 epochs.  It would be
interesting to see the dynamics of all approaches after 800 epochs,
are they closer to Matrix-SSL?  It also does not report any mean +-
std over multiple runs.

While I find the experiments convincing, it could reproduce
state-of-the-art better with other methods.  E.g. SimCLR is usually
trained for 1000 epochs, but this is not done in this paper.

### Questions
Why do you think that the method works best for gamma = 1?  

Perhaps the authors could comment on the computational aspect of the method?  Does it slow down training?  If yes, why?

### Summary
The article aims to introduce a unifying information-theoretic framework for self-supervised learning (SSL). For this purpose, the article
 -  Surveys some established SSL methodologies.,
 - Introduces matrix entropy, matrix KL divergence and matrix cross entropy measures,
 - Expresses certain existing SSL loss functions using the matrix cross entropy measure,
 - Proposes a new SSL loss function derived from matrix cross-entropy,
 - Conducts numerical experiments, demonstrating the enhanced performance of the proposed method compared to select existing approaches,
 - Draws a connection of matrix cross entropy with the effective rank.

### Strengths
The article's pursuit of a unifying framework offers a commendable approach. Strategy to employ  matrix information measures to achieve this is intriguing. Moreover, the numerical examples showcase marked enhancements over certain existing methods, underscoring the efficacy of the algorithm derived from this framework.

### Weaknesses
The article lacks a clear organizational structure and consistent notation, making it challenging to follow. Concepts are introduced without adequate explanation or clarity. Additionally, the matrix information measures employed are not innovative; similar methods have been previously applied in the SSL context. The attempt to frame existing methods as special cases within this framework falls short of being convincing and satisfactory. Please see Questions section for details.

### Questions
## INTRODUCTION

- The following reference,

[a] Ozsoy S, Hamdan S, Arik S, Yuret D, Erdogan A. Self-supervised learning with an information maximization criterion. Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems. 2022 Dec 6;35:35240-53,

proposes utilizing "correlative information" maximization for self-supervised learning. Analyzing this paper within the context of the proposed matrix information framework would be interesting, especially since the authors of [a] assert that maximizing correlative information between the representations of augmentations establishes a linear dependence rather than an arbitrary nonlinear one.

- Figure 1: The citation for Coco is absent. It would be beneficial to compare the performances of  Vicreg, [a] (Bardes et. al, 2021), and (Tong et. al, 2023).


### 2.1 CONTRASTIVE AND NON-CONTRASTIVE SELF-SUPERVISED LEARNING

- First paragraph: The discussion here is based on the SimCLR and SimSiam, however, the authors introduce a generic SSL architecture. Furthermore, what is meant by dual networks is not clear at this point.

- Would categorizing this section into subheadings like "Contrastive SSL Approaches" and "Non-Contrastive SSL Approaches" enhance clarity?

- There seems to be inconsistency in the conventions used for sample and augmentation indices in Equations (2) and (3)?

- For Equation (3), is there an underlying assumption about the normalization of the encoder,  such as  $\||z_i^{(k)}\||_2=1$ ?


### 2.2 MATRIX INFORMATION-THEORETIC QUANTITIES
- Could you provide a citation detailing Matrix Entropy. Furthermore, could you discuss its interpretation, and perhaps its existing applications especially within the context of machine learning/SSL?

- Regarding the Matrix Entropy definition, is there a specific assumption about the trace of $\mathbf{A}$ ensuring its eigenvalues form a probability mass function?

- Can you provide interpretations and potential applications of Matrix KL Divergence and MCE?

- Bach 2022's KL divergence doesn't seem to incorporate the  $-\mathbf{P}+\mathbf{Q}$ terms within trace? Could this discrepancy be addressed?

- From the presented definitions, it appears that, unlike Shannon Entropy, MCE does not equate to the sum of Matrix KL and Matrix Entropy. Should there be a $\text{Tr}(\mathbf{P})$ term included in the matrix entropy definition?

- A brief discussion explaining the relevance of these definitions to the SSL problem would be insightful.


### 3 MATRIX INFORMATION-THEORETIC PERSPECTIVES OF SELF-SUPERVISED LEARNING

- The assertion about proofs should be positioned adjacent to the first proposition, i.e., Proposition 3.1.

- Proposition 3.3: The statement of the proposition is  ambigious:  InfoNCE cost in (1) is the MCE of which matrices? This should be clearly stated. Are InfNCE cost and SimCLR cost identical? The cost function obtained in the proof in terms of MCE does not match (1)?
- The paragraph after Proposition 3.3: This part appears convoluted: Is $p_{data}=p_{\mathbf{x}}$ ? and $\mathcal{X}$ is the support set of $p_{\mathbf{x}}$? I guess there is no clear definition of $f$ before. (there was $f_\Theta$ and $f_\phi$ without clear definitions before). $f$ is sometimes unbold and sometimes bold? Since $f$ is not prespecified, the assumption that there is a layer normalization $\||f(\mathbf{x})\||_2^2=1$ is also not clear. Instead of stating "straightforward calculation", it is better to provide a proof of Lemma 3.4 with proper notation in Appendix A. In my opinion, both this paragraph and Lemma 3.4 is not properly motivated.

- Lemma 3.4: Suggestion "Let $\sigma$ represent the uniform distribution on $S^{d-1}$. ...".

- The paragraph after Lemma 3.4: Change of variables formula? (Inverse image rule?). Why "auto-correlation" matrix for $q$ but "covariance" for $p_{data}$?  It is better for the authors to clearly state the uniformity principle. Can't we just say that we would like features $\mathbf{z}$ to be uncorrelated? do we need the notation for $p_{data}$, $f^{-1}$.

- Quoting the sentence: "From Proposition 3.3, we find that SimCLR (InfoNCE) loss is not canonical for achieving matrix information-theoretic uniformity unless the covariance matrix is diagonal". What do we mean by "loss being not canonical"? Has matrix information-theoretic uniformity been defined yet? Is this statement simply saying that  SimCLR or InfoNCE does not enforce feature whitening?

- MCE-based decorrelation objective: why do we have a $\lambda \mathbf{I}_d$  perturbation for the desired $\mathbf{I}_d$ matrix? it is already perfectly conditioned. This perturbation on the first argument of the MCE does not reflect on the right side of 

$$\operatorname{MCE}\left(\frac{1}{d} \mathbf{I}_d+\lambda \mathbf{I}_d, \frac{1}{B} \mathbf{Z} \mathbf{Z}^{\top}+\lambda \mathbf{I}_d\right)=-\operatorname{tr}\left(\log \left(\frac{1}{B} \mathbf{Z Z}^{\top}+\lambda \mathbf{I}_d\right)\right)+1+d \lambda$$

Shouldn't there be a multiplier $\frac{1}{d}$ or $\frac{1}{d}+\lambda$ in front of the trace term? I suggest that $\mathcal{L}_{UMCE}$ should be defined at this stage.

- The paragraph before Theorem 3.5: Suggestion "This MCE based uniformity loss definition (or $\mathcal{L}_{UMCE}$ ) and its Matrix-KL divergence based counterpart are closely related.... as outlined by the following theorem:"

- Theorem 3.6: Suggestion: .... under the constraint $\||\mathbf{z}_i\||_2^2=1$, for $i=1, \ldots, n$. The proof of Theorem 3.6 better be provided in Appendix.

- Suggestion: The sentence "Our formulation interestingly recovers the Maximal Entropy Coding (MEC) loss..." can be written as "The Maximal Entropy Coding (MEC) loss in ... can be formulated in terms of Matrix MCE.." as

$$ \mathcal{L}_{MEC}=-\mu \log\det(\mathbf{I}_d+\frac{d}{B\epsilon^2}\mathbf{Z}_1\mathbf{Z}_2^T)$$

$$ =MCE(...., .....)$$

- $\mathcal{L}_{EMP-TCR}$: $\bar{\mathbf{Z}}$ is not defined. Only $\bar{\mathbf{Z}}_i$ is defined. Again there is a confusion of index representations relative to  Equation (1). It is understood from this statement that $\mathbf{z}_k^{i}$ vectors were defined as row vectors. The article should set up the proper data model and notation at the beginning an should stick with that throughout the article.

- Can we also have MCE based representation for the Corinfomax SSL provided in [a] above?

- Overall suggestion: I suggest that the article defines all SSL-related loss functions in Section 2.1, instead of introducing some in Section 2.1 and some in  Section 3.1. Furthermore,  In Section  3.1, the article can clearly write each SSL loss function in the form 
MCE(... , ...) to show that they can be put in the form of matrix cross entropies.

#### 4 MATRIX INFORMATION THEORETIC UNIFORMITY AND ALIGNMENT FOR SELF-SUPERVISED LEARNING

- First sentence: .... we would like embeddings to have zero mean and covariance ....

- Sentence before Theorem 4.1: optimizing covariance matrix uniformity: is this maximizing $\mathcal{L}_{UMCE}$ or $\mathcal{L}_{UKL}$. This should be clarified.

- Theorem 4.1. This needs to be clearly reworded with proper references to the objective function and constraints. What is "effective rank", how is it different than rank? If this is a constraint how do you pose it?  Is the argument of the MCE in the uniformity-MCE loss sample correlation or sample covariance? Is this theorem about  the following optimization?:

$$ \text{maximize } \mathcal{L}_{UMCE}(\frac{1}{B}\mathbf{ZZ}^T)$$
$$ \text{ subject to } \text{tr}(\frac{1}{B}\mathbf{ZZ}^T)=1$$

The proof of Theorem 4.1 in the appendix requires a rewrite: Dote (Typo?)  Denote? $\mathbf{Z}$ can be confused as a matrix due to earlier notation. I guess the first sentence states that Let $\mathbf{x}$ be a random vector, whose distribution has support $S^{d-1}$. Again what is effective rank? This proof needs to be in the form of a series of explicit mathematical assertions referring to a clearly stated optimization problem.

- Lemma 4.2 is typically well known.

- For $\mathcal{L}_{Matrix-KL-uniformity}$,  $MCE$ is used not Matrix-KL measure. Why is it called this way?

5 MATRIX-SSL: UNIFORMITY AND ALIGNMENT

- Regarding the alignment cost based on Matrix: 

1. Again it is based on MCE rather than Matrix-KL. In fact after (11), it is stated that KL versions can also be considered. So why do you call it $\mathcal{L}_{Matrix-KL-allignment}$ ?

2. The fact that covariance matrices of two matrices are aligned with respect to MCE or KL does not necessarily imply that representations for the same image are aligned in the direction, where as euclidian distance based or cosine angle based approaches try to ensure that they are sample wise aligned. So why should $\mathcal{L}_{Matrix-KL-allignment}$ be a better choice?

### 5 EFFECTIVE RANK AND RANK INCREASING PHENOMENON

- It is indeed surprising that effective rank is properly defined and connected to the framework of the article much later than it is already referred. 

### 6 EXPERIMENTS

- It would be interesting to include Tong et.al, 2023 and [a] in the experiments for comparison.

- Interestingly, the proposed Matrix-SSL method provides superior performance in experimental results. A natural question to ask if the authors reproduced the accuracy of other algorithms to calibrate their simulation and evaluation models.

### Summary
In this paper, the authors investigate self-supervised learning through the lens of matrix information theory. They present a unified theoretical framework for analyzing both contrastive and non-contrastive learning methods. Specifically, they employ matrix cross-entropy as the training objective to enhance uniformity and alignment, thereby improving self-supervised learning. Experiments conducted on ImageNet and COCO datasets demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms existing classical approaches.

### Strengths
1. This paper studies self-supervised learning through a matrix information-theoretic framework. The analysis presented in this paper is particularly intriguing and I find it quite appealing. 

2. The authors further introduce a Matrix-SSL scheme based on matrix cross-entropy, which consists of matrix uniformity and matrix alignment. 

3. The experiments on the ImageNet and COCO datasets not only show that the proposed method surpasses state-of-the-art methods but also highlight its robustness in transfer learning tasks.

### Weaknesses
1. There are some issues with the mathematical symbol definitions in this paper, such as inconsistency in the usage of symbols, missing definitions for certain symbols, and incorrect usage of mathematical symbols. For example, on the second page, the lowercase letter "z" represents features, and in subsequent chapters, the bolded lowercase letter "**z**" also represents features. In the part of the definition of matrix entropy, the definition of the lowercase letter $\lambda$ is missing. In the proof of proposition 3.3, there is something wrong with the infoNCE loss. I suggest that the authors follow the definitions provided by the original authors in their arXiv paper.
2. How was Lemma 3.4 obtained? I understand the purpose of this Lemma, but it's better to give the proof or the corresponding reference. On the other hand, Lemma 3.4 shows that minimizing matrix cross-entropy between the Identity diagonal matrix and the covariance matrix can achieve a uniformity target. However, starting from the fourth page, the zero-mean assumption is disregarded. Does this have any impact on the theoretical analysis results? 
3. Starting from the third page, the authors consistently assume that the feature matrix is positive semi-definite. However, can this constraint be maintained in practice？
4. In section 3, the authors analyze that matrix information theory could provide a unified framework for many existing SSL methods. Then, according to Theorem 3.5, Uniformity-MCE loss is equal to MEC loss. The experiments in Table 3 can verify this, where the result of Matrix-SSL (when $\gamma=0$ ) is equal to that of MEC (70.6%). With an increase in $\gamma$, the results will improve. This means that matrix alignment is indeed helpful for final performance improvements. Therefore, if we consider the alignment term along with the MEC loss, what will be the results? I suggest the authors conduct a detailed analysis of the differences between the MEC loss and the Uniformity-MCE loss, especially from an experimental perspective. I wonder if the gradient computation for the Uniformity-MCE loss is easier compared to the MEC loss.
5. Although matrix-KL and matrix-CE share similar optimization properties and theoretical results, are they consistent in practical experiments? I recommend that the authors conduct a set of experiments to validate this.

### Summary
This paper presents Matrix-SSL, a joint-embedding SSL method based on matrix information theory.
Specifically, the uniformity and alignment framework is implemented using principles from matrix information theory.
The results of this study demonstrate that Matrix-SSL surpasses prior state-of-the-art (SOTA) SSL methods.

### Strengths
This paper introduces a matrix-based information-theoretic framework that provides a comprehensive explanation for self-supervised learning methods, including both contrastive learning and non-contrastive learning.

### Weaknesses
- According to Propositions 3.1 and 5.2, it can be established that the Matrix-KL-uniformity loss is synonymous with the von Neumann entropy loss of I-VNE+ as proposed in [1]. This similarity diminishes the novelty of this paper. Therefore, it is imperative to substantiate, either through theoretical or empirical means, the superiority of Matrix-SSL in comparison to I-VNE+.
- The results presented in this paper are not significant to substantiate the effectiveness of Matrix-SSL. Notably, Table 1 does not incorporate the official performance metrics of SwAV, as reported in [2], which report values of 71.99, 73.85, and 74.81 for 100, 200, and 400 training epochs, respectively. Additionally, Table 2 lacks the inclusion of performance data as reported in [1]. When both Table 1 and Table 2 are appropriately updated, it becomes evident that the performance of Matrix-SSL is not state-of-the-art.
Furthermore, it is important to note that this paper does not provide comprehensive benchmark tables, including but not limited to "Semi-supervised learning on ImageNet" and "Transfer learning: image classification," as elaborated in Table 2 and Table 3 of [3].
- In Section 5, this paper demonstrates that enhancing uniformity leads to an increased effective rank through matrix entropy. However, this result is not groundbreaking. In [1], the authors have previously presented these mathematical findings and have empirically shown that von Neumann entropy regulates uniformity, thereby influencing the effective rank.
