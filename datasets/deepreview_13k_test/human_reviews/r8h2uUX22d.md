# Understanding MLP-Mixer as a wide and sparse MLP

- Decision: Reject
- Scores: 6, 6, 5, 6, 6

## Abstract
Multi-layer perceptron (MLP) is a fundamental component of deep learning, and recent MLP-based architectures, especially the MLP-Mixer, have achieved significant empirical success. Nevertheless, our understanding of why and how the MLP-Mixer outperforms conventional MLPs remains largely unexplored. In this work, we reveal that sparseness is a key mechanism underlying the MLP-Mixers. First, the Mixers have an effective expression as a wider MLP with Kronecker-product weights, clarifying that the Mixers efficiently embody several sparseness properties explored in deep learning. In the case of linear layers, the effective expression elucidates an implicit sparse regularization caused by the model architecture and a hidden relation to Monarch matrices, which is also known as another form of sparse parameterization. Next, for general cases, we empirically demonstrate quantitative similarities between the Mixer and the unstructured sparse-weight MLPs. Following a guiding principle proposed by Golubeva, Neyshabur and Gur-Ari (2021), which fixes the number of connections and increases the width and sparsity, the Mixers can demonstrate improved performance.

### Confidence
3: You are fairly confident in your assessment. It is possible that you did not understand some parts of the submission or that you are unfamiliar with some pieces of related work. Math/other details were not carefully checked.

### Summary
The authors have shown that MLP mixers are essentially equivalent to a much wider MLP layer, which has structured sparsity:

1. The authors demonstrated a way to rewrite the formulation of MLP mixer into a standard MLP, where the input to the MLP is the vectored feature matrix and the wide MLP weights are constructed from the Kronecker product.
2. The authors empirically showed that the representations obtained from the equivalent wide MLP and MLP-Mixer are similar.
3. The authors also showed that the wide MLP resembles the Monarch matrix.
4. The authors also tried reducing the "structureness" of the equivalent wide MLP's sparsity, by introducing a permutation matrix.
5. Finally, the authors argued that an MLP mixer is a way to achieve wide MLP without the computation cost of the wide MLP, and increasing the effective width indeed improves the performance.

### Strengths
1. The derivation and observation seems to be solid.
2. I believe this is the first time the equivalence between MLP mixer and wide MLP has been formalized.

### Weaknesses
1. The paper is not very easy to follow. For one, a lot of notations are not defined, which require the reader to find out from the original MLP mixer paper. Examples are eq (1), eq (2). The plots are also hard to interpret, and more explanation could be better. The general structure of the paper could also be improved, to have a more coherent story. For example, section 3.2 could be merged with section 5.
2. The contribution is weak. For example, while it's good to formalize the relationship between MLP mixer and wide MLP, it's not that unexpected. From figure 1(d), it seems like the equivalent MLP under-performs the MLP-Mixer which makes the equivalence argument weak. The random permuted mixers also don't consistently out-perform the vanilla mixer which is also a weak argument.

### Questions
1. Do you have an explanation on why RP-Mixers are not consistently better than normal mixer.
2. the $vec(X)$ in eq(4) should be $vec(WX)$ and $vec(XV)$?

### Summary
This paper explores the potential of MLP-Mixer as a wide and sparse MLP. The author demonstrates through the use of Kronecker product that the mixing layer of the Mixer has an effective representation as a wider MLP, which has sparse weights, and regards it as an approximation of the Monarch matrix. Additionally, the authors also introduce a more memory-efficient RP-Mixer to verify the similarity in much wider cases.

### Strengths
1. The author has conducted extensive parameter analysis to validate that the mixing layer of both the MLP-Mixer and the RP Mixer effectively represents a wider MLP.
2. The author offers a new analytical perspective to elucidate the effectiveness of the MLP-Mixer.

### Weaknesses
1. The paper falls short in terms of the selection of networks for comparison, thereby resulting in a lack of theoretical support.
2. There is a lack of experimental evidence to support the memory efficiency and lightweight structure of the RP-Mixer.
3. According to (Magnus and Neudecker, 2019), there appear to be slight mistakes in the theoretical proof section. For instance, formula $J_c^{\top}\left(I_S \otimes V\right) J_c=V^{\top} \otimes I_S$ should actually be $J_c^{\top}\left(I_S \otimes V\right) J_c=V \otimes I_S$.

### Questions
1. The motivation for this article's research appears to be similar to that of (Golubeva and Neyshabur, 2021). Could you clarify how the author's approach to analyzing network width and sparsity differs from that in Article A?
2. In the contribution, why is the RP-Mixer referred to as a computationally demanding yet lightly-structured alternative? This statement seems contradictory.

### Summary
This paper made theoretical and practical study to understand the good performance of the MLP-Mixer architecture. More specifically, this paper shows that MLP-Mixer behaves similarly to a wide MLP with sparse weights. The wide and sparse MLP variant achieves comparable results compared to the original MLP-Mixer on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet-1k.

### Strengths
The idea of understanding MLP-Mixer as a wide and sparse MLP is original. This paper presents an analysis of the MLP-Mixer method, provides a good explanation to connect MLP-Mixer with the Kronecker product and shows that the model behaves as a wide MLP with sparse weights. It is a novel explanation to attribute the success of the Mixer architecture to the effective width of a sparse MLP. Experimental results show that the wide and sparse MLPs could achieve comparable results as the MLP-Mixer architecture.

### Weaknesses
1. Performance comparison of the MLP-Mixer with Wide MLP and RP-Mixer is missing. It would be nice to add the inference speed comparison and memory consumption comparison among the three methods (MLP-Mixer, Wide MLP, RP-Mixer). 
2. The absolute results are a bit low on both CIFAR (84.1% baseline for Mixer) and ImageNet-1k (76.4% baseline for Mixer). It makes the improvements less convincing as 0.3 percent boost on ImageNet could easily be caused by many different reasons (augmentation, hyper-parameters, patch sizes, training durations, test-time crops, etc.) This may limit the impact of this paper.
3. The takeaways from this paper is a bit unclear, especially on how to properly make use of the new insights in this paper to either improve the quality or improve the performance of the existing architectures (i.e. MLP-Mixer).

### Summary
This paper analyzes the MLP-Mixer model, and shows that the model can be restated as a wide MLP with sparse weights, and investigates some generalizations/variations of the model.
They show that these proposed variants perform well on CIFAR, STL and ImageNet.

### Strengths
Originality: While there is a large literature on the analysis of sparsity in neural nets, this specific type of analysis seems novel to me.
Quality: the analysis looks sound, the experiments are well done.
Clarity: I was able to follow along the paper.
Significance: The analysis done here might be applicable to a larger variety of models. Still, I think this might be the weakest part of the paper (see next field).

### Weaknesses
* The MLP-Mixer is a fairly nieche model that hasn't seen much adaption neither in practice nor as a vessel for theoretical analysis. So I'm under the impression that this work will not be immediately useful to a broader audience. However, the tools of analysis used and the results obtained might be useful for future research in related areas. The authors themselves mention such potential areas on the Conclusion.

* The authors do not mention running time for their variations, it would be nice if they would state both FLOPS and wallclock times.

### Questions
1) My main question to the authors would be if they have any immediate applications of their findings? I agree that in theory this demonstrates that you could use this to structure weights that can achieve a very large effective width. The MLP Mixer's MLP fulfills a very specific task (interlacing inter/intra-token processing), I'm unsure how to extrapolate that to other architectures.

2) What is the running time of their models compared to the original MLP Mixer formulation?

### Summary
This paper shows an effective expression of MLP-Mixer as an MLP by vectorizing the mixing layers. This paper clarifies that the mixing layer of the Mixer has an effective expression as a wider MLP whose weights are sparse and represented by the Kronecker product. It is also regarded as an approximation of Monarch matrices. This paper also introduced the RP-Mixer, a more memory-efficient alternative to the unstructured sparse-weight MLP.

### Strengths
1. This paper shows an effective expression of MLP-Mixer as an MLP by vectorizing the mixing layers
2. This paper finds similar tendencies between the mixer and unstructured sparse-weight MLP in hidden features and the performance under widening with a fixed number of connections.
3. This paper characterizes the Mixers as a special example of a general class: Permuted-Kronecker (PK) family

### Weaknesses
1.	The authors claim that wider Mixer is a an effective expression of MLP-Mixer and RP-Mixer is a more memory-efficient alternative to unstructured sparse-weight MLP. It would be beneficial to apply wider Mixer/RP-Mixer to more state-of-the-art frameworks [1,2,3,4,5], especially considering the more efficient MLP-Mixer approach proposed in [6].

2.	The paper lacks a thorough comparison with existing methods in terms of both memory efficiency and performance. It would be valuable to include such comparisons to demonstrate the superiority of wider- Mixer/RP-Mixer.

As a non-theoretical machine learning researcher, I am only able to give a recommendation based on the novelty of the idea and the empirical parts, and would give a borderline accept with low confidence according to the listed strengths and weaknesses.

### Questions
1. The paper lacks a comprehensive comparison with state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods. It is important to compare the proposed MLP-Mixer with other SOTA methods in terms of performance, memory efficiency, and any other relevant metrics.

2. Additionally, it would be beneficial to conduct a detailed analysis of existing MLP-Mixer variants or related methods. Exploring the strengths and weaknesses of these approaches would provide a more comprehensive understanding of the proposed method and its contributions to the field.

3. The experimental section should include a thorough evaluation of the proposed method's performance compared to other SOTA methods. This evaluation should consider multiple benchmark datasets and provide statistical analysis to support the claims of superiority.
