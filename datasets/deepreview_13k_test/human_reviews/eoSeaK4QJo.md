- Decision: Accept
- Scores: 6, 8, 3, 8

## Abstract
Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs)  have emerged as energy-efficient alternatives to  Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) when deployed on neuromorphic chips.  While recent studies have demonstrated the impressive performance of deep SNNs on challenging tasks, their energy efficiency advantage has been diminished. Existing methods targeting energy consumption reduction do not fully exploit sparsity, whereas powerful pruning methods can achieve high sparsity but are not directly targeted at energy efficiency, limiting their effectiveness in energy saving. Furthermore, none of these works fully exploit the sparsity of neurons or the potential for unstructured neuron pruning in SNNs. In this paper, we propose a novel pruning framework that combines unstructured weight pruning with unstructured neuron pruning to maximize the utilization of the sparsity of neuromorphic computing, thereby enhancing energy efficiency. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first application of unstructured neuron pruning to deep SNNs. Experimental results demonstrate that  our method achieves impressive energy efficiency gains. The sparse network pruned by our method with only 0.63\% remaining connections can achieve a remarkable 91 times increase in energy efficiency compared to the original dense network, requiring only 8.5M SOPs for inference, with merely 2.19\% accuracy loss on the CIFAR-10 dataset. Our work suggests that deep and dense SNNs exhibit high redundancy in energy consumption, highlighting the potential for targeted SNN sparsification to save energy.

4: You are confident in your assessment, but not absolutely certain. It is unlikely, but not impossible, that you did not understand some parts of the submission or that you are unfamiliar with some pieces of related work.

### Summary
The paper proposes a framework towards unstructured pruning of weights and neurons in Spiking Neural Networks for high sparsity and significant reduction in spikes. Masks are learned during training to trade off accuracy loss and energy consumption. Experiments are provided to demonstrate competitive reduction in spiking operations with higher accuracy than previous works.

### Strengths
The authors provide a sound approach towards learned pruning for energy at high-granularity. Experimental details including hyperparameter sensitivity and ablation are addressed and elaborated in sufficient detail. From their results, the proposed method is demonstrated to achieve a competitive accuracy-energy trade-off compared to recent works. Lastly, the paper is clearly written with enough details provided for reproducibility.

### Weaknesses
1.The central idea doesn't appear to offer a breakthrough. The hyperparameter search may not sufficiently differentiate this work. Although combining energy factors into training is a novel approach for SNNs, it has previously been utilized in other contexts, such as artificial neural networks, for various objectives. Such as in the following paper:

Salehinejad, H., & Valaee, S. (2021). Edropout: Energy-based dropout and pruning of deep neural networks. IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems, 33(10), 5279-5292.

2. The comparison with the state-of-the-art, especially concerning the ImageNet dataset, lacks comprehensiveness. Only one previous work is considered.

3. While the proxy measure of energy-efficiency using synaptic operations (SOPs) is justified from prior neuromorphic hardware works, the paper could improve its claim for energy efficiency by providing actual energy saved in implementation on neuromorphic hardware. 

4. In paragraph 3 of Section 5.2, the proposed energy model is claimed to be validated by energy estimates of GradR and STDS. However, as the energy measure used (SOPs) is itself defined by the energy model, this claim seems circular.

### Questions
In Table 2 (comparison with state-of-the-art), the accuracy for GradR-CIFAR10 and STDS-ImageNet are obtained from the original papers, but the percentage of connections reported differs from the original papers. Please clarify these differences (i.e. if there is a difference in definition).

### Summary
This paper is dedicated to improving the energy efficiency of SNNs. It defines the energy consumption model and explores a new route to optimizes energy efficiency directly. The authors propose a fine-gained pruning framework that combines unstructured weight and neuron pruning, along with a novel energy penalty term to address the ill-posed problem of jointly pruning neurons and weights. The paper demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed methods on various datasets and shows that they outperform existing state-of-the-art methods in reducing energy consumption while maintaining comparable performance.

### Strengths
1.This paper presents a pioneering effort in directly optimizing the energy efficiency of SNNs, offering novel ideas for reducing energy consumption in neuromorphic computing.

2.The conclusions are impressive. The authors highlight the fact that having fewer weight (parameters) does not necessarily translate to lower energy consumption, which prompts us to reevaluate the efficacy of pruning methods in SNNs. Many existing pruning works may not effectively reduce energy consumption.

3.The structure is clear and easy to follow.

4.The experimental results show that the proposed method can achieve the state-of-the-art balance between accuracy and energy efficiency.

### Weaknesses
1.Some portions of the paper lacks clarity. For example, Figure 1 is not sufficiently elucidated. The authors illustrate in the motivation section that Figure 1 shows how fine-grained pruning significantly reduces synaptic connections, but it is challenging to grasp. Furthermore, some variables are not clearly defined, such as $d_n$ and $d_w$ in Equation (6).

2.There are some grammar errors that require improvement. 
Page 4: 'better trade-off' should be 'a better trade-off',
Page 7: 'refers to' should be ' refer to',
Page 9: 'outperformes' should be 'outperforms'.

### Questions
1. For Figure 1, additional details regarding the experimental settings and result analysis should be added in the appendix.

2.Why there is not a element-wise multiplication for $m_n$ in Equation (6)? Why it is different from the masks of weights $m_w$?

3.Before Equation (6), it appears that the order may be reversed. Specifically, $m_w$ should be the masks of weights and $m_n$ should be the masks of neurons.

### Summary
This paper describes a means of improving the energy consumption of SNNs via irregular pruning, that includes pruning of nodes as well as weights. The reduction in number of synaptic operations is significant with only small drops in accuracy.  The method involves adjusting the loss function with several reasonable approximations.

### Strengths
The reports results are strong and the paper is very well written with clear explanations of the approach taken.  The ability to target a given sparsity level is a plus.

### Weaknesses
The cost function associated with number of synaptic operations ignores the cost associated with managing the sparsity. In CNNs it is well known that it is hard to take advantage of irregular non-structured sparsity (see e.g., https://arxiv.org/pdf/1907.02124.pdf) and this is somewhat well understand in SNNs as well. Many hardware accelerators claim to try to take advantage of sparsity, but the cost associated with managing the sparsity reduces the overall energy benefits.  See https://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.03388.pdf for an example of a good paper that identifies a high-level energy model of SNNs which captures this issue by more accurately capturing the associated memory cost of managing an SNN. 

The proposed approach ignores these issues and only uses SOPs as a metric of energy consumption. At the minimum, I would argue that the paper needs to appreciate that this metric is not accurate for many hardware accelerators and highlight which architectures this metric is most suited. I hypothesize, for example, SOPs is more reasonable for many core processors like Loihi (which do not focus on weight re-use) and less accurate for architectures where dataflow such as weight stationary play a key role.

### Questions
1. Which accelerator architectures match well to using SOP as a metric and which do not?

### Summary
Low energy consumption is a main property of spiking neural networks. This paper focuses on enhancing energy efficiency of spiking neural networks. The authors first propose the energy consumption model of SNNs and then try to optimize the energy efficiency by introducing the unstructured weight and neuron pruning framework with masks. Besides, a new energy penalty term is proposed to solve the ill-posed problem. Experimental results on CIFAR10, DVS-CIFAR10 and ImageNet datasets demonstrate the proposed method can achieve the SOTA energy efficiency with comparable performance.

### Strengths
The paper is the first application of unstructured neuron pruning to deep SNNs. The combination of unstructured weight pruning and unstructured neuron pruning is interesting and efficient. Besides, the authors propose some insight methods to address the ill-posed problem when jointly pruning neurons and weights under energy constraints.

### Weaknesses
1. The difference between ANNs and SNNs in pruning (especially unstructured neuron pruning) is not fully explained. It is not clear why unstructured neuron pruning is not used in ANNs. Why is it more suitable for SNNs?
2. The authors mainly illustrate how to optimize the penalty, but there was no explanation of how to optimize the first term of the loss function in Eq.11.

### Questions
Can the authors explain why unstructured neuron pruning is not (commonly) used in ANNs?  How to optimize the first term of the loss function in Eq.11? How to choose the parameter $\beta$ for different datasets?
