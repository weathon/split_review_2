# SAS: Structured Activation Sparsification

- Decision: Accept
- Scores: 6, 6, 6

## Abstract
Wide networks usually yield better accuracy than their narrower counterpart at the expense of the massive $\texttt{mult}$ cost.
To break this tradeoff, we advocate a novel concept of $\textit{Structured Activation Sparsification}$, dubbed SAS, which boosts accuracy without increasing computation by utilizing the projected sparsity in activation maps with a specific structure. 
Concretely, the projected sparse activation is allowed to have N nonzero value among M consecutive activations.
Owing to the local structure in sparsity, the wide $\texttt{matmul}$ between a dense weight and the sparse activation is executed as an equivalent narrow $\texttt{matmul}$ between a dense weight and dense activation, which is compatible with NVIDIA's $\textit{SparseTensorCore}$ developed for the N:M structured sparse weight.
In extensive experiments, we demonstrate that increasing sparsity monotonically improves accuracy (up to 7% on CIFAR10) without increasing the $\texttt{mult}$ count.
Furthermore, we show that structured sparsification of $\textit{activation}$ scales better than that of $\textit{weight}$ given the same computational budget.

### Summary
This paper introduces Structured Activation Sparsification (SAS), a method that enhances the accuracy of wide neural networks without the additional computational cost typically associated with network width. By implementing structured sparsity within activation maps—where a set number of non-zero values are maintained in consecutive activation. This allows for the simplification of wide matrix multiplications into narrow ones. Empirical results show that this method can improve accuracy (by up to 7% on CIFAR10) without increasing computational demands and outperforms similar sparsity approaches applied to network weights.

### Strengths
The strengths of this work is listed below:
1. This work introduces a novel method of structuring sparsity in activations, which appears to enable a reduction in computation without a corresponding drop in accuracy. The concept of using structured sparse projection (SAS) to maintain vectorization compatibility is particularly innovative.
2. The structured sparsity allows for efficient matrix multiplication operations that maintain the number of multiplications at the level of the base dense/narrow network, highlighting efficiency in computation.
3. The process for creating sparse activations through the structured sparse projection S is described as having negligible computational cost and wall-clock latency, indicating an efficient method that does not add significant complexity or processing time.
4. A thorough evaluation is presented that demonstrates the SAS network's increased expressiveness compared to Static Weight Sparsity (SWS) networks, given the same computational budget, by using trajectory length analysis.
5. The proposed SAS projection and its integration into the training process suggest a straightforward transformation of existing neural networks to increase their efficiency, which could be widely applicable across different network architectures and tasks.

### Weaknesses
The weakness of this work is listed below:
1. As mentioned in Section 2.3, while the computational load in terms of FLOPS remains the same for a given level of activation sparsity 
M, the memory requirements for the Sparse Activation Sparsification (SAS) network increase linearly with M. This is in contrast to the Sparse Weight Storage (SWS) network, which maintains a constant storage requirement for weights at inference time regardless of M. This could become a significant limitation for devices with limited memory or when scaling to very large networks.
2. In Section 3, the paper discusses the expressive power of SAS networks by comparing trajectory lengths in a specific constructed neural network with 2-dimensional input and output. However, this analysis might not generalize to all network architectures or datasets, which could limit the understanding of the practical implications of SAS's increased expressive power.
3. The straightforward method used for computing the index I might not be the most effective approach, particularly when neighbor elements oscillate around zero (Section 6.1). An indexing strategy that is not learned end-to-end may limit the model's capacity to adapt to the data's complexity, potentially leaving some performance on the table.
4. In general, the listings (code pieces) in the paper is informative enough. However, I would suggest the authors to replace the source code with some high-level pseudo code. This is more readable and more accessible to some readers.

### Summary
This paper proposed SAS, a method to explore structured sparse activation in CNN. SAS describes the approach to generate structured sparse activation, software and hardware implementations. Numerical experiments on image classification validates the efficacy regarding accuracy aspect.

### Strengths
- The paper is written well, and technically sound.
- The study problem is interesting and may deliver real impact onto DNN speedup.

### Weaknesses
- The terminology of structured sparsity is misleading. We typically refer the N:M sparsity as "semi structured sparsity" to distinguish it from standard structured sparsity including disjoint group sparsity, overlapping group sparsity and hierarchical sparsity. 

- The realistic benefits of structured sparse activation is not clear. Although the topic is interesting, I am not sure what is the actual speedup gain of such sparse activation that can deliver to the community. The paper seems equipping without numerical results regarding speedup as well.

- The citation format is wrong. Please use \citep{} rather than \cite{} to cite references.

### Questions
- What is the training cost to yield SAS network compared to training as standard?

### Summary
This paper proposes a new concept of sparsity that maps the input activation values to a sparse representation, then exploits Nvidia Ampere sparsity for sparse computation by widening the weights. By doing this, wider weights make the network have stronger representation ability, and computation remains consistent because of the n:m sparsity operation. The authors conducted experiments on CIFAR and ImageNet datasets to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method.

### Strengths
1. The presented idea is clever and novel. It can effectively enhance the representation ability of the network under the same amount of computation compared with the vanilla network. I think this brings a nice insight to the field.
2. The author developed a general matmul library for the proposed SAS using Sparse Tensor Core. This gives the method practical value in the field, which is appreciated.

### Weaknesses
1. It is inaccurate for the author to state that the computation of SWS and SAS are the same. I can agree that the computation of SAS and the original dense network are the same, but the computation of SWS is obviously higher than that of SAS.
2. Let's continue considering this point. Figure 3 raises a big question for me. The author doesn't express the dimensions of the weights corresponding to SWS and SAS. Although it intuitively looks like SAS has a clear acceleration in the graph, I think this is unreasonable because the author also says the number of mult count in SAS is the same as the base dense/narrow network. This greatly reduces my enthusiasm for this paper.
3. The current presentation pf experiments is very scattered. I think the author should provide a comparison of the full network’s computation, inference speed, and accuracy to give readers a clearer comparison. For instance, when compressing ConvNeXt-b, although the accuracy of SAS is higher than SWS, a comparison of SAS's operation count and inference time also needs to be provided.
