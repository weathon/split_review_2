- Decision: Accept
- Scores: 3, 6, 6, 6

## Abstract
Masked autoencoders have become popular training paradigms for self-supervised visual representation learning. These models randomly mask a portion of the input and reconstruct the masked portion according to assigned target representations. 
In this paper, we show that a careful choice of the target representation is unnecessary for learning good visual representation since different targets tend to derive similarly behaved models. 
Driven by this observation, we propose a multi-stage masked distillation pipeline and use a randomly initialized model as the teacher, enabling us to effectively train high-capacity models without any effort to carefully design the target representation. 
On various downstream tasks of classification, transfer learning, object detection, and semantic segmentation, the proposed method to perform masked knowledge \textbf{d}istillation with \textbf{bo}otstrapped \textbf{t}eachers (\textbf{\ourmethod}) outperforms previous self-supervised methods by nontrivial margins. 
We hope our findings, as well as the proposed method, could motivate people to rethink the roles of target representations in pre-training masked autoencoders.

### Summary
This paper studies the role of target representation in Masked Image Modeling framework. Prior works each proposes a separate teacher network to generate the reconstruction target: BeiT uses DALL-E; MaskFeat uses HoG; MVP uses CLIP, without clearly justifying the necessity. This work finds that different choices of teacher network, including a random initialized one, leads to close performance in MIM training. Furthermore, it proposes a bootstrapped iterative MIM training pipeline, called dBOT, which shows improved performance.

### Strengths
The observation that diffrent teacher models do not make a large difference in generating target representation in MIM learning is interesting. The high-level idea of this paper is easy to follow, and the model does show good performance on classification, detection, and segmentation tasks.

### Weaknesses
1. The proposed method dBOT and the observation about the choice of teacher model is somewhat unrelated. It is my opinion that the good performance of dBOT comes from multi-stage training, which I find not clearly motivated in this paper. For instance, if the teacher network is switched in to some other pretrained networks, I feel confident that this dBOT pipeline would still perform good.

2. The observation of the insignificance of the choice of teacher network is somewhat aligned to the observation of MAE, which simply opts for raw image pixels and surpasses previous methods like BeiT or MaskFeat with more sophisticated target representation by a non-trivial margin. This is also validated from the results in appendix B.1, which shows *using the patch token obtained by a randomly initialized network as the target can achieve comparable results with a pixel as a target.*

3. The authors claim that *Using a random model as teachers not only avoids an extra pre-training stage, but also alleviates the painstaking selection of the target representations*. But I think this has already been achieved by MAE, since reconstrucing raw image pixels does not involve pretraining, and there is no need to select target representations. Thus, I am not sure what is the practical value of the observation of this work.

### Questions
1. In table 1, I find a randomly initialized teacher network could achieve 77.3 accuracy on ImageNet (and similar for other datasets), which really seems impossible to me. Am I missing something here?

### Summary
The paper analyses the role of target representations (reconstruct targets) in masked knowledge distillation for self-supervised learning (SSL). It finds that distilling from the output of a randomly initialised network results in performance and properties similar to distilling from pre-trained representations. Based on these observations, the work proposes a new SSL method, dBOT that employs multiple stages of distillation starting from a randomly initialized teacher network. The results indicate that the proposed SSL pretraining consistently outperforms prior SSL pretraining on the downstream tasks of image classification, semantic segmentation, and object detection.

### Strengths
1. The paper makes a novel and interesting observation of the masked knowledge distillation being invariant to the initial teacher networks (Table 1).
2. The proposed method is simple and achieves consistent improvements over prior SSL methods (models) across multiple downstream tasks (Table 2,3,4).
3. The paper performs thorough ablation study (Table 5) and analysis of model weights and outputs (Section 6)
4. The method seems to be stable with respect to minor changes in the pretraining setup. (Table 5)
5. The work promises further improvements if data beyond ImageNet-1k is used (Appendix C.2 and C.3), including a result that shows model training from a CLIP-L teacher achieving 89.1% top-1 accuracy (new SoTA image recognition result)

### Weaknesses
Please look at the Questions section for suggestions on improving the draft. 

Here are a few minor concerns (that are a bit related to each other):
1. **dBOT does not scale with more training?**. Results in Table 1 show a drop in performance on adding more stages, thus requiring a good stopping condition.
2. **Different models for different tasks** as opposed to prior works that typically release a single general model
The purpose of SSL is to learn a single model that generalize across tasks. Given that the performance on different downstream tasks peaks at different stages (Table 1), it is not clear how to choose the number of distillation stages to arrive at a single general model that can work across tasks (even beyond the ones discussed - eg. for embodied navigation [1]). 
3. **Do the trends hold across random seeds?**. For a single random initialized teacher, Table 1 shows 2 stage being better for classification and stage 3 being better for detection/segmentation. It is not clear if trends like this (and the performance) hold across random seeds.

### Questions
# Questions
1. In context of the weaknesses above, do authors have evidence that suggests that performance saturates and not drops with more stages and training? 
2. **Sample efficiency.** SSL methods have been shown to improve with more training (Figure 7 of MAE [1]). Is the total number of pre-training iterations controlled across different methods in Table 2, 3, 4 and 5? 
4. The authors compute properties **within** model and show that these match across different choices of teachers (Figure 2 and 3). Do the learned layers **across distilled models** show any correspondences? eg. how do the cross-model CKA similarity maps [2] look?
5. Table 6: Why is MAE faster than dBOT when both use an asymmetric encoder-decoder architecture?
6. "Additionally dBOT achieves more local attention than previous works". Can authors clarify this comment in context of Figure 2? It seems like MAE's attention distance plot is similar to the distilled models'.
7. Section 6. SVD line 5: Shouldn't lesser correlation in model's output result in lower redundancy?
8. C.1. I think I understand why the need for a decoder could be "eased when target contains high-level semantics". But can the authors elaborate a bit on why the "existence of decoder" may hurt?


# Minor typos/suggestions:
1. Section 1: A masked image **is** passed through the 
2. Section 2.2: Page 3 last line: teacher and ~~bootstraps~~ bootstrap the teacher for stages
3. Table 2 caption: ~~Comparison~~ Comparing fine-tuning result
4. The method (section 4) suggests to continue repeating the distillation until a saturation in downstream task is observed. The authors may want to reword this as it is odd to have the SSL pretraining phase depend on a particular downstream task.

### Summary
This work studies the effect of knowledge distillation in mask auto-encoders. The authors observe that the choice of teacher representation becomes inconsequential when employing multi-stage distillation. As a result, the authors propose a novel approach called MKD, which utilizes bootstrapped teachers initialized randomly. Notably, MKD yields significant performance improvements when compared to alternative methods.

### Strengths
1. The paper presents a reasonable and novel story, and the conclusion regarding the teacher representation for Masked auto-encoders is convincingly demonstrated through solid preliminary experiments.

2. The organization and writing style are clear, making the paper easily readable.

3. The authors perform extensive and compelling experiments to validate the effectiveness of MKD, which results in significant performance improvements compared to the baselines.

4. The analysis provided in Section 6 is highly appreciated.

### Weaknesses
1.  The conclusion of the paper is limited to Masked auto-encoders where the teacher and student models are pre-trained with the same data (IN-1k). However, this is not clearly stated in the main paper.

2.  A While the authors mention the instability and sensitivity of other methods, it should be noted that MKD also requires careful pipeline design and hyper-parameter selection. For example,  MAE with fixed m (momentum updating teacher’s param) can achieve 84.3 at stage 2, however, in most cases in the ablation, MKD only outperforms MAE when the stage split number, epochs for each stage, and momentum parameter (m) and others are correctly set. This limits the practical application of MKD. This limits the practical application of MKD, as one could simply distill MAE for two stages with less time consumption and similar performance.

3. The paper only explores the fine-tune setting of semi-supervised learning (SSL), which diminishes the differences between pre-training models. How about the linear-probe setting? Would teachers also matter? Additionally, it is unclear whether the models mentioned in Section 6 are supervisedly fine-tuned on IN or pre-trained models before fine-tuning.

4. A minor weakness of the paper is that only l2 distillation is performed, neglecting other potential distillation methods.

### Questions
1. What is the recipe ⚗ in appendix A.1? I did not find the definition of this setting?

2. Pls see weakness.

### Summary
This paper explores a quite interesting perspective of masking image modeling by first summarizing current methods with a more high-level architecture called masking knowledge distillation and then empirically demonstrate the learnt backbones of different target representation do not differ from each other with respect to both transfer results and weight distribution. Based on that, the authors propose a simple yet effective framework called dBOT to learn strong self-supervised visual representation.

### Strengths
- This paper has a clear formulation and writing architecture to present their motivation.
- The experimental results are solid and completed to support their claim.
- The observed phenomenon is quite interesting.

### Weaknesses
- This paper constructs tightly with the proposed masked knowledge distillation framework in Equ. 1, which consists of several basic components, including 1) the transferred backbone, 2) target representation, 3) asymmetric masking and 4) similarity measurement.
- About target representation:
  - The phenomenon observed in this paper can be more detailed phrased as, "With long enough pre-training, different target representation demonstrate similar behavior". Therefore, does that suggest that the observed conclusion only mask sense with a fixed dataset with long enough training? 
  - In other words, is the bottleneck of scalable visual representation learning not about the methodology but more about data?
- About asymmetric masking:
  - Following my question above, another perspective to understand this phenomenon is due to the limited scalability [1] of asymmetric masking architecture proposed in MAE, which is also utilized as the main architecture in this work. While in Swinv2 and EVA, the MIM pre-training has been quite important for ViT training of giant sizes. Does the implementation of masking also affect the scalability of pre-training?
  - Moreover, does the invariance of target representation suggest masking operation is the key in MKD, which might also explain why the learnt representation has similar weight distribution?
- About backbone architecture:
  - Throughout the whole paper, the authors utilize the vanilla ViT of different sizes for both the student and teacher networks, while DeiT has shown that architecture discrepancy exists when distilling  between different architectures like CNN and ViT. Will that be the same for MKD, like does the phenomenon still hold with a ConvNext teacher?
- Overall, I think this is a quite interesting paper, and my questions are more open-ended to further enhance the insight of the observed phenomenon for future development.
