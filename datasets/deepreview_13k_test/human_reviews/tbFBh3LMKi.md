## Abstract
Combining offline and online reinforcement learning (RL) is crucial for efficient and safe learning. However, previous approaches treat offline and online learning as separate procedures, resulting in redundant designs and limited performance. We ask: \textit{Can we achieve straightforward yet effective offline and online learning without introducing extra conservatism or regularization?} In this study, we propose \ours, which utilizes an on-policy objective for both offline and online learning. Owning to the alignment of objectives in two phases, the RL agent can transfer between offline and online learning seamlessly. This property enhances the flexibility of the learning paradigm, allowing for arbitrary combinations of pretraining, fine-tuning, offline, and online learning. In the offline phase, specifically, \ours leverages diverse ensemble policies to address the mismatch issues between the estimated behavior policy and the offline dataset. Through a simple offline policy evaluation (OPE) approach, \ours can achieve multi-step policy improvement safely. We demonstrate that by employing the method above, the fusion of these two paradigms can yield superior offline initialization as well as stable and rapid online fine-tuning capabilities. 
Through real-world robot tasks, we highlight the benefits of this paradigm for rapid deployment in challenging, previously unseen real-world environments. Additionally, through comprehensive evaluations using numerous simulated benchmarks, we substantiate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in both offline and offline-to-online fine-tuning learning.

### Summary
The authors propose a new approach, Uni-O4, to combine offline and online reinforcement learning, which is an important and challenging problem in the field. Uni-O4 can effectively address the mismatch issues between the estimated behavior policy and the offline dataset,  and it can achieve better offline initialization than other methods and be more stable for the later online fine-tuning phase. The experimental results on several benchmark tasks show that Uni-O4 outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in terms of stability, final performance, and the capability for real-world transferring.

### Strengths
1. Uni-O4 can seamlessly transfer between offline and online learning, enhancing the flexibility of the learning paradigm.

2. The experiments are sufficient and persuasive. The experiments on real-world robots showed very good performance in the provided videos.

### Weaknesses
1. Notions are confusing in this paper, especially after the overloading in Equ. (8).

2. In Fig.2, It is hard to capture the Offline Multi-Step Optimization process, i.e. the sequence relationship of each step.

3. In Sec 3.1:  "BPPO leads to a mismatch ... due to the presence of diverse behavior policies in the dataset D",  could authors explain further why the diversity is blamed for the mismatch?

4. Lack of theoretical analysis (to support the motivation of technique details), but it has sufficient experiments thus this point is acceptable I think.

### Summary
This paper proposes a new algorithm called Uni-O4 that unifies offline and online reinforcement learning using an on-policy optimization approach. The key ideas are:
- Using an on-policy PPO objective for both offline and online learning to align the objectives.
- In the offline phase, using an ensemble of policies and offline policy evaluation to safely achieve multi-step policy improvement.
- Seamlessly transferring between offline pretraining and online fine-tuning without extra regularization or constraints.
- Evaluating Uni-O4 on both simulated tasks like Mujoco and real-world quadruped robots.

### Strengths
- Simple and unified design without needing extra regularization or constraints for stability. Avoids issues like conservatism or instability in prior offline-to-online methods.
- Impressive results surpassing SOTA on offline RL and offline-to-online tasks. Significantly boosts offline performance and enables rapid, stable online fine-tuning.
- Policy ensemble provides good coverage over offline data distribution. Offline policy evaluation enables safe multi-step improvement.
- Excellent results on real-world robots - pretraining, offline adaptation, online finetuning. Showcases efficiency and versatility.

### Weaknesses
- The complexity of the method, especially regarding the ensemble behavior cloning and disagreement-based regularization, may present a steep learning curve for practitioners.

### Questions
- What are the computational overheads associated with the ensemble policies, and how do they impact the method's scalability?
- Why don't use the ensemble approach to mitigate mismatches instead of other methods for handling the diverse behaviors in the datasets? For example, Diffusion-QL [1] demonstrates that Diffusion model can be used to learn multimodal policy.

### Summary
The article introduces Uni-O4, a new method for combining offline and online reinforcement learning. It eliminates redundancy and enhances flexibility by using an on-policy objective for both phases. Uni-O4 employs ensemble policies and a straightforward offline policy evaluation approach in the offline phase to address mismatches between behavior policy and data. The approach leads to better offline initialization and efficient online fine-tuning for real-world robot tasks and achieves state-of-the-art results in various simulated benchmarks.

### Strengths
1) Despite some minor flaws, this paper is written in a standardized and organized manner, allowing people to quickly capture the core innovative points and ideas of the paper.

2) The Uni-O4 framework proposed in the article unifies the learning objectives of online and offline learning, making the transition from offline learning to online learning smoother.

3) This method has shown excellent performance in various experiments and has also achieved good results in real-world machine experiments.

### Weaknesses
1）The behavior cloning method proposed in section 3.1 requires training multiple policy networks, which incurs significant computational overhead. At the same time, it does not mention how to get $\hat{pi}_{\beta}$ from a policy set.

2）Definition error, the definition of f used in formulas 6 and 7 is incorrect. Taking the maximum value of multiple distributions cannot guarantee a single distribution (the sum cannot be guaranteed to be 1), and analysis based on this definition is also meaningless. If the code is truly implemented based on this definition, I am skeptical about the final performance of the algorithm.

3) The proposed offline strategy evaluation method relies on the accuracy of the probability transfer model T, and using the transfer model for evaluation will introduce more errors.

4) The entire method has made too many approximations to the problem and lacks corresponding error analysis.

5） The legend in Figure 3 is missing to know the correspondence between curves and algorithms.

### Questions
1) Can you provide a detailed reconstruction method for policy $\hat{\pi}_{\beta}$, whether to select any one from the policy set $\Pi_n$ or integrate it using the f function to obtain a policy?

2) Is there a way to evaluate the quality of behavior cloning? Can you compare your proposed method of behavior cloning with previous methods?

3) Can we analyze the errors in the approximate part? You can cite the results of previous work to prove it. For this article, you do not need to prove the size of the approximation error. You only need to quantify the approximation error to a certain extent, analyze the potential impact, and find ways to avoid negative effects.

### Summary
This paper focuses on unifying offline and online RL to achieve efficient and safe learning. Specifically, this paper proposes Uni-O4, which utilizes an on-policy RL objective for both offline and online learning. For offline learning, this paper combines the advantages of both BPPO and OPE to achieve the desired performance. For online learning, this paper directly utilizes the standard PPO for finetuning. Experiments under offline RL and offline-to-online RL setting demonstrate the effectiveness of Uni-O4. Furthermore, this paper extends the offline-to-online setting to address a practical robotic scenario, transforming it into an online-to-offline-to-online setting. Empirical results highlight the seamless integration across these three stages in Uni-O4.

### Strengths
- This paper investigates an interesting research problem: offline-to-online setting, and online(simulator)-to-offline(real-world)-to-online(real-world) setting in robotic scenarios.
- This paper performs extensive experiments to derive empirical findings.

### Weaknesses
Overall, this is a descent paper. However, in the current manuscript, I think the following concerns should be addressed.

== Major concern ==

- Unclear empirical motivation in Figure 1. What does these variants (Conservatism, Constraint, Off-policy) mean in (a)? How does Q value compare with V value in (b)? Moreover, from (b), it seems that CQL->SAC shows faster improvement that On-policy (V). How this conclude that Q values of SAC exhibit slow improvement? Furthermore, CQL->CQL and CQL->SAC are naïve solutions for offline-to-online RL. What about advanced offline-to-online RL algorithms, such as off2on?
- The technique seems incremental by just combining BPPO with OPE.
- I think there exhibits slight overclaiming of the experimental results in Introduction without sufficient comparison of SOTA algorithms.
> Experimental results show that Uni-O4 outperforms both SOTA offline and offline-to-online RL algorithms.
    - Insufficient comparison of offline RL, including but not limited to:

    [1] RORL: Robust Offline Reinforcement Learning via Conservative Smoothing.

    [2] Extreme Q-Learning: MaxEnt RL Without Entropy.

    [3] Offline RL with No OOD Actions: In-Sample Learning via Implicit Value Regularization.

    - Insufficient comparison (including PROTO, ODT, E2O, SPOT, etc.) or at least discussion of related works on offline-to-online RL. Particularly, the baselines include AWAC, CQL, IQL, which are naive solutions for offline-to-online RL. PEX presents weak sample-efficiency for above-medium datasets. Cal-ql is not empirically designed for MuJoCo tasks. There is only one relatively strong baseline, i.e., off2on.

    [1] Adaptive policy learning for offline-to-online reinforcement learning

    [2] Actor-Critic Alignment for Offline-to-Online Reinforcement Learning

    [3] A Simple Unified Uncertainty-Guided Framework for Offline-to-Online Reinforcement Learning

    [4] Efficient online reinforcement learning with offline data

- Minor improvement on MuJoCo tasks in Figure 4. As shown in the figure, off2on significantly outperforms Uni-O4 by a large margin in halfcheetah-medium and halfcheetah-medium-replay. Besides, I also want to point out that 100 D4RL score already achieves expert-level performance in D4RL benchmark. Thus, further improvement on other settings over 100 is not necessary. Thus, I also wonder why this work does not consider random dataset, which presents a significant challenge for online finetuning to achieve expert performance.

- Comparison in Section 5.2 seems not fair enough. Firstly, I want to know which is the claimed baseline WTW in Figure 5? Additionally, given that IQL is not designed specifically for a real-world robotic scenarios, is the comparison between IQL and Uni-O4 fair? (Uni-O4 is revised to adapt to robotic scenarios as stated in the appendix) Maybe a strong baseline can be considered to verify the superiority of Uni-O4.

- I feel a little struggling to follow Section 5.2. Maybe a pseudo-code like A.6 can be provided to make the readers understand the online-offline-online setting more clearly.

- The experimental results in A.3 make me confusing. I cannot identify obvious differences between Figure 11 (a) and (b).

== Minor Concerns ==

- Figure 2 is not that intuitive. Maybe more explanations can make it clearer.

- How many seeds and evaluation trajectories for AntMaze tasks in offline RL setting? Why offline-to-online RL setting does not consider Kitchen, AntMaze and Adroit-cloned and -relocate tasks?

- Why 18 hours training time is **unacceptable** for real-world robot learning?

- Lack of reproducibility statement.

- Maybe more details on baseline implementation for real-world robot tasks can be provided.

- Why this paper does not provide offline training time for comparison?

== Typos ==

- Page 4, above Equation 7: dataset $D$ -> $\mathcal{D}$

- Page 9, Hyper-parameter analysis, loss 7 -> Equation 7 is an optimization objective.
