## Abstract
Maximizing the log-likelihood is a crucial aspect of learning latent variable models, and variational inference (VI) stands as the commonly adopted method. However, VI can encounter challenges in achieving a high log-likelihood when dealing with complicated posterior distributions. In response to this limitation, we introduce a novel variational importance sampling (VIS) approach that directly estimates and maximizes the log-likelihood. VIS leverages the optimal proposal distribution, achieved by minimizing the forward $\chi^2$ divergence, to enhance log-likelihood estimation. We apply VIS to various popular latent variable models, including mixture models, variational auto-encoders, and partially observable generalized linear models. Results demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, both in terms of log-likelihood and model parameter estimation.

### Summary
The paper proposes a variational algorithm for learning model and latent parameters in a latent variable model which at each step first updates the variational distribution by minimizing forward chi-square divergence and then uses this distribution to estimate the log marginal likelihood using Importance Sampling. The optimization is done by gradient ascent where the gradients are estimated by MC sampling.
The proposed algorithm is compared against many contemporary algorithms on simulated and real world datasets, including a large scale case study on multi-neuron interaction modelled by a custom made partially observable GLM.

### Strengths
1. The paper tries well to motivate itself well and the use of chi-square divergence objective as means of finding the optimal distribution for IS is theoretically sound.
2. The paper has done experiments and analysis on may simulated and real world datasets. The experiment on GLP model for multi-neurns activation is well documented and insightful. Some of the plots look good and match the narrative. 
3. The method proposed seems sound to me and the results show that it can perform better than contemporary VI algorithms on the tasks given in the paper.

### Weaknesses
1. The paper is not polished yet, although the major parts are all there, it may require another thorough pass.
it has too many mistakes and typos:, the notation changes from bold to normal in many places, the title has a typo: 'importane', 'log function is a convex function'. 
2. Some of the references and recent literature is missing which have looked on the quality of different divergence objectives such as CUBO and ELBO for finding the optimal sampling distribution.
3. The theory part and the algorithm part can be emphasized more, right now it feels to compressed and dense. The figure 2 is good but it has too many colors and things to unpack, maybe use solid line for true posterior as I was thoroughly confused by the legend choices, and the use of two colors for showing modes reduced readibility for me atleast. 
4. It is the bane of chi-square divergence methods that it  does not scale well with dimensions covered in the papers here: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.09541.pdf and https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.02538 and it seems that this method may not scale well as it uses Chi-squared divergence minimization.

### Questions
1. What is the dimensionality of the POGLM model, do the authors intend to use this method as a tool for low dimensional complex posteriors because both IS and CUBO do not scale well with dimensions and even large sample size as done in this paper will not help.  
2. Maybe include this in your conclusion section and discuss this as a limitation ? 
3. Did the authors use any other optimizers other than ADAM, did it have any effect, how did you choose the optimization algorithm hyperprameters like learning rate etc. ?
4. Did reparameterization gradients perform better than score gradients in the case where they both were available.

### Summary
This work proposes an adaptive importance-sampling algorithm which seeks to improve the proposal distribution by minimising the chi-square divergence from the target distribution to the proposal.

### Strengths
There are a large number of experiments. The proposed method seems to perform well.

Approximating the gradient of the logarithm of the forward $\chi^2$-divergence (rather than the gradient of the $\chi^2$-divergence) seems to enhance numerical stability and seems novel. Though it should be noted that existing approaches improve numerical stability by minimising not the forward $\chi^2$-divergence itself but rather the forward $\chi^2$-divergence multiplied by the squared normalising constant of the target distribution: $p_\theta(x)^2$ (see, e.g., [2]). It is not clear how this compares to the log-space approach taken here.

### Weaknesses
Targetting the $\chi^2$-divergence as an objective for improving the proposal distribution in adaptive importance sampling is not novel. The fact that minimising the variance of the importance weights is equivalent to minimising the chi-square divergence from the target to the proposal is well known in the importance-sampling literature and has already often been used to improve proposal distributions within adaptive importance-sampling schemes, e.g. [1, 2] and references therein.

Furthermore, using such adaptive-importance-sampling approaches for variational inference is already extensively discussed in [3].: 
1. Algorithm 1 of the present paper is a special case of the generic method described in [3, Section 3] (in particular, see [3, Section 3.4]);
2. the $\theta$-gradient from Equation 6 of the present work is already well known (see, e.g. [3]).
3. However, from the author's rebuttal, it is now more clear to me that their $\phi$ gradient is slightly different than in [3] because they derive the $\phi$-gradient in log-space.

### Questions
How does the approach compare with replacing the forward $\chi^2$- with forward KL-divergence (i.e., effectively two out of the three "phases" of reweighted wake--sleep)?

### Summary
The paper focuses on the problem of approximate Bayesian inference in latent variable models and challenges the common wisdom of approximating the posterior with variational inference and maximizing the evidence lower bound (ELBO). The authors identify a mismatch between maximizing ELBO and maximizing loglikelihood, and posit that the latter is a better objective, as it is divorced from the quality of the approximate posterior. To tackle the maximization of loglikelihood, the paper proposes variational importance sampling (VIS), which maximizes the marginal directly via importance sampling. Upon inspecting the variance of the IS estimator, the paper also proposes minimizing the chi-squared divergence w.r.t. the approximate posterior. 

The paper inspects the efficacy of this method on a series of latent variable models, and witness a consistent improvement on the inference of latent variable models.

### Strengths
I think the paper warrants acceptance due to the fact that it tackles a well-motivated problem with a simple, yet empirically effective method. 

- Motivation: the maximization of ELBO as a proxy of likelihood maximization has long been a standard practice in latent variable, even though the mismatch can be significant. I agree with the authors that the mismatch should be inspected more carefully, and that one should separate the approximate posterior inference with the model itself. 
- Methodology: the paper proposes a simple, yet elegant solution to the question of likelihood maximization, and motivate the reasoning behind the optimization of the chi-squared divergence from the perspective of the bias and variance of the IS estimator. This approach seems novel, even though I am not very up-to-date about the research in this regard. 
- Experiments: the paper compares against alternative options in latent variable inference and showcase that the method can correctly infer the marginal likelihood, as well as outperforming competing methods in real-world datasets.

### Weaknesses
I am not entirely sure how the method proposed in this paper differs from previous work, as the practice of using Monte Carlo samples to sharpen variational bound is a topic that has been explored by previous work. I hope the authors can make some clarifications or have a small section in the manuscript that discusses the difference across different ways to combine IS with VI. 

- It is neat to see the same chi-squared divergence on both the bias and effectiveness of the IS estimator, but eq. 8 contains an approximation that seems to work mostly for large $K$s, and the effectiveness is evaluated at the estimator $\hat{p}$ and not $\log \hat{p}$, making the connection seem a bit artificial. Is it possible to minimize a divergence in the form of, e.g., the first line in eq. 8?

### Questions
- The experiments presented in the paper show that VIS performs well, but it seems that a large number of Monte Carlo samples are chosen in many of the experiments. This seems that it can present a significant computational cost. Could the authors include some explanation about the effect of the number of Monte Carlo samples on the efficacy of VIS, and clarify if taking many Monte Carlo samples is practical in training latent variable models?

### Summary
This work proposes a new method of variational inference (VI) for latent variable models based on importance sampling, and shows its effectiveness with numerical experiments on toy model (synthetic), auto encoder model (real) and spike neural network (synthetic and real).

The method improves the tightness of the conventional VI by increasling the batch size of monte-carlo sampling, while giving up the exact computation/minimization of the approximation gap introduced with VI (cf. Eq. 8 and 11). This theoretical trade-off turned out to be beneficial in the experiments.

### Strengths
The paper is original and well written. The performance gain obtained with the proposed method is significant, which is one of the main contribution of the paper.

### Weaknesses
There is no discussion on the limitation of the proposed method.
From what I understood from the paper, I expect the following potential drawbacks:
  - Increase in training time based on the additional sampling
  - Instability in training due to the biased approximation (due to Eq. 8 and 11).

Detailed discussions on this matter are highly welcomed.

### Questions
The ground truth model of the toy experiment (Sec. 4.1) seems unidentifiable. In particular, the distribution of the hidden variable has multiple modes, which seems impossible to be identified only with the binary visible variable. This observation also explains well that despite the fact that the conventional VI substantially failed to estimate the modes, there is only a tiny difference in log-likelihood compared to other methods (order of 1e-4, see Fig. 2a). So, the question is, **why do you compare the parameter convergence, HLL and CLL**, which I think are meaningful to compare only if the model is identifiable? A similar argument also applies to the synthetic experiment of spike NN.
