# Quantile-Free Regression: A Flexible Alternative to Quantile Regression

- Decision: Reject
- Scores: 5, 5, 3, 3, 5

## Abstract
Constructing valid prediction intervals rather than point estimates is a well-established method for uncertainty quantification in the regression setting. Models equipped with this capacity output an interval of values in which the ground truth target will fall with some prespecified probability. This is an essential requirement in many real-world applications in which simple point predictions' inability to convey the magnitude and frequency of errors renders them insufficient for high-stakes decisions. Quantile regression is well-established as a leading approach for obtaining such intervals via the empirical estimation of quantiles in the (non-parametric) distribution of outputs. This method is simple, computationally inexpensive, interpretable, assumption-free, and highly effective. However, it does require that the quantiles being learned are chosen a priori. This results in either (a) intervals that are arbitrarily symmetric around the median which is sub-optimal for real-world skewed distributions or (b) learning an excessive number of intervals. In this work, we propose Quantile-Free Regression (QFR), a direct replacement for quantile regression which liberates it from this limitation whilst maintaining its strengths. We demonstrate that this added flexibility results in intervals with an improvement in desirable qualities (e.g. sharpness) whilst maintaining the essential coverage guarantees of quantile regression.

### Summary
The paper proposes an approach for performing confidence interval regression. To do so, the authors propose a modified version of pinball loss that regresses to the confidence intervals. Since the problem formulation is ill-posed, the papers propose two regularizations on the obtained confidence intervals, namely, interval width and orthogonality. The former promotes shorter intervals, and the latter promotes conditional coverage.

### Strengths
- The modified pinball loss formulation for regressing to confidence intervals is interesting.
- Both regularization techniques, minimizing interval width and promoting orthogonality between width and X, make sense to overcome the ill-posedness of the problem.
- The writing is clear, I also appreciated the theoretical results showing the expected coverage based on the modified pinball loss (+regularizations).

### Weaknesses
- The quantitative results (Table 3) are not strong enough to justify the need for asymmetric intervals (explained below).
- The evaluation methodology for experiments in Table 3 is potentially flawed (explained in detail below).

### Questions
1. Why is it important to report the minimum width interval of a distribution? What practical purpose does it serve to a decision maker who is served with these intervals? The minimum-width intervals come at the cost of losing interpretability on what each end-point constituting the interval means — why is it meaningful to pay this cost? For e.g. in Fig 1a, symmetric intervals convey the following facts: the probability of the random variable to exceed $\mu_h$, probability of the random variable to be lower than $\mu_l$, and that probability of falling within the interval $[\mu_l, \mu_h]$. Whereas in Fig 1b, we only know the probability of falling within $[\mu_l, \mu_h]$. Doesn’t this convey much less information to a decision maker that makes use of these interval estimates?
2. Following the point above, is it possible to know _which_ quantiles do the predicted interval endpoints $\mu_l$ and $\mu_h$ correspond to? This could then partially alleviate the aforementioned limitation.
3. An alternative approach to predicting confidence intervals is to regress to all quantile levels at once, as the authors also noted. Then one can present the smallest interval among all, post-hoc. The authors mention that the limitation of this approach is that SQR [Tagasovska and Lopez-Paz, 2019] performs poorly and thus limits its utility. Recently there have been other approaches [1, 2] to regress all quantiles at once. I encourage the authors to consider evaluating these approaches.
4. *Evaluation methodology.* Firstly, the results suggest that the suggested QFR method results in relatively marginal improvements compared to the trivial baseline QR, and other baselines. This does not fully support the claim of the paper that symmetric intervals are worse than asymmetric ones, as one needs to sacrifice the interpretability of the intervals (see point 1), for very little gain in the interval width. Secondly, and more importantly, I find it concerning that many results in Table 3 were in strikethrough because the coverage requirement is not met. In order to fairly compare two uncertainty estimation methods, it is important that both methods have the same marginal coverage. For example, consider the dataset $\texttt{energy}$, QFR-W has 89.87% coverage and 0.13 width, and QR has 98.31% coverage and 0.18 width, how can one claim that QFR-W is better than QR? One way to carry out a fair comparison is by employing conformal prediction–based wrappers [3] that guarantee marginal coverage, then it is possible to compare different methods in terms of interval width, while they obey the same coverage requirements. Otherwise I am afraid that the comparisons in this table do not fully make sense.

Overall, I found the idea of regressing to the intervals directly via the modified pinball loss clever  and interesting. However, I believe addressing the above points clearly is important for the paper to reach its full potential. I encourage the authors to consider my suggestions.

### Summary
This paper proposes a quantile-free regression to provide prediction intervals. Traditionally, prediction intervals are constructed by fitting quantile regressions. However, using the proposed approach, the width of the intervals can be effectively narrowed down by exploiting the asymmetries of the distributions. Overall, this paper solves a fundamental problem in machine learning and statistics.

### Strengths
1. The paper studies an important problem and has real potential.
2. Theoretical justification is provided via asymptotic coverage guarantees.

### Weaknesses
In my opinion, the main weakness is that the improvement over the existing approaches seems to be unclear. See details in the Questions Section below.

### Questions
1. The improvement over the existing approaches is basically marginal. 
  - More importantly, the improvement in the width of the intervals might be due to the regularization term on the interval width. It seems that the same regularization can be naturally applied to QR and WS. Hence, the comparison may not be fair. 
  - The above statement can also be seen from Table 2. For the skewed distribution, the proposed QFR fails to outperform QR; only the QFR-W with the regularization outperforms QR. 
  - It does not make sense to strikethrough the case when the coverage probability is higher than the nominal value. For example, it seems to me that, in Table 3, QR performs much better than the proposed method in yacht data, as the width is roughly the same while the coverage of QR is much higher with a smaller standard error. 

2. The essential idea of this paper, as well as some competing methods such as SQR, WS, and IR, is to put different weights on the different sides of the intervals. For example, if a distribution is skewed to the right, it is desired to include more data points on the left of the median in the interval to reduce the width. However, as shown in Figure 2, the proposed QFR-W intervals are narrower than the QR intervals on both sides. Can the author explain why this happens?

3. The name of the proposed method is slightly confusing. The new method basically uses a new loss to estimate the quantiles, so it is not really quantile-free. Also, the main purpose of the quantile regression is to estimate quantiles, and constructing intervals is typically seen as a byproduct. Can the proposed method directly be used to estimate quantiles? If not, it is not appropriate to claim the method is a direct replacement for quantile regression.

### Summary
This paper introduces Quantile-Free Regression (QFR). QFR targets to compute an upper and lower interval bounds such that the interval achieves a user-specified target coverage level. Since there are infinitely many solutions to the unregularized QFR problem, the authors proposed two regularization terms to induce some preference among solutions. The two regularization terms favor small interval width and independence between interval width and coverage level, respectively. Theoretical analysis guarantees that the trained QFR model covers exactly the target level. Empirical results show that the QFR model and the two regularization terms can induce the desired properties.

### Strengths
- The paper proposes a simple approach to compute two quantile estimates such that they cover a target level of data. A novel objective function for performing QFR is proposed.
- Existing interval regression methods do not guarantee asymptotic coverage, while the proposed approach has theoretical guarantee and is empirically tested.
- This paper is clearly written and very easy to follow.
- An extensive literature review which discusses the connections and differences of the proposed work and existing approaches is given.
- Extensive synthetic and real experimental data are used to test the performance of the model and verify the claims made by the authors.

### Weaknesses
- In the experiments, only the case of high-level coverage (90%) is tested. More extensive experiments considering low and mid-level coverage should be performed. It seems that there is no guarantee on monotonicity, i.e., \mu_l <= \mu_u. I wonder if monotonicity is preserved for a low-level target coverage level
- The comparing methods are mostly basic models. There are SQR approaches which compute the estimates over all quantile levels and has comparable computational cost to QR approaches, e.g., the monotonic regression splines approach and [1]. The authors can consider adding more methods to the experiments.
- I am not sure about the statement "QFR maintains QR's strengths". While the proposed method can flexibly achieve the target coverage level, the corresponding quantile levels for the interval cannot be obtained. The main strength of QR is that the estimates for specific quantile levels are provided.

### Questions
- My main concern is about the model performance on other levels of coverage. How does the model perform compared to the baselines, when \alpha is say, 30%, 50% and 70%?
- The practical advantages of narrow interval width and independence between interval width and coverage are unclear. For instance, is there any real-world situation where the property shown in figure 1 is desirable?
- SQF computes the quantile estimates for more than two values. In the experimental results, how is the coverage of SQF computed? 
- Is there any intuition on why QFR outperforms QR on getting a 90% coverage?

### Summary
The paper proposes a new loss function that directly predicts the interval and frees the need to specify upper and lower quantile levels when predicting the conditional confidence intervals. The rationale behind this construction is to write out the optimization problem (with the vanilla pinball loss) for the upper and lower quantiles respectively and then combine these two problems in a way such that the exact value of the lower quantile level is eliminated, and only the difference between upper and lower quantile levels remains.

### Strengths
The paper proposes a new loss function -- the quantile-free regression (QRF) loss. The loss function is natural and interesting, especially the result in Theorem 3.2 which explicitly depicts the "confidence shrinking" effect of the regularization term. What's more, this loss is intrinsically open to the continuous search for the sharpest confidence interval, unlike traditional methods that often take a grid search among discrete choices.

### Weaknesses
1. The paper doesn't provide any guarantees other than the asymptotic consistency result for the proposed QRF loss. In order to argue for the advantage of this QRF loss over multiple alternatives (like, explicitly fixing the lower quantiles and upper quantiles), finite sample error would be more desirable.

2. It makes sense that when the conditional distribution is skewed, using a symmetric confidence interval is not an optimal choice, yet the missing part of the argument is, why the QRF loss is an optimal or better choice? Say, under what distribution shape will the QRF be preferable? The current theoretical evidence only supports that QRF is consistent in a marginal sense (which is weak), but it doesn't show the advantage of the QRF over other methods as claimed. For the numerical experiments, the synthetic experiment is a bit special, while the real-data experiments didn't include many other calibration methods, but only those quantile regression-based ones. 

3. The loss function seems to add an additional non-convexity because of the cross term of the product $\mu_l\cdot \mu_u$. I think the common belief is that we need to be very cautious when we introduce non-convexity to the loss function.

### Summary
This paper studies loss functions for quantile regression problems. The authors propose a quantile-free regression method to estimate quantile-based intervals for output variables. Theoretical analysis reveals that the proposed loss function yields a consistent result for an infinite sample limit. Though the l_2 regularization for quantile intervals induces a bias to the estimated interval, the authors proposed how to adjust the regularization parameter and the coverage probability to maintain the consistency of the proposed method. Numerical studies indicate the proposed method outperforms some existing methods for estimating the quantile-based intervals.

### Strengths
- The problem considered in the paper is important. The authors proposed an interesting loss function for estimating two quantile regressions simultaneously.
- Theorem 3.2 reveals the relationship between the coverage probability and regularization parameter. This is an interesting and important result.

### Weaknesses
- From the definition, \mu_l(x) should be less than \mu_u(x) for arbitrary x. Is there any theoretical guarantee that the estimated upper and lower quantiles satisfy that inequality? Supplementary comments on that would be helpful for practitioners. 

- Theoretical analysis is insufficient to guarantee the proposed method's effectiveness. The authors could theoretically investigate the estimation accuracy and prediction performance of the estimated intervals using the quantiles. The theoretical guarantee would be hard when a neural network model is employed. On the other hand, theoretical analysis for simple models such as the linear model would be possible. 

- The stability of the estimator can depend on the coverage probability. Intuitively, the estimator for the small coverage probability will be vulnerable to a small data perturbation. Showing some theoretical or numerical explanation on that will be helpful for readers.
