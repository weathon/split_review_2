# Towards Foundation Models for Knowledge Graph Reasoning

- Decision: Accept
- Scores: 8, 5, 8, 6

## Abstract
Foundation models in language and vision have the ability to run inference on any textual and visual inputs thanks to the transferable representations such as a vocabulary of tokens in language. 
Knowledge graphs (KGs) have different entity and relation vocabularies that generally do not overlap.
The key challenge of designing foundation models on KGs is to learn such transferable representations that enable inference on any graph with arbitrary entity and relation vocabularies.
In this work, we make a step towards such foundation models and present \method, an approach for learning universal and transferable graph representations. 
\method builds relational representations as a function conditioned on their interactions.
Such a conditioning strategy allows a pre-trained \method model to inductively generalize to any unseen KG with any relation vocabulary and to be fine-tuned on any graph.
Conducting link prediction experiments on 57 different KGs, we find that the \emph{zero-shot} inductive inference performance of a single pre-trained \method  model on unseen graphs of various sizes is often on par or better than strong baselines trained on specific graphs. 
Fine-tuning further boosts the performance. % even further.

### Summary
The key limitation of designing the foundation models for dealing with the Knowledge Graphs (KGs) is that the KGs have different entities and relations that generally do not overlap. To address this issue, this paper proposes ULTRA, which positively transfers the information of source KG to unseen KG. It constructs relation representations based on the interactions between the relations by introducing the graph of relations. The proposed approach has shown good performance on various tasks.

### Strengths
- From their experiments, the proposed methods have shown good performance on various tasks.
- Research topics about the foundational models on graph-structured datasets is really interesting and important.
- The paper is well written and easy to follow.

### Weaknesses
- The authors first pretrain the ULTRA model with the mixture of 3 standard KGs and then fine the model for the downstream task. But, the other supervised SOTA model only uses dataset of the downstream tasks without employing the pre-training datasets. If the supervised SOTA models are designed to deal with transductive settings, they may show worse performance on the downstream tasks. However, if the SOTA models are the models for the inductive setting, I think they may be possible to be pretrained like the ULTRA. So, could you measure the performance of the "pretrained" SOTA models on the inductive if possible?

### Summary
Paper claims to propose a foundation model, named Ultra, for knowledge graph representation learning. The proposed model can handle full inductive graphs in which new entities and relations may appear in the test set. To do so, the authors propose to lift the graph to a one with relations as the nodes and design 4 different edge types (head2head, head2tail, tail2head, tail2tail). The relational representations are then learnt using message passing on this graph. The learnt relation embeddings are then used in the original graph to perform inductive link prediction. For the experiments, the authors pre-train their method on 3 KGs and further evaluate in a zero-shot setting and also by fine-tuning the downstream tasks.

### Strengths
- The paper proposes a transductive model that works in settings of new relations and entity nodes.
- The method obtains good zero-shot pretraining results.

### Weaknesses
- The authors have not explicitly stated the computational complexity of the method. From the paper, it seems that the forward pass is run on the entire relational graph to obtain relation representations. This is then used to initialize the node embedding from the query triple and the process is repeated for every triple. Thus it seems that the entire graph is being used for link prediction every triple making the computational complexity O(E^2). This seems limiting for large graphs that have not been explored in the paper (such as wikidata-5m etc.).
- From Table 2 we can see that finetuning over the pre-trained models helps the results significantly over the 0-shot setting. Also, the fine-tuning steps are too large to claim few shot results. This weakens the claim of the "foundation model" for KGs. A fair comparison would be to show the pretraining results for other inductive and transductive methods as well in addition to the SOTA comparison.
- Another limitation is that of scale. Since the current model has fewer parameters, this would limit learning over larger pretraining datasets as can be seen in Figure 6 and also reported by the authors.
- SoTA results for transductive models are better than the pre-trained Ultra model in many datasets. Thus the Ultra model seems to work well for the inductive setting rather than transductive. Thus the claim of the "foundation model" seems broader in scope.
- We see that in the metafam dataset, the pretraining results are poor but on finetuning the results are improved drastically. This shows that the method works well in cases where the relational patterns of the downstream datasets are similar to the pre-trained one but when the data distribution changes the results suffer. Moreover, due to limited capacity, the model may not be able to handle such cases by increasing the pretraining datasets calling for downstream finetuning. Thus domain adaptation is not a problem which can be easily overcome by scaling the current model and this further weakens the claim of a "foundation model" for KGs.

### Questions
- For weakness point 2: Any reason why this was not done by the authors?
- For weakness point 3: How would this be addressed in future works for the model?
-  For weakness point 4: Could the authors comment on why this would be the case and how would the model be improved to handle the transductive setting?
- For weakness point 5: Any reason why the results on this dataset are not good?
- Considering KGs are a rich source of textual/semantic data along with graph/structured data and the current model does not use this rich source of context information, how can we extend Ultra to incorporate the KG ontology? 
- Considering weaknesses 2,4,5 the claim of the foundation model seems a bit broad as of now and at best the model could be said to be a good inductive learner.

### Summary
This work aims to build a foundation model for knowledge graph reasoning tasks, where the authors explore the setting of generalization to any edges and nodes, including unseen, of any multi-relational knowledge graphs without using node and edge features. To this end, the authors first construct a view of a relation-centric graph from an original graph where edges become nodes of this new relation graph, and then, based on this view, the authors represent the relation (node) relative to and conditioned on the query relation. Then, based on this relative relation representation, the authors use existing inductive link prediction methods to perform knowledge graph reasoning. The authors conduct link prediction experiments on various knowledge graphs considering both inductive and transductive settings, and show that the proposed method, namely ULTRA, outperforms other SOTA baselines sometimes without further fine-tuning on target knowledge graphs (i.e., zero-shot).

### Strengths
* This work studies the very important, challenging, and practical setups of building a foundation model for knowledge graph reasoning, which aims to be generalizable to any other knowledge graphs involving unseen nodes and unseen edges, without leveraging features of nodes and edges. 
* The proposed method works well with different knowledge graphs, on zero-shot transfer learning setups without further fine-tuning on target knowledge graphs, and further shows the boosted performance with task-specific further fine-tuning on them, on most experiment setups.
* This paper is very well-written and easy to follow.

### Weaknesses
* I would like to note that I don't see any major weakness, and below is the minor.
* In Section 4.2, the explanation about the indicator function with variables $u$ and $v$ is a bit unclear to me. Could you elaborate more on the process and result of the indicator function according to those two variables, perhaps with visuals?
* Text-based methods (e.g., LM-based methods) can be generalizable to any knowledge graphs including unseen nodes and unseen edges, as long as their nodes and edges are represented with texts. In this vein, I think one potential direction for building a foundation model for knowledge graph-related tasks might be to use the LMs, and the authors may highlight this point more and potentially make comparisons between the proposed approach and text-based methods. I don't think this should be the critical weakness of this paper since text-based methods are limited to knowledge graphs with textual features; meanwhile, given the framing of this work ("Towards Foundation Models for Knowledge Graph Reasoning"), this point should be carefully explained.

### Questions
* I would like to suggest emphasizing the performance differences between inductive and transductive setups when explaining Table 1. The proposed method w/ 0-shot settings are strong on inductive graphs; meanwhile, previous methods are superior to it on transductive graphs, which are worthwhile to discuss.
* It may be beneficial to show the results of the ULTRA fine-tuned on the knowledge graphs used for pre-training the ULTRA. I am wondering if there are further performance improvements when further fine-tuning the model on the data used for pre-training.

### Summary
This paper presents ULTRA, a single model that can be directly used/finetuned for link prediction over different knowledge graphs. The key is to model the transferrable relationships between different relations across knowledge graphs. Specifically, a NBFNet is used to learn relative relation representations and generate relation embeddings, which is then fed into another NBFNet to perform link predictions. Extensive experiments are performed over many knowledge graph to demonstrate the performance of this model.

### Strengths
- This paper is well written and easy to follow
- The core method around the relative relationships between relations is clever and interesting.
- The experiments demonstrate the gains of the method. It is especially impressive to see the competitive zero-shot performance of ULTRA over different knowledge graphs.

### Weaknesses
- The proposed method relies entirely on knowledge graph structure and does not consider using node embedding such as textual features of the knowledge graphs. In reality, text embedding of nodes and edges could be a better transferrable embedding. Such transferability has already been demonstrated by PRODIGY (https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.12600) and should be addressed.
- The model does not scale well as the authors already pointed out.
- The zero shot and fine-tuning performances are worse or on-par with the per dataset model performance, rendering pretraining not effective performance-wise. 
- Some notations are a bit hard to understand. See questions.

### Questions
- What are u and v in h_{u|v} in section 4.2?
- Why are supervised SOTA baselines only reported for some datasets in Figure 4?
