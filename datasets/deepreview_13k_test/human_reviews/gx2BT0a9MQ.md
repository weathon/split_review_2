# ZeRO++: Extremely Efficient Collective Communication for Large Model Training

- Decision: Accept
- Scores: 6, 6, 5, 5, 8

## Abstract
Zero Redundancy Optimizer (ZeRO) has been used to train a wide range of large language models on massive GPU clusters due to its ease of use, efficiency, and good scalability. However, when training on low-bandwidth clusters, and/or when small batch size per GPU is used, ZeRO’s effective throughput is limited due to communication overheads. To alleviate this limitation, this paper introduces ZeRO++ composing of three communication volume reduction techniques (lowprecision all-gather, data remapping, and low-precision gradient averaging) to significantly reduce the communication volume up to 4x that enables up to 2.16x better throughput at 384 GPU scale. Our results also show ZeRO++ can speedup the RLHF by 3.3x compared to vanilla ZeRO. To verify the convergence of ZeRO++, we test up to 13B model for pretraining with 8/6-bits all gather and up to 30B model for finetuning with 4/2-bits all gather, and demonstrate on-par accuracy as original ZeRO (aka standard training). As a byproduct, the model trained with ZeRO++ is naturally weight-quantized, which can be directly used for inference without post-training quantization or quantization-aware training.

### Rating Number

### Confidence
4: You are confident in your assessment, but not absolutely certain. It is unlikely, but not impossible, that you did not understand some parts of the submission or that you are unfamiliar with some pieces of related work.

### Summary
This paper proposes ZeRO++, a communication-efficient extension of the commonly used memory-efficient training framework for LLMs, ZeRO. The proposed techniques include three specific techniques to reduce communication costs, improve the throughput and accelerate the training process.

### Strengths
1. This paper proposes quantized weight communication, hierarchical partitioning, and quantized gradient communication techniques to reduce the communication costs and achieves efficient implementation of overlap computing and communication. The parallelism of training is the focus.

2. The experiments presented are quite convincing, including large-scale language model training and fine-tuning on a large GPU cluster. The convergence accuracy and throughput reflect great improvements.

3.	Training on low-bandwidth clusters is an important question and this paper solves it to some degree.

### Weaknesses
1.	In my opinion, the main insufficient of this paper is short of novelty. In fact, this paper is more like a technical report instead of an academic paper. The techniques of quantization and organizing the communication into a new topology are not new ideas. However, considering the overlap realization and trade-off between memory and communication are difficult and expensive, this paper is still significant for LLM community.

2.	Another problem is that this paper is lack of specific introduction to used quantization techniques and corresponding theoretical analysis. For example, how the quantization error affects the convergence rate and whether the error-feedback technique works.

### Questions
1.	What is the specific quantization methods in qwZ and qgZ?
2.	How to choose the quantization ratio during training and fine-tuning? I am interested in the inner effect of ratio on the convergence of different tasks.
3.	In the real low-bandwidth environment, does the trade-off between memory and communication still work without NVLink?

### Confidence
4: You are confident in your assessment, but not absolutely certain. It is unlikely, but not impossible, that you did not understand some parts of the submission or that you are unfamiliar with some pieces of related work.

### Summary
The paper proposes an extension to the existing memory optimal training technique for LLMs, *ZeRO*. The proposed enhancements address the expensive communication problems of the state-of-the-art method, especially when trained on low bandwidth networks. ZeRO++ with the new quantization enabled communication strategies achieves reasonably good performance over ZeRO while keeping the performance of LLMs intact.

### Strengths
- The paper is well written, detailed and easy to understand for both DL and HPC communities. (assuming readers have some basic understanding of both the worlds).
- Has a good coverage of the existing literature and positions the paper with-in the body of work.
- The problem is probably impactful for low-resource devices such as low band-width networks.

### Weaknesses
- The paper shows the effectiveness of the proposed method on powerful DGX GPUs with infiniBand interconnects. Noway, we can consider this interconnect as low-bandwidth. 
- Intra-node weight storage sounds interesting and empirically showed to work for upto 30B model fine-tuning and 13B model pre-training. Wonder, if this can be scaled if there is any ablation on this dimension?

### Questions
- One simple experiment (even on a network of RasberryPi machines) with low-badwidth networks will obviously greatly strengthens the paper claims/contributions. This can be fine-tuning does not even have to be pre-training. 
- A feasibility study on the scalability of the method, especially because of the GPU memory tradeoff within the node, would help.
- Upon some or all of the above concerns being addressed, would be happy to raise the score. 
- Also, wonder, if there is any open implementations for this complex custom communication MPI primitives?

### Summary
This work, ZeRO++, proposes a collective communication optimization for ZeRO3 of DeepSpeed library. Three elements are introduced: 1) quantized AllGather of weight, 2) hierarchical partition, and 3) quantized ReduceScatter of gradient with AlltoAll. When combined together, ZeRO++ reduces communication volume and network hops to mitigate the communication bottleneck of ZeRO3 training for large models.

### Strengths
+. Replaced Ring-ReduceScatter with AlltoAll for lower latency and less quantization/dequantization times

+. Optimized intra-node and inter-node AlltoAll

### Weaknesses
-. **Limited contribution**
> qwZ quantizes FP16 weights to lower precision right during the all-gather, and dequantizes them back to FP16 on the receiver side, and then conducts layer computation.

* Why cast FP16 weight into INT4 is a novel contribution? Just use "torch.Tensor.to()"?
* What if model is being trained FP8 on the modern H100? so the communication benefit will be halved?
* Will cast FP16 into INT4 occupy 25%+ extra GPU memory (assuming zero fragmentation)?

> hpZ removes cross node traffic in backward all-gather by holding secondary weight partitions in on device memory.

* How is this scheme different from HSDP of PyTorch (Intra-Machine FSDP to shard weight + inter-Machine DDP to replicate weight)? HSDP was published in VLDB'2023.

> qgZ is a novel quantized reduce-scatter algorithm based on all-to-all collectives that enables a 4xcommunication volume reduction of gradient reduce-scatter by replacing FP16 with INT4.

* Same question as weight quantization

-. **Limited Convergence Analysis**

> Pretrain: We analyze the pretraining of GPT-350M and GPT-13B models on the Pile dataset

How does this work apply to different datasets for convergence behavior, considering extreme quantization?

Besides Figure 9, does this work provide accurate numbers for loss diffs for pertaining?

> Fine-tuning. Table 2

It seems this work always worse the perplexity compared with baseline.

### Questions
*. Does this work provide open-source code?

*. Is this work ever used in production for industrial models?

### Rating

### Rating Number
5

### Confidence
5: You are absolutely certain about your assessment. You are very familiar with the related work and checked the math/other details carefully.

### Summary
This paper proposed ZeRO++, which includes three main techniques to accelerate communication in distributed training of foundation models: i) low-precision AllGather for parameter collection, ii) hierarchy communication optimization, and ii) low-precision gradient aggregation. Empirical studies was conducted to verify the performance of the proposed method.

### Strengths
- Optimizing the communication in ZeRO or more generally speaking, optimizer parallelism is an important problem to scale out / speed up foundation model training.

- The proposed design and implementation are reasonable. 

- The evaluation is conducted on a large production-level GPU cluster to evaluate models at the state-of-the-art scales.

### Weaknesses
- My main concern about the paper is lack of novelty as a research paper instead of a software report, concretely, w.r.t each technique contribution, I have the following comments:
  - Low-precision gradient averaging: such a technique has been studied for decades in standard data parallel training; integrating them in an existing system probably cannot be viewed as a novelty in a top ML volume (i.e., ICLR).    
  - Organizing the communication as a hierarchy topology is not a new approach; a similar implementation was introduced in PyTorch-FSDP about six months ago.
  - Distributing the model weights with lower precision is an interesting point. However, there is a lack of concrete theoretical analysis about this approach, i.e., now the model parameter includes some quantization error; how would this influence the convergence behavior?

### Questions
Would it be possible to provide some theoretical analysis about the convergence given the quantized communication of the weights distribution?

### Confidence
3: You are fairly confident in your assessment. It is possible that you did not understand some parts of the submission or that you are unfamiliar with some pieces of related work. Math/other details were not carefully checked.

### Summary
This paper proposes zero++, which contains 3 communication reduction techniques (low-precision parameter all-gather, data remapping, and low-precision gradient averaging), in order to reduce the communication overhead and acceleration the training.

### Strengths
1. This paper proposes zero++, which contains 3 communication reduction techniques (low-precision parameter all-gather, data remapping, and low-precision gradient averaging) with sufficient details provided in the appendix.

2. Additional to the system design, an optimized implementation is also proposed.

3. The experiments show good performance on real-world training tasks.

### Weaknesses
1. Some part of the paper is a little bit vague and confusing, please refer to the "Questions" below for more details.

2. The main reason I'm holding back from a better score is that zero++ seems to have huge overlap with QSDP (Markov, I., Vladu, A., Guo, Q., & Alistarh, D. (2023). Quantized Distributed Training of Large Models with Convergence Guarantees. ICML 2023). I understand that QSDP was officially published on ICML not very long ago and we reviewers should not take the release date on arxiv as a reason to reject this paper. However, this is a delicate situation for me and I guess we will need the AC to judge. 
For now, I still need the authors to give a detailed comparison between QSDP and zero++, which will help a lot for my paper review.

### Questions
1. Does the gradient and parameter communication compression use the same quantizer/quantization algorithms? What are the specific quantization algorithm used in the experiments?

2. In experiments, some details are missing. For example, in Section 4.3 "Pretraining" (or Figure 9), it is mentioned that 8-bit or 6-bit quantization is used. However, it is unknown whether is 8-bit for both parameters and gradients? or 8-bit for parameters and fp16 for gradients? or fp16 for parameters and 8-bit for gradients? I strongly recommend the authors to specify what (parameter or gradient) is quantized wherever quantization/precision configuration is mentioned.

3. In the experiments,  Section 4.3 "Fine-tuning" (or Table 2), it is mentioned that "with ZeRO++ using FP6, INT4, and INT2 precision for qwZ and INT-8 for qgZ ..." I wonder why not also conduct some experiments of lower precision (int4, int2) on qgZ? Also, is there any ablation experiments on other configurations, such as int4 qwZ + fp16 qgZ?

BTW, there is "FP6" in Section 4.3 (see the sentence I quoted above), is it a typo and the authors actually mean "FP16" here?

4. What's the difference between Zero++ and QSDP (in system design), except for the hierarchical partitioning in Zero++ (hpZ)?
