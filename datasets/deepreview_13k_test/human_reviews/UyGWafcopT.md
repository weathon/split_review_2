# Meaning Representations from Trajectories in Autoregressive Models

- Decision: Accept
- Scores: 6, 8, 6, 8

## Abstract
We propose to extract meaning representations from autoregressive language models by considering the distribution of all possible trajectories extending an input text. This strategy is prompt-free, does not require fine-tuning, and is applicable to any pre-trained autoregressive model. Moreover, unlike vector-based representations,  distribution-based representations can also model asymmetric relations (\eg, direction of logical entailment, hypernym/hyponym relations) by using algebraic operations between likelihood functions. These ideas are grounded in distributional perspectives on semantics and are connected to standard constructions in automata theory, but to our knowledge they have not been applied to modern language models. We empirically show that the representations obtained from large models align well with human annotations, outperform other zero-shot and prompt-free methods on semantic similarity tasks, and can be used to solve more complex entailment and containment tasks that standard embeddings cannot handle. Finally, we extend our method  to represent data from different modalities (\eg, image and text) using multimodal autoregressive models

### Summary
The paper presents an innovative approach to interpret and represent the meaning of text in autoregressive LLMs through the concept of trajectories -- distributions of potential text continuations. This method diverges from traditional vector space embeddings, offering a a semantic interpretation that aligns with the actual use and context of language as understood by LLMs. It effectively overcomes the challenges posed by other methods, such as prompt dependency and the need for fine-tuning, providing a more faithful reflection of the model's internal representations without additional data or model modifications.

Empirical results demonstrate that this trajectory-based approach can successfully capture complex linguistic relationships and perform competitively on semantic textual similarity tasks without any fine-tuning or prompts. Furthermore, the paper extends this approach to multimodal models, where it outperforms established benchmarks like CLIP embeddings in understanding semantic similarities across images. The main contributions of the study include a new interpretable semantic representation for autoregressive models, the alignment of these representations with human linguistic understanding, and the applicability of the method to multimodal contexts.

### Strengths
1. The paper's trajectory-based method for understanding LLMs is original, diverging from typical vector space models and prompt-based approaches, and introducing a new angle to distributional semantics.

2. The approach has been empirically tested against established benchmarks, indicating robust methodology and results that surpass existing techniques like CLIP embeddings on image-image similarity tasks.

3. The paper is clearly articulated, systematically presenting the new method and its implications, with illustrative examples that enhance comprehension of the proposed concepts.

4. This work is significant for its practical application in making LLMs more interpretable without extra training, it is an approach that is original as far as I know.

### Weaknesses
My main criticism of the paper is in the results for semantic similarity, they are far below those of contrastive methods (like 10 pts or so). I also the Sentence-T5 results are a bit misleading, that is the case without any fine-tuning. This isn't explicitly stated. There are other approaches that achieve far higher results on these tasks that do not use the training data for these tasks. I think the Sentence-T5 results in this paper are actually worse than a random encoder where random word embeddings are average together.

There are also a few typos:

Section 3: “Speicifically”
Appendix E: “presenedt”

### Questions
How does this model perform relative to more interpretable baselines - like random word embeddings?

### Summary
The paper proposes a new method of sentence or phrase similarity measures using Decoder-only language models.  Decoder-only language models generate a continual string of tokens given an input. The proposed method measures two given sentences as individual inputs to a decoder-only model and measures the distributional similarity between the probabilities of multiple possible continual strings, named trajectories, for both of the inputs.
While it cannot catch up with the recent contrastive learning-based sentence similarity models, it outperforms most off-the-shelf encoder-based sentence representation models.
Although there are limitations especially high computational costs, the proposed method is interesting and unique.

### Strengths
- The paper is overall well-written. I had no difficulty in reading and understanding this paper.
- This paper presents an interesting and unique usage of decoder-only language models for measuring sentence similarity.
- The proposed method shows better performance on sentence similarity tasks over encoder-based baselines.

### Weaknesses
- For the baseline encoder-only models, it is better to include larger models like BERT-large and RoBERTa-large using their CLS tokens and token averages.
- The discussion about partial ordering between sentences is a bit puzzling. Since Tu and Tv are samples from u and v respectively, the former set of trajectories usually gives high Mu values for u and vise versa, so it hardly happens that Mu < Mv or Mu > Mv for all t in Tu U Tv. Besides, the discussion of entailment suddenly shifts from the comparison between Mu and Mv to the comparison between d(Mu cup Mv, Mu) and d(Mu cup Mv, Mv). This part is also quite puzzling.
- For the experiments of entailment and hypernym/hyponym evaluation, there is an assumption that either of those relations exists between the given input pairs, which is not realistic.
- As is pointed out in the limitation paragraph, the proposed model is computationally higher than other baseline models. In the Appendix, it is tested using a fixed set of trajectories, which seems to cause a big performance degradation.

### Questions
- For the Hyponym test, the contexts for a given word u are not sampled but retrieved from. It is not clear how the value Mu(s u t) is obtained.
- Is it guaranteed that the set of trajectories for an input u always the same? Or, does it vary each time sampling for a sentence u is conducted?
- The Autoregressive Model Baselines look very weak. I am not sure they are worth being included.

### Confidence
3: You are fairly confident in your assessment. It is possible that you did not understand some parts of the submission or that you are unfamiliar with some pieces of related work. Math/other details were not carefully checked.

### Summary
This work proposes an alternative sentence meaning representation (specifically for sentence similarity) for zero-shot use with auto-regressive LMs.   The method is to sample N possible following texts for two sentences A and B, and score each of those 2N following text for its probability of following A and the probability of following B, and then compare difference between the probabilities. They explore the ability to modify the notion of similarity by augmenting those sentences with prompts, and evaluate on zero-shot Semeval STS tasks, a task of comparing captions to CLIP outputs, and (using a modified approach to focus on single-word characterization) a lexical semantics task (WordNet hypernym modeling).

### Strengths
- The work seems to outperform other methods for autoregressive representation of sentences on the sentence similarity tasks studied, indicating its potential for continued relevance and utility. 
- The ability to modify similarity using prompting is very clever. 
- On a theoretical level, thinking about sentence meaning in terms of this theoretical notion of a trajectory of meanings is a great framing.

### Weaknesses
- It has a relatively rigid and narrow use case, since this method can only be used for pairwise comparison and since it's not obvious how to fine-tune it.  
- The work frames it as producing "interpretable" vectors, but the work was somewhat lacking in an actual exploration of that interpretability. 
- I liked the idea of the entailment and hypernymy work, but it felt a bit convoluted: the way they approached both tasks seems to have lead to them comparing to weak baselines, despite NLI and wordnet link detection being well-explored areas.

### Questions
- As mentioned above: do the authors feel that this would be viable to fine-tune, or is it limited entirely to zero-shot STS settings (plus entailment/hypernymy)? 
- Wouldn't the general hypernymy assumptions often be violated under negation?

### Summary
This paper proposes a "meaning representation" of a text based on inverse perplexity for the continuation sequence of the text.
The authors define a semantic distance between two prompts using their meaning representations.
This is useful for capturing the similarity between texts and for testing hyponym relationships.
Additionally, it can be applied to multimodal autoregressive models.

### Strengths
This paper is well-written, featuring concrete formulations and structured experiments.
The authors introduce a novel and powerful semantic distance measurement that captures sentence similarity and hyponym relationships. Furthermore, they demonstrate that this distance can be computed more efficiently than initially concerned, alleviating worries about sampling a lot of trajectories.

### Weaknesses
1) The authors define a 'syntactic meaning representation' as the function $M_s$. I'm unclear as to why it is named 'syntactic meaning representation' (I'm also unsure why 'syntactic' is included). It is simply the conditional probability of the prompt. I don't find it to be a useful 'representation' for training or other applications like vector-space representation. In fact, they merely use the divergence between the conditional probabilities to measure text similarity. If this approach hasn't been taken by others, then this divergence could be considered novel. Thus, I cautiously suggest they use 'inverse perplexity mapping' rather than 'meaning representation'. The paper's title could then be 'A New Measurement for Sentence Similarity via Sampling Trajectories in Autoregressive Models'. Furthermore, 'semantic representations' appear suddenly following Algorithm 1. I recommend they use 'inverse perplexity mapping for substrings' instead of 'semantic representations'.

2) I'm unsure what is meant by 'meaning containment'. Why use 'containment', which typically refers to 'the action of keeping something harmful under control or within limits'? Please provide a definition or explanation, along with some references.

3) For the final version, sharing the code on GitHub would be beneficial for readers.

### Questions
1) The similarity distance depends on the performance of the autoregressive model. If the model is fine-tuned, e.g., for a chatbot, then how would the similarity change?

2) In the first sentence of the second paragraph under **Meaning representation for prompts**, I think $M_u$ should be changed to $M_s$ and $t\in \mathcal{A}^1$ should be changed to $t\in \mathcal{A}^*$.

3) In the second sentence of the paragraph **Containments of semantic representations**, the definition of 'partial order' should be revised. Since $\sum_{\mathrm{len}(t) = m} M_u(t)^{m} = \sum_{\mathrm{len}(t) = m} M_v (t)^{m} = 1$, we cannot have $M_u(t) < M_v(t)$ for all $t\in \mathcal{A}^*$. Please update the definition of 'partial order.'

4) What is the temperature $\lambda$ in the experiment? Is it the temperature parameter used during the inference process in the autoregressive model? Please clarify this.

5) I believe we should use the training set for the model to compute $\overline{M}_u$. Does the text corpus WikiText reflect the distribution of the training set?
