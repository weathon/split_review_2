## Abstract
Varying dynamics parameters in simulation is a popular Domain Randomization (DR) approach for overcoming the reality gap in Reinforcement Learning (RL). Nevertheless, DR heavily hinges on the choice of the sampling distribution of the dynamics parameters, since high variability is crucial to regularize the agent's behavior but notoriously leads to overly conservative policies when randomizing excessively.
In this paper, we propose a novel approach to address sim-to-real transfer, which automatically shapes dynamics distributions during training in simulation without requiring real-world data.
We introduce DOmain RAndomization via Entropy MaximizatiON~(DORAEMON), a constrained optimization problem that directly maximizes the entropy of the training distribution while retaining generalization capabilities. In achieving this, DORAEMON gradually increases the diversity of sampled dynamics parameters as long as the probability of success of the current policy is sufficiently high.
We empirically validate the consistent benefits of DORAEMON in obtaining highly adaptive and generalizable policies, \ie solving the task at hand across the widest range of dynamics parameters, as opposed to representative baselines from the DR literature. Notably, we also demonstrate the Sim2Real applicability of DORAEMON through its successful zero-shot transfer in a robotic manipulation setup under unknown real-world parameters.

### Summary
This paper introduces DORAEMON, a novel domain randomization technique in reinforcement learning, designed to enhance policy generalization across varied environment dynamics. DORAEMON strategically increases the entropy of training distributions, conditioned on achieving a probability of success threshold and by ensuring updates to the entropy are constrained. The aim is to balance both the entropy of the dynamics parameters distribution and task proficiency. Empirical tests across OpenAI Gym benchmarks and on a real-world robotic task highlight DORAEMON's superior adaptability to diverse dynamic settings compared to conventional domain randomization approaches and also demonstrate how the success rate threshold and success definition (i.e., lower bound return threshold) impact performance. This work convincingly demonstrates the potential benefit of applying DORAEMON to systems where sim-to-real policy transfer is important.

### Strengths
Originality
The paper introduces a novel and innovative approach to domain randomization. This method is an advancement in the field of RL, not only in the scope of domain randomization but potentially in areas of research outside of domain randomization (e.g., meta-RL). The method's innovation stems from its entropy maximization technique that enables a policy to generalize across a broader range of dynamics, while ensuring that the entropy of the dynamics parameter distribution grows in a manner that does not compromise the policy's probability of success. 

Quality
The proposed algorithm, DORAEMON, has been tested in OpenAI Gym benchmarks and in a sim-to-real robotics task, generally demonstrating its superior generalization in comparison to existing domain randomization techniques. 

Clarity
The paper has a clear definition of success and the presentation of the results are well-structured. The mathematics foundations of the paper are clear and sound. The figures and empirical results support the authors claims of the superiority of their method in comparison to traditional domain randomization methods.

Significance
This paper is significant to the development of autonomous systems and has the potential for real-world application in industry.

Summary
DORAEMON stands out as an original, high-quality research work with significant implications for both theory and application in reinforcement learning and robotics.

### Weaknesses
The paper presents empirical tests across OpenAI Gym benchmarks and a real-world task. However, there may be a need for more diverse environmental tests to fully understand the limits of DORAEMON's generalization ability. For instance, testing in environments with higher-dimensional state spaces or more complex dynamics could provide a more comprehensive picture of the algorithm's robustness.

The research presented is certainly complex and holds significant value to the field. However, some sections of the text may benefit from further clarification to enhance the paper's accessibility to a broader audience. In particular, the density of technical terms and concepts could be balanced with more detailed explanations or simplified language. This could potentially include adding definitions, or providing more background information for non-expert readers. Such revisions would likely make the paper's contributions even more impactful and ensure that a wider range of readers can fully grasp the innovative work you have presented.

### Questions
How sensitive is DORAEMON to its hyperparameters (e.g., trust region size, trajectories per distribution update, definition of success, etc.), and what process was followed to select them? Did you perform a sensitivity analysis?

Are there potential negative impacts of DORAEMON that should be discussed, especially regarding its application to real-world systems? While it is beyond the scope of this paper, have you considered the safety of the sim-to-real policy in the real-world robotics task? How does it compare to previous domain randomization methods?

### Summary
Domain Randomization (DR) is a common technique used to reduce the gap between simulations and reality in Reinforcement Learning (RL), which involves changing dynamic parameters in simulations. The effectiveness of DR, however, largely depends on the chosen sampling distribution for these parameters. Too much variation can regularize an agent's actions but may also result in overly conservative strategies if the parameters are randomized too much. This paper introduces a new method for enhancing sim-to-real transfer, dubbed DOmain RAndomization via Entropy MaximizatiON (DORAEMON). DORAEMON is a constrained optimization framework that aims to maximize the entropy of the training distribution while also maintaining the agent's ability to generalize. It accomplishes this by incrementally expanding the range of dynamic parameters used for training, provided that the current policy maintains a high likelihood of success. Experiments show that DORAEMON outperforms several DR benchmarks in terms of generalization and showcase application in a robotics manipulation task with previously unseen real-world dynamics.

### Strengths
The paper is well-written and easy to follow. The authors also conducted real-world robotics experiments.

### Weaknesses
* Limited technical novelty. The formulation (Eq. 4) is very similar to that of SPRL[1], SPDL[2], CURROT[3], and GRADIENT[4]. Setting the target distribution to be uninformative -- uniform distribution could transform their objectives into something very similar to Eq.4, and they do not necessarily converge to the final target distribution.
* Beta distribution is often not a reasonable choice. It cannot handle multi-modal distribution, while many existing works can handle arbitrary empirical distributions [1,2,3,4].
* Given the similarity to the existing work as discussed in the first point, the authors should compare DORAEMON to them.

### Summary
The paper introduces DORAEMON, which revisits domain randomization from the perspective of entropy maximization. Specifically, instead of maximizing the expected total return over the distribution of the dynamics parameters, this paper proposes a constrained optimization problem that directly maximizes the entropy of the dynamics distribution subject to a constraint on the success probability.  Based on this formulation, this paper proceeds to offer an algorithmic implementation that decouples this maximization into two subroutines: (1) Update the policy by any off-the-shelf RL algorithm under the current dynamics parameter; (2) Under the current policy, update the dynamics parameter to improve the entropy with the help of a KL-based trust region. Accordingly, a toy experiment is provided to demonstrate the dynamics distribution that DORAEMON converges to. The proposed algorithm is then evaluated on both sim-to-sim (MuJoCo) and sim-to-real tasks (PandaPush) against multiple baseline DR methods.

### Strengths
- The method introduced in this paper is quite intuitive and reasonable in concept and avoids some inherent issues of DR. Specifically, as the standard DR requires a pre-configured fixed prior distribution over the support of the environment parameter (which would require some prior domain knowledge), the proposed DORAEMON framework learns to maximize the entropy of dynamics distribution and hence naturally obviates this issue. (That said, in the meantime, the threshold needed for defining a successful trajectory also requires some domain knowledge, but probably a bit less)
- The proposed algorithm is evaluated in a variety of domains (including both sim-to-sim and sim-to-real scenarios), and the empirical results demonstrate quite promising performance of the DORAEMON framework (in terms of success rate).  
- The paper is well-written and very easy to follow, with justification and explanation whenever needed in most places.

### Weaknesses
Overall I could appreciate the proposed reformulation of DR, but there are some concerns regarding the algorithm:

- DORAEMON appears to be conceptually very similar to the AutoDR, or ADR in the original paper (Akkaya et al., 2019). They both define some custom indicators of success and iteratively increase the entropy of the dynamics distribution. With that said, DORAEMON appears to be yet a somewhat different implementation of the idea highlighted by ADR.

- Based on the above, while the two approaches arise from similar ideas, DORAEMON appears to have a better success rate across almost all environments. It is not immediately clear whether the performance improvement comes from which specific part of the design or it is just a matter of different choices of hyperparameters. While there is a one-sentence discussion on the authors’ conjecture in Section 5.2 (about the potential data inefficiency), it is expected to have a deeper dive into the root cause of this performance difference.

- The successful rate for certain tasks, e.g., Walker in Figure 2 and PandaPush in Figure 11, decline after reaching maximum entropy. However, the algorithm does not dynamically reduce the entropy in response to a decrease in the success rate, which might be necessary for maintaining performance consistency. This appears not consistent with the objective in (4). As the discussion in Section 5.2 does not fully address this phenomenon, more explanation would be needed.

- Another concern lies in the constraint based on the success rate. Specifically, the use of success rate largely ignores the effect of the poor trajectories, which could be arbitrarily poor and degrade the robustness of the learned policy. By contrast, in the standard DR, the objective is to consider the expected total return over all the possible trajectories. As the experimental results reported in the paper all focus on the “success rate”, the robustness issue is thereby largely neglected.

### Questions
Detailed comments/questions

- In practice, is it computationally easy to optimize (4)? The constrained problem does not seem to be convex (even under Beta distribution)?

- Could the authors specify the alpha values for Figure 2 and Figure 11? When the entropy matches the max entropy, the global success rate aligns with the local success rate. If the alpha is set to 0.5, why does the global success rate drop below 0.5 when entropy is at its maximum?

- How to design the entropy jointly for multiple dynamics parameters? (For example, simply taking the product of multiple univariate distributions like AutoDR?)

- In Section 3: The notation of reward function shall be consistent (mathcal or not)

------------------ Post-rebuttal ------------------

I would like to thank the authors for the detailed response. Most of my questions have been addressed, especially the ablation study. That being said, regarding the comparison of DORAEMON and AutoDR, while I can understand authors' response on their differences, these differences still appear more like subtle implementation choices, and this keeps me from giving a higher rating.

### Summary
The paper introduces domain randomization via entropy maximization, a constrained optimization framework that directly maximizes the entropy of the training distribution while retaining generalization capabilities. The authors empirically evaluate their method in several simulated control environments. Additionally, they successfully showcase zero-shot transfer in a robotic manipulation task under unknown real-world parameters, emphasizing its practical applicability.

### Strengths
1. The proposed framework utilizes entropy maximization to gradually enlarge the randomization range, which is sound.
2. Experiments compared to control results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods.
3. The robot manipulation experiments indicate that the proposed method has the potential for use in real-world tasks.

### Weaknesses
1. Only Beta distributions are considered in the experiments. It is encouraged to add more distribution types to the experiments.
2. Additional visualizations need to be included to illustrate the trade-off between performance and entropy. For example, in Figure 2, the performance of Walker2D and Swimmer decreases when the entropy increases. It is important to explore the relationship between the randomized variable and performance, and to determine the range within which performance decreases.
3. Adding more real-world experiments is encouraged. PushCube is a relatively easy task in robot manipulation.

### Questions
Can this domain randomization method potentially be applied to object randomness? For example, in ManiSkill environments, some tasks include variations in objects. Can we use maximum entropy to gradually learn from these different objects?

### Summary
The paper proposes a novel approach to addressing the "sim-to-real transfer" challenge in reinforcement learning. The presented approach, DORAEMON, aims to maximize the diversity of dynamics parameters during training by incrementally increasing randomness while ensuring a sufficiently high success probability of the current policy. This results in highly adaptable and generalizable policies that perform well across a wide range of dynamics parameters.

### Strengths
A straightforward method to explore the environment dynamics parameters is proposed for RL algorithms to enhance their generalization. 

The method is simple, and its effectiveness is demonstrated in the toy example and the experiments.

### Weaknesses
The method is heuristic and lacks theoretical analysis.

### Questions
1.	The proposed method calls the RL algorithm to update the policy for every dynamics parameters sampling, which might lead to an inefficient algorithm. Maybe the embedded RL algorithm only need to return a relatively approximate solution? Does this works for DORAEMON. This is expected to be made clear. 

2.	The authors adopt univariate beta distributions for \nu_{\phi}, which might simplify problem (6). But for more general distributions, solving (6) might be challenging. Maybe this should be further investigated. Or is it the case that some commonly used distributions, e.g. Gaussian, are effective and meanwhile make (6) tractable. Or some variational methods can be adopted.

### Summary
This paper presents a new domain randomization method that tries to overcome the performance and generalization gap by maximizing the entropy of the distribution of dynamic parameters while retaining certain success probability during training. The authors conduct simulation experiments as well as sim-to-real experiments.

### Strengths
- The article presents its content in a clear and concise manner.
- The method exhibits novelty and has been well formalized.

### Weaknesses
- The baselines utilized in this study appear to be somewhat outdated, which raises the question of whether more recent advancements in domain randomization have been considered. It is highly recommended that the authors explicitly address this concern by providing a specific clarification on the existence of any updated domain randomization approaches, and it would be beneficial for the authors to incorporate additional baseline experiments that encompass these newer methodologies.
- While the method proposed in this study demonstrates a certain level of innovation, it does not appear to be exceptionally groundbreaking. Therefore, it is imperative to present more compelling experimental results. Conducting additional simulation experiments, as well as sim-to-real experiments, would be highly recommended.

### Questions
- In Table 1, the accuracy of the Fixed-DR approach is notably low, prompting the need for the authors to provide further explanations, if not overlooked, in order to clarify any potential factors contributing to this outcome.
