## Abstract
Denoising diffusion models enable conditional generation and density modeling of complex relationships like images and text. 
However, the nature of the learned relationships is opaque making it difficult to understand precisely what relationships between words and parts of an image are captured, or to predict the effect of an intervention. 
We illuminate the fine-grained relationships learned by diffusion models by noticing a precise relationship between diffusion and information decomposition. 
Exact expressions for mutual information and conditional mutual information can be written in terms of the denoising model. 
Furthermore, \emph{pointwise} estimates can be easily estimated as well, allowing us to ask questions about the relationships between specific images and captions.
Decomposing information even further to understand which variables in a high-dimensional space carry information is a long-standing problem.
For diffusion models, we show that a natural non-negative decomposition of mutual information emerges, allowing us to quantify informative relationships between words and pixels in an image. 
We exploit these new relations to measure the compositional understanding of diffusion models, to do unsupervised localization of objects in images, and to measure effects when selectively editing images through prompt interventions.

### Summary
This work presents a new method for information decomposition at both pointwise and pixel-wise level via well-trained diffusion models, utilizing the results such that there is an exact connection between mutual information and MMSE denoising estimators under Gaussian noise, as well as the exact correspondence between denoising and density modeling. The work demonstrates the ability of such information decomposition to measure the compositional understanding of diffusion models, to perform unsupervised localization of objects in images, and to measure effects of selective image editing via prompt interventions. The proposed metric, *Conditional Mutual Information (CMI) estimators*, is displayed as an alternative to attention in capturing the effect of text interventions in image generation.

### Strengths
1. The finding that attention to a word doesn’t necessarily imply this word would affect the generated outcome is interesting, and Figure 1 shows how CMI can be helpful in interpreting the model for the cases where attention cannot.
2. The authors present a standalone section to discuss ethical implications of the models they are working on, as well as how their method could help deal with the potential risks.

### Weaknesses
1. The walkthrough of some key results that help construct the proposed information decomposition approach is too brief: it would be nice to have a more in-depth review of these results, for example, the derivation of Eq. (2), the part of diffusion model parameterization that’s related to MMSE, etc. Meanwhile, the experiment section is relatively lengthy: some parts could be moved to the appendix, leaving the contents most closely connected to information decomposition in the main paper.
2. Error bars in Table 3 for the comparison between CMI and attention are not reported.
3. Source code is not shared to facilitate reproducibility.

### Questions
1. Could the authors give a quick example of how $i^o(\mathbf{x};\mathbf{y})$ from Eq. (5) is computed? Under the DDPM parameterization, the noise network predicts the forward noise, thus it makes sense to start with a real image $\mathbf{x}$, sample $\mathbf{\epsilon}$ to obtain $\mathbf{x}_{\alpha}$, and compute the L2 term: this utilizes the forward diffusion. Meanwhile, the goal is to decompose the *generated* samples, which uses the reverse diffusion. Therefore, it’s a bit unclear on how these mutual information estimators are calculated.
2. The authors mentioned that Eq. (2) would hold for an “optimal denoiser”: what does it mean for a denoiser to be optimal?

### Summary
This paper proposes a method to visualize the relationship between image and text caption based on the mutual information (MI) estimated by a pre-trained diffusion model. The core observation is that the log probability density can be estimated up to constant by integrating the diffusion-model loss over timesteps (McAllester, 2023), which enables the MI between image and text-caption to be computed by the difference of the estimated log density from the conditional and the unconditional inference result of a text-to-image diffusion model. While the original MI is the average over the samples, the authors consider per-sample (point-wise) MI and further decompose it to per-pixel MI, which gives rise to a visualization of which region in the image is related with a certain word. In experiments, the proposed visualization method showed superior interpretation over the attention-based method.

### Strengths
The paper considers an important topic in text-to-image diffusion models. Analyzing the influence of each word to the generated image has been attracting many researchers, since it serves as an essential tool to come up with ideas for improving or debugging the semantic alignment of the generated image and for developing image-editing methods.

While a large body of literature exploits the cross-attention maps for the problem, this paper considers a new approach acts on pixels. The approach itself is quite similar to the classifier-free guidance that contrasts the conditional and unconditional inference results, which has been used in most of the diffusion models, but have strength by grounding on information theory. 

Also, experimental results demonstrate the proposed method gives better interpretability compared to the attention-based methods.

### Weaknesses
A weak point of this paper is that the main manuscript seems to be not self-contained. While each of the following can be rather minor, they together drops readability.

- References:
    - The proposed method is heavily relying on the log-density estimator of McCallester, 2023, but lacks details. Further explanation on the practical behavior of this estimator and how this estimator can be derived, at least in abstract sense, would help the understanding.
- Rather important figures and tables are in appendix.
    - There is a fair amount of discussion in the main manuscript with Table 9 and Figure 10, but these are on the appendix thus making difficult to read.
- Dataset information
    - CoCo-IT is the main dataset used for evaluation, but how it has been filtered from CoCo is not described at least briefly.

### Questions
- Are the “standard definition” and the “orthogonality principle” the full list of the decomposition possibilities? If not, we might need some justification that why these two are better suited as pointwise information.
    - The main manuscript mentions that both $i^s$ and $i^o$ will be explored. Can you locate where the $i^s$ results are?
- Is there a notable relationship between $i^o$ and the classifier-free guidance, considering their similarity in computation? For example, if the guidance scale gets larger, does it make a enhanced visualization or a larger MI between the text and image?
- The Eq. (5) and (6) contains expectation over the noise, $\epsilon$. But different noises will make dramatically different images. How are the visualizations in Fig. 2 are generated, well aligned with the image?

### Summary
The paper introduces the application of information theory to interpret text-to-image diffusion models. The authors present a way to measure and utilize the mutual information between the image and the text conditioning to visualize "where" a specific prompt maps to. They also demonstrate how this mapping from text to pixels can be used to relate images with text and localize words as well as help in interpretability by visualizing the effects of the text prompt in the generation process.

### Strengths
- The paper introduces a novel approach to measuring the relationship between the text conditioning and the image pixels in text-to-image diffusion models. Previous attempts that focused on interpreting the cross-attention operations within the model were architecture-specific and usually required additional processing or fine-tuning to translate attention into meaningful signals. In contrast, the authors show that their information-theoretic approach can be easily interpreted without additional overhead.

- The experiments section clearly demonstrates both the advantages and disadvantages of the proposed approach. The paper paints a clear picture of when the mutual information can be useful and where attention can be used instead.

- The method is well-grounded, with Section 2 presenting the approach and necessary background thoroughly. The paper is overall well-written.

### Weaknesses
- The authors present this paper as an approach to interpretability for text-to-image diffusion models but there is no clear demonstration of where this could be applied other than better visualizations of text-image relations. It would be informative to discuss (or even demonstrate) whether the mutual information can be exploited to better align text-to-image models with human preferences during inference time or fine-tuning. The broader scope of interpreting the generation process by relating pixels to words is missing from the paper and could greatly benefit it.

### Questions
- How is the attention extracted in Figure 2? The proposed per-pixel mutual information averages the result over all timesteps of the diffusion process. However, the attention seems to be extracted from a single forward pass of the model. That could be disadvantageous as the attention mechanism highlights different scales of features at different timesteps. In section 3.2.2 the authors acknowledge the existence of a  "feature pyramid" in the attention but is this again for a single time step of the diffusion process?

### Summary
Denoising diffusion models are used for complex data relationships like images and text, and this paper has revealed a link between these models and information decomposition, enabling precise characterization of relationships, including mutual information, which can be used to understand and measure the relationships between specific elements in high-dimensional data like words and image pixels.

### Strengths
This paper provides a new perspective to explore the relationship between image and text in the Generation field, and quantify compositional understanding capabilities of diffusion models at a certain level.

### Weaknesses
However, the primary drawback lies in the paper's somewhat inadequate presentation, making comprehension challenging. Additionally, a limitation is the insufficient experimentation, which fails to demonstrate how this method could enhance the generation process. To conclude, I strongly advise the authors to undergo a significant revision.

### Questions
1. Inadequate preliminary information on related information theory makes Section 2 difficult to comprehend.
2. Clicking on citations does not redirect to the bibliography, making it challenging to locate the correct reference.
3. Apart from the formations, understanding the implementation of this method is challenging, necessitating more detailed explanations from the authors.
4. Improved demonstration of how this method enhances the generation process in experiments would be beneficial.
5. Does Section 6 exceed the limitation of 9 pages?
