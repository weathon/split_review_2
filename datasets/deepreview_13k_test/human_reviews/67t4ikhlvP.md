# Agent-Centric State Discovery for Finite-Memory POMDPs

- Decision: Reject
- Scores: 1, 1, 8, 5

## Abstract
Discovering an informative, or agent-centric, state representation that encodes only the relevant information while discarding the irrelevant is a key challenge towards scaling reinforcement learning algorithms and efficiently applying them to downstream tasks. Prior works studied this problem in high-dimensional Markovian environments, when the current observation may be a complex object but is sufficient to decode the informative state. In this work, we consider the problem of discovering the agent-centric state in the more challenging high-dimensional non-Markovian setting, when the state can be decoded from a sequence of past observations. We establish that generalized inverse models can be adapted for learning agent-centric state representation for this task. Our results include asymptotic theory as well as negative results for alternative intuitive algorithms, such as encoding with only a forward-running sequence model. We complement these findings with a thorough empirical study on the agent-centric state discovery abilities of the different alternatives we put forward. Particularly notable is our analysis of past actions, where we show that these can be a double-edged sword: making the algorithms more successful when used correctly and causing dramatic failure when used incorrectly.

### Summary
The authors propose an unsupervised method for estimating a Markov state from a fixed-length sequence of observations. They use a classifier to select an action from a series of observations, proposing four different objectives. They ablate their method on a navigation task with curtains and and VD4RL tasks with some pixels obscured.

### Strengths
- The authors ablate their approach

### Weaknesses
- The paper is difficult to read
- The paper claims that unsupervised learning for Markov state discovery is novel -- this is not true, as evidenced by world-model based approaches for POMDPs such as Dreamer
- I'm not familiar with the "agent-centric state" definition central to the paper, and a cursory search returns few results. It seems to be equivalent to the Markov state "which captures all information that is relevant to the control of the agent".
- The literature review seems to be missing lots work on unsupervised objectives in RL

### Questions
- Typo in the abstract (double spaces)
- Abstract is not very clear -- what is an agent-centric state? Alternative intuitive algorithms? Etc.
- "Can we devise an unsupervised learning algorithm for automatically discovering the informative Markovian state space from a rich non-Markovian observation space?" - Isn't this model-based RL or a dreamer-style approach?
- "To the best of our knowledge, no prior work has focused on developing techniques for state space discovery in such a setting." - There is prior work, please see [1] or any work on partially observable world models
- "Yet, none explicitly focused on state discovery." - What about [2]?

### Summary
The paper describes a method for representation learning in POMDPs. It makes two assumptions to ensure states can be recovered from finite observation sequences (both past and future). It then considers several possible approaches for using inverse dynamics models to predict a particular action given a (possibly masked) trajectory of observations (and possibly actions) surrounding that action. The paper claims that the proposed method, which requires looking at specific past and future observations, is the only method among those considered that removes all exogenous variables from the state while retaining all information useful for control. They then present evidence that their method produces a state representation that leads to improved offline RL performance.

### Strengths
The paper addresses an important and useful problem:
> *"Can we devise an unsupervised learning algorithm for automatically discovering the informative Markovian state space from a rich non-Markovian observation space?"*

A complete answer to this question would allow agents to employ learning methods that solve MDPs rather than POMDPs, and hence would make decision-making vastly more tractable.

Moreover, the paper's focus on specifically recovering only what the authors call the "agent-centric" state (i.e. only the problem features relevant for decision making) and discarding the irrelevant information, is a longstanding goal of representation learning. A method for reliably accomplishing this would be extremely useful.

### Weaknesses
### Main objection

The paper unfortunately suffers from a major weakness. In addition to the standard k-order Markov assumption on past trajectories, it also makes the surprising and confusing choice to require that the hidden state can also be fully decoded from *future* sequences of observations. While this might have interesting mathematical consequences, it also means that the resulting algorithm, which leverages this assumption to decode state based on future observations, cannot lead to a practical decision-making agent.

It is of course true that by using future observations, the agent can more accurately recover the true underlying state of the POMDP. But this fact is completely irrelevant for decision making.

Consider the classic Tiger problem introduced by Kaelbling, Littman, and Cassandra (1998), where the agent must listen for some number of time steps in order to reliably ascertain which of two doors contains a tiger so that it can select the other door that is safe to enter. The original version of the problem returns the agent to the starting state immediately after choosing a door, but suppose we extend the problem by an additional time step so that the resulting state after selecting a door would produce different observations depending on the presence or absence of the tiger. This would satisfy the assumptions in the paper under review.

This paper effectively proposes that the agent simply wait until it has observed whether or not the room it will eventually enter contains the tiger in order to decide what state it is in. But this completely misses the fact that by the time the agent has observed the subsequent room, the crucial decision of selecting which door to open will have already passed!

It is not at all surprising that the authors are able to replace observations with these decoded states and measure improved offline RL performance, because they are providing the agent with more information than it originally had access to. The issue is that this approach can in principle never be useful for online decision making.

### Other Concerns
1. The paper is trying to simultaneously tackle the problems of learning a Markov state abstraction and disentangling the agent-relevant features from the non-relevant ones. This adds complexity, and I don't see much reason to tackle these problems in the same paper. 
2. >"the one-step inverse objective learns an undercomplete representation. Intuitively, it may incorrectly merge states which have locally similar dynamics but are actually far apart in the environment."

    I'm not sure this is the correct interpretation. See Allen et al.'s (2021) "Learning Markov State Abstractions for Deep RL", which explores the same idea for MDPs and discusses inverse dynamics models in depth. In particular, they show that even for MDPs, inverse models alone are insufficient for learning an abstract Markov representation. It seems that the approach presented in the submitted paper only works because of the inclusion of future information in the decoding process.

    Furthermore, the suggestion that an inverse model can recover all the agent-state features seems incorrect---it may recover all *controllable* features, but what about non-controllable objects that nevertheless affect either the dynamics or the reward? See Thomas et al.'s (2017) "Independently Controllable Factors" and Sawada et al.'s (2018) follow-up "Disentangling Controllable and Uncontrollable Factors".
3. The paper never actually defines inverse models anywhere, and the "algorithm" (mentioned in the section Forward-Jump Inverse Kinematics (FJ) objective) is only hinted at, never actually presented, even in the appendix.
4. > *"... learning in the presence of both non-Markovian and high-dimensional data. To the best of our knowledge, no prior work has focused on developing techniques for state space discovery in such a setting."*

    I don't understand what the authors could mean by this. It seems to me that there are many such examples. See Ha & Schmidhuber's "World Models", Hafner and colleagues' series of PlaNet and Dreamer models, Guo et al's (2020) Predictions of Bootstrapped Latents (PBL), Subramanian et al's (2022) Approximate Information State (AIS), Zhang et al.'s (2019) causal states.

5. I don't find the experimental results compelling either. Why mask out random frames in the frame stack rather than simply truncating the framestack to use the most recent frame? Why use offline RL? The paper claims that the proposed method "can better capture sufficient information from the partial observations to fully recover the agent-centric state." Was there an experiment that actually measured this? And how is it fair to compare cumulative return relative to methods that can't look into the future?

### Questions
So far I cannot see the value of this approach, since it requires the agent to look into the future to construct its state representation, therefore it cannot make decisions based on that representation. Is there some application that I'm missing here? Why would this type of decoding be a valuable thing to do?

### Summary
Building upon a Finite-Memory Partially Observable Markov Decision Process, the authors compare the capabilities of various inverse kinematic approaches for recovering of the agent-centric state in high-dimensional non-Markovian scenarios. Revealing recovery insufficiencies they formally show the applicability of a Masked-Inverse Kinematics objective with the addition of actions. Using this objective, they empirically demonstrate the capability of reconstructing obfuscated states given a sufficient horizon and learning from partially observable image-based offline RL datasets.

### Strengths
Overall, the paper is well motivated and articulated. All deductions are well comprehensible and an effective solution approach for a relevant issue is derived with formal justification as well as extensive empirical evaluation.

### Weaknesses
Event though, the paper comprehensively covers a relevant topic, some parts could be improved. Most importantly, known limitations should be stated. Also, whilst formally well-motivated, I am missing a notion of the integration of the considered objectives into the experimental setup shown visually in Fig. 5, especially regarding the "SP", "No SP" settings. Also, relations between the masked gap $k$ and the maximum prediction span $K$ could be discussed. Furthermore, the following minor issues in Section 2 should be addressed: 

- For convenience $\mathcal{Z}$ should be intoduced as state space and be part of $\mathcal{M}$ (p. 2).
- If not mistaken, $\mathbb{P}(z'|z,a)$, should include $h$ as previously denoted (p. 2).
- Later, z is defined as $z=(s,\xi)$. Thus, $\mathbb{O}$ could also be formalized using $z$ for convenience (p. 2).
- An explanation of $q(o|z)$ is missing (p. 2).
- T is not defined (p. 3).
- $D$ is not introduced (p.  3).
- From my understanding, $\tilde{o}_{F}$ should be bound by h, not 1 (p. 3).
- $\tilde{i}$ should be $\tilde{o}$ (p. 3).
- Table 1: MIK Objective should depend on $o$ not $\tilde{o}$ (p. 6). 

Regarding further areas of related research, the authors could consider referring to the artificial obfuscation of fully observable state spaces to partial observability for improved generalization, e.g.:

- R. Raileanu, M. Goldstein, D. Yarats, I. Kostrikov, and R. Fergus, ‘Automatic Data Augmentation for Generalization in Reinforcement Learning’, in Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, 2021, vol. 34, pp. 5402–5415.
- P. Altmann, F. Ritz, L. Feuchtinger, J. Nüßlein, C. Linnhoff-Popien, and T. Phan, ‘CROP: Towards Distributional-Shift Robust Reinforcement Learning Using Compact Reshaped Observation Processing’, in Proceedings of the Thirty-Second International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence, IJCAI-23, 8 2023, pp. 3414–3422.

Finally, to foster reproducibility, the authors should consider open-sourcing their implementations upon publication.

### Questions
As not clearly stated in the motivation, could you clarify the scope of applicable state spaces? 

What are the implications of assuming past- and future-decodability? How do they limit the applicability of the proposed approach?  

How does the addition of the two dynamic models impact the computational expense when applying the proposed approach? 

Minor Comments:

- Providing examples for non-Markovian environments in the introduction could be helpful. 
- p.1: "for an FM-POMDP" -> "for a FM-POMDP"
- Figures and Tables could placed closer to their reference (e.g., Table 1).
- p.5: "in previous" -> "in the previous"
- p.5: Even though refering to Lamb et al. (2022), Theorem 5.1 should be provided.
- Figures 6 and 7: To improve the readability, font sizes should be increased. Shaded areas should be described.

### Summary
This paper studies agent-centric state discovery in finite-memory partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs). The authors consider a setting where the observation space is high-dimensional and non-Markov, but the unobserved latent can be decoded from a sequence of past observations. The state transition dynamics are assumed to factorize into two parts, a deterministic agent-centric part and a control-endogenous part. The authors presented positive results where generalized inverse models can be used for learning agent-centric state representation with some asymptotic analysis, as well as negative results where alternative intuitive algorithms can fail. Experimental results are conducted on a navigation task and a partially observable variant of the vd4rl benchmark.

### Strengths
This paper studies the interesting topic of learning an informative state in POMDPs. The authors considered a diverse set of possible inverse kinematic based objectives and reasoned about their pros and cons. The experiment results also look encouraging and validate the authors’ arguments. The objective of “learning state representations” perfectly fits into the scope of ICLR.

### Weaknesses
My biggest concern is about the problem setup and especially the assumptions made in the paper. The assumption that the state transition dynamics can factorize into a deterministic agent-centric part and a control-endogenous part seems not very practical to me and needs more motivation. The assumption of a finite agent-centric state space is also not very practical. 

In addition, the authors posed the main objective of the paper as “discovering the informative Markovian state space”, yet Section 3 mainly talks about predicting an *action* from a sequence of observations. I am not able to make the connection between these two, especially when the behavior policy is not assumed to be known. 

For the theory part, it seems to me that the authors’ analysis heavily relies on a reduction to an existing work (Lamb et al., 2022). It is hence unclear to me what the new contributions are in this work. 

The experiment setup seems a bit simplified. In Section 4.1, the authors considered a simple navigation task that is 1-step past-decodable. The authors also only provided comparisons with their own alternative methods but no comparison with other existing works is given. In Section 4.1, the authors modified the vd4rl tasks into POMDPs by randomly masking the observations, which is also a bit artificial to me. I would suggest considering more standard POMDP benchmarks. 

The writing and presentation of the paper are not always clear and can sometimes be confusing.

### Questions
1.	Could you provide more motivation for the assumptions that I mentioned in the Weaknesses section?

2.	How is “predicting an action from a sequence of observations” related to “discovering the informative Markovian state space”?

3.	Several existing works also consider learning an “approximate information state” in POMDPs, which I believe are relevant and could be discussed in the related work section: 
(a)	Subramanian, J., & Mahajan, A. Approximate information state for partially observed systems, 2019.
(b)	Mao, W., Zhang, K., Miehling, E., & Başar, T. Information state embedding in partially observable cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning, 2020.

4.	What is the $q(· | z)$ function at the end of Page 2. Do you intend to mean the emissions (which has been denoted as $\mathbb{O}$)?

5.	In Page 3, the definition that $\tilde{o}_F(h,n) = \tilde{o}_{\min \{1,h+n\}, H}$ does not look correct.

6.	In Section 4.1, what are the exact metrics that you use to define the “state estimation errors”?

7.	Since the authors only considered the offline RL setting (in the experiments), I would suggest adding the word “offline” to the title or abstract to make the scope of the paper clear to the readers.

8.	Since the setup and methodology of the paper are closely related to several existing works, I would suggest moving the “Related Work” section to an earlier position in the paper.
