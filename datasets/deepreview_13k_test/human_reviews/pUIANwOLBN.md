# Behind the Myth of Exploration in Policy Gradients

- Decision: Reject
- Scores: 6, 5, 5

## Abstract
Policy-gradient algorithms are effective reinforcement learning methods for solving control problems with continuous state and action spaces. To compute near-optimal policies, it is essential in practice to include exploration terms in the learning objective. Although the effectiveness of these terms is usually justified by an intrinsic need to explore environments, we propose a novel analysis and distinguish two different implications of these techniques. First, they make it possible to smooth the learning objective and to eliminate local optima while preserving the global maximum. Second, they modify the gradient estimates, increasing the probability that the stochastic parameter update eventually provides an optimal policy. In light of these effects, we discuss and illustrate empirically exploration strategies based on entropy bonuses, highlighting their limitations and opening avenues for future works in the design and analysis of such strategies.

### Summary
The paper studies the impact of exploration in policy optimization algorithms from an optimization perspective. The authors propose different measures of analysis, discuss implications of the techniques and measures proposed, and insights gathered on illustrative examples. Their conclusion is that exploration techniques that smoothify the objective (by adding entropy) eliminate local optima and increase the probability of trajectories through the optimization landscape reaching the goal.

### Strengths
I believe the properties of exploration bonuses on policy gradient algorithms are not entirely novel (for instance, their effect on smoothifying the optimization landscape was known, investigated empirically in \citet{ahmed19} and theoretically in \citet{mei2020}). The optimization perspective on exploration has been previously explored in \citet{mei2020, chung21, mei2022}. The main strength of the paper I believe lies in its clarity and rigor of collecting and expressing these scattered insights. I think the paper makes a good effort in systematically investigating these properties together, and offering a way of looking at them in the same place, on simple illustrative examples. Because of this, I think it has a lot of value to the community. Particularly, I believe the optimization view on exploration is still not known within the community, or understood by RL practitioners, so explaining these things with clarity is very relevant and subtly impactful. I also found the illustrative examples really interesting, particularly the last one.

  abstract = 	 {Entropy regularization is commonly used to improve policy optimization in reinforcement learning. It is believed to help with exploration by encouraging the selection of more stochastic policies. In this work, we analyze this claim using new visualizations of the optimization landscape based on randomly perturbing the loss function. We first show that even with access to the exact gradient, policy optimization is difficult due to the geometry of the objective function. We then qualitatively show that in some environments, a policy with higher entropy can make the optimization landscape smoother, thereby connecting local optima and enabling the use of larger learning rates. This paper presents new tools for understanding the optimization landscape, shows that policy entropy serves as a regularizer, and highlights the challenge of designing general-purpose policy optimization algorithms.}

  abstract = 	 {Bandit and reinforcement learning (RL) problems can often be framed as optimization problems where the goal is to maximize average performance while having access only to stochastic estimates of the true gradient. Traditionally, stochastic optimization theory predicts that learning dynamics are governed by the curvature of the loss function and the noise of the gradient estimates. In this paper we demonstrate that the standard view is too limited for bandit and RL problems. To allow our analysis to be interpreted in light of multi-step MDPs, we focus on techniques derived from stochastic optimization principles&nbsp;(e.g., natural policy gradient and EXP3) and we show that some standard assumptions from optimization theory are violated in these problems. We present theoretical results showing that, at least for bandit problems, curvature and noise are not sufficient to explain the learning dynamics and that seemingly innocuous choices like the baseline can determine whether an algorithm converges. These theoretical findings match our empirical evaluation, which we extend to multi-state MDPs.}

### Weaknesses
I would have liked to see however how these methods generalize over problem instances, as it is known from \citet{mei2020} that PG methods are highly impacted by initialization and problem instances.
Some statements are rather vague, e.g. the authors claim that there is a trade-off between quasiconcavity and eps-coherence, but i’m not sure how general this statement is, and the authors do not provide proofs that guarantee these statements hold on all problem instances. At other times the authors use vague words like “appears” so its difficult to understand if these small illustrations would carry over to agents at scale, and are general enough.
The experiment illustrated in Fig 2 is interesting, but wasn’t this already known, the problem generally is that we cannot know the value of lambda beforehand as these are problem dependent, sometimes state-dependent and might also change over the optimization landscape for different policies on the way toward the optimal solution.

### Questions
The authors claim at some point that exploration strategies bias the policy. An exception is which we constrain the policy to stay in the vicinity of the previous policy, in which case we maintain optimality. It would have been interesting to explore such methods which are theoretically optimal.

### Summary
The paper under review took a closer look at the value of exploration for RL algorithms from an analytic point of view.
On top of the intrinsic need to achieve global optimal (one has to know then entire environments), 
authors proposed four criteria: __coherence, quasiconcavity, efficiency, and attraction__, 
to measure the quality of an exploration, and demonstrated the effectiveness of these measures through simulations.

### Strengths
The idea of quantify effectiveness of an exploration is novel and well grounded.
The paper is well written, easy to follow. Simulations and plots are illustrative and helpful.

### Weaknesses
My concern lies in practicality. While intuitively, the proposed four criterion all make sense, however, for a general RL question, how to effectively compute these four measures is somehow challenging. For instance, following the paper's notation,  let $J$ be the objective function, 
$J(\pi_{\theta^*})$ be the optimal, and $J(\pi_{\theta^\dagger})$ be the optimal with a way of exploration. Coherence requires 
evaluating if $J(\pi_{\theta^*}) - J(\pi_{\theta^\dagger}) \leq \epsilon$. 
Usually $\theta^*, \theta^\dagger$ are unknown, how would one utilize this coherence, and more generally the other proposed measures are not detailed in the paper.

### Questions
- Question on Practically: current simulations are good for readers to get the idea of the paper, but insufficient to demonstrate the capacity. It would be nice if the authors could take an concrete example, say a maze, with a few popular regularized objectives, compute (estimate) the proposed four criterion of these objectives, see which one is more effective based on these criterion. Then valid such prediction on the trained agent's behaviors.

### Summary
The authors use two pathological environments to explore aspects of exploration bonuses in objectives.  For example, they show that these bonuses can potentially eliminate local optima and make the loss landscape more amenable to SGD.

### Strengths
This work offers a compelling perspective and analysis of the topic.  While some of the ideas they explore might be "common knowledge" in the community, I believe that this might be the first time that some of these ideas have been explored thoroughly and scientifically.

### Weaknesses
Typos and minor suggestions:
- Discount factor backwards bracket in 2.1
- Is (1) missing the sum?
- “The valley is composed of two floors”: “floors” is a strange way to phrase it, and the intended meaning was initially unclear to me.  Consider rephrasing to something like "The valley contains two separate low points”.
- If there’s room, you could point to an appendix to briefly remind the reader why the middle and RHS of (7) are the same as alpha -> 0.  I know it’s fundamental SGD theory, but it confused me for a few minutes in this context (especially since, at first glance, the equation is not true, since it is just a first-order approximation and is only true as alpha approaches 0).
- In 4.2, the thorough description of the environment is nice, but I think it’s missing the time limit used.  Also, were the curves given in Figure 3 computed analytically or empirically?  Some more info might improve the paper.
In 4.2, you could remind the reader what (4) is so that they do not have to hunt for it.

Weaknesses:
1) Some of the questions below are clarity weaknesses or other possible weaknesses.
2) The contribution is entirely empirical (there are some nice theory concepts, but no proofs or useful properties are shown except empirically), and the empirical results are based entirely on extremely simple toy problems.  In my opinion, this does not invalidate their interesting perspectives on the issues that they illustrate with these results, but it does make the contribution less substantial.
3) The paper overall is a bit challenging to read.  For an example of a well-written bit that does *not* have this issue, the conclusion says “First, it modifies the learning objective in order to remove local extrema. Second, it modifies the gradient estimates and increases the likelihood that the update steps lead to optimal policies.”  This is great; more “high-level summary” passages like this in sections 3-4 would’ve made it much easier to read.  For an example of a hard-to-understand part, see the last question below.

Note: My primary concerns and slightly negative score come primarily from #2 (contribution), and the second question below ("reward-engineering").  The clarity weaknesses are not severe enough to have a large impact on my score.

### Questions
What is the meaning of the and symbol in (6)?  How is the gradient equal to “0 and L(theta)”?  Or is the and symbol meant to separate this line into two separate equalities?  If so, this is confusing, consider representing this in a more standard way, or using parentheses to disambiguate.  **Update:** upon reading more of the paper, and seeing this used more, I know the latter interpretation is correct, so no need to answer this question in your response, but I’ll leave this here to illustrate the potential confusion to the reader.

In 4.1, J^d seems less like an exploration term, and more like a “reward-engineering” term that simply makes the problem easier.  Am I missing a perspective on this?  This leads to a larger concern, in that much of the contribution of 4.1 hinges on this term, and I have doubts about whether this term can be legitimately thought of as an exploration bonus that is superior to the entropy bonus.

Can you please sum up the core take-away from 4.1?  I’ve reread the paragraph “We have empirically shown that exploration in policy gradients…” several times, but I’m struggling to understand exactly what I was supposed to take away from this section.  Is the point that the two criteria were good criteria in practice for choosing a good exploration bonus term?  If so, I am not convinced that this result will generalize beyond this specific toy setting (and the issue raised in the question above becomes even more of a concern in this case).  If not (or even if so), I think the intended take-away of this section needs to be spelled out more clearly.  **Update:** I understand better now upon a reread, so no need to address this question directly in your response.  However, the Section 4.1 paragraph noted is a perfect example of the last weakness noted above, so I’ll leave this question in the review.
