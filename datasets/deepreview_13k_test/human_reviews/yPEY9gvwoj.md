## Abstract
Machine learning based classifiers have achieved incredible success in a variety of sectors such as college admissions, hiring and banking.  However their ability to make classifications has not been fully exploited to understand how to improve undesirable classifications.  We propose a new framework for finding the most efficient changes that could be made in the real world to achieve a more favorable classification, and term these changes \textit{amicable perturbations}.  We present a principled methodology for creating amicable perturbations and demonstrate their effectiveness on data sets from a variety of fields. Amicable perturbations differ from counterfactuals in that they are better suited to balance the effort-reward trade-off and lead to the most efficient plan of action. Unlike adversarial examples, which fool a classifier into making false prediction, amicable perturbations are intended to affect the true class of the data point.  To this end, we develop a novel method for verifying that a amicable perturbations change the true class probabilities. We also compare our results to those achieved by previous methods such as counterfactuals and adversarial attacks.

### Summary
The paper proposes a novel type of input perturbations termed amicable perturbations whose goal is to find the most efficient changes to an input in order to achieve a more favorable classification outcome in the real world. The efficiency of input changes is quantified using a cost or distance function that could be domain (dataset) dependent, and the changes are constrained to be realistic/meaningful. They clearly contrast amicable perturbations from counterfactual and adversarial inputs, and provide a number of real-world examples to motivate it. Different from adversarial inputs, amicable perturbations seek to modify the true class of an input. 

The paper then defines the idea of an $(\epsilon, \delta)$ amicable perturbation, where $\epsilon$ corresponds to the cost of making the change from $x$ to $\tilde{x}$ and $\delta$ corresponds to how closely we want the true class of $\tilde{x}$ to approach the target desirable set. They propose a closed-form solution for the statistical distance to the target set for a family of f-divergence based distances (Theorem 1), which is an interesting result. Based on this, they propose a constrained optimization algorithm to find amicable perturbations for neural network classifiers on tabular datasets.

### Strengths
A novel and principled framework for creating optimal changes to an input in the most efficient way in order to achieve a desirable outcome in the real world. Clearly discusses and contrasts amicable perturbations with counterfactual inputs and adversarial perturbations.

The changes suggested by amicable perturbations offer useful insights (advice) that can help people or products in real world situations. This is discussed with many examples and also shown in the experiments. Therefore, the intended use case of amicable perturbations is for enabling social improvement.

The development of the formalism in terms of the actionable set, effort/cost function, and the desired goal is very principled. The analysis of the statistical distance to the target set in terms of f-divergence and deriving its closed form solution as a piecewise linear function, which is continuously differentiable (Theorem 1) is a neat contribution.

Overall, the paper presents an interesting and novel contribution, which could spur a new line of research similar to adversarial examples.

### Weaknesses
**1.** The proposed amicable perturbations are mainly suitable for tabular datasets, with well-defined input features. It is not clear how they can be applied to image and text datasets. A discussion on this would be useful. 

**2.** The method supports only differentiable models such as deep neural networks, but cannot be applied to non-differentiable models such gradient-boosted decision trees or random forest. However, the latter models are widely used for tabular data since they often have better performance. The ability to handle such models would provide more flexibility to their proposed method. 

**3.** Some of the details in Algorithm 1 are not clear. For instance, how is the projection function to satisfy coherency $cond(\tilde{x})$ defined? Since the features of the tabular datasets are often categorical or binary, it seems like using gradient descent is not the best approach to optimizing the perturbation. They have to introduce penalty terms to remain in the actional set $\mathcal{A}(x)$, and a projection function $cond(x)$ to satisfy coherency. There is not enough discussion on how effective this approach is and its limitations. I would suggest including a paragraph on the limitations and future work (scope for improvement) covering these aspects.

**4.** The paper applies the Carlini-Wagner $\ell_2$ attack to generate adversarial inputs. However, it does not seem appropriate to apply this attack for these tabular datasets where some of the features are categorical or binary. It is likely to find adversarial inputs that are easily detectable by the verification function.  

**5.**  Minor: needs some proof-reading for language and typos. Some details about the algorithm are missing and could be included. Please see my suggestions in the `Questions` section.

### Questions
**1)** The citation format of references is not correct. There should be a parentheses around citations; e.g. (Leo et al., 2019) instead of Leo et al., 2019.

**2)** The paper needs some proofreading for language issues and typos. For instance, in the last paragraph of page 2, it should be: 
> “In Section 2, we define an amicable perturbation as well as contrast it with related work.” 

**3)** The paper needs to define $k$ as the number of classes and $m$ as the input dimension at the start of Section 2. Sometimes these two symbols are interchanged leading to confusion. A few instances are listed below:
- In Eqn 28, it should be $m$ instead of $k$ denoting the number of features.
- In the proof of theorem 1 (Appendix 5.1), the number of classes is denoted by $m$ instead of $k$. 
- On page 6, under `Solving Step 1`, the projection function should be defined as $\text{cond} : \mathrm{R}^m \mapsto \mathcal{X}$. 

### 4) Section 2, Problem setting and goals
The notations could be more clear. Rather than saying $(\mathcal{X}, \mathcal{Y}) \sim \mathcal{D}$, it would be better to say $(x, y) \sim \mathcal{D}$, where $x \in \mathcal{X} \subset \mathrm{R}^m$ and $y \in \mathcal{Y}$. Here, $\mathcal{Y}$ is the $k$ probability simplex. 

Also, different from conventional notation where $y$ is an integer, here it is the true (conditional) probability distribution over the set of classes. Therefore, it would be clearer to define a class random variable $C \in \\{1, \cdots, k\\}$ and $y := [P(C=1 | x), \cdots, P(C=k | x)]$, i.e. the true class posterior probabilities. Of course, this could specialize to a one-hot coded label.  

With this definition, it is clear that an amicable perturbation $\tilde{x}$ aims to change the true class of an input to a desired $\tilde{y} := [P(C=1 | \tilde{x}), \cdots, P(C=k | \tilde{x})]$.    

In the definition of the difference training data (before Eqn 3), used to train $V(x, \tilde{x})$, it should not include pairs $(i, j)$ where $i = j$. If the architecture of $V$ does not depend on the order of inputs, then it should only include pairs where $j > i$.

In Eqn (3), it would be simpler to define $z^{(i,j)} = \mathrm{1}[y^{(i)} = y^{(j)}]$, i.e. using the indicator function. 

### 5) On training the verification function (page 4)
The verification function $V$ is actually estimating the conditional probability that the true class corresponding to $x$ and $\tilde{x}$ are equal given the inputs. Let $C$ and $\tilde{C}$ denote the true class corresponding to $x$ and $\tilde{x}$. The verification function estimates the probability $P(C = \tilde{C} | x, \tilde{x})$. Another way to estimate this probability is using the classifier $M(x)$, assuming conditional independence of $C$ and $\tilde{C}$ given $(x, \tilde{x})$, as follows: 
$\hat{P}(C = \tilde{C} | x, \tilde{x}) = \sum_{i=1}^k M_i(x) M_i(\tilde{x})$

**6)** For solving step 2 (page 6), it is mentioned that a large random sample of input pairs from the test set which have different labels are used to set the threshold $\gamma$. Is it appropriate to use the labeled test set for deciding the verification threshold without introducing bias? 

### 7) Regarding Algorithm 1
Would suggest defining the penalty terms $b(\tilde{x})$, $p(\tilde{x})$ and the projection function $cond(x)$. Is it possible to provide a general form for different scenarios? It would be good to provide pointers in the main paper to the penalty terms defined in Appendix 5.2.1. 

In the step where the gradient $\textbf{g}$ is calculated, please show that the gradient is over all the terms by including parentheses around the terms.

In practice, is it sufficient to use a fixed learning rate $\alpha$ for the gradient descent? Have the authors explored adaptive learning rate schemes?

Please add comments for some of the lines in the algorithm for clarity. For example, can add a comment like “// Projection to ensure coherancy” to the line $\tilde{x} = cond(\tilde{x})$.

It would help to provide a precise method (recipe) to adjust $\lambda$ and the problem parameters. What is the method used in your implementation?

**8)** It would be interesting to explore non-gradient based optimization methods for finding the amicable perturbations. This would allow us to extend the method to non-differentiable models such as gradient-boosted decision trees. 

**9)** In the experimental setup (Section 4), the cost function for each dataset should be $d_{\mathcal{X}}$, not $d_{\mathcal{Y}}$. Same comment for Figure 3. 

**10)** In Section 4, the cost functions $d_{\mathcal{X}}$ defined for the datasets are somewhat vague. Could the authors describe them more precisely in an appendix?

**11)** For the plots in Figure 4, how do we interpret the scale of $\epsilon$ values on the x-axis? In the discussion in the text for the Law School dataset, it is mentioned that a short move from the Far West to the Great Lakes region and a mild increase in grades can result in a 11% increase. It is hard to understand how to translate these changes into the $\epsilon$ (effort) values. Similar comment for the other examples.  

**12)** The following lines under `Other Methods` in Section 4 is not clear.
> The counterfactuals will belong to the same actionable set as the amicable perturbations, but the adversarial examples not be be in the actionable set or even to be coherent. This is significant because our verifier procedure should be able to recognize that these adversarial examples are not effective real world solutions.

**13)**  More details on the neural networks used for each dataset in the appendix would be useful. How are they made suitable for handling categorical inputs?

**14)**  Minor: the quality of math symbols in the figures can be improved. 

**15)**  A discussion of limitations and societal impacts of amicable perturbations would be useful. Can include points such as the computational cost of generating amicable perturbations, which may not be so bad in the real world because it is not usually time sensitive. The verification method for detecting inputs could potentially be improved to reduce the false rejection of amicable perturbations as adversarial. 

**16)**  Is it possible to effectively apply amicable perturbations to domains such as image and text? Could you discuss some potential use cases?

### Summary
The authors propose the problem setup of _amicable perturbations_, in which the goal is to generate a realistic perturbation to a person's features in a way that causes a desired change in the classifier prediction. To generate amicable perturbations, the authors propose an optimization problem to minimize the weighted sum of the cost of the perturbation and the distance to the desired target. To avoid generating adversarial samples, the authors propose a second verification step to filter out such samples. The authors evaluate their method on several tabular datasets, finding that they can generate perturbations matching certain problem specifications at a higher success rate than the baselines.

### Strengths
- The paper tackles an important machine learning problem.
- The paper is generally well-written and easy to understand.

### Weaknesses
1. The perturbations generated by the method are not _causal_, unlike previous work [e.g. 1-3]. As such, if the classifier learns some spurious correlations, the proposed method could suggest perturbations that do not causally lead to changes in the true label.

2. The authors frame their problem of amicable perturbations as an entirely new problem setting. This is an oversell in my opinion, as the proposed setup is essentially the same as a standard algorithmic recourse setup, with the main novelties being that (1) the authors generalize the target set instead of a simple label flip, and (2) the authors propose the second verification step. Note that the idea of adversarially robust recourse has been explored in several prior work [2, 3] which the authors have not referenced.

3. The scenario of what to do when the verifier rejects a candidate perturbation is underexplored in the paper. The authors propose some actions at end of Section 3, but I don't believe these were used in the experiments. I would be particularly interested to see whether action (2) can help in raising the success rate.

4. The authors should show a few cases of amicable perturbations rejected by the verifier, to visually confirm that these are indeed adversarial examples.

5. The authors should conduct an ablation study on e.g. the addition of b(x) and p(x), and the choice of the f-divergence.

6. The authors formulate their target set $T$ to be quite general, but then only test on binary classification datasets. They should consider adding some multi-class classification datasets.

### Questions
Please address the weaknesses above, and the following questions:

1. Have the authors considered a projected gradient descent based algorithm, instead of the addition of the b(x) and p(x) penalties?

2. For the optimization problem in Eq (7), since the f-divergence is 0 once $M(\tilde{x}) \in T$, it seems like all generated perturbations should be right on the boundary of $T$. However, this is not what happens in practice. Can the authors give some intuition on this?

3. For the definition of $\Delta(x, \tilde{x})$, it seems to me that the threshold should be dependent on T (i.e. $p$ and $q$). Can the authors give some intuition on why they use a fixed threshold $\gamma$?

4. In Algorithm 1, have the authors considered adding an early stopping criteria based on $\epsilon$ and $\delta$ to the first for loop?

### Summary
This paper proposes a framework for identifying effective real-world changes, termed "amicable perturbations", that aim to positively influence the classification of data points. Unlike adversarial examples, these perturbations are designed to impact the true class of a data point. The authors introduce a novel method to verify the impact of amicable perturbations on the true class probabilities.


Most importantly, the paper's definition of amicable perturbations is akin to "improving counterfactual explanations" [1]. This problem has originally been identified theoretically in [2] and was conceptualized in [3]. Hence, the claim that "amicable perturbations" are a new concept is probably overstated and unfortunately limits the novelty of the paper's contribution to the field. That being said, the suggested Verifier is still an interesting concept. However, the paper falls short of a more detailed analysis regarding its efficacy and how it theoretically affects the recourse problem. I would evaluate the paper more favourably if the authors instead focused on the analysis of the recourse problem + verifier. For example, the authors could analyze the recourse performance wrt to ground truth label flips and understand the conditions (on the data generating process, classifier performance, etc.) under which successful identification of an "improving counterfactual explanation" that effectively alters the true class of an individual is possible.

### Strengths
**Verifier function as a new method to evaluate counterfactual quality**: The most notable strength of the paper is the introduction of the verifier function, which plays a crucial role in the suggested method by assessing whether a generated counterfactual can alter the true underlying label, such as transitioning from high to low credit risk. While the suggested Verifier is an interesting concept, the paper falls short of a more detailed analysis regarding its efficacy. The paper could delve further into the complexity of the verification problem, evaluating the performance, factors influencing it, and the conditions indicating successful identification of an "improving counterfactual explanation" that effectively alters the true class of an individual.

### Weaknesses
**Contribution**: The paper overstates its contribution to the existing literature, neglecting to establish connections with the counterfactual explanation literature, which has already highlighted the concept that represents "amicable perturbations" in previous works, such as [1-3]. Further, the problem of controlling a counterfactuals classification confidence has also been addressed in works that deal with generating robust recourse (see [4,5]).

**Evaluation of the Verifier**: The evaluation of the Verifier using real-world data poses a significant challenge, given the absence of empirical evaluations to ascertain its accuracy in identifying improving counterfactuals. I recommend incorporating Structural Causal Models (SCMs) from the causal literature to comprehensively validate the efficacy of the proposed Verifier. Moreover, exploring the feasibility of an end-to-end optimization that uses the Verifier as constraint in the optimization could potentially enhance the study's robustness and applicability. 

As a side note: The verifier is differentiable (or can be made differentiable) as far as I see. One could potentially consider an end-to-end optimization of this problem.

### Summary
The paper extends the notion of counterfactuals to allow for striking a balance between the effort $\epsilon$ and reward $\delta$. Given an instance $x$, let $\tilde x$ be a modification of it with "effort" defined using some suitable distance $\epsilon = d(x, \tilde x)$. Let $T$ be a collection of some desirable probability distributions (i.e. probability of the true label $p(y|\tilde x)$ satisfies some lower and upper bound constraints). Let reward $\delta$ be some notion of distance between $p(y|\tilde x)$ and the target set $T$. The authors propose a formulation to strike a balance between $\epsilon$ and $\delta$ as opposed to simply using classical methods in either counterfactual research or adversarial examples. 

One key novelty is the verification stage in which they train a classifier $f(x, x')$ that predicts if $x$ and $x'$ have the same label. The authors argue that this verification helps in identifying examples that more faithfully reflect changes in the underlying true class, as opposed to the surrogate classifier (like in adversarial examples). 

The authors refer to these modifications as "amicable perturbations." They argue that these can be useful, for instance, when the goal is not related to machine learning per se (e.g. for interpretability or robustness research), but, rather, to offer some guidance on how to change the instance such that it belongs to a desired set of classes (e.g. do a minimal change to a given resume in order to increase the probability of landing interviews).

### Strengths
- The authors study an interesting setup. They propose an approach for striking a balance between effort and reward and show that their formulation has nice theoretical properties (e.g. differentiable loss). 
- The idea of introducing a verification stage is novel as far as I know.

### Weaknesses
The primary weakness is the lack of distinction between correlation and causation. The idea of altering an instance $x$ to $\tilde x$ does not really mean that $p(y|\tilde x)$ can be estimated based on the original joint distribution $p(y, x)$. In fact, this is precisely the type of questions the literature in causal analysis focuses on. Amicable perturbation corresponds to what is commonly referred to as do-queries; see for instance Pearl's introduction to causal analysis (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20305706/). The main takeaway is that $p(y|\tilde x)$ (post-intervention) is not necessarily the same distribution as pre-intervention.

But, the main argument in the paper is the claim that one can estimate $p(y| do(x))$ based on the original joint distribution $p(y, x)$, which is wrong. This can even be seen in one of the examples the authors mention in Section 4, in which their approach suggests that an individual should move from the Far West to the Great Lakes in order to improve their chances of passing the BAR exam. In my own opinion, unless this is addressed, the motivation behind the work is questionable.

Second, while the authors distance themselves from counterfactual and adversarial examples, their formulation seems to be an extension of those methods. The authors extend those methods to handle the tradeoff between effort and reward. Compare for example Equations 5, 6, and 7. This by itself is not a major limitation. However, I mention it here because the narrative of the paper suggests that amicable perturbations are quite different, when they aren't. In Figure 4, for instance, counterfactuals lie *along* the Pareto curve for amicable perturbations. 

Third, one key novelty in this work is the idea of verification. But, I don't think this is well justified. When a model is trained on pairs of examples $(x, x')$ from the same distribution $\mathcal{D}$, why should the model work well on examples from a different distribution (e.g. $x$ and its perturbation $\tilde x$)? If it could work, then the OOD problem would be solved. There is no empirical evidence that it works in the present paper, aside from the fact that it has some effect.

A few comments about the presentation:
- It would improve readability if $\mathcal{Y}$ is defined from the beginning as a collection of probability distributions. This becomes clear only later in the analysis, which can be confusing.
- Page 2: Missing space in "no greater than q.Then".
- Equation 5: Missing outer parentheses or at least a space should be added after argmin. Currently, the equation reads as if the minimization is applied to the first term only.
- Page 4: typo in "but they but"
- Page 6: typo in "ensure that out solution"
- Page 6: Missing space in "coherent.To solve"
- Page 6: typo in "In Section 2, discussed"
- Page 7: typo in "not be be"
- Page 7: typo in "differentiable and and cannot"

### Questions
- Why did the authors present Equations 5 and 6 as separate equations? They seem to be identical except that the notion of distance or loss is instantiated in one case but kept generic in the other.
- Why does Adult income dataset contain 26000 examples only? It should contain over 48,000 examples.
- How is distance $d(x, \tilde x)$ defined in each dataset? For example, the authors claim in Page 8 that one example should be perturbed using "a simple increase in education to the masters level." A masters degree is not a small change.

### Summary
"Amicable Perturbations" introduces a novel concept distinct from adversarial examples, guiding users to genuinely alter their data for better outcomes from machine learning classifiers. The paper provides a clear definition, practical scenarios, and a unique verification procedure to ensure authenticity, demonstrating its effectiveness across various datasets and real-world applications.

### Strengths
- The paper introduces the concept of "Amicable Perturbations" and provides a comprehensive definition for it. This helps in understanding the potential use cases of amicable perturbations in real-world applications, guiding users to modify their data for better outcomes from machine learning.
- The paper provides a comprehensive verification procedure to ensure the authenticity of the amicable perturbations, which is crucial for real-world applications.

### Weaknesses
- The novelty of the paper seems limited. While the concept of amicable perturbations is interesting, it appears to be a minor extension of existing techniques for crafting actionable counterfactual explanations. 

- The method's robustness against potential countermeasures is not discussed. What if adversarial training is conducted on the classifier to improve the robustness against adversarial examples? Can the proposed amicable perturbations still work? 

- It is unclear whether the verification step really works. The proposed discrepancy score for verification is somewhat heuristic and do not have theoretical guarantees to ensure that the proposed amicable perturbations produce truly different outcomes.

### Questions
Is there any theoretical analysis that can explain why the proposed verification procedure can ensure that amicable perturbations produce truly different outcomes?
