# Guiding Instruction-based Image Editing via Multimodal Large Language Models

- Decision: Accept
- Scores: 6, 6, 8, 8

## Abstract
Instruction-based image editing improves the controllability and flexibility of image manipulation via natural commands without elaborate descriptions or regional masks. However, human instructions are sometimes too brief for current methods to capture and follow. Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) show promising capabilities in cross-modal understanding and visual-aware response generation via LMs. We investigate how MLLMs facilitate edit instructions and present MLLM-Guided Image Editing (MGIE). MGIE learns to derive expressive instructions and provides explicit guidance. The editing model jointly captures this visual imagination and performs manipulation through end-to-end training. We evaluate various aspects of Photoshop-style modification, global photo optimization, and local editing. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that expressive instructions are crucial to instruction-based image editing, and our MGIE can lead to a notable improvement in automatic metrics and human evaluation while maintaining competitive inference efficiency.\blfootnote{\faApple~Work done during an internship at Apple.

### Summary
This paper proposes a novel text-guided image editing method that builds on the instructpix2pix model, which fine-tunes a diffusion model on instruction-image pairs. Authors propose to leverage a multimodal (image + text) large language model to generate more precise and expressive editing instructions, and improve editing ability. The method is trained on the instructpix2pix dataset, and evaluated on 4 datasets, considering different types of edits.

### Strengths
Image editing is a timely and challenging task. Authors demonstrate that they are able to successfully carry out a large set of edit types across multiple datasets. Visual results look very promising, and suggest that the proposed changes can yield noticeable gains over instructpix2pix The evaluation is detailed and the method is analysed from a lot of different angles.

The idea of replacing the CLIP encoder with a more expressive vision-language model is sound, as providing more detailed instructions can help guide the diffusion model towards the desired output. Authors have made efforts to go beyond simple replacement of the text encoder and added functionality (summarization, adaptation to visual content) that improve performance.

### Weaknesses
My main concern with this work is the limited novelty. The crux of the innovation is the use of a multimodal language model instead of a CLIP model in the instructpix2pix setting. The second main innovation is the introduction of [IMG] tokens, which are processed by a transformer head to generate conditioning embedding for a LDM model. This approach is very strongly inspired from Koh et al. 2023, where they train a language model to generate image tokens, which are then transformed via a transformer architecture, and used as conditioning for stable diffusion based generation. The source of inspiration should be credited more clearly (the main reference in the method section simply mentions using a similar feature extractor architecture).

The presentation of the paper could be improved as well.  The paper is written in a confusing way, and lacks explanation and justifications for design decisions. For example, equation (5) is introduced without any justifications or intuitive explanation, and author do  not explain what they refer to as by score. Similarly, what authors refer to as MLLMs (pre-trained LLMs adapted to take visual inputs as well) is not clearly defined until section 3.1. Multimodal language models can be designed and trained in different ways (e.g. trained with vision-text inputs jointly), and authors should clarify that they refer to a specific type of models. Similarity, the edit head T was not clearly explained, I needed to read the GILL paper (Koh et al.) to understand how these features were generated. Another example is figure 2, which is mentioned at the beginning of chapter 3.2 and shows a MLLM* model without explanation, while this model is only introduced (in a footnote) in a later paragraph. 

While the evaluation is detailed with experiments carried out on many datasets, state of the art references are limited. The only pre-existing work that authors compare to is instructpix2pix, while the LGIE baseline is an overly poor baseline, which is expected to perform worse than any model with vision-language mappings (e.g. CLIP) in a lot of settings. It does not make a lot of sense to ask a pure language model to hallucinate detailed descriptions of an unseen image. Evaluations on prompt-based editing methods are available on the magic brush dataset, and could provide additional context. For consistency, instructions could easily be converted to a prompt using an LLM.

### Questions
- Image editing performance can be influenced by the random seed. Results in tables 1-2 compared to results reported in Zhang et al (MagicBrush) show that there can be a noticeable difference for some metrics (e.g. 70->74 for DINO score on instructpix2pix). Several of these evaluations show performance scores that are relatively close, have authors investigated how consistent these rankings are across multiple seeds? 

- Are ground truth images (post edit) available for all datasets? Why were these specific sets of evaluation metric chosen? Why not e.g. measure image quality using FID?

- Authors compare inference times, but do not mention training times. How much more more expensive is it to train this new model compared to pix2pix? This is relevant as noticeable performance gains can be observed when fine-tuning on a specific instruction/edit types.

### Summary
This submission proposes an approach towards improving the visual output quality of instruction-based image editing. Authors put forward the hypothesis that natural text-based edit instructions, provided by humans, are oft terse and this hinders contemporary learning-based models from successfully capturing and dependably following intended image-edit meanings. 

The crux of the proposed strategy involves learning to map terse input text, representing image edit-instructions, to more expressive (evidently more verbose) output text, in order to provide more explicit image-editing guidance. The work explores the efficacy of leveraging cross-modal capabilities, contemporary language-models, and sensitivity to visual inputs in order to positively influence edit-instruction quality. This multi-modal component is evidenced to be important for text-edit quality and resulting downstream edited images. Quantitative and qualitative evaluation of the proposed strategy, across various metrics and human rankings, are reported in comparison with recent work and a relevant baseline, across four benchmark datasets.

### Strengths
The problems being addressed here are real and are important -- principled solutions and progress towards techniques capable of realising consistently high quality and complex (intended) image edits, that are also of low cost in terms of required human effort, will be of high value to the community and will additionally result in widely applicable and practical end-user benefits.  

The technical components of the work, the manner in which the various components are concatenated together, appears reasonably straightforward. Explanation of the guided image editing strategy is aided by basic yet clear schematics to aid understanding (Fig. 2, specifically). 

The investigation can be considered reasonably thorough with the inclusion of experimental work covering (i) method efficacy (quant. & qual.), (ii) vision & language hyper-parameter sensitivity, (iii) ablating instruction generation components, (iv) compute. Reported qualitative results are quite compelling and show some good perceptual improvements over baselines. Further results (public anon-web page, supp. materials) are appreciated and provide some aid for apprehensions over method robustness, reliability.

Writing is of a reasonable standard in general. I enjoyed reading the paper.

### Weaknesses
Leveraging multi-modal language-models provides an intuitively promising avenue, when striving to follow image-manipulation intentions that are defind by only terse human text instruction. Good evidence is provided that the presented strategy goes some way to tackling the observed short-comings however technical contributions (size, sufficiency) can be regarded as moderate. The overarching system makes use of an array of pre-existing components however the particular implementation that facilitates component concatenations can be regarded as somewhat novel.

For this venue, an important factor that would strengthen the submission might look to provide additional understanding, discussion on the long-term sustainability of the proposed style of approach. The requirement for intermediary 'on-the-fly' remappings, reconfigurations of text input cannot be regarded as a very elegant or pleasing solution. I explicitly note that this is not grounds for rejection, my point is rather that further thinking, discussion on the fundamental gaps that prevent base models from correctly realising terse (yet human-parseable) instruction would likely prove elucidating and of high value. An empirical avenue here might involve investigating pre- and post-hoc parts-of-speech (POS) distributions, or other statistical evaluation of the edit-text distributions. Is the long-term goal, alternatively, to fashion single models, capable to understand natural (terse) human instruction? The point touches on well-understood (dis-)advantages of modular-component systems c.f. end-to-end.

I would be keen for authors to discuss these points and I am open to modifying my score. 

Minor suggestions:

1. Authors may wish to update to an ICLR24 template (c.f. ICLR23) 

2. On pp.2: suggest explicitly expand acronym 'IPr2Pr' on first use (presumably Instruction Prompt-2-Prompt ?)

3. Precision of some phrasing could be tightened, towards aiding reading understanding. See example suggestions in following section. 

4. The (useful!) model schematic image, found between Figure 3 and Figure 4, is unnumbered. Is this by design ? Suggest 'Baselines' paragraph might serve as suitable caption content.

### Questions
* Can the authors commit to a full source code release? The submission opted to stay silent on this issue. Code release would be of clear benefit to the community aiding reproducibility, public probing of method robustness, consistency, range of model abilities. This will undoubtedly increase the value of the contributions. If impossible; web page might be extended to allow public inference-time testing.

* The property of 'elaborate descriptions' is posed as something one wishes to evade in natural commands and yet 'explicit yet detailed guidance' is conversely noted a sought after notion. Do the authors suggest that the former pertains largely to image space, in a similar fashion to e.g. regional masks? Concrete examples of the considered 'elaborate descriptions' may help to clarify this point.

* How is the phrase 'reasonable image editing' to be defined?

* Minor: Small icons (flame, blue cube) tagged to components in the system schematic (Fig.2) presumably represent learnable and frozen model components, respectively. Suggest to make this key explicit.

### Summary
This paper proposes a new instruction-based image editing approach. The Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) are incorporated into the editing, formulating MLLM-Guided Image Editing (MGIE). Different editing operations are utilized for testing, including Photoshop-style modification, global photo optimization, and local editing.

### Strengths
The proposed method can have effective performance on the chosen datasets of evaluation. Especially, a lot of evaluations are conducted with subjective assessment.

### Weaknesses
1.	The performance is limited by the dataset utilized for training, especially for learning effective instruction and editing performance. Will this approach complete the editing operation which is not appeared in the training data?

2.	The template of this paper is wrong, it is still the template of ICLR2023.

3.	There is no ablation analysis for the loss functions and their alternatives. 

4.	The editing effects are not ideal, for example, the woman in the background of Fig. 1 is removed, while there are still some residuary artifacts in the background.

### Questions
1.	How to balance the loss weights of $\mathcal{L}_{ins}$ and $\mathcal{L}_{edit}$ in Eq. 6?

2.	Can this approach add new objects into the image?

3.	What are the details of the user study’s participants? Like their ages, educations, and the time for taking part in the user study.

### Summary
The paper introduces an image editing method guided by MLLM. This approach can learn from expressive instructions and offer explicit guidance. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the method's effectiveness.

### Strengths
The paper is clearly written.

The introduced technique.is novel and interesting.

The experiments are sufficiently conducted.

The presented results seems promising.

### Weaknesses
While certain aspects of the work might appear less novel, its practical effectiveness compensates for this.

There are typographical errors. Specifically, "Methods" in Tables 1 and 2 should be placed at the top.

### Questions
I am curious about the method's potential in handling tasks like:

1. Transferring image texture. Language-Driven Artistic Style Transfer, ECCV 2022.

2. Modifying an object's color. L-CAD: Language-based Colorization with Any-level Descriptions using Diffusion Priors, NeurIPS 2023.

3. Interpreting user-provided emotions. Affective Image Filter: Reflecting Emotions from Text to Images, ICCV 2023.

Including comparisons or referencing these studies could further enrich the paper's depth and context.
