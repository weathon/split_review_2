- Decision: Reject
- Scores: 5, 3, 5, 3

## Abstract
Physics-informed machine learning has emerged as a promising approach for modeling physical systems. However, two significant challenges limit its real-world applicability. First, most realistic scenarios allow only coarse-grained measurements due to sensor limitations, making the use of physics loss based on finite dimensional approximations infeasible. Second, the high cost of data acquisition impedes the model's predictive ability. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel framework called Physics-Informed Coarse-grained data Learning (PICL) that incorporates physics information via the learnable fine-grained state representation from coarse-grained data. This framework effectively integrates data-driven methods with physics-informed objectives, thereby significantly improving the predictive ability of the model. The PICL framework comprises two modules: the encoding module, responsible for generating the learnable fine-grained state, and the transition module, used for predicting the subsequent state. To train these modules, we employ a base-training period followed by a two-stage fine-tuning period. The key idea behind this training strategy is that we can leverage physics loss to enhance the reconstruction ability of the encoding module and the generalization ability of the transition module, using both labeled and unlabeled data. In the base-training period, we train both modules collaboratively using data loss and physics loss. In the two-stage fine-tuning period, we first tune the transition module with physics loss using unlabeled data and then tune the encoding module with data loss using labeled data to propagate the information from the transition module to the encoding module. We demonstrate that PICL exhibits superior predictive ability across modeling various PDE-governed physical systems. Code is available on GitHub: https://github.com/PI-CL/PICL.

### Confidence
3: You are fairly confident in your assessment. It is possible that you did not understand some parts of the submission or that you are unfamiliar with some pieces of related work. Math/other details were not carefully checked.

### Summary
The paper addresses an issue typically seen in real world problems, where only coarse-grained measurements are available. The authors propose a surrogate model that works over data with finer resolution reconstructed from observed data with low resolutions. The model comprises U-Net and Fourier neural network models and the proposed training framework incorporates physical losses that ensure consistency between reconstructed solutions.

### Strengths
The paper is motivated by real world applications, to which few surrogate physics models have been applied so far. The authors propose a novel framework that incorporates losses stemmed from physical systems. The authors also propose two training phases, where the first phase is responsible for training models in a supervise manner and the second phase is based on fine-tuning aimed for enhancing the prediction capability. The experiments show that the proposed method outperforms a couple of baselines. Some ablation studies are also conducted.

### Weaknesses
I do not quite understand the problem setting in the paper yet. What problems does the paper aim to tackle? To my knowledge, the prediction of coarse-grained observation is not a keen requirement for real world applications since simulation in real applications is mostly performed with high resolution data.
 

What is the difference between PICL and FNO* reported in the experiments? Are the loss functions used in training different? It is also unclear how much each term of the loss function has an impact to the performance of the proposed forward model.


When the output resolution of $f_{\theta}$ increases, how much does it have an impact to the computational cost? How does it compare to the baselines?
 

The paper does not seem to be well-organized and hard to follow. The followings are some of the examples that made the paper difficult to understand:
* Definition in Section 3 is ambiguous. For instance, differential operator $P$ is not well-defined since Banach spaces $(A, U, V)$ is not mentioned to have differential structure.
* Between equations (3) and (4),  "Then, the sequentially used transition module roles the prediction process with the input $u^{t}$ to predict $u^{t+1}$".
* I could not find the implementation detail of down-sampling operator $\Phi$.
* Figure 1 is very confusing since arrows corresponding to data flow in training and test phases are mixed up. Are physics loss $L_{ep}$ and $ L_{tp}$ used in the unrolling phase?

### Questions
The proposed method relies on physics loss defined by fourth-order central-difference scheme and Runge-Kutta time discretization, which can be performed when one knows PDEs of the problems. Do the authors have any observation or insight on what range of real world problems the proposed method work for?

### Summary
In this paper, the author proposes a new physics-informed framework for achieving finer-grained data reconstruction in spatial and temporal fields from coarser-grained data through super-resolution and neural operators. The framework comprises two components: an encoder module and a transition module, and it utilizes a three-stage training process (base training followed by a two-stage fine-tuning process). The results show the effectiveness of the proposed method in different PDE-governed systems. However, it lacks some important comparisons with non-FNO-based approaches and also some discussion about details of incorporating physics.

### Strengths
1.	The paper studies an important problem. The authors well introduce the background and define the problem while providing a clear overview of the proposed framework.
2.	The authors justifies the effectiveness of the proposed method in various aspects through a series of experiments over multiple PDE-governed systems.

### Weaknesses
1.	The method section lacks a clear explanation of how the physics loss is defined and how the 4th-order Runge-Kutta (RK) method is incorporated into the design.
2.	The experimental section only compares the method with Fourier Neural Operator (FNO)-based methods, omitting comparisons with other state-of-the-art neural operator methods, such as similar mesh-based methods like Magnet.
3.	The original FNO paper tested model performance on different Partial Differential Equations (PDEs), including 1D cases (decay flow) and 2D cases (Navier-Stokes equations). It would be beneficial if the author also compared their method against these PDEs.
4.	The performance in zero-shot super-resolution (SR) cases is not addressed.

### Summary
The paper proposes a physics guided deep learning solution for modeling under data paucity and coarse-grained data. Essentially, the paper employs a super-resolution approach to generate fine-grained data from coarse-grained data employing supervised losses at the coarse-grained scale while employing physics losses (conservation conditions) between successive time-steps at the predicted fine-grained scale. Specifically, the proposed architecture comprises a sort of self-supervised task wherein the low-dimensional data is input into an encoder module which produces the corresponding high-dimensional output (predicted). This predicted high-dimensional output is passed into a transition module which predicts the high-dimensional output at the next time step. This high-dimensional output at the successive time-step is downsampled (by a deterministic function) and compared with the ground-truth low-dimensional data using a data-driven loss.

### Strengths
- The proposed solution is (somewhat) novel and is a creative way to effectively employ coarse-grained data and physics to perform super-resolution. 
 

- The results are extensive (although not entirely convincing) and have been performed on multiple important PDE contexts.

### Weaknesses
1. Overall, the novelty in the paper is somewhat limited and analyses of the drawbacks of the proposed finite-difference based physics encoding method have not been fully carried out. Specifically, discussions regarding where the proposed method might lack, how fine-grained data can be incorporated (when available) will be helpful additions to the narrative. 
 

2. Some results indicate that baselines outperform the proposed method. E.g., Table 1 NSWE indicate that PINO* has lower re-construction errors. Why is this? 
 

3. The paper methodology is hard to understand and needs to be significantly improved. The reviewer feels the entire methodology can be explained in 1 – 2 paragraphs (half a page) but is needlessly convoluted and interspersed with details making it hard to get a high-level idea.  
 

4.There are many ambiguous phrases/ design decisions that have been made without explanation. 

    a. Why has the U-Net architecture been employed for the encoder while UNet++ [1] , Transformer [2] and many newer image encoding / SR architectures superior to UNet have been proposed more than 2 – 3 years ago? 
 

    b. What does “hard encoding” $\tilde{o}$ into the corresponding $\hat{u}_t$ mean? 

        i. Does it mean that assuming the low-res data was n/2 X h/2 and high-res data was n x h , that every 4th pixel in  the high-res data would have the corresponding $\tilde{o}$ value? Or does it mean something else? 

        ii. If it means the same as <4.b.i>, would this design decision not overtly couple the high-res and low-res solutions? How might the high-res solution significantly improve upon the low-res solution with this constraint? 
 

5. Results don't seem practically usable. It is important to comment on this owing to the context (i.e., mapping from low-res to high-res with predominantly low-res training data). In most real-world scientific simulations, physical consistency / errors are assumed to in the range `1e^-5 – 1e^-7` . A discussion about the practicality of the obtained results and the usability of the proposed method is required but missing.

    a. What exactly does “imitating the implementation of higher-order FD” mean? Is there a FD operator that has been embedded into $f_\theta$? Or is there something special (I.e., some special input transformation) that has been applied to the inputs of $f_\theta$ that makes it “immitate” an FD operator?

### Summary
The authors introduced a framework to model coarse-grained data incorporating physics information in the form of partial differential equations (PDEs). The proposed framework learns to map coarse-grained data to fine-grained space and a dynamic operator that advances fine-grained states forward in time. The authors test the framework in a few exemplary PDEs and present some ablation studies on hyperparameters, data efficiency and quality.

### Strengths
* The authors explain the training routine thoroughly, which benefits reproducibility. Source code is also provided
* The writing is generally easy to follow, although held back by the lack of equations to explain key terms and concepts

### Weaknesses
* It is not very clear what the proposed framework is trying to achieve. The authors quotes "predictive ability" constantly but the prediction task is nowhere explicitly defined. I am inferring two tasks: (a) given coarse-grained state at time $t$, predict coarse-grained state at time $t+1$ and (b) given coarse-grained state, predict the corresponding fine-grained state. Task (a) inevitably involves incomplete information, which is not talked about and task (b) seems to be for a single step? (see questions below)
* The reason why the transition module is needed in the first place is unclear when there is already a closed expression for it from physics? It does not seem to provide benefits in terms of computational cost. If it represents approximate knowledge, the experiments do not demonstrate the value and limitations (compare against no physics knowledge at all and study how much error causes the framework to break down).
* The loss terms and metrics do not come with formulas and instead explained in dense text, making it difficult to follow

### Questions
* When the observations are extremely coarse-grained, they represent partial state and the map to fine-grained state is not one-to-one. How is this uncertainty accounted, especially given that the modules in the proposed framework are all deterministic in nature?
* Does evaluation involve only a single step prediction forward in time? Have you studied the performance over multiple steps?
* Broken sentence in section 4.1 below equation (3) - "the sequentially used transition module roles the prediction process..."
