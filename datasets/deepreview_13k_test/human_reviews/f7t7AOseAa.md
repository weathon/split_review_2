# ZEST: ZEROSHOT SPARSE FINE-TUNING

- Decision: Reject
- Scores: 3, 6, 6, 5

## Abstract
Recent studies have pointed out that fine-tuning a subset of layers from the model can match or even outperform the performance of full fine-tuning, known as surgical fine-tuning ~\citep{lee2022surgical}. This method effectively helps reduce the risks of overfitting and accelerates the fine-tuning process. However, swiftly and accurately identifying the "right" layers is not straightforward. Existing approaches naively train each layer until convergence and find the best candidates, which is not scalable, especially given the rapid growth in model sizes.
In this paper, we propose $\textbf{ZEST}$: $\textbf{Ze}$roshot $\textbf{S}$parse fine-$\textbf{T}$uning. We first study and compare the zero-shot metrics acquired from a single forward and backward pass. We observe that the metrics are inconsistent for different model and dataset combinations, thus we train a universal \method predictor to generalize this method. We use the zero-shot \method predictor to rank layers by the estimated importance and fine-tune only the important parameters.
By doing so, we can decrease the number of trainable parameters by up to 99\%, being on par or outperforming full fine-tuning in terms of model performance. We thoroughly evaluate the effectiveness of \method on various tasks and modalities. We train a universal predictor for ResNet50, MobilenetV2, and EfficientNet on 8 different datasets. We also scale this method up to BERT and LLAMA. Our results demonstrate that fine-tuning just five layers can closely match or even outperform the performance achieved through full fine-tuning on LLaMA-7B. Specifically, fine-tuning only the \textbf{5} fully connected layers on LLaMA chosen by \method can result in improvements of up to 5\% over full fine-tuning

### Summary
This paper proposes a new surgical fine-tuning approach, where the authors train a predictor to estimate the importance of blocks given several proposed metrics computed from the mini-batch data. The metrics being considered are classified into static metrics, forward metrics and backward metrics. The authors assume it is possible to predict the layer contribution, i.e.,  the final task performance when fine-tuning only that single layer, given the mini-batch statistics only. Also, they assume such predictor could generalize to predict layer importance for unseen datasets. The authors evaluate ZEST on ResNet50, MobilenetV2, EfficientNet, BERT and LLAMA.

### Strengths
- The direction of considering the generalization of layer-wise surgical fine-tuning to deal with unseen datasets is a very appealing yet important task for machine leaning community.

- The paper is relatively easy to read and follow.

- The experiments consider both computer vision and NLP problems. Also, it is very interesting to see the popular large-scale model  LLAMA is considered for evaluating the sparse fine-tuning model.

### Weaknesses
My concerns on the paper center on the *novelty/soundness of the method*, the *comprehensiveness of the experimental results*, and the *weak reproducibility*, where **an appendix is missing** with my important details being not available to the readers. 

- The novelty of this paper is rather limited. I feel the layer evaluation metrics, or so called zero-shot metrics in this paper, are the most important component for this type of works. However, regretfully **none of the metric introduced in this paper (see Sec 3.1) is new**. The metric formulas in Sec 3.1 have very high overlap with the reference paper Abdelfattah et al. 2021. Similarly, the layer contribution score is simply inferred from one layer/block fine-tuning accuracy, which is not novel either. 

- The proposed method comes with a strong assumption, which is that the authors **assume the layer contribution score could be approximated with low computational cost by mini-batch data**. I would like to elaborate why such assumption is wrong. (1) First, it is straightforward that different mini-batch will result in highly biased and noisy metrics scores. This means for each dataset, there is no guarantee different mini-batch could result in stable and reliable evaluation statistics for each individual layer/block in deep neural networks. Even for the same mini-batch data, the zero-shot metrics (input to the ZEST predictor) keep changes as the model parameter is being fine-tuned. Do the authors collect such zero-shot metrics throughout model fine-tuning (inferenced under different $\Theta$s as the training data or collect that from the initial $\Theta$? (2) Second, for generalizing to testing datasets, the method would additionally assume the prediction model to be able to make prediction given the highly stochastic mini-batch statistics on unseen data. For secure generalization on unseen dataset, the authors adopt a very simple trick, which is to mix the data from different datasets in a minibatch. I am not convinced such trick could ensure the generalization ability of the predictor on such an unrealistic task on completely unseen dataset.  Overall, the task of estimating block/layer importance based on mini-batch data in the presented way fails to convince me.

- For all such layer-wise pruning methods, the most time consuming part is the data construction part. For this work, the authors adopt a non different data collection approach, where only one layer is fine-tuned to collect the $Score_{gt}$ (see **Training Label Collection** part in Figure 2).  If comparing the entire time from data collection to final model fine-tuning, I do not feel the total time efficiency is reduced in a great deal. 

- In the abstract, the authors make very strong claim about the benefit of ZEST, saying their method **can decrease the number of trainable parameters by up to 99%, performing on par with full fine-tuning**. However, from the other part of this paper, it seems the sparsity of fine-tuning with ZEST is not as low and how the statistic of 99\% is derived is not explained from anywhere. I suggest the authors to carefully revise the writing of this paper to remove such overclaims. 

- One major flaw of this paper is that for the main benchmark results (shown in Table 3), the authors did not explicitly specify which performance evaluation metric they use to make the comparison for BERT and LLAMA, while there could be many possibilities to consider. Also, the claim that **ZEST with 5 layer could outperform LLAMA's full fine-tuning by up to 5\%** is highly suspicious, because the reported performance score for LLAMA FT-Full on the *hellaswag* dataset is much lower than the publicly reported standards (e.g., refer to the scores for LLAMA-7b from https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp/discussions/2321). 

- Important details about the datasets and model training are missing. It is necessary to describe dataset statistics, model properties and training details apart from learning rate and mini-batch size.

- The author claim ZEST can be used orthogonal to the other method LoRA. However, adding LoRA to ZEST regretfully lowers the performance and does not bring positive effect (see Table 3). In this case, the conclusion seems to highlight the WEAKNESS or LIMITATION of ZEST, rather than its strength, diminishing the significance of this work.
 
- The experiment is not convincing also because that essential fine-tuning baselines are missing from the benchmark comparison. For the main results shown in Table 3, apart from ZEST variants, the authors only include two very simple fine-tuning baselines: **zero-shot** and **FT-Full**, which is insufficient. I believe there are many layer-wise deep neural net pruning methods that is related to this work. It is essential to include up-to-date SOTA fine-tuning baselines (e.g., [1]). 

[1] AutoLR: Layer-wise Pruning and Auto-tuning of Learning Rates in Fine-tuning of Deep Networks (AAAI'21). 

- Ablation study of ZEST is not comprehensive. I feel simply comparing with completely random baselines (e.g, Rand@3 and Rand@5 from Figure 3) is a bit unfair. It would be more interesting if random baselines which employ a combination of ZETA suggested layers and purely randomly chosen layers could be investigated. 

- The authors focus on reporting the benchmark performance scores on the hold-out testing datasets, while the performance scores on the training datasets would be also interesting and important for the readers to know. I suggest the authors to add more comprehensive comparison results, with more inclusive datasets and related pruning baselines. 

- The term **zero-shot metrics** sounds very confusing to me. From my understanding, those metrics, when being talked about for the training datasets, is not zero-shot at all. I feel it is not appropriate to name the metrics as zero-shot. Related work referenced paper, such as Abdelfattah et al. 2021, also does not use such term. 

- From Fig 2, the prediction result of ZEST is fed to a **pair-wise ranking loss**. In the entire paper, such loss is not talked about at all. It is said the **$Score_{gt}[i]$** is given as the label for ZETA, with which supervised training can be done. Why additional ranking loss is there? Also, it is unclear why for **ZEST Inference**, no ranking information is inferenced and only **$Score_{gt}[i]$** is inferenced? 

- The related work section is poorly written because it covers very limited literature on the most important layer-wise sparse fine-tuning methods, and the discussion on transfer learning seems too long. There are plenty of such works from the literature. The authors should discuss on them in detail.

### Questions
- From your algorithm (i.e., the **Sparse Fine-Tuning** part in Sec 3.2), you always use **top-n** layers with highest ZEST scores for fine-tuning. Does this mean no matter what testing datasets come in, you always predefine the number of layers as a hyperparameter? I wonder whether there is a way to verify the quality or sensitivity of ZEST prediction scores to identify optimal number of layers that can be customized to each testing dataset. From the training efficiency perspective, it seems not a good idea to always fix the number of n in your top-n fine-tuning strategy.

- In introduction, the authors claim **ZEST is 1000x more efficient than previous methods**. I wonder what is the 1000x in terms of? How exactly it is measured, e.g., how many datasets, compared to WHICH previous methods, is it for training or only inference, etc. In many other parts of this paper, there are also similar claims, e.g., 2.7x, 2.3x, for which, I think the authors should state more clearly how the numbers are derived.

### Summary
This paper proposes a zeroshot sparse fine-tuning method that can achieve satisfactory results by only training a few layers. On both vision and language tasks, the proposed ZEST is effective and efficient.

### Strengths
1) The proposed zeroshot sparse fine-tuning method is intuitive and easy to apply. The whole pipeline is simple but effective.
2) ZEST proves effective on both visual and language tasks, which is inspiring and shows its generalization. 
3) The resource optimization is obvious, which can greatly reduce the resource burden of fine-tuning.

### Weaknesses
1) The details of this paper need to be better presented. For example, the structure of the ZEST predictor is ambiguous. The pair-wise ranking loss is also not specified.
2) The experiment settings are not insufficient. The authors chose three backbone networks for the vision task, but all of them are CNNs. The transformer-based network is also needed to be proven effectiveness in vision task.
3) The dataset setting is simple. It will be better to try different dataset splits, especially reducing the datasets for constructing ZEST predictor.

### Questions
1) To construct the ZEST predictor, CIFAR-10, Aircraft, Cars, Flowers, Food, and Pets datasets are employed, while CIFAR-100 and CUB datasets are utilized for evaluation. It would be helpful to provide further details on the experimental setup, such as whether different dataset splits yield varying results.
2) During ZEST predictor training, two samples are inputted. It's worth investigating whether the number of samples plays a significant role in determining ZEST's performance.
3) What is the estimated time required for dataset construction, and is it justifiable to shift the time investment from fine-tuning to label collection? The decision may hinge on the model's ability to generalize across different dataset splits.

### Summary
Traditionally, problems that go about determining the importance of different layers/neurons such as in pruning, or masked/sparse fine-tuning etc., use metrics that are derived from the network's performance on the target dataset for which the alterations to the model are performed. Modern approaches, learn a meta-model are a function of the model weights, input dataset and other factors and produce a rating for each layer/neuron. The authors propose one such meta-model for identifying which layers are to be frozen and which made adaptable for fine-tuning purposes, in order to optimize efficiency. They learn this meta-model using an array of previously collected "training data" of model-dataset-metric combinations. During inference time, their work does not need to access the entire target dataset, but only one sample from it, hence "zero-shot".

### Strengths
The concept of associating a metric with a layer of a neural network for either compression, such as pruning etc., has been a searching one. Ideas ranging from using forward metrics, such as activations, backward metrics such as gradients and their higher-order approximations such as Fisher co-efficients have been tried and shown some success. Several works also successfully demonstrate that in larger networks, even randomly associated neuron/layer importance/saliency can be a good proxy, due to the incredible plasticity of neural networks to learn to new data.

In the case of fine-tuning, however, plasticity can become a trouble for generalization, due to catastrophic forgetting. This is particularly so in cases where the fine-tuning dataset target is a small and hard dataset, which often leads to overfitting. Therefore, in cases of sparse fine-tuning, the choice of which parameter to freeze and which not to, is important. The authors suppose that using metrics that measure importance might not be the ideal way and instead learn a meta-model that can predict a layer-wise importance measure. They then use the top-n layers from this measure for fine-tuning. Although not completely original, this is novel and is sound reasoning. 

The standard metrics used to support their cases are also used to learn their meta-model and these are well-chosen. The experiments show that there is some value in training a meta-model, by being better than almost all standard metrics. Considering that their method abstracts out the metric measurement model from the system for the actual sparse fine-tuning, their work can be seamlessly combined with other fine-tuning techniques.

### Weaknesses
The work has several weaknesses that need to be discussed/addressed.
1. While it is clear from table 2, that the meta-model estimation is better than the best standard metrics and therefore can generalize for all model/dataset combinations and from figure 3 is shown to be better than random, it is not clear how much better this model is when compared against the standard metrics. This is important to know since the meta-model itself requires training and the data-collection and training is significantly expensive.
2. Table 3 is a good result. It shows comparisons against another fine-tuning technique. The reviewer would encourage the authors to add their "static predictors" as well to this table.

### Questions
The reviewer has one question, which requires further results. How much benefit is this predictor yielding when compared against the other static predictors that it is learning from? This needs to be weighed against, how expensive it is to collect data for training this predictor model and training it itself. Also, how does that delta change with model-size/type and target dataset-size/type.

### Summary
Previous studies have found that fine-tuning a small subset of layers in a model can achieve comparable or even better performance than full fine-tuning. These methods were based on metrics, known as zero-shot metrics, that measure the importance of network layers to select the optimal one for fine-tuning. However, this paper points out that these metrics perform inconsistently across different models and datasets, making it challenging to use a single metric for universal layer selection. To address this, the paper establishes a dataset that consists of various metrics and their corresponding optimal layers and trains a universal predictor for optimal layer selection using this dataset. Experimental results demonstrate that the predictor generalizes well across different models and datasets, improving fine-tuning performance while enhancing efficiency.

### Strengths
The problem addressed is interesting and relevant, especially considering the increasing model's size in the current era.

### Weaknesses
1. The paper does not provide a detailed configuration of the optimal fine-tuning layers for different models on different datasets, making it difficult for readers to identify patterns. Additionally, there is confusion regarding the claim that fine-tuning only a subset of layers can accelerate the process. Generally, fine-tuning deeper layers can be faster since backward propagation does not reach shallower layers. However, achieving downstream generalization often requires fine-tuning parameters in the shallower layers, making it challenging to achieve significant acceleration. Therefore, the authors should provide a specific layer selection for each case and provide a clear explanation of how acceleration is achieved.
2. The experiments in the paper are not extensive. Since the training is conducted on related models and datasets, there is a high risk of overfitting. Therefore, the proposed method should be validated on a wider range of models and datasets. For example, for visual tasks, validation should be performed on models like ViT, Swin, and VTAB-1K benchmark. For NLP tasks, validation should be performed on newer models like Kosmos, LLaMA 2, and LLMs. Additionally, further validation should be conducted on current multimodal large models such as BLIP-2, MiniGPT-4, LLaVA, etc. Furthermore, the architecture of the ZEST predictor is not clearly explained.
3. The paper indicates that ZEST is orthogonal to many PEFT methods but only validates its compatibility with LORA in NLP tasks. Considering the existence of many new state-of-the-art PEFT methods, can ZEST also be combined with these methods? For example, in visual tasks: Adaptformer, ConvPass, Fact, and in NLP tasks: Adapter, Prompt tuning, Ladder-side tuning, etc.
4. Table 1 indicates that a higher Kendall Tau value is better. However, in fact, negative values indicate a negative correlation between variables. Shouldn't the absolute value be used to measure the degree of the correlation?
