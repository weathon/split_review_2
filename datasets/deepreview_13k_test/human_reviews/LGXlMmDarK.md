# On the Stochasticity in Graph Neural Networks

- Decision: Reject
- Scores: 6, 5, 3

## Abstract
Graph neural networks (GNNs) that aggregate and transform point masses as \textit{messages} manifest a wide array of symptoms including limited expressiveness, over-smoothing, and over-squashing.
When stochasticity is injected into the structure of the graph, these problems can be jointly remedied, as shown in the unifying framework herein, which theoretically justifies the superior performance of a number of GNN architectures that incorporate random regularization.
For the first time, we discover that simple GNNs can \textit{exceed} the power of the Weisfeiler-Lehman test when equipped with structural stochasticity.
With insights drawn from the theoretical arguments, we design a principled way to quantify the structural uncertainty in GNNs via variational inference, termed Bayesian Rewiring of Node Networks (BRONX), and showcase its competitive performance with real-world experiments.

### Summary
The paper focuses on the structural stochasticity in graph neural networks (GNNs) and its benefits in addressing issues like limited expressiveness, oversmoothing, and over-squashing. It provides a theoretical framework justifying how structural uncertainty alleviates over-smoothing, over-squashing, and limited expressiveness in GNNs. It also discovers that stochastic GNNs can exceed the discriminative power of the Weisfeiler-Lehman tests. It introduces a method called BRONX, which quantifies the structural uncertainty in GNNs through variational inference. BRONX showcases competitive performance with other stochastic GNN models like GRAND and DropEdge with real-world experiments, highlighting the importance of edge uncertainty quantification and a principledly constructed amortized scheme for edge uncertainty.

### Strengths
1. Originality: The paper introduces the concept of structural stochasticity in graph neural networks (GNNs) and demonstrates its benefits in addressing limitations of traditional GNNs. It also presents the BRONX framework, which quantifies structural uncertainty in GNNs through variational inference, providing a novel approach to address these limitations.

2. Significance: The paper's findings have significant implications for the field of GNNs. By injecting stochasticity into GNN structures, the paper shows that simple GNNs can outperform the Weisfeiler-Lehman test. The introduction of BRONX as a method to quantify structural uncertainty in GNNs also has practical implications for improving GNN performance.

3. Clarity: The paper presents its findings and contributions in a clear and concise manner. It explains the theoretical arguments, the design of BRONX, and the real-world experiments in a way that is easy to understand.

### Weaknesses
1. The paper does not thoroughly discuss the potential limitations or drawbacks of the BRONX framework. It would be valuable to address any potential challenges or trade-offs that researchers might encounter when using BRONX in different contexts.

2. The paper lacks a comprehensive comparison with existing stochastic GNN models, limiting the understanding of how BRONX performs in relation to other approaches.

3. The paper does not provide a comprehensive comparison of the proposed method, BRONX, with existing methods for quantifying structural uncertainty in GNNs. Without such a comparison, it is difficult to assess the effectiveness and superiority of BRONX in practical scenarios. 

4. This paper only considers a simpler case where edge strength are perturbed, but not cover the increase and decrease of the number of the edges.

### Questions
1. Could you provide a more comprehensive comparison of BRONX with existing stochastic GNN models to better understand its performance and advantages?

2. Could you explain what "$\mathcal {I}$" means in equation (20)?

3. Could you discuss any potential limitations or drawbacks of the BRONX framework? Addressing these challenges would enhance the understanding and applicability of the approach.

4. It would be beneficial if you could discuss the scalability of the BRONX framework and its performance on larger datasets. This would provide a better understanding of its practical utility.

5. It would be helpful if you could provide more detailed explanations and examples of the practical implementation of the BRONX framework to assist readers in applying it in real-world scenarios.

6. There may be some minor errors in the Equation (29), which can be corrected.

4: You are confident in your assessment, but not absolutely certain. It is unlikely, but not impossible, that you did not understand some parts of the submission or that you are unfamiliar with some pieces of related work.

### Summary
In this paper, the authors study how using stochasticity can improve GNNs. The model used in the paper is called Bayesian Rewiring of Node Networks (BRONX) which allows to quantify structural uncertainty using variational inference. In Theorem 2, they show how stochasticity can allow to go beyond WL test, thus improving GNNs power. In Theorem 3, how the randomness prevents oversmoothing, and Theorem 4 shows how it prevent oversquashing. The paper is concluded with experiments.

### Strengths
- motivated problem
- various experiments

### Weaknesses
- the paper is 'slow,' the contributions start from page 4
- the theoretical result while being nice are not enough to address GNN issues

### Questions
I believe this is a nice paper but unfortunately the theoretical contributions of the paper are not enough for this venue.


--------------------------------------------
After the rebuttal: I appreciate the authors for their response and revision, as they made a lot of changes to improve the quality of the paper. As they partially addressed my questions/comments, I decided to slightly increase my score.

### Summary
The manuscript studies the role of structural stochasticity (where edge strength can be perturbed, but no edge is added in the original adjacency matrix) in Graph neural networks (GNNs). Specifically, the authors claim that the limited expressiveness, oversmoothing, and over-squashing problems can be remedied with the adoption of the structural stochasticity. Based upon this observation, the author suggests a design principle of the structure of the GNNs with the stochasticity.

### Strengths
The problem is of sufficient interest since limited expressiveness, oversmoothing, and over-squashing problems on GNNs are significant issues that need to be resolved, and empirically, engineers have tried to put randomness to resolve these issues. Hence, the objective is of importance to analyze the role of the structural stochasticity and quantify how much this helps in improving performance.

### Weaknesses
1. There are rooms for improvement on the statements of Theorems 3 & 4: The statements do not directly tell us that oversmoothing and oversquashing can be alleviated. Both contain inequalities between the one with stochasticity and the original one. If the difference is marginal, as the number of layers $K$ increases, this would not affect the improvement. For example, if the values of the two are $1/2$ and $1/3$, then $(1/2)^K \approxeq (1/3)^K$ even for the moderate $K$.
2. Technical contributions seem to be rather limited: The proof that the authors relied on is the convexity of the activation functions (or that of the first derivative of the activations), which can be limited in practice. For example, sigmoid and tangent hyperbolic functions are not convex.
3. The stochasticity assumption on the case where edge strength can be perturbed, but no edge is added in the original adjacency matrix, is bit limited.
4. It would have been nice if the assumptions that the authors made is presented in a clearer manner (e.g., by explicitly put "Assumption" separately from the normal texts or Theorem/Lemma statement).
5. Minor typo: p-5 stps -> steps

### Questions
1. p-2 $A[:,v, v] \sim q(Z)$: Does this mean that for each feature (i.e., for each column) $A[v, v]$ only becomes zero? or the entire row $A[v, :]$ or column $A[: v]$ become zero?
2. p-5: Does $K$ indicate the number of layers?
3. p-5 in the proof of Theorem 2: For $\ell = r+1$, is $r \in \{r_1, r_2\}$?
4. p-5 in the proof of Theorem 2: Does $\mathcal{I}(\cdot)$ indicate the indicator function?
