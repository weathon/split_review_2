# Training Socially Aligned Language Models on Simulated Social Interactions

- Decision: Accept
- Scores: 5, 6, 6, 8, 6

## Abstract
Social alignment in AI systems aims to ensure that these models behave according to established societal values. However, unlike humans, who derive consensus on value judgments through social interaction, current language models (LMs) are trained to rigidly replicate their training corpus in isolation, leading to subpar generalization in unfamiliar scenarios and vulnerability to adversarial attacks. This work presents a novel training paradigm that permits LMs to learn from simulated social interactions. In comparison to existing methodologies, our approach is considerably more scalable and efficient, demonstrating superior performance in alignment benchmarks and human evaluations. This paradigm shift in the training of LMs brings us a step closer to developing AI systems that can robustly and accurately reflect societal norms and values.

### Confidence
3: You are fairly confident in your assessment. It is possible that you did not understand some parts of the submission or that you are unfamiliar with some pieces of related work. Math/other details were not carefully checked.

### Summary
This paper has 3 key contributions: an environment for simulating social consensus and feedback on LLM responses; a training method for making use of the data gathered from the framework; and a new loss formulation that adds a contrastive aspect to perefence optimization. The authors conduct extensive experiments across multiple datasets and models.

### Strengths
1. The language in the paper is mostly clear and easy to read.


1. The general concept of being inspired by social interactions is interesting, and there is the possibility of being able to train an aligned model without the need to host an online reward model. However, there are many details in the execution that cast doubt on the learning method’s efficacy. Additionally, the claim of simulating human society with no supporting references from the social science literature is too grandiose.


2. There are extensive experiments on multiple datasets.


3. Human annotators were used for evaluating the final output rather than simply using a language model as a shortcut.

### Weaknesses
1. > However, this method often yields models susceptible to adversarial attacks, like “jailbreaking prompting” (Subhash, 2023; Xu et al., 2021), due to limited exposure to misaligned data during training (Amodei et al., 2016). To address this, a more advanced technique, “reward modeling” has been proposed (Leike et al., 2018; Christiano et al., 2017). 

Subhash, 2023 uses ChatGPT, a model that has likely been trained with a reward model, as an example of a vulnerable model and appears to contradict the second sentence stating that reward modeling addresses the vulnerabilities of SFT-trained models. 

2. The claim of simulating human society with no supporting references from the social science literature is way too grandiose. The authors should improve the accuracy of their claim.

3. It is somewhat unclear how the OpenAI models fit into the picture; are 99 of the 100 models all simply one of the 3 OpenAI models and one of them the Stable Alignment model? If so, this seems like a form of distillation of the preferences/values from the OpenAI model, which was purportedly trained with SFT and RLHF. Given that this method claims to do away with the need for RLHF/RMs, experiments showing its efficacy should not rely on models trained with such methods. In other words, the current experiments do not convince me that Stable Alignment can replace RLHF on its own. For example, I would be much more convinced if all the agents were initialized from non-RM based models. Relatedly, while convenient, using the OpenAI API models for critical parts of the experiments makes them essentially non-replicable and rather non-reproducible, given the constantly changing model in the backend. 

4. An additional nitpick is that the method claims to deviate from SFT-like approaches but uses an SFT-trained model as the starting point. I would like to see this addressed as well; what is the performance of Stable Alignment without using an SFT-trained model as the initialization?

5. Regarding CPO, since it is a new technique that claims to improve the efficacy of the overall method, there should be an ablation where it is replaced with the regular SFT loss or other alignment algorithms, such as perhaps DPO.

6. More details on the procedure and exactly which models and types of social agents were used to generate data for each learning stage are needed; this is still unclear to me after reading through the details and appendices multiple times. Are the numbers of examples for each stage in Fig 2 the total over all iterations, or per iteration? How many iterations were needed to arrive at the final model? Was the model trained on data from all three societies at each stage or were 3 separate models trained? If the latter, which model was used in the final evaluation?

7. Use of HH-A as an estimate of adversarial prompt robustness:
I went through the examples in the HHH dataset (there are typos where the last H is missing throughout the paper) and disagree with the use of the appended “misaligned” response as a dataset good enough for adversarial robustness evaluation. A better evaluation of adversarial prompt robustness would be to use a library such as [garak](https://github.com/leondz/garak) with known adversarial prompts used by the community.

### Questions
1. Given that the motivation was alignment to social values, how was diversity across demographics ensured in the user study? The user study is meant to demonstrate that models trained with this method are better aligned, but better aligned to whom? This is important to call out since regular practitioners will simply use the popular models of the day with the released toolkit without thinking critically about whose values they capture.

1. Additionally, given the use of simulation with LMs is touted as a benefit of this approach, what are the drawbacks of using this instead of collecting representative feedback (and training a reward model), whose values are the models implicitly aligning to with such simulation? These should be explicitly called out and elaborated in the limitations section but are currently briefly glossed over in the ethics section.

1. Given the unstable nature of RL training, how was hyperparameter optimization done for the baseline methods? Were you able to reproduce published results where their hyperparameters were optimized?

1. For the embedding model and social agents, is it necessary to use an API model? Why not use an open-source model, which makes the experiments more reproducible and replicable?

### Summary
This paper proposes a data collection environment (Sandbox) and a training approach (Stable Alignment) to help align LMs to generate responses that are more moral and robust to adversarial attacks (i.e., being more "socially aligned"). 

The authors first introduces a new sandbox environment for collecting responses that are more socially aligned, by interacting a central agent (to be trained) with other static agents (e.g. LLMs). The other agents provide feedback and ratings to the answers generated by the central agent, and those data are later used for training. Next, the author proposes Stable Alignment, which trains a LM to learn from those collected data in three stages by 1) imitation learning from socially aligned responses, 2) learning to self-critique, and 3) learning to generate better responses entailed by a feedback. Additionally, stage 1 and stage 3 are trained using a contrastive objective. The authors finally showed improved performance (e.g. generating more human-aligned responses, choosing more moral responses) in a variety of tasks, and presents analysis showing that Stable Alignment has a more stable training curve compared to RRHF and requires less training steps to obtain high rewards/scores.

### Strengths
1. The proposed Contrastive Preference Optimization is new, and is shown to be able to effectively train LMs to learn from both positive samples (well-aligned responses) and negative ones. This hints at how data collection procedure in the future may not always need to focus on collecting high-quality, socially aligned data only, which can be costly and time-consuming.

2. The authors provided extensive analysis across six benchmark tasks with seven related baselines to show that Stable Alignment can generate/choose more socially aligned responses. This is helpful especially because the pipeline is autonomous: it does not require human involvement for additional annotation.

### Weaknesses
1. The authors claim the proposed Stable Alignment addresses limitations from (e.g.) RL from a reward model, which "may be inherently imperfect and not fully capture nuances of human judgment". However, since the data collection process (i.e., the sandbox) mainly prompts LLMs to gather feedback and ratings, how are these not imperfect or can be guaranteed to fully capture nuances of human judgement? There is a lack of analysis or discussion on the noises that could come from gathering data from LLMs, which is arguably critical for the proposed method to succeed and can be seen as limitation of how far this approach can go.

2. the sandbox data creation procedure appears to be an extension to prompt *multiple* LLM agents to provide rating and feedback for a single agent, instead of just prompting a single LLM teacher to gather data. There is a lack of experiments showing the advantage of using "multiple" LLM agents, and whether if this is even necessary. If not, many relevant work ([1]-[3]), which also did learning to generate feedback/critiques/improvement from a single teacher model, and is not discussed in this work. This limits the novelty and usefulness of the proposed "sandbox" construction and the following supervised training procedure.

### Questions
1. RL + reward model aims to train an LM with on-policy data. By converting the learning task of an offline scenario, the model eventually is training on *off-policy* alignment data, as its safety capability of the LM improves but it is still learning from the same fixed pool of data. The benefit of this is a more stable learning curve (from supervised training), but to what extent do you see this trade-off between on/off-policy training coming up in your proposed approach?

2. why is TRLX not included in Figure 4?
 
3. the motivation of sandbox being a "10 x 10" grid is unclear. Since the interaction mechanism is getting feedback and ratings from some other LLM agents, just sampling those LLMs from some unordered pool should suffice? It is unclear how the additional structure of a grid world is necessary in the proposed sandbox environment.

4. the data collection process of using LLM to gather feedback and asking the central model to generate a revision may be error-prone as indicated by [2] and [4], as a smaller LMs such as LLaMA-7b or Alpaca was not trained initially to follow the feedback and revise its response. Has this been an issue in the proposed approach as well? If so how is this resolved?

### Summary
The paper proposes a scalable and efficient training paradigm that enables LMs to learn from simulated social interactions. There are two key components: (1) simulating social interactions in SANDBOX with Back-Scatter to generate alignment data and (2) a 3-stage alignment learning framework (Stable Alignment) to train LMs on the alignment data from (1). Evaluation results on several relevant alignment benchmarks show the efficacy of the method.

### Strengths
-The proposed alignment method is novel, and takes inspiration from recently published research. The human evaluation results confirm experimental results on relevant benchmarks. Relevant related work is cited. The paper is well written, and graphics help with understanding.

### Weaknesses
-The proposed methodology is complicated compared to existing alternatives, but ablation shows that each component is critical in the effectiveness. I would assume the proposed method generalizes to other (larger) LMs, but additional experimental results would be helpful.  

-I might overlook this but an analysis of the results on chatgpt will be helpful to identify future improvements.

-Experiments can be extended to more human value relevant datasets such as mmlu and civil comments.

-See questions below.

### Questions
A few clarifications on Back-Scatter would be helpful. 

-It’s not clear how the observer LLMs generate the ratings using the Likert scale; the relevant prompts would be helpful given these ratings play a key part in the training component. 

-Is the rating on imitation and self-critic data only alignment ratings. 

-In Fig 3, are these the central agents? What is serving as the observer agent here?

The training process (3.2 Stable Alignment) is quite clear, though a few small clarifications would be helpful in the experiments section. 

-Is instruction-tuning a prerequisite for alignment training with Stable Alignment? 

-Could a non-instruction tuned model be trained on the alignment data and achieve comparable results (i.e. base LLaMA instead of Alpaca)?

-Do these experimental results on alignment tasks generalize to other (larger) base models? 

-The wider performance implications are also unclear. Does model perplexity greatly increase? Does the performance on more generic tasks (non-alignment based benchmarks) decrease after alignment training with Stable Alignment?

### Summary
This paper studies how to use simulated social interactions to align AI with human values. It presents a sandbox where many LLMs can interact with each other, provide feedbacks, and rate each other. Then a contrastive preference optimization, i.e. learn more from the welcome responses and unlearn the unwelcome responses. Experiments show that the proposed method gives better aligned responses compared to baselines.

### Strengths
1. The proposed method is interesting and conceptually novel, especially the sandbox idea.

2. The experiment is extensive (although contains some issues that I am concerned with, which I will discuss later)

3. The writing is clear.

### Weaknesses
The main issue that I am concerned with is the relation between this work and RLAIF[1]. It is also trying to use AI feedbacks to align the model. The main difference between the proposed method and RLAIF is that RLAIF still follows the paradigm of RLHF and only replace human feedback with AI feedback. And the proposed method is building up a sandbox of multiple AI. I am wondering how much difference in performance will be brought by this difference.

### Summary
The paper proposes a framework for aligning LMs with societal norms by training them on data generated by LMs interacting with each other and correcting their behavior. They conduct extensive experiments showing how their methods improves alignment on a number of benchmarks, including human evaluation.

### Strengths
1. The paper proposes a quite original approach to alignment, using social interactions between multiple LMs as a data-generating process for finetuning. It’s ambitious and inspiring.
2. I think multi-agent experiments with LMs studying norm establishing, norm following and social learning are interesting on their own and the paper (specifically, the Sandbox environment) is a great contribution to this area.
3. The paper is well-written. Despite complexity of the method, it’s relatively easy to understand.
4. The experiments are quite extensive and well-designed. The results look promising: significant improvements can be seen on multiple relevant benchmarks.

### Weaknesses
1. I don’t think the authors have enough evidence to claim that “their approach is considerably more scalable” (from the abstract). I’m a bit concerned that the method does not scale with model size (page 4) and I didn’t see experiments showing scaling wrt society size. If it doesn’t scale, Stable Alignment is significantly less promising as an alignment method. (It’s still interesting as an LLM capabilities analysis though.)
2. I’m not entirely convinced how important is the social aspect of the data-generating process. It seems to be just an extension of [language model cascades](https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.10342) line of work, including [imitational learning from language feedback](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.16755) (ILF) or [constitutional AI](https://www.anthropic.com/index/constitutional-ai-harmlessness-from-ai-feedback) (CAI), where LMs give feedback on LMs’ initial responses which are then refined. The agents are weakly individuated in the proposes framework, i.e. (as far as I understand) they start the same and and only differ in their conversation histories. I wonder how important is treating multiple calls to the same LM as simulating different agents. Does it improve alignment compared with a single-agent society, more similar to ILF or CAI? Is there a scaling plot? (I might’ve missed this, I’m happy to corrected by the authors.)
3. Relatedly, I think [language model cascades](https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.10342) line of work (including [imitational learning from language feedback](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.16755) (ILF), [constitutional AI](https://www.anthropic.com/index/constitutional-ai-harmlessness-from-ai-feedback) (CAI), [critiques](https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.05802), [Reflexion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.11366), [STaR](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.14465)) could be discussed briefly in Related work. I’m also happy to be corrected if the authors think I’m wrong seeing their paper as a multi-agent extension of this line of work.
