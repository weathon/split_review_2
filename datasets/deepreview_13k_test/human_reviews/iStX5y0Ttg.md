# Towards Universal Robust Federated Learning via Meta Stackelberg Game

- Decision: Reject
- Scores: 5, 3, 3, 3

## Abstract
Recent studies have revealed that federated learning (FL) systems are susceptible to a range of security threats. Although various defense mechanisms have been proposed, they are typically non-adaptive and tailored to specific types of attacks, leaving them insufficient in the face of unknown/uncertain or adaptive attacks. In this work, we formulate adversarial federated learning as a Bayesian Stackelberg Markov game (BSMG) to tackle adaptive attacks of uncertain types. We further develop an efficient meta-learning approach to solve the game, which provides a robust and adaptive FL defense.
Theoretically, we show that our algorithm provably converges to the first-order $\varepsilon$-equilibrium point in $O(\varepsilon^{-2})$ gradient iterations with $O(\varepsilon^{-4})$ samples per iteration. Empirical results show that our meta-Stackelberg framework obtains superb performance against strong model poisoning and backdoor attacks with uncertain types.

### Summary
This paper proposes a new federated learning defense mechanism by combining Bayesian Stackelberg Markov game and meta-learning.
The proposed procedure contains a pre-training stage that learns a meta defend policy in simulated environment, and an online execution stage, where the meta defend policy is updated using data collected from real interactions with the potentially malicious clients.

### Strengths
The idea of using Bayesian Stackelberg Markov game to model adversarial federated learning seems to be novel.

### Weaknesses
Please correct me if I am missing anything. 

In the proposed defense framework, we will train three neural networks, one for minimizing the FL loss, with parameter $w$, one for the policy network of the defender, with parameter $\theta$, and one for attacker (could be multiple actually, we have one for each type of attacker), with parameter $\phi$. Then when we apply this in real FL environment, we rely on the defender's policy network to alter the updated global model at each iteration, to defende against potential attackers. And importantly, the learned defender's policy will only work for the particular neural network used for minimizing FL loss during pre-training, i.e., if we change the dataset (e.g., change in distribution of x, or conditional distribution of y|x), choose a different loss function, or change the structure of the neural network, the defender policy no longer works. Is this correct?

What I am a little bit confused about is, what this framework seems to be saying is that, we have already have enough data to train a neural network $w$ during pre-training to solve some FL task. Now what I am worried about is that, if I train this neural network again in real FL environment (ideally, using exactly the same training data as the one used during pre-training), there might be some attackers that manipulate my global model updates. Therefore, to defend against them, I will create a simulation environment that contains different type of attackers, and I train my neural network $w$ to solve the FL task, with the help of a defender policy $\theta$ that tries to "correct" the manipulated global model. Now with the trained defender policy $\theta$ (with some online adaptation), I can properly train my network $w$ in real FL environment in the face of potential attackers.

If this is true, then it seems FL is not really necessary, since we are already capable of training a good $w$ locally? I'd appreciate it if the authors can shed more light on this.

### Questions
1. There seems to be a bit mismatch in the description of how the defense strategy works.

In Section 2.1 paragraph "FL process", the server applies a post-training defense $h(\cdot)$ only on the final global model, i.e., $h(w_{g}^{T})$. In Section 2.2, the action of the defender is described as $a_{D}^{t}=h(w_{g}^{t+1})$, which is applied at each step.

2. The definition of defender’s expected utility in Section 2.3

Intutively, we should only care about the final loss of the FL procedure, i.e., how good our model is at the end of FL. But the currently definition says we should care about the cumulative loss during the whole FL procedure, which does not seem to be very reasonable? Perhaps changing the reward definition in Section 2.2 to "reduction of loss compared with last iteration", instead of loss at current iteration would be better?

3. I'd appreciate if the authors can elaborate on what it would mean if the proposed method successfully defend against the attackers, e.g., in terms of convergence rate of the FL procedure. This seems to be vague in the current presentation of the theoretical results.

### Summary
The authors develop Bayesian Stackelberg Markov game to handle security problems in FL and incomplete information. 

 The authors have built on previous RL and meta learning literature to establish the game and solve the problem by constructing a simulation environment. 

Though the problem is important, I found serious concerns with respect to the considered setting and its usefulness for FL, the developed solution, and results.

### Strengths
Addressing security issues in FL is an important problem. The problem is important, however, the idea is not original. The paper is relatively well written but the developed solution and contribution is not significant.

### Weaknesses
The main issue with this paper is the assumption for the existence of a pre-training. It is not clear which entity provides the data for pre-training as the data privacy is critical in FL. If the server does not have access to client's data, the pre-training step can be quite ineffective for example when the data distributions can be significantly different, which makes the overall proposed solution ineffective.

How do you generate the data for the simulation to ensure 1) the privacy is not violated 2) you make sure the distribution matches the distribution of data over honest clients? 

--------

The sample complexity of the proposed method is exhaustive. The main problem is using an RL-based simulation methods, while there are alternative methods with guaranteed regret bounds with significantly smaller sample complexity. I am not sure whether an RL-based solution is a good idea to handle this problem.

--------

The setting of considering both backdoor attackers and untargeted attackers is not well motivated and counter intuitive. Since the objectives of those attackers are different, the overall attacks will be much less effective compared to considering two disjoint scenarios where you have either backdoor attackers or untargeted ones.

--------

The authors consider each attack separately and optimize policy according to each attack. It is quite time consuming. The setting assumes that the defender knows attacks distribution but it averages all adapted policies rather than does weight average. 

--------

The Assumption 3.4. which is required for the following theoretical results are quite restrictive. Can the authors provide a concrete learning problem with deep neural networks that satisfy this assumption?

### Summary
The paper consider mitigation of Byzantine attacks in federated learning. They assume access to a simulator on which they find a minimax optimal policy for the defending aggregation policy in a pre-training phase. The pre-training proceeds by iteratively considering a batch of sampled attack type and subsequently unrolling a simulated training scenario using the current policy of both the defender and the attack type. An inner loop ensures that the attack policy is solved approximately optimally (at the expense of unrolling multiple times). A meta learning aggregation rule, such as Reptile, is used to aggregate the updates across the batch of sampled attack type. This allows adjusting to a particular (fixed and possibly unknown) attack type at training time more effectively. Convergence is shown under strict competition and PL conditions and the algorithm is demonstrated on MNIST and CIFAR10.

### Strengths
- The idea of a data dependent aggregation rule seems useful
- There is a good overview of existing literature

### Weaknesses
The scenario being modelled is a setting where the attacker randomly selects the attack type, fixes it throughout training and only optimizes the hyperparameters of the attack type. One major concern is that this is a very narrow scenario, which is subsequently solved by a (computationally expensive) heavy machinery. I would expect a simple baseline to do well. Why not in Table 1 compare against the same defences as used in the policy based method (e.g. FoolsGold)? How about comparing against a fixed policy (with reasonable defaults)?

One major issue is that the final algorithms is never fully specified since many parts remains undefined (even after looking through the appendix):

- What is an attacker type? Is it a fine set? Last paragraph of page 3 does not seem to define it precisely.
- What is the policy for a given attack type? In theory part is it a mapping from parameter space to parameter space? In practice is it the hyperparameters of a given attack type?
- Right before section 4.2: 
    - You seem to optimize over $\mathbb R^3$ (with some additional constraints) for untargeted defences policy and similarly for backdoor defence. Should we understand that $\theta$ in Algorithm 1 lives in the _product_ space of the two?
    - Do you project to keep e.g. $b$ in $a_1^t:=(a,b,c)$ within the trimming threshold?
 - The online adaptation only seems to be described loosely in the paragraph right before section 3. Do you need to store a trajectory of model weights? What is the memory requirement?

 I suggest specifying the algorithm (as used in both theory and in experiments) in full detail.
 
Theory:

- The convergence results do not seem surprising or informative. All difficulty seems to be assumed away with PL conditions, strict-competitiveness, increasing batchsize and approximating a max-oracle. You also seem to be ignoring the size of the (sampled) attack type space. Is the batch size of the attack types taken "large enough"? (intuitively it should depend on $\varepsilon$)
- If the attack types space have no structure (it is a set) how can you give a meaningful OOD generalization bound? In the appendix it seems that you almost have to assume that their policies are not too different. Can you elaborate on what this proposition buys you?
- If the model is overparameterized the attacker can construct a backdoor attack without harming the defenders reward. How does solving (2) prevent a backdoor attack?

It seems that the methods intentionally _violates client privacy_ to construct the necessary simulation dataset. Bottom page 7 states "We use inference attack (i.e., Inverting gradient (Geiping et al., 2020)) in (Li et al., 2022a) for only a few FL epochs (20 in our setting) to learn data from clients". This does not seem viable. Do you have ablation over how much the simulated data quality degrades the performance?

### Summary
This paper proposes a pre-training algorithm to defend against multiple attacks in the context of federated learning. In particular, it considers the threat model in which adversaries can either use a model poisoning attack that aims to maximize average loss, or use a backdoor attack that aims to cause misclassification of poisoned test data while preserving decent performance on clean test data. The idea of the proposed algorithm is to converge towards an equilibrium where the central server has previously learned to defend itself against the mentioned attacks, and then learns in the context of the federated learning setting. The authors propose both a theoretical analysis of the number of gradient iterations and an experimental evaluation of the proposed solution.

### Strengths
- The game theoretic approach is interesting.
- The experimental results show the improvement of the proposed method over some existing defenses.

### Weaknesses
In my opinion, the form of the paper is not presentable and does not meet ICLR standards (the following points are not sorted by importance):

- Page 2 in FL process: learning rate is missing in the gradient descent formula

- Definition 2.1: As it is presented, there isn’t any condition for $\theta$ and $\phi$ to constitute an equilibrium. More precisely, if I had to simplify the current formulation of the definition, one would have:
"Definition 2.1 :$\theta$ and $\phi$ constitute an equilibrium if they satisfy : $\max_{\theta} f(\theta)$"
For me there is definitely a problem in the formulation.

- Figure 2 shows that the pre-training (that corresponds to Algorithm 1) output is the policy $\pi_\theta$ and the gradient adaptation $\Psi$, whereas in Algorithm 1, the output is $\theta$. This is a bit confusing. 

- As presented in the paper, the objective of federated learning is to minimize the loss on all clients. I think it would be better to say (or to add) that the objective of federated learning under attack is to minimize the loss on the set of honest clients and not on all the clients, since some of them are malicious.

- In Definition 3.1, the intersection $\Uptheta \cap B(\theta^\star)$ in the first 'max' is exactly equal to $B(\theta^\star)$. Can you explain this choice? Same problem for the second 'max', and above all there is an error in the definition of $B(\phi^\star)$ which depends on theta, whereas the constraint is on $\phi$... 

- The 'Meta_Update' function in Algorithm 1 is not explained anywhere.... Or maybe I just didn't find it.

- Most of the graphs in the experiments section are not visible at all... the font size is too small.

I found the paper very difficult to follow because of the points mentioned above.

On the content :

- The state-of-the-art in defending against model poisoning (a.k.a Byzantine attacks) is to use the NNM [1] pre-aggregation rule before using any aggregation rule such as Krum or Trimmed-Mean etc... Why didn't the authors use this technique to compare with the proposed method?

- Most of the time, the FL setting appears either when data needs to be kept on the client side, or when computing power needs to be divided. In both cases, it is assumed that the server will not learn on its own because it is not possible or practical to do so. Is there any practical reason why it is acceptable to consider that the central server is able to pre-train here? How does the server generate data? Overall, if the server is allowed to pre-train, would it not allow to train completely in a centralized way and avoid potential malicious client?
