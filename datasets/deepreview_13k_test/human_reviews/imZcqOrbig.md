## Abstract
A promising direction for pre-training 3D point clouds is to leverage the massive amount of data in 2D, whereas the domain gap between 2D and 3D creates a fundamental challenge. This paper proposes a novel approach to point-cloud pre-training that learns 3D representations by leveraging pre-trained 2D networks. Different from the popular practice of predicting 2D features first and then obtaining 3D features through dimensionality lifting, our approach directly uses a 3D network for feature extraction. We train the 3D feature extraction network with the help of the novel 2D knowledge transfer loss, which enforces the 2D projections of the 3D feature to be consistent with the output of pre-trained 2D networks. To prevent the feature from discarding 3D signals, we introduce the multi-view consistency loss that additionally encourages the projected 2D feature representations to capture pixel-wise correspondences across different views. Such correspondences induce 3D geometry and effectively retain 3D features in the projected 2D features. Experimental results demonstrate that our pre-trained model can be successfully transferred to various downstream tasks, including 3D shape classification, part segmentation, 3D object detection, and semantic segmentation, achieving state-of-the-art performance.

### Summary
This paper proposes a new learning framework for point cloud pre-training. The core motivation is to learn a view-consistent 3D feature representation. To enhance the pre-training effectiveness, the authors introduce pre-trained 2D image learning networks for knowledge transfer and also develop an auxiliary task of building pixel-space correspondences. Experiments on various downstream tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed pre-training method.

### Strengths
(1) The paper is well-written and easy to follow. The working mechanism and motivation of each module is clearly explained. 

(2) The proposed learning pipeline and pretext task are technically sound. 

(3) The resulting supervised fine-tuning performances are encouraging.

### Weaknesses
(1) In practice, we may adopt various backbone models for point cloud learning. This requires a generic pre-training scheme that can be used to enhance the feature extraction capability of various point cloud backbones. However, in the manuscript, only the SR-UNet backbone is involved. Hence, the authors should explore more types of backbones for pre-training to validate the proposed method. Note that it is not convincing enough to only give a few results in Table 2 of the supplementary material without detailed explanations and more comprehensive experiments. 

(2) Furthermore, the experimental comparison with previous point cloud pre-training approaches is problematic because the adopted backbone models differ. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed pre-training framework, the authors should make sure that the performance gains are not from the stronger backbone. 

(3) For scene-level experiments, the authors perform pre-training on ScanNet and fine-tune on ScanNet, S3DIS, and SUN RGB-D. In fact, the pre-training dataset and the fine-tuning datasets are all indoor room data, with small domain gaps. Therefore, the actual transferability, which is known to be a key consideration factor for a pre-training method, is questionable. Some cross-domain verifications are needed, such as fine-tuning on some outdoor datasets.

 (4) For object-level experiments, the pre-training dataset Objaverse (with 800K objects) is much larger than ShapeNet/ModelNet used in previous pre-training methods. Therefore, the performance comparison is unfair.

### Questions
For different experiments, the authors are also suggested to report their results of training from scratch, such that readers can better observe the relative gains after pre-training the backbone using the proposed method.

### Summary
This paper introduces a 3D representation learning approach that involves projecting 3D dense features into 2D images. This method employs multi-level feature maps for cross-modal knowledge distillation and employs coordinate mapping as a pretext task for achieving multi-view consistency learning. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of both modules in various downstream tasks, including 3D shape classification, part segmentation, 3D object detection, and semantic segmentation.

### Strengths
1. The proposed method exhibits a high degree of applicability, yielding favorable results across indoor scene-level datasets such as ScanNet and S3DIS, as well as at the object level dataset such as ScanObjectNN.

2. The approach of projecting 3D features to 2D and learning consistency through point mapping aligns with physical intuition.

3. The paper is well-written and ablation experiments are well-designed.

### Weaknesses
1. Given that the model can generate dense features containing rich semantics, I strongly recommend incorporating zero-shot experiments, including zero-shot classification experiments on datasets such as ModelNet and LVIS, as well as zero-shot semantic segmentation experiments on ScanNet and S3DIS.

2. The classification experiments at the object level lack references and comparisons to recent works, such as ULIP-2 [Liu et al., 2023] and ReCon [Qi et al., 2023]. Furthermore, MVNet is trained on Objaverse and includes multiple versions with different parameters, making the comparisons in Table 3 unfair in terms of both the training dataset and model parameters.

3. Some papers are repeatedly cited in the bib, such as: "Charles R. Qi, Or Litany, Kaiming He, and Leonidas J. Guibas. Deep hough voting for 3d object detection in point clouds. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), October 2019a."

4. The result of ScanObjectNN in Figure 1 is different from the result in Table 3.

### Questions
1. Why not directly use the transformation matrix of two views as training targets within the multi-view consistency module?

2. Is voting strategy employed in the classification of object point clouds? 

3. I am curious to understand why SAM yields inferior performance as a 2D encoder compared to DINOv2.

### Summary
This paper proposes to leverage the pre-trained 2D **networks** instead of data for 3D point cloud pretraining. Specifically, a 3D network is first applied to extract 3D feature volumes that are then projected into image-level embeddings with the help of depth information. Next, the key idea is to make the projected image features close to their counterparts that are pretrained using powerful 2D vision foundation models such as Dinov2, CLIP, SAM. Additionally, to realize multi-view consistency, another module is adapted to maintain the point correspondences across different views, yielding the whole proposed method called MVNet. For verifying the effectiveness of MVNet, experiments are conducted on various benchmarks and tasks.

### Strengths
1.	The paper is well-organized, well-written, and easy to follow.
2.	The key idea to leverage the pre-trained 2D networks and learn the 3D-2D correspondence at the feature level is interesting and effective. Such pretext task design provides a new direction for future research on 3D pretraining.
3.	The proposed method achieves **superior results** on various benchmarks and tasks.
4.	The supplementary material provides more experimental results and states the broader impacts. Additionally, the qualitative results of multi-view consistency predictions further prove the effectiveness of the proposed method.
5.	Some possible limitations and future potentials are also discussed.

### Weaknesses
1.	The **masking ratio** is *only discussed* in the ablation study, which is very confusing. Some more details about this masking operation should be discussed in the method section. For example, why do you use this operation? Why can it benefit the proposed method?
2.	There are several **important recent related works** [1, 2] that should be discussed in Related Works and compared in the tables in the main paper.
3.	The proposed method introduces two modules, thus the **#params and FLOPs** during pretraining (all the parts that need to be trained online in Fig. 2 should be counted) need to be provided and compared with other methods to show the efficiency of the proposed method.
4.	The proposed method requires the **pre-processing** on RGB-D scans to generate point clouds. This operation may bring extra processing time and disk usage. How long will it take? How much extra storage will this need? This should be at least discussed in the supplementary material.
Also, this may be a limitation of the proposed method, which should be mentioned in the limitation section.
5.	Some **qualitative/visualization results** of different tasks such as 3D segmentation, and detection should be provided in the supplementary material.

### Questions
This work shows great potential to serve as a new pretraining method for 3D point cloud processing. Hope the code and the pretrained models could be public upon the acceptance of this paper.

The major concerns are detailed in the weaknesses part. The missing discussions, experimental results and qualitative results are expected to be provided during the rebuttal.

### Summary
The paper proposes a pre-training method for 3D point clouds that leverages 2D pre-trained foundation models. The method performs multiview consistency pre-training with a distillation loss from 2D pre-trained model. The experiments show the effectiveness of this method on several tasks on point cloud data.

### Strengths
The major strength of the paper is the effectiveness and simplicity of the method. Although I think the paper does not have a big technical contribution, since knowledge distillation from 2D foundation models is becoming a common approach, I like the paper since it is simpler than other concurrent works [1] and shows significant improvements.

### Weaknesses
Although I like the concept, I think the evaluation should be improved. In particular, I am concerned about the weight initialization scheme used. The paper states that only the weights of the encoder are re-used for initialization since it leads to better performance. However, all previous approaches have used the pre-trained weights from the encoder and decoder. Therefore, it is difficult to assess if this pre-training setup improves over previous work. Since this work uses the same backbone as previous pre-training works and these methods provide pre-trained weights, it would be easy and necessary to provide a comparison of fine-tuned models for previous works where only the encoder is reused. Moreover, numbers for a fine-tuned model with the proposed method where the decoder weights are also reused should be provided. With this experiment, we will be able to assess if this is only necessary for the proposed pre-training method or if all pre-training strategies suffer from it. More importantly, we will be able to assess if the described improvement on the paper really comes from the pre-training strategy or from the fine-tuning setup used. I would rate the paper as marginally above acceptance and I would change my rating after rebuttal when these numbers are available.

Moreover, it is not clear the masking ratio ablation experiment. There is no description in the methods section of any masking applied during pre-training, so I think it will be necessary to clarify how this masking is applied during pre-training.
