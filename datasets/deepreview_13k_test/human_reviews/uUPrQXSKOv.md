# Decentralized Decoupled Training for Federated Long-Tailed Learning

- Decision: Reject
- Scores: 5, 3, 5

## Abstract
In the real world, the data samples often follow a long-tailed distribution, which poses a great challenge for Federated Learning (FL). That is, when the data is decentralized and long-tailed, FL may produce a poorly-behaved global model that is severely biased towards the head classes with the majority of the training samples. To settle this issue, decoupled training has recently been introduced to FL. Decoupled training aims to re-balance the biased classifier after the normal instance-balanced training, and has achieved promising results in centralized long-tailed learning. The current study directly adopts the decoupled training idea on the server side by re-training the classifier on a set of pseudo features, due to the unavailability of a global balanced dataset in FL. Unfortunately, this practice restricts the capacity of decoupled training in federated long-tailed learning as the low-quality pseudo features lead to a sub-optimal classifier. In this work, motivated by the distributed characteristic of FL, we propose a decentralized decoupled training mechanism by leveraging the abundant real data stored in the local. Specifically, we integrate the local real data with the global gradient prototypes to form the local balanced datasets, and thus re-balance the classifier during the local training. Furthermore, we introduce a supplementary classifier in the training phase to help model the global data distribution, which addresses the problem of contradictory optimization goals caused by performing classifier re-balancing locally. Extensive experiments show that our method consistently outperforms the existing state-of-the-art methods in various settings. Our code will be released upon acceptance.

### Summary
This work studies Federated Learning in a setting where the global data distribution is long-tailed and non-IID decentralized regarding the classes. It adopts the popular decoupled training strategy used in centralized long-tailed training. Each client re-balance the
classifier on a locally balanced dataset based on the local real data and the global gradient prototypes of a supplementary classifier that captures the global distribution.

### Strengths
* The writer-up is clear and organized 
* The proposed approach is sound and intuitive

### Weaknesses
* The scope of this paper is a bit restricted in terms of either imbalanced learning or federated learning (FL). On the imbalanced learning side, the decoupling classifier strategy is a subset of the SOTA techniques in imbalanced learning. On the FL side, imbalanced learning is a subproblem in general non-IID FL. 

* The technical contributions are a bit small. It seems to be an application of CReFF and prototyping, which are actually not specific to FL but are already widely used in centralized learning. The proposed method seems to be incremental on CReFF. 

* The related work and compared baselines are quite outdated for both centralized imbalanced learning or FL. Previous works in section 2.2 are before 2021. For FL baselines in experiments, more advanced general FL methods should be compared. Moreover, adopting class-imbalanced loss in local training was proposed in several FL works [A, B] but missing. The idea of classifier calibration or using prototypes is also proposed before [CDE].

* Sharing the per-class gradients might weaken the privacy compared to vanilla FedAvg.

### Summary
This paper addresses a key challenge in FL when data samples have a long-tailed distribution. In such cases, FL tends to produce models biased towards the majority classes. This paper looks into "decoupled training", a method previously effective in centralized long-tailed learning. 

This paper proposes a decentralized decoupled training method. Instead of relying on pseudo features, this method utilizes real data from local storage and combines it with global gradient prototypes. This process creates local balanced datasets to recalibrate the classifier locally. To further enhance the model's performance, this paper also introduces a supplementary classifier. This classifier aids in modeling the overall data distribution, mitigating potential local optimization conflicts.

Empirical experiments demonstrate that this approach consistently outperforms existing methods in various settings.

### Strengths
1. The problem studied in this paper is interesting and important. The method addresses the problem of long-tailed which is important in FL. 

2. This paper has originality and some technically sound.

### Weaknesses
1. The clarity and organization of the paper can be improved. There is a need for clearer motivation for the proposed method, providing a stronger rationale for its development.

2. The performance of the decentralized decoupled training mechanism heavily relies on the abundant local real data, limiting its applications to more wide areas.

### Questions
1. There are certain issues with the formulas and symbols used throughout the paper, causing confusion. Specifically,

   - In Eqs (4), (5), and (6), what distinguishes $L(P,W,\widehat{W};\mathcal{D})$ from $L(W;P,\mathcal{D})$? It would be clearer to use distinct symbols for differentiation.

   - In Eqs (7), (8), (9), and (11), the subscripts for the differentiation symbols appear to be incorrect. The correct notation should be $x^{t}=x^{t-1}-\eta\nabla_xf(x^{t-1})$.

   - Eqs (4) and (5) raise some queries: How does $L(W;P,\mathcal{D}^{bal})$ constrain $L(P,W,\widehat{W};\mathcal{D})$? Does the expression $L(W;P,\mathcal{D}^{bal})=\min_{W_P}L(W_P;P,\mathcal{D}^{bal})$ imply that $W=\arg\min_{W_P}L(W_P;P,\mathcal{D}^{bal})$?

2. This paper seems to rely on an implicit assumption that the real data, which is exclusively stored on the clients, is abundant. Such an assumption seems strong, especially in cross-device contexts where locally stored data is typically limited.

3. The Algorithm focuses solely on the local training process. Incorporating a global process for clarity, which includes both local training and global aggregation, would be beneficial.
4. The description, specifically for each class $c$, in point (1) is some ambiguous. Are points (1) and (2) referring to different cases?
5. For the final logits given as $z=W^\top h+ \widehat{W}^\top h$, is there a need for an additional normalization coefficient to satisfy the properties of logits?
6. It would be beneficial if the authors could provide a more comprehensive discussion in the experimental section regarding the additional communication overhead of the proposed method. This encompasses the transmission of extra model parameters or gradient information.

### Summary
This paper proposes a training algorithm to address the challenge of long-tailed data distribution in federated learning. They target the contradictory optimization goal when training the model and introduce an additional classifier to make it more feasible. Moreover, they decouple the training of the original and additional classifier to make the original classifier benefit from the balanced data gradient. Empirical experiments are conducted to verify the effectiveness of their method.

### Strengths
- Originality: The paper focuses on a conventional problem, but the method that introduces an additional classifier to address the contradictory optimization is novel.
  - Quality: Sufficient technique details.
  - Clarity: The logic and presentation are relatively good.
  - Significance: Maybe there is something that I misunderstand in their method. But from my point of view, the method is counterintuitive, and the experiment results are not significant. No theoretical guarantee is provided. These make the significance of this paper limited.

### Weaknesses
- The proposed method is somehow counterintuitive. Please check the questions below.
  - The improvement is not so impressive. E.g., in Tab.1 and 2, the maximal improvement is about 1% and 2%, respectively. For some small datasets like MNIST and CIFAR10, the improvement is especially limited. I encourage the authors to discuss more advantages of their paper than the SOTA. Though the author claims CReFF needs more computation, it seems to me that the computation and communication overhead of the proposed method is also high. I expect the author to analyze the difference in the computation cost between theirs and other methods.
  - Given the experiment results are not so good, no theoretical guarantee makes the significance and contribution of this paper limited

### Questions
1. In Eq.6, how to calculate the gradient of $\min_{W_P}L(W_P;P,D^{bal})$? From my understanding, in Alg.1, line 3 is to optimize $L(P,W,\hat{W};D_k)$ while line 4-6 can be considered as jointly optimize $L(P,W,\hat{W};D_k)+\lambda L(W;P,D^{bal})$. But I don’t see how to optimize $-\min_{W_P}L(W_P;P,D^{bal})$ where $P$ should be the optimization variable.
  2. Even though I know the whole training process as shown in Alg.1 and Fig.1, I am still confused about the effect of $\hat{W}$. Except that $\hat{W}$ will change the optimization goal as in Eq.5, I cannot get the point that what $\hat{W}$ can really learn in the training process. My intuition is that $\hat{W}$ will learn a residual of the output of a classifier trained with the long-tailed distribution and balanced distribution. But it makes no sense to me to introduce $\hat{W}$ here. We can solely train $W$ since the inference only involves $W$ but $\hat{W}$. Moreover, I notice that the author shows the results in Fig.4 to show the effectiveness of the additional classifier. Can you provide more intuition or explanation about why the additional classifier leads to better performance from a learning perspective?
  3. Why $g_{W^{t-2},c}^{pro}$ is a constant? I think it depends on $W^{t-2}$ and $P^{t-2}$. So I don’t quite get the point why we need to normalize the scale of $g_{W_k^{i-1}}^{bal}$ in Eq.13.
  4. In Eq.9-11, it requires at least one client to have sufficient samples for each class. I doubt the applicability of such a requirement in a realistic scenario. What if the data distribution is a heavy long-tailed distribution, e.g., only a few samples for some classes? In this case, it is very possible that no clients have sufficient samples, which makes their method fail or makes it very hard to tune the threshold $T$. Even though in Fig.3 it seems that the proper choice of $T$ is 2-8, I still think it is too small for sufficient samples and encourage the author to increase $T$ to see whether a larger $T$ can lead to a better performance. Also, when $T=\infty$, no clients have sufficient samples and all the local real data are removed, then how to get the global gradient prototype?
  5. I don't quite understand why Eq.3 is a contradictory target. Because from the formulation of Eq.3, $P, W$ can be achieved to satisfy both $\min L(P,W;\cup_k D_k)$, and $\min L(W;P,D^{bal})$. It is not contradictory based on the math formulation.
