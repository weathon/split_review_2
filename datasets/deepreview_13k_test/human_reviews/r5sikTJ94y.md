- Decision: Reject
- Scores: 5, 5, 5, 6

## Abstract
In-memory computing (IMC) has emerged as a promising solution to address both the computation and data-movement challenges posed by modern AI models. IMC takes advantage of the intrinsic parallelism of memory hardware and performs computation on data in-place directly in the memory array. To do this, IMC typically relies on analog operation, which enables high energy and area efficiency. However, analog operation makes analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) necessary, for converting results back to the digital domain. This introduces an important new source of quantization error, impacting inference accuracy. This paper proposes a Reshape and Adapt for Output Quantization (RAOQ) approach to overcome this issue, which comprises two classes of mechanisms motivated by the fundamental impact and constraints of ADC quantization, including: 1) mitigating ADC quantization error by adjusting the statistics of activations and weights, through an activation-shifting approach (A-shift) and a weight reshaping technique (W-reshape); 2) adapting AI models to better tolerate ADC quantization, through a bit augmentation method (BitAug) to aid SGD-based optimization. RAOQ demonstrates consistently high performance across different scales of neural network models for image classification, object detection, and natural language processing (NLP) tasks at various ADC bit precisions, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy with practical IMC implementations.

### Summary
This paper addresses the issue of accuracy degradation due to ADC quantization in In-Memory Computing (IMC) and proposes a solution called RAOQ. RAOQ introduces three techniques to adjust the statistical properties of weights and activations, as well as to enhance the model optimization process. Firstly, W-reshape adjusts the statistical distribution of the weights to maximize the Signal to Quantization Noise Ratio (SQNR). Secondly, A-shift modifies the range of activation values to minimize the impact of ADC quantization. Lastly, BitAugs leverages ADCs with various bit precisions to improve model optimization. The performance of RAOQ has been evaluated across various datasets, models, and bit precisions, consistently achieving high accuracy.

### Strengths
- This paper attempts to solve an important challenge of ADC precision as ADC complexity becomes a major performance bottleneck for IMC.
 
- This paper assesses the performance of the proposed algorithm across a wide variety of models and tasks to evaluate its generality, demonstrating consistent performance improvements.

### Weaknesses
- Reproducibility issue: the paper discusses ADC quantization error, a new type of error that reflects the non-ideal property of analog signal processing; but modeling such error on DNN training is not trivial. Furthermore, the training procedure includes complex tuning of regularization and augmentation, which would also hinder the reproduction of the claimed benefits. Thus, to reproduce the impact of ADC quantization on the models and the effectiveness of RAOQ, it is desirable to provide a reference code that reveals the error modeling of ADC quantization and the hyper-parameter settings. 

- Lack of fundamental understanding of distribution shifts on SQNR. The authors claim that increasing the variance of W and the 2nd moment of X would improve SQNR. However, there is only limited empirical evidence to support their claims without theoretical justification. Therefore, there are many unanswered questions such as:
1) They ignore the impact of the distribution shift of W and X on quantization errors. 
2) The claim that Var[Y] can be maximized by maximizing Var[W] and E[X^2] is weakly supported.
3) Fig. 3.b shows a compound effect of W-reshape and A-shift, but does not show an individual impact separately.

- The rationale for enhancing performance by adding the loss terms for various bit precisions in BitAug to the original loss and gradient calculations seems insufficiently explained. The authors properly showed the difficulty of fine-tuning with ADC quantization, but there is little justification for why the proposed BitAug helps optimization. 

- The bit precision candidate selection in BitAug is empirical. According to Appendix C, the bit
precision candidate set that shows good performance in MobileNetV2 is applied across all other
networks, including BERT and ResNet

- As the authors admitted, the Kurtosis regularization for weight quantization was already proposed by (Shkolnik et al., 2020) with a similar purpose of flattening weight distribution. Therefore, the novelty of W-reshape is not clear. 

- Not all operations of the model are mapped to IMC. Based on Appendix E, while the research
argues that the operations not mapped to IMC (e.g., the first and last layer in CNN, depth wise
convolution in the MobileNet family, the second matrix matrix multipl ication inside the Multi Head
Attention of BERT) represent a small fraction of the total operations, these operations are typically
located intermittently within models. This may induce overhead (e.g., data transfer latency between
the host and IMC

### Questions
- What is the precision of the short-cut (for ResNet, MobileNet, BERT)? (Since the output of MatMul/Conv is taken to the short-cut in pre-activation residual, ADC quantization would affect short-cut precision as well.)

- Regarding A-Shift, if enlarging E[X^2] is crucial, why don't we shift X more aggressively toward negative? (instead of stopping at zero-center, in Fig. 3.a(bottom))

- For the same ADC bit-precision, how can BitAug adjust the loss surface? (e.g., can you compare loss surface of 6-bit ADC in Fig. 4 without and with BitAug?)

### Summary
The Reshape and Adapt for Output Quantization (RAOQ) is proposed to mitigate the ADC quantization noise in in-memory computing (IMC). The method reshapes the statistics of activations and weights and retrains the networks. It is shown that RAOQ improves the accuracy for various network models for a diverse set of tasks (image classification, object detection, NLP).

### Strengths
1. The proposed method extends previous works on QAT to incorporate output quantization in addition to top of weight and activation quantization. In this way, it 'completes the picture'.
2. Though the work is empirical it is supported by extensive simulation results for a variety of tasks.
3. The paper describes the work clearly.

### Weaknesses
1. Application of this work is limited to in-memory computing. This is a niche area. The work would be more useful if it could be applied to digital computation as well.
2. The paper would be a stronger if it presented itself as an advanced form of QAT, one that includes output quantization.
3. Comparison with multiple QAT approaches is missing. Only one [Bhalgat] is considered.

### Questions
1. Fig. 5 compares energy efficiency of IMC vs. digital accelerators. Was this comparison done at iso-computational or network accuracy, e.g., did both architectures display the same misclassification rate for image classification? 
2. What is the impact of RAOQ on weight and activation sparsity? Does it increase or decrease it or is there no effect? If sparsity is reduced then it will affect complexity reduction techniques that rely on it.
3. What is the training overhead due to RAOQ? For large AI models, even if training is done once or occasionally, it is already complex. RAOQ will make it even more complicated. 
4. Table 1 (main result) is missing error bars. It is hard to say if the results are statistically significant.
5. How does RAOQ perform when subject to out-of-distribution (OOD) samples during inference? This is a very practical problem with BP-based training in general.
6. Table 3 caption has a typo.

### Summary
This paper identifies the challenge of ADC quantization error on deploying deep neural network models on IMC hardwares. The paper proposes three techniques: activation shifting, weight reshaping, and bit-augmentation to resolve the issue.

### Strengths
1. This paper studies a novel problem: ADC quantization error, which has not been studied before
2. The proposed methods are technically sound
3. The paper conduct experiments on different models and tasks to show the effectiveness of the proposed method, and provides ablation study for each technique.

### Weaknesses
1. Though the paper attempts to explain the setting of ADC quantization error in Section 3, there's still someting unclear, which makes me doubt the necessity of some proposed method. See questions below for details.
2. The proposed weight reshaping aims to improve the variance of the weight, but opt to use a complicated 4-th order regularization in Equ. (4). It is unclear why such regularization term is selected, and how is it comparing to regularizing the variance directly. Also the choice of regularization strength may need more study

### Questions
My main question is on the setting of ADC quantization problem. Is the hardware specification known at the training time of the model? If the specification is known, why not directly perform a post-activation shift/scaling before ADC to maximize the usage of ADC bins?

While if the hardware specification is unknown, the proposed method assumes a situation of underflow, but the degree of underflow may be unknown without hardware specification. This will make it hard to decide the regularization strength and shifting beforehand.
