- Decision: Accept
- Scores: 6, 6, 6, 8

## Abstract
Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs) have garnered popularity for data generation across various domains. However, a significant bottleneck is the necessity for whole-network computation during every step of the generative process, leading to high computational overheads. This paper presents a novel framework, Denoising Diffusion Step-aware Models (DDSM), to address this challenge. Unlike conventional approaches, DDSM employs a spectrum of neural networks whose sizes are adapted according to the importance of each generative step, as determined through evolutionary search. This step-wise network variation effectively circumvents redundant computational efforts, particularly in less critical steps, thereby enhancing the efficiency of the diffusion model. 
    Furthermore, the step-aware design can be seamlessly integrated with other efficiency-geared diffusion models such as DDIMs and latent diffusion, thus broadening the scope of computational savings. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that DDSM achieves computational savings of 49\% for CIFAR-10, 61\% for CelebA-HQ, 59\% for LSUN-bedroom, 71\% for AFHQ, and 76\% for ImageNet, all without compromising the generation quality.

### Summary
This paper proposes Denoising Diffusion Step-aware Models (DDSM), which utilize variable-sized neural networks for different steps of the diffusion generative process. The key insight is that diffusion steps have varying importance, so uniformly allocating computational resources is inefficient. The method trains a slimmable UNet that can be flexibly pruned to different capacities. An evolutionary search then determines the optimal per-step network size to balance efficiency and performance. Experiments demonstrate substantial computational savings on CIFAR-10, CelebA-HQ, LSUN-bedroom, AFHQ, and ImageNet versus conventional diffusion models, with minimal quality loss.

### Strengths
- The core ideas are technically sound and offer a unique perspective on accelerating diffusion models.
- Using evolutionary search to determine step-wise network requirements. 
- Compatibility with existing methods like DDIM.

### Weaknesses
- Using a different network at different timestep has been explored before, such as in e-diff-i. 
- The compatibility claims with DDIM and latent diffusion are fairly cursory. More detailed experiments showing accelerated performance combining these methods could better showcase modularity.
- The evolutionary search itself requires non-trivial compute resources. Analysis of the search costs and scalability could be insightful.

### Questions
You claim compatibility with methods like DDIM and latent diffusion, but details are limited. Could you provide in-depth quantitative experiments demonstrating accelerated performance when combining DDSM with these existing diffusion acceleration techniques?

The search cost and scalability of the evolutionary algorithm is unclear. Could you analyze the computational requirements of the search procedure and discuss how it scales with factors like dataset size?

### Summary
This paper...
- proposes to accelerate diffusion sampling by using diffusion models of different size at each time-step,
- proposes to use evolutionary search to find a best step-aware strategy,
- shows the effectiveness of the proposed approach on CIFAR-10, CelebA-HQ, and ImageNet sampling.

### Strengths
- Paper is easy to follow.
- Using networks of different size (slimmable network) for each-time step is an unexplored approach in diffusion acceleration.
- DDSM shows promising performance gains on a variety of generation tasks.

### Weaknesses
While the idea behind DDSM is interesting, I am inclined to give "marginal reject" due to weak experimental validation.

- The paper lacks comparison with [1], which I think is a very relevant work.
- The paper lacks experiments on higher resolution data. Can the authors provide results on $\geq 128$ resolution images?

### Summary
The paper proposes Denoising Diffusion Step-aware Models (DDSM) to improve efficiency of denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs) for image generation. Previously, DDPMs require compute-intensive iterative sampling, using the full model each step. DDSM hypothesizes different steps have varying importance, and uses a spectrum of networks with adapted sizes for each step, determined via evolutionary search. This avoids redundant computation in less critical steps.
DDSM integrates with slimmable networks - trained simultaneously on sub-networks to enable execution at arbitrary sizes.

### Strengths
DDSM accelerates diffusion models by avoiding uniform computation for all steps. The step-aware network design is shown to be efficient and effective across datasets.

### Weaknesses
The major concern is the pathway of denoising acceleration.  It's evident that the prevalent approach to enhancing diffusion speed, in the context of network compression, hinges on the application of post-training quantization techniques. These techniques enable the compression of neural networks in a manner that circumvents additional training [1,2]. However, I observe that your method necessitates training and, notably, falls short in performance when compared to methods that forego training. To illustrate, empirical assessments show that DDSM facilitates computational reductions of 49% for CIFAR-10 and 76% for ImageNet. In contrast, the techniques in [1,2] manage to achieve 4 or 8-bit quantization (surpassing DDSM in speed) without compromising the FID score. It's crucial to underscore that these methods achieve this efficiency entirely without the need for further training. Consequently, the approach employed by DDSM for accelerating denoising doesn't appear to be robust enough.

### Summary
This paper presents a novel approach to accelerating sampling from denoising diffusion models without sacrificing image quality. This approach is based on the idea that not every generation step is equally difficult nor equally important for the quality of the final image. The authors propose using *slimmable networks* to prune the network weights at less-important generation steps, and combine this with an evolutionary search method to identify which steps can be safely pruned without sacrificing image quality. The authors demonstrate that their method reduces the FLOPs required for multiple datasets while achieving comparable or better sample quality (FID) than the unpruned methods, and further show that it can be combined with the adaptive step-skipping of DDIM or with latent diffusion for further improvements. They also visualize the learned pruning schedules for different datasets, and show that the set of safely-prunable generation steps differs depending on dataset structure.

### Strengths
**[S1]** The idea of pruning the network adaptively based on the difficult of each generation step is insightful, and well-motivated by the introduction and the pilot study in section 3.1. This approach also seems quite novel. I'm not aware of any previous work that has considered adaptively using different network sizes at different timesteps.

**[S2]** The authors show that their approach is actually complementary to existing acceleration methods like DDIM, and yields additional improvements when combined. I expect that the approach could also be combined with some of the more recent ODE-based acceleration methods like DPM-Solver, since the proposed DDSM technique is agnostic to the exact mathematical sampling process and instead adaptively shrinks the network itself.

**[S3]** The empirical results are quite strong across multiple datasets. The authors show significant cost savings relative to sampling from the full model, and actually show slight *improvements* in sample quality for all but one of the datasets (LSUN-bedroom takes a small hit).

**[S4]** The approach is easy to understand and seems like it would not be too difficult to implement. The authors also plan to release their code.

**[S5]** I found the results of the pruning schedule search to be quite insightful. Different datasets show different amounts of pruning, and this pruning occurs at different times, which seems to match whether the dataset has more information in its high-frequency or low-frequency components.

### Weaknesses
**[W1]** The approach relies on "slimmable networks" and "slimmable counterparts" of standard convolution and normalization. However, these aren't discussed in much detail. I think the paper could benefit from some additional background on what slimmable networks are and how they work, and more details on the particular slimmable network architecture used for this work. (In particular, how many slimmable switches were used, and how do they fit into the U-Net architecture?)

**[W2]** The objective for the evolutionary search algorithm is also presented at a fairly high level and could use more details. The authors mention using NSGA-II to "balance conflicting objectives", but it's not clear to me what objectives were used. Algorithm 2 suggests that the search objective was a linear combination of FID and FLOPS, but the details of the linear combination weights are not specified.

**[W3]** Although the contributions of this work do seem orthogonal to some of the more recent work in accelerating diffusion model sampling, I think the experimental results would be more impressive if they could also be demonstrated for these more recent accelerated sampling approaches like DPM-Solver, [DPM-Solver++](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.01095) or the recent [UniPC](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.04867). My guess is that the methods could be combined, but it would be useful to see how much FLOPs can be saved when combined with these more recent samplers.

### Questions
Could you provide more details on the slimmable network architecture and on the configuration of the search algorithm, as I discuss in [W1] and [W2]? For the search algorithm, what was the value of $w_M$ used, and how critical is this choice? (Or, are the FID and FLOPs measurements automatically balanced by NGSA-II somehow?)

Figure 4a and Figure A are quite interesting, but they also look somewhat blurry. I can sort of see some fuzzy "bands" at different points of the trajectory; are these actual changes in the slimmed model size or are these some sort of compression artifact in the figure image? Also, what is the resolution of the X axis here, e.g. where are the boundaries between different steps? It's hard to understand exactly what the plot is showing, and I think this plot would be more readable if it were presented as a line graph (instead of as a heatmap), since its only 1 dimensional.

I found some very recent related work ["Structural Pruning for Diffusion Models" (Fang et al. 2023)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.10924) which was just accepted at NeurIPS. That work also considers pruning in order to speed up diffusion model inference, although I believe they only consider pruning the entire network rather than adaptively pruning at different timesteps. It might make sense to discuss this related work in your paper, and I'd also be curious how your approach compares to theirs in terms of FLOPs savings.

Have you explored combining your DDSM approach with some of the more recent accelerated sampling approaches? And do you still observe runtime improvements for those methods?
