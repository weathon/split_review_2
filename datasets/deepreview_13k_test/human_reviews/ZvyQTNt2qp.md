# Provable Convergence of Clipped Normalized-gradient Heavy-Ball Momentum for Adversarial Attacks

- Decision: Reject
- Scores: 5, 5, 5, 5

## Abstract
Gradient-based adversarial attack is dominated by the sign-like regime. Specifically, the sign-momentum MI-FGSM, which is a variant of Polyak's heavy-ball in normalizing each gradient by its $L_1$-norm, has achieved remarkable empirical success. However, the sign operation inevitably loses information about the magnitude as well as the direction of gradient or momentum, leading to non-convergence even in simple convex cases. Gradient clipping is an effective rescaling technique in optimization, and its potential has recently been demonstrated in accelerating and stabilizing the training process for deep learning. In this paper, to circumvent the drawbacks of sign-like gradient-based attacks, we present a clipped momentum method, in which the normalized-gradient heavy-ball momentum (NGM) is clipped as the update direction. By using a new radius-varying clipping rule, the clipped NGM is proved to attain optimal averaging convergence for general constrained convex problems. The experiments demonstrate that it remarkably improves the performance of sign-like methods and verify that the clipping technique can serve as an alternative to the sign operation in adversarial attacks.

### Strengths
1. This paper proposes a clipped normalized-gradient heavy-ball momentum method for generating adversarial examples. 
2. Moreover, the authors also provide the convergence analysis of the proposed algorithm. 
3. Some experimental results show the performance of the proposed method.

### Weaknesses
Although the paper is theoretically and experimental sound, there are still some questions need to be discussed in this paper:
1.	The novelty of this paper is limited. In other words, the main techniques used in this paper include one clipped technique and a heavy-ball momentum acceleration method. However, all the techniques are widely used in previous works. 
2.	The convergence analysis of the proposed algorithm is provided for the constrained convex problem. But in fact, the problem of generating adversarial examples is non-convex. Therefore, the authors should provide the convergence analysis of the proposed algorithm for solving both convex and non-convex optimization problems.
3.	Eq. (15) may be questionable. Note that the clipping operator in Eq. (8) should be element-wise, and thus Eq. (15) includes the element-wise product of two vectors.
4.	The experimental results are not convincing. The authors should compare the proposed algorithm with more recently proposed algorithms.
5.	Both the English language and equations in this paper need to be improved. For instance, what’s the definition of the (L_0, L-1)-smooth function?

2: You are willing to defend your assessment, but it is quite likely that you did not understand the central parts of the submission or that you are unfamiliar with some pieces of related work. Math/other details were not carefully checked.

### Summary
The authors propose a clipped momentum method (clipped NGM), in which the normalized-gradient momentum (NGM) is clipped as its update direction with a radius-varying clipping rule.  They show that the clipped NGM attains its averaging convergence for general
constrained convex problems. Numerical experiments are given to demonstrate the efficiency of the clipped NGM.

### Strengths
Numerical experiments and comparisons with the sign-momentum MI-FGSM are given in some adversarial attack problems.

### Weaknesses
The basic idea of the proposed algorithm, clipped NGM, looks a bit unnatural to me. The authors state that they propose the algorithm based on replacing the sign operator in the sign-momentum algorithm-MIFGSM by a clipping operator. As we all know, in the sign-momentum-based algorithm, using the sign operator, the normalization of the gradient in the momentum update is natural as one would lose the magnitude information once taking the sign operator. For the clipped NGM, it looks like the normalization of the gradient could be unnecessary, as one already has another energy-clipping operator in the iterative updates.  Without considering the normalization gradient step in the momentum updates, the algorithm looks similar to the one studied in (Mai & Johansson, 2021). From this point of view, numerical comparisons with the clipped momentum algorithm by  (Mai & Johansson, 2021) should be better given.

The presentation could be further improved. The introduction of the motivation and the algorithms looks like a composition of pieces of different algorithms in different areas.  

In the introduction of the background of some related algorithms, the authors mention Adam algorithm and say that the drawback of Adam is its non-convergence issue. However, to my best knowledge, Adam indeed can converge in some parameter settings. Besides, Adam is one of the popular algorithms in ML area. However, the authors do not provide any numerical comparisions with Adam algorithm. 

The derived theoretical results are for the convex constraints problems with bounded gradient and domain assumptions, which is a bit restricted in a world filled with non-convex optimization problems.

### Summary
The paper proposes a new adversarial attack algorithm based on gradient clipping, momentum, and normalized gradient. The algorithm is proven to converge and experiments show it has superior performance than existing attack algorithms.

### Strengths
1. The paper extends gradient clipping into the setting of adversarial attack which is a novel contribution.
2. Theoretical analysis is provided for the proposed algorithm to show it is convergent.

### Weaknesses
1. The paper mentioned a few times that signsgd is non-convergent, but did not provide any example of its non-convergent. The claim should be consolidated and more importantly, for the adversarial attack problem. My intuition tells me signsgd might be convergent for adversarial attack problems with box (l1) constraint, it may diverge for l2 constraints.
2. Gradient clipping is shown to accelerate training theoretically in prior works, I missed any solid acceleration discussions in the paper.

### Questions
Could the authors provide some clarifications to the two weaknesses?

### Summary
This paper proposes a method, clipped NGM, to improve the performance of adversarial attack. Intuition, theory, and numerical experiments are provided.

### Strengths
The paper is self-contained, with all intuition, theory, and numerical results included.

### Weaknesses
[1] A literature review is not sufficient. Checking through the reference list, the most recent literature is a paper from ICLR2021. The authors are encouraged to search for papers published in recent three years to highlight the difficulty of the problem and the novelty of their proposed method.

In addition, some literature is missing:

Croce, Francesco, et al. "Robustbench: a standardized adversarial robustness benchmark." arXiv preprint arXiv:2010.09670 (2020).

Croce, Francesco, and Matthias Hein. "Reliable evaluation of adversarial robustness with an ensemble of diverse parameter-free attacks." International conference on machine learning. PMLR, 2020.

Please compare the proposed method with the attack in the above literature. Robustbench is an important leaderboard evaluating the robustness of different training methods in adversarial training.

[2] When describing the results in Figure 3, it is mentioned that "the generated noise in each image is human-imperceptible". However, I think the noise in the proposed method is more obvious than the one from PGD, and such a difference leads to the difference in the attack success rates. Figure 3 is not convincing enough.

The authors may visualize the data under different attacks in their latent space to see whether any attack is easier to detect than others.

[3] The authors need to use different data sets in the experiments, e.g., CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, ImageNet. The current experiments are not sufficient to demonstrate the improvements of the proposed method. The authors may also consider other neural network architectures, e.g., WideResNet models or ViT.

[4] My understanding of the proposed attack method is that it combines attack and some existing optimization methods. In addition, from how the proof is presented in the appendix, the proof follows some routine steps in proving optimization convergence, and the theoretical contribution is also limited. The authors may need to highlight the novelty and emphasize the difficulty or potential challenge when crafting their proposed method. 

[5] The writing needs improvement. For example, the math notations can be improved. An attack algorithm aims to find a perturbation in x, and (9) and (10) are using x. However, in other formulas, the notation w is used. The notation w is often used for model parameters rather than the data x, confusing readers.

Another suggestion is to emphasize the purpose of each paragraph at the beginning of the paragraphs. When reading this paper, sometimes I have to read the whole paragraph, understand the details, and eventually get to know the purpose of the paragraph. Although the paragraphs still contain all the information, reading this paper is tiring.
