- Decision: Accept
- Scores: 6, 6, 5, 6

## Abstract
Label differentially private (label DP) algorithms seek to preserve the privacy of the labels in a training dataset in settings where the features are known to the adversary. In this work, we study a new family of label DP training algorithms. Unlike most prior label DP algorithms that have been based on label randomization, our algorithm naturally leverages the power of the central model of DP. It interleaves gradient projection operations with private stochastic gradient descent steps in order to improve the utility of the trained model while guaranteeing the privacy of the labels. We show that such projection-based algorithms can be made practical and that they improve on the state-of-the art for label DP training in the high-privacy regime. We complement our empirical evaluation with theoretical results shedding light on the efficacy of our method through the lens of bias-variance trade-offs.

### Rating

### Rating Number

### Confidence
3: You are fairly confident in your assessment. It is possible that you did not understand some parts of the submission or that you are unfamiliar with some pieces of related work. Math/other details were not carefully checked.

### Summary
This work considers training under label differential privacy by projecting the DP-SGD gradient onto a gradient subspace that only depends on the features. Experiments show that the algorithm works well in the high privacy regime ($\varepsilon <1$). Theoretical analysis proves convergence in the stochastic convex optimization setting.

### Strengths
1. The idea to project the noisy gradient of DP-SGD onto a smaller subspace is simple and intuitive. 
2. The authors also address practical issues of memory efficiency and stability when calculating projections, which makes the algorithm more practical.
3. The experiment result is encouraging for the high privacy regime ($\varepsilon < 1$)
4. The algorithm has theoretical support which shows that dimension-independent convergence rate can be achieved under stochastic convex optimization.

### Weaknesses
1. The user-level private algorithm only leverages group privacy, which is extremely sub-optimal even in the simple problem of mean estimation. A good user-level private algorithm should go beyond the simple application of group privacy.
2. For $\varepsilon \ge 1$ in Tables 5 and 6, the proposed algorithm underperforms the best baseline by a large margin. In practice, it is still reasonable to use $\varepsilon < 5$, so it would be better if the algorithm could also perform well for moderate level of privacy.

### Questions
1. Could you explain why the proposed algorithm underperforms the best baseline by a large margin when training from scratch for $\varepsilon \ge 1$? 
2. When using pre-trained weights from SSL, the result for $\varepsilon > 1$ is much better. Maybe this is due to a more accurate gradient subspace after SSL pretraining?

### Summary
Paper proposes to use DP-SGD (private features and labels) in a label-only DP setting. It then proposes a way to de-noise DPSGD noisy gradients by projecting them to a convex hull build out of gradients derived only from the features (calculating gradients per existing label class). 

Paper then shows how this de-noising process can be made compatible with privacy amplification by subsampling that is fundamental to utility-privacy trade off in DPSGD.

### Strengths
Paper proposes a novel gradient denoising method in label-only private settings. The proposed algorithm outperforms SOTA in high privacy regime on small public datasets like MNIST and CIFAR-10.

### Weaknesses
The main issue with applied DP is that production use cases really crave performances close to non-private regimes. Label private settings are very important for ads and marketing use cases and accuracy is of utmost value in these settings. Developers will prefer a medium privacy regime with very close to non-private utility compared to a highly private regime with very low utility. 
From the paper results, trends suggest that the proposed algorithm gets inferior to SOTA as epsilon starts to pass 1 which I think is the most important hurdle in using the proposed algorithm in practice.

### Questions
I would like to see results of the proposed algorithm for epsilons between 1 and 10 too (for a fairer comparison and decision making for interested users). 

I would like to see an empirical epsilon study (like the one referenced by authors, e.g. Malek et al. 2021)

I would like to see studies on CIFAR-100 (along with comparison with SOTA)

### Summary
This paper studies the algorithm design for label differential privacy (label-DP), where the labels in the dataset are private and the features are public. Previous label-DP algorithms are in the framework of random label flipping. This paper proposes a novel algorithm which utilizes the framework of DP-SGD. By the empirical evaluation, the proposed algorithm has the advantage over previous algorithms in the high-privacy regime.

### Strengths
1. The clarity is great. The arguments are well-explained and the structure is good.
2. The proposed algorithm is novel. It is different from previous algorithms which are in the framework of label random flipping. It instead utilizes the DP-SGD framework.
3. It derives the theoretical utility-privacy trade-off for DP convex optimization and compares this trade-off among different versions of their algorithm.
4. The proposed methods and baselines are evaluated on both the image benchmark and the Criteo dataset.

### Weaknesses
Both the proposed method and baseline numbers in the experiment can be potentially better. As they might be underestimated, the current comparison could be inaccurate, which is the main evaluation to illustrate the advantage of the proposed algorithm.
- The pure DP-SGD can be much better, which can potentially bring benefits for the proposed algorithm. For example, De et al., 2022 empirically show that DP-SGD can achieve 56.8% accuracy on CIFAR10 when $\varepsilon=1.0$, while the number reported in the paper is only 43.5%.
- ALIBI's accuracy on CIFAR-10 is reported as 51.3 when $\varepsilon=1.0$ in Table 5 in the paper, while in the original paper (Malek et al. (2021)) ALIBI achieves 71% when $\varepsilon=1.0$.
- When leveraging self-supervised learning with LabelDP, PATE-FM doesn't utilize the SelfSL on CIFAR-10, which seems a little unfair. It is reasonable to at least utilize a pretrained feature extractor as an initialization instead of random initialization when training teachers in PATE-FM. In this way, PATE-FM leveraging SelfSL is expected to have better accuracy.

Moreover, DP-SGD with gradient projection actually has been investigated for a while [1, 2] and not introduced in the paper. Although I still agree with the novelty of the proposed method given that all previous labelDP algorithms are based on label flipping, it might be worthwhile to see the difference and comparison between the proposed method and the methods in the literature.

### Summary
This paper introduces a cute idea -- leveraging the feature vectors (which are non-private under label DP) to construct a prior, which helps to reduce the noise required for label DP. To this end, this paper considers label-DP in the central model rather than the previous local model. Some theoretical results and experimental results are provided.

### Strengths
1. The idea of leveraging feature vectors to boost the performance under the label DP is cute.
2. A good balance between theory and experimental results, which is a good fit for ICLR.

### Weaknesses
I think the comparisons in the theoretical part need to be clear, i.e., what's the exact gain of the proposed method?

### Questions
I think this paper introduces some nice ideas and I also enjoyed reading this paper. 

I have some clarification questions so as to ensure I did not miss something. 

1. [Regarding the subtlety of privacy analysis of SELFSPAN]. If I understand it correctly, the problem is that even though the additional projection step does not touch sensitive data (labels) in this case, one cannot directly use post-processing. This is because the projection will leak the index of the sampling result, which then impacts the privacy amplification by subsampling in the original DP-SGD. Due to this, when using SELFSPAN, one cannot enjoy the gain/benefit of subsampling. On the other hand, since it does not touch labels, one can still use post-processing over the **non-subsampling** version of DP-SGD?

2. [Regarding the improvement over DP-SGD] It seems to me that the main gain over DP-SGD is the improvement over dimension d? It might be better to give more discussions on Table 4, as there are different choices of \sigma. Being more specific or using more particular values will be better I think. 

3. [Confusion about the section name] For Section 4, the authors use SCO, which gives readers the impression that the goal is somehow the population excess loss. However, it turns out the authors are actually analyzing ERM. It might be better to replace the section name.
