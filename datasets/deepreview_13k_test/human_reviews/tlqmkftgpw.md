## Abstract
Estimating the individual-level continuous treatment effect holds significant practical importance in various decision-making domains, such as personalized healthcare and customized marketing. However, current methods for individual treatment effect estimation are limited to discrete treatments or rely on a simplistic approach of balancing the entire representation, which may lead to inaccurate estimation. To the best of our knowledge, no existing efforts is capable of precisely adjusting for selection bias in continuous settings. Hence, in this paper, we propose a novel Disentangled and Balanced Representation Network (DBRNet) for estimating the individualized dose-response function (IDRF), which learns disentangled representations and precisely adjusts for selection bias. Extensive results on synthetic and semi-synthetic datasets demonstrate that our DBRNet outperforms most state-of-the-art methods. Our code is avaiable at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/DBRNet_final_2-2B76.

### Summary
This paper aims to estimate the individual treatment effect (ITE) under continuous treatment setting. The authors claim that the latent covariates can be divided into three different kinds of variables, i.e., instrumental variable, confounder and adjustment variable, and the representations of confounders should be balanced across treatments.
The proposed DBRNet can address the above issues under theoretical guarantees. Extensive experiments are conducted to verify the effectiveness of DBRNet.

### Strengths
1.	The paper has a clear goal to estimate individual treatment effects in a continuous treatment setting.
2.	The paper introduces DBRNet as a solution to tackle the estimation challenges, and it comes with theoretical guarantees, indicating that it's a reliable approach.
3.	The paper conducts extensive experiments to show that DBRNet works effectively in practice.

### Weaknesses
1.	The motivation of this paper is convincing but lacks innovation because neither the disentangled representation nor the re-weighting technique is originally proposed in this paper. I hope the authors can provide deeper insights into why disentangled covariates should be considered in the context of continuous treatment settings.
2.	In equation (5), why isn't there an enforcement of the discrepancy between the adjustment variable and the treatment variable? This point should be clarified.
3.	In the experimental setting, it would be beneficial to compare the proposed method with more disentanglement-based baselines, such as DR-CFR[1] and DeR-CFR[2].

### Summary
This paper has proposed DBRNet, which learns disentangled and balanced representations for continuous treatment effect estimation at the individual level. DBRNet is the first model that could adjust for selection bias in continuous treatment settings.

### Strengths
1. This paper is well-motivated, "how to adjust for selection bias in continuous treatment settings" is an important research problem that existing works haven't solved.

2. This paper is well-organized, it is easy to get the main ideas for readers.

### Weaknesses
1. The proposed method relies heavily on the causal graph shown in Figure 1(a). However, the authors haven't provided a sufficient explanation for the soundness of this causal graph. The authors should at least provide several specific examples (such as Johansson et al., 2016) about what $\Gamma, \Delta, \Upsilon$ respectively represents. 

2. In Section 3.2, the authors formulate the loss function of their proposed DBRNet, it is too sophisticated and contains too many hyper-parameters. As the authors claimed, the discrepancy loss encourages $\Gamma, \Delta, \Upsilon$ to be independent of each other, and the independent loss encourages $\Upsilon, T$ to be independent of each other. However, based on the causal graph shown in Figure 1, why not DBRNet contain another term to encourage $\Gamma, Y$ to be independent of each other given $T, \Delta$? Besides, there are some questions about the soundness of the discrepancy loss and independent loss, please see Questions.

3. It seems that the theoretical results only focus on factual loss, so there exists a remarkable gap between the sophisticated loss function and the theoretical analysis.

4. I'm happy that the authors have performed sensitivity analysis w.r.t. $\alpha, \beta$, so why not perform that w.r.t. $\gamma, \lambda$?

### Questions
Discrepancy loss minimizes KL divergence between $\Gamma(x_i)$ and $\Delta(x_i)$ and the authors claimed that if $\Gamma(x_i)$ and $\Delta(x_i)$ are independent of each other, the KL divergence is 1. First, considering $x_i$ is a realization of the random variable X (rather than a random variable), what does "$\Gamma(x_i)$ and $\Delta(x_i)$ are independent of each other" mean? Second, in my experience, KL Divergence can only measure the similarity between two distributions but not the independence of two random variables. The similar question also exists for independence loss. If I'm wrong, please provide some references.

### Summary
This paper aims at estimating individual-level continuous treatment effects, a crucial aspect in fields like personalized healthcare and customized marketing. It extends existing work and tries to address the limitations of existing methods that focus on discrete treatments via important reweighting. Extensive experiments on synthetic and semi-synthetic datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

### Strengths
1. Attempting to Tackle a Challenging Problem: The paper targets a crucial area in the field of causal inference, specifically the estimation of individual-level continuous treatment effects.  
2. Theoretical Analysis: The authors provide theoretical analysis to support the effectiveness of the debiasing process employed in DBRNet.

### Weaknesses
1. **Proof of Major Results (Equation 9)**: 
   - In the proof citing the law of total probability, it seems to assume binary treatment. This appears inconsistent with the claim that the method is capable of handling continuous treatments. 

2. **Self-Containment and Clarity**:
   - The process of identifying and estimating the counterfactual distribution $p(x, t')$ from observed data, especially when $t'$ is a continuous variable, is not sufficiently detailed. More explicit steps or examples would greatly benefit readers in understanding this crucial aspect of the proposed methodology.
   - The authors use the independent loss for disentanglement. It's important to note that this doesn't necessarily imply full identifiability of the real underlying causal factors. Given the known challenges in achieving full identifiability in nonlinear independent component analysis (up to a component linear transformation), it would be helpful to discuss this limitation and its effect in the paper. A more rigorous proof or argument regarding the identifiability and independence of representations in the model would be beneficial.

### Questions
- Could the authors elaborate on how the law of total probability is applied in Equation 9, particularly in continuous treatments, to align with the method's main contribution?
- How exactly is the counterfactual distribution $p(x, t')$ identified and estimated from observed data when dealing with continuous treatments? Could the authors provide more detailed explanations or examples in this regard?
- Given the challenges in achieving full identifiability in nonlinear independent component analysis, could you discuss how the authors' approach counters this issue? What is the influence of not achieving full identifiability with the proposed methods?
- Could the authors provide rigorous proof or detailed argument to support the claim of independence and identifiability in the proposed model's representations?
- What does the $\gamma$ symbolize in Figure 3? What does TR mean in Table 1?
- Could the authors further explain the specific techniques or methods leveraged in the paper to handle continuous variables compared to Hassanpour and Greiner [2019b]?

### Summary
The paper proposes DBRNet, a neural method leveraging disentangled representations representing different underlying latent variables (adjustment factors, instrumental variables, confounding variables)  to estimate the individualized dose-response curve. For this, they adapt the method of [1] to the setting of continuous treatments leveraging parts of the work from [2]. The paper further introduces an additional discrepancy loss term. Finally, the method is evaluated on existing synthetic and semi-synthetic datasets used by previous works.

### Strengths
1. IDRF estimation is an important topic, especially in domains such as medicine.
2. The main contribution of the paper (disentangling latent factors for continuous treatment setting) is well motivated and easy to understand.

### Weaknesses
In general, there are multiple points in the evaluation of the paper which seem problematic or unclear to me:
1. The paper is mainly motivated by learning the **individualized** dose response function. This is a different task than learning the **average** dose response function. Hence, the main metric for evaluation should be the MISE and not the AMSE (even though it is a nice add-on but not necessary). Thus, the MISE should also be the displayed metric e.g., in Fig. 3 and Table 3, and the main interpretation of the results should focus on the MISE. 
2. My understanding is that the MISE is not properly implemented (see also code). The paper approximates the integral over the treatments in the MISE by averaging over the existing treatments in the datasets $t \in \mathcal{T}$. However, since the datasets are biased with respect to the treatment assignment, this may yield biased estimates of the MISE. Instead one could use Romberg integration (as in [3]) are just simply use at least equally spaced points in $\mathcal{T}$
3. The sensitivity analysis in Fig. 3 states in the description: “ Sensitivity analysis with different values of $\alpha, \beta$”, but the axis of the plots are $\beta$ value and $\gamma$ value which is confusing. Also, the plots for $\beta$ and $\gamma$ do not show clear performance gains outside of the standard deviation bounds. This may indicate that the (quite substantial) performance gains reported in Table 2 are not significant because of the high variance of the method, or may be quite prone to hyperparameter tuning and model selection. Clarification here would be much appreciated.
4. The paper argues that existing methods using selection bias adjustment “fail to accurately adjust for selection bias, as they do not make any adjustments to eliminate the bias, or resort to a simple and sophisticated approach to balance the entire representation.” While there is work on binary treatments showing this, it is important to benchmark against such methods in a continuous setting to support this argument, e.g., using the balancing applied in [4] as a baseline.
5. The theory is primarily around re-weighting and not balancing. 

Minor: There are a many spacing issues with missing spaces around references.

### Questions
1. I assume the “_TR” in the baseline methods refers to targeted regularization. However, TR is designed for ATE / ADRF estimation. Motivation about why these baselines are included (and still oftentimes outperform methods without TR even in MISE) would be appreciated.
2. Why is alpha not included in the ablation studies? Its contribution could also be interesting, especially since only a very simplified density estimator is used and it could show if this still leads to performance gains.
3. The discrepancy loss in Eq (5.) leverages KL divergence between representations. However, as I understand, the learned representations are not probabilistic so how is the KL divergence approximated which is defined as a measure between two probability distributions? Also, if there are some implicit assumptions here which are necessary to ensure statistical independence between the representations they should be stated.

### Summary
In this paper, authors have studied the continous treatment effect estimation problem and proposed a novel disentangled and balanced representation network (DBRNet) for estimating the individualized dose-response function (IDRF) that precisely balances the confounders. DBRNet learns disentangled representations using a loss term based on Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between latent factors and imbalance loss term. Moreover, selection bias is addressed by using inverse propensity score based weighting to the factual loss term. They used synthetic and two semi-synthetic datasets to evaluate the model against the existing techniques.

### Strengths
- This is a novel method for continuous treatment setting which combines two ideas of disentanglement and weighting, and I find that as sufficient novelty. In fact, they extended Hassanpour and Greiner [2019b] paper from discrete to continuous setting. Authors also claim this to be first work that precisely balances the confounders for the continuous treatments.
- Overall, clearly written and well-organized.   
It was easy to follow. Introduction clearly presents the problem and motivations for the work, and related work puts the work in context, and presents the literature gap. Similarly, methdology is also presented with sufficient details.
- Sufficient experiments with detailed ablation study to prove the effficacy of the method as well as different components of the idea. Paper clearly formulates the research questions and provide empirical evidence for each.
- Paper provides theoretical substantiation that the devised re-weighting function is able to precisely adjust for selection bias.

### Weaknesses
**NOTE:** I reviewed this work earlier as part of NeurIPS. I can notice the changes authors have done to the paper.   

However, it is not clear if authors have addressed my concern about under-training/over-training due to training all algorithms for fixed 800 epochs (and not using something like early stopping).

### Questions
Can you confirm if you have addressed the under-training/over-training issued caused by training for fixed 800 epochs?
