## Abstract
Hard-thresholding is an important type of algorithm in machine learning that is used to solve $\ell_0$ constrained optimization problems. However,  the true gradient of the objective function can be difficult to access in certain scenarios, which normally can be approximated by zeroth-order (ZO) methods. SZOHT algorithm is the only algorithm tackling $\ell_0$ sparsity constraints with zeroth-order gradients so far. Unfortunately,  SZOHT  has a notable limitation on the number of random directions due to the inherent conflict between the deviation of ZO gradients and the expansivity of the hard-thresholding operator. 
This paper approaches this problem by considering the role of variance and provides a new insight into variance reduction: mitigating the unique conflicts between ZO gradients and hard-thresholding.  Under this perspective, we propose a generalized variance reduced ZO hard-thresholding algorithm as well as the generalized convergence analysis under standard assumptions. The theoretical results demonstrate the new algorithm eliminates the restrictions on the number of random directions, leading to improved convergence rates and broader applicability compared with SZOHT.  Finally, we illustrate the utility of our method on a portfolio optimization problem as well as black-box adversarial attacks.

### Summary
This paper  provides a new insight into variance reduction: mitigating the unique conflicts between ZO gradients and hard-thresholding.

The theoretical results demonstrate the new algorithm eliminates the restrictions on the number of random directions, leading to improved convergence rates and broader applicability compared with SZOHT.

### Strengths
The theoretical results demonstrate the new algorithm eliminates the restrictions on the number of random directions, leading to improved convergence rates and broader applicability compared with SZOHT.

### Weaknesses
Typo:
It should be $\| \nabla f_i(\theta) - \nabla f_i(\theta') \| \leq \rho_s^+ \|\theta - \theta'\|$ in the Assumption 2.

### Questions
Since the Problem (1) is NP-complete, what  is $\theta^*$ in the convergence analysis? If $\theta^*$ is the optimal point of Problem (1), why can the proposed algorithm can achieve a  linear convergence rate which means it is a polynomial time algorithm that can solve a NP-complete problem?

### Summary
The paper presents a new algorithm for solving sparse learning problems in machine learning. By incorporating variance reduction techniques, the algorithm improves convergence rates and expands its applicability. It offers a solution to conflicts between zeroth-order gradients and hard-thresholding and provides a general analysis framework. Overall, the paper contributes an efficient and effective approach for sparse learning.

### Strengths
1. This paper introduces an interesting perspective, i.e., variance reduction, to improve existing zeroth-order hard-thresholding algorithms.
2. This paper has provided sound theoretical analysis for the newly proposed algorithm.

### Weaknesses
1. There are many symbol error as well as misleading notations in the paper, which requires further correction. E.g., the $k^*$ should be s in Assumption 1; no introduction of $\mu$ in eq. 3; no explanation for $H_{2k}$ in page 3 when it appears at the first time; what's the meaning of J in page 5? how to get the i in page 5? and so on. This will make it hard for readers to understand the paper.
2. More details and discussion for experiment section, e.g., the explanation on IZO and NHT in Fig.2,3, how to tell VR-SZHT is better in Table 1?
3. More experiments may do a better job in supporting the advantages of the VR-SZHT algorithm. Currently, VR-SZHT seems to be even worse than baselines in some cases, e.g., Fig. 3.

PS: it's really hard for reviewers to point out which equation when there is no equation number!

### Questions
1. Could the authors elaborate more on what's the conflict between the expansionary of hard-theresholding and ZO error about? And how it affects the performance of zeroth-order hard-thresholding algorithms?

### Summary
This paper first proposes a general convergence analysis on stochastic zeroth-order hard-thresholding algorithms with variance. Based on the theoretical analysis, this paper further proposes a generalized variance reduced zeroth-order hard-thresholding algorithm. Theoretical results demonstrate the new algorithm has improved convergence rates and broader applicability compared with existing methods by eliminating the restrictions on the number of random directions. Experiments on both ridge regression and black-box adversarial attack demonstrate the effectiveness of proposed method.

### Strengths
The idea of combining variance reduction with zeroth-order hard-thresholding methods should be novel

### Weaknesses
- The proposed method is not clearly introduced and has many confusing points. 
- Experiments is not very supportive for the proposed method, details can be found in Questions part

### Questions
- My first concern is on the usefulness of zeroth-order oracles. From experiments in this paper, it seems that we have easy access to gradient information in all these applications. Therefore, why do we need to emphasize zeroth-order algorithms? The authors may consider some other applications where gradient information is hard to obtain. 
- Another concern is on the setting of L0 regularization. While there exist many other approaches on obtaining sparse solutions (e.g., LASSO), the authors may need to justify the necessity of using L0 regularization here.  
- I am a bit confused on the key contribution of this work. The authors introduced two algorithms, pM-SZHT and VR-SZHT. What is the key difference of these two algorithms? Moreover, pM-SZHT is not compared in experiments, but SARAH/SAGA-SZHT is compared. This is also very confusing and may need some explanations. 
- It seems that SAGA-SZHT is missing in both the main text and appendix. Given its good performance in Table 1, I am a bit confused on why it is not properly introduced. Are there some errors? 
- Regarding experimental results, I am a bit confused by Figure 3. It seems that SZOHT converges faster than all other methods, but gradually becomes worse with more iterations. Some explanations may be needed here on why we need so many iterations after convergence. 
- Also, the evaluation of few-pixels universal adversarial attacks may seem a bit restricted with only 10 images from the same class. It would be better if the authors can use more images from different classes to further justify the effectiveness of proposed method.

### Summary
The paper introduces a new algorithm for solving $\ell_0$ constrained optimization problems using zeroth-order (ZO) gradients, specifically targeting the limitations of the SZOHT algorithm, which is currently the only algorithm addressing this problem. The main limitation of SZOHT is the conflict between ZO gradients and the expansivity of the hard-thresholding operator, which restricts the number of random directions. The proposed algorithm takes a novel perspective by considering the role of variance and introduces a generalized variance-reduced ZO hard-thresholding algorithm. The paper provides theoretical analysis and demonstrates that the new algorithm overcomes the limitations of SZOHT, resulting in improved convergence rates and broader applicability. The utility of the proposed method is illustrated through experiments on a ridge regression problem and black-box adversarial attacks.

### Strengths
1. The paper presents a well-motivated and principled approach to resolving conflicts between zeroth-order methods and hard thresholding. The authors offer a fresh perspective on the problem, providing innovative insights and potential solutions.
2. The paper introduces a comprehensive analysis framework that evaluates the performance and behavior of variance-reduced algorithms under the $\ell_0$-constraint and zeroth-order gradient settings.
3. The paper includes rigorous theoretical analysis, establishing a solid foundation for the proposed algorithm. The theoretical justifications and proofs contribute to the robustness of the research and build confidence in its practical applicability. Additionally, the paper demonstrates the versatility of the proposed method through applications in ridge regression and black-box adversarial attacks, highlighting its real-world relevance and effectiveness.

### Weaknesses
1. The paper lacks a proper related work section, which makes it challenging for readers to quickly grasp the background and understand the previous works. It is crucial to include a comprehensive discussion on related works, especially regarding the variance-reduced ZO hard-thresholding algorithm and the variance reduction aspect.
2. The paper suffers from a lack of necessary references, such as papers on SAGA, SARAH, and SVRG methods. When these methods are initially mentioned, it is essential to provide corresponding references. Additionally, there are errors in the appendix due to bibtex errors, which should be carefully reviewed and corrected.
3. The presentation of baselines and experimental settings in the main text is not well-organized. It is recommended to reorganize this information to improve clarity, especially for readers who are unfamiliar with the baselines and adversarial attacks. Providing a cross-reference to the appendix can also help readers gain a better understanding.
4. The introduction of SAGA-SZHT is missing from the paper, and it cannot be found. It is necessary to either locate the missing information or add it during the rebuttal phase.
5. The authors propose three variants of VR-SZHT by utilizing SVRG, SARAH, and SAGA. It would be beneficial to summarize the advantages of each method in terms of memory storage and convergence rate, similar to what is found in the variance-reduction literature. Providing tables or summaries can help readers compare and understand the individual strengths of these methods.
6. It is well-known that variance-reduction methods can improve the convergence rate of SGD from sublinear to linear under strongly convex and smoothness conditions. It would be interesting to clarify whether VR-SZHT exhibits a similar improvement compared to SZOHT. If there are notable differences, the authors should provide explanations or insights into the reasons behind these variations.
7. I am curious to know if there are any additional technical challenges when integrating VR methods into SZOHT and proving the convergence rate, compared to applying VR methods to traditional finite-sum tasks. The response to this question will not impact my final evaluation of the paper's novelty. However, it will help me gain a better understanding of the paper's correctness and soundness.

### Questions
Please refer to the weakness section for detailed feedback. Overall, I appreciate the paper for its natural motivation and principled solutions. However, there are several issues with the presentation that need to be addressed. During the rebuttal phase, I encourage the authors to resolve the mentioned concerns or correct any misunderstandings I may have. I suggest that the authors respond to my questions in multiple phases if they need much time to solve all the issues, allowing for further clarification if needed. For instance, it would be helpful to begin with the related works section and provide the algorithm for SAGA-SZHT as a priority. One suggestion is for the authors to incorporate the appendix into the current PDF version of the paper. This would enhance convenience for reviewers, allowing them to access all relevant information in a single document.

Based on the current version of the paper, I have given it a borderline score. However, I will reconsider my evaluation based on the authors' responses during the rebuttal phase. I would like to defend my positive attitude towards the paper if my concerns and issues are effectively addressed.

### Summary
This paper studies efficient zeroth order (ZO) algorithms for solving $\ell_0$-constrained optimization problems. While existing approach alternate between gradient descent and hard thresholding, it only works well in restricted settings. This paper makes the novel observation that large variance  of gradient estimation would result in conflict between ZO gradient and expansity of hard-thresholding operators. To resolve this issue, the authors prodive a variance reduced ZO hard-thresholding algorithm, and theoretically demonstrate that the variance-reduced algorithm is guaranteed to converge under standard assumptions and eliminates the requirement of the random direction sampled. Finally, the authors demonstrate the superiority of their algorithm by solving portfolio and adversatial attacks.

### Strengths
1) Both the algorithm and the analysis presented in this paper seem novel. Notably, the role of variance discovered by this paper is found by establish a new descent inequality (Theorem 1), and based on this discovery a variance reduced algorithm is introduced.

2) The paper is in general well-written and not hard to read. The authors introduce necessary background of ZO in the introduction section and also discuss previous works, making it easier to understand the contribution of this paper.

3) Besides sound theoretical results, extensive experiments are also conducted to verifty the efficiency of the proposed algorithm.

### Weaknesses
1) Some quantities seem to be used before being defined: $k*$ and $\kappa$ in Sec. 2.2, $\hat{g}_I^{(r)}$ in Theorem 1.

2) In the experiments, I think the authors can add more comparison on computational cost and also comparisons with first-order methods or other methods as well, to highlight the benefits of using zeroth order optimization. I'm not an expert in zeroth order optimization, so I think adding such comparisons could make your results more convincing.

### Questions
The paper [1] considers a stochastic optimization setting while the current paper studies finite-sum optimization. Can there be a way to reduce the variance for [1]'s setting?
