- Decision: Accept
- Scores: 5, 6, 6, 6

## Abstract
While diffusion models have revolutionized generative AI, their application to human sketch generation, especially in the creation of complex yet concise and recognizable sketches, remains largely unexplored. Existing efforts have primarily focused on vector-based sketches, limiting their ability to handle intricate sketch data. This paper introduces an innovative extension of diffusion models to pixellevel sketch generation, addressing the challenge of dynamically optimizing the guidance scale for classifier-guided diffusion. Our approach achieves a delicate balance between recognizability and complexity in generated sketches through scale-adaptive classifier-guided diffusion models, a scaling indicator, and the concept of a residual sketch. We also propose a three-phase sampling strategy to enhance sketch diversity and quality. Experiments on the QuickDraw dataset showcase the potential of diffusion models to push the boundaries of sketch generation, particularly in complex scenarios unattainable by vector-based methods.

### Summary
The paper presents a method for class-guided sketch synthesis. The base model is an unconditional DDIM model operating in pixel space. During testing, the method uses classifier guidance to generate class-guided sketches. Naively using the same scale for all the time steps often produces low-fidelity or over-sketching samples. To address this issue, the paper proposes the scaling indicator which is computed based on stroke complexity and recognizability. At each sampling step, the classifier guidance scale is adaptively optimized to match the residual sketch with the scaling indicator. All the experiments are done on the QuickDraw dataset.

### Strengths
- The results are good qualitatively.
- The idea of adaptive scale optimization is interesting.
- The paper reads well and is easy to follow.

### Weaknesses
The validation of the idea is lacking:
- The comparison with classifier-free guidance is missing.
- In Table 1, what's the classifier guidance scale of DDIM? To validate the idea, it will be good to sweep over all possible classifier guidance scales and show that the proposed method works better than any constant guidance scale.
- Why not just replace the classifier score in Equation-1 with the scaling indicator? In this case, the residual sketch and scale optimization are not needed anymore.

### Questions
What's the effect of \alpha and \beta?

### Summary
This paper divides the diffusion denoising process into three phases. The first and the last phases are unconditional generation, the middle phase is conditioned on the classifier guidance. For the middle phase, this paper proposes an extension block for classifier-guided diffusion models to perform scale adaptive classifier-guided sampling on the task of pixel-level sketch generation, addressing the challenge of dynamically optimizing the guidance scale for classifier-guided diffusion. This method achieves a balance between "recognizability" and "complexity" in the generated sketches. Experiments are on the QuickDraw dataset.

### Strengths
1. The three-phase sampling strategy can maintain sketch diversity and quality.

2. The idea of dynamically optimizing the guidance scale is reasonable and prospective.

3. Overall, the presentation and writing are easy to follow, and the experiment is detailed.

### Weaknesses
1. The main weakness is that the proposed block is specialized for classifier-guided diffusion. However, classifier-guided diffusion models are not as popular and powerful as those multimodal diffusion models using cross-attention. This limits the impact and universality of the proposed block.

2. The idea of scale adaptive classifier-guided sampling is sound and this method achieves a balance between "recognizability" and "complexity". However, this also fixes the "recognizability" and "complexity" of the results. I mean, in classifier-guided diffusion models, users can adjust the guidance scale to trade off diversity for fidelity. But the proposed adaptive method can not.

3. The implementation details are naive such as the complexity c(x0|t) using $L_0$ norm, and the determination equotion for $t_w$ and $t_d$.

### Questions
1. I wonder whether the SGD process employed to obtain the optimal value of guidance scale s at each timestep t by minimizing Lt(s) is convergent. There is no further exploration.

2. Also about the SGD process. In equation 4,"N is the number of sketches generated within a sampling batch". But why should the sketches in the same batch share the same guidance scale $s$? I mean, $s$ should be independent for each sketch in one batch.

3. About the optimization objective Lt(s), which is "intuitive" but not from mathematical proof. This optimization objective seems questionable. 

4. How to you determine the parameters α = 1.0, β = 0.2, and $\gamma$ = 0.02?

### Summary
This paper proposes a novel sketch generation method based on classifier-guided diffusion models. Specifically, the authors propose a scale-adaptive classifier-guided diffusion model, which achieves a delicate balance between recognizability and complexity in generated sketches. In addition, the authors also propose a three-phase sampling strategy to enhance sketch diversity and quality.

### Strengths
+ The authors analyze the impact of guidance scale on diffusion-based sketch generation tasks and propose a scale adaptive classifier-guided sampling method to achieve a delicate balance between recognizability and complexity in generated sketches.
+ The authors point out the impact of unconditional guidance and classifier guidance on generating sketches in diffusion models and propose a three-phase sampling strategy.
+ Quantitative and qualitative experiments have shown that the proposed method outperforms existing sketch generation methods.

### Weaknesses
+ From Figure 2 and Section 4.1, we can see that the input of the sketch classifier is a clean sketch estimated from noisy images. However, the author mentioned in Section 4.1 that the classifier is trained by using noisy sketches, which is obviously contradictory.

+ From Table 2, we can see that using unconditional guidance can increase the diversity of generated sketches. However, from Figure 5, it can be seen that under the same random seeds, the images generated by different categories during the warm-up sampling stage are the same, and some strokes will remain in the final generation result. Therefore, it remains to be discussed whether the warm-up sampling is truly effective for sketch generation tasks.

### Questions
The default size of the produced sketches is set to 64×64. Can this method still generate sketches well at higher resolutions?

### Summary
The authors proposed a strategy to dynamically change the scale of classifier-guidance during the reverse diffusion process for the generation of pixel-based sketches. For this purpose, they empirically designed a scaling indicator and a residual sketch to achieve the optimal guidance scale needed at the current diffusion stage. The scaling indicator is to assess the recognizability and complexity of current generative results. The residual sketch x_rs (x_t, s) is to evaluate the extent to which the guidance scale s will impact the generative process. The guidance scale s is optimized to enforce the residual sketch to be synchronized with the scale indicator. Moreover, they adopted a three-phase sampling strategy to enhance the sketch diversity and quality. Experiments demonstrated the superiority of their approach in the realm of sketch generation.

### Strengths
1. The proposal of scaling indicator and residual sketch is novel and can conduct an effective scale adaptive classifier-guided diffusion process.
2. The experimental part is convincing, and includes both quantitative and qualitative results. And the ablation study shows the effectiveness of their methods.
3. The organization of this paper is clear and easy to understand.

### Weaknesses
1. The scale adaptive classifier-guided diffusion process seems useful and attractive, however, the scaling indicator and residual sketch are proposed mainly based on their experience in the field of sketch generation. In my opinion, it may rely on the simple structure of sketch. I wonder if similar methods can be applied to other data modalities, such as natural images.
2. Equation 4 appears to be dubious. I understand the point that the residual sketch should be synchronized with the scale indicator. However, are they on the same numerical scale and is it appropriate to directly apply mean squared error for optimization? I believe that a more rigorous discussion or proof is needed based on their definitions (Formula 2 and 3).
3. The contribution “three-phase sampling strategy” has been proven to be effective but it is merely a simple technique for diffusion process and the innovation may be limited.
4. Using the fraction of stroke pixels to the whole canvas to evaluate the sketch complexity is oversimplified.

### Questions
1. The authors mentioned that vector-base approaches are inherently limited when tackling intricate and complex sketches. I would like to understand why pixel-based methods have an advantage over vector-based methods? I hope the authors can provide some intuitive explanations.
2. In Section 2, the authors claimed that an additional property of pixel-based diffusion modeling is classifier gradient can be used as guidance. So are there any obstacles to using classifier-guidance for vector-based diffusion? It also seems feasible in principle.
3. In Equ 2, are the settings of the three hyperparameters obtained through experiments or are there some empirical principles?
4. In Equ. 4, why do different images in the same batch share the same scale?
