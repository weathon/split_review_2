- Decision: Accept
- Scores: 6, 6, 6

## Abstract
Multivariate time series forecasting plays an important role in various applications ranging from meteorology study, traffic management to economics planning. In the past decades, many efforts have been made toward accurate and reliable forecasting methods development under the assumption of intact input data. However, the time series data from real-world scenarios is often partially observed due to device malfunction or costly data acquisition, which can seriously impede the performance of the existing approaches. A naive employment of imputation methods unavoidably involves error accumulation and leads to suboptimal solutions. Motivated by this, we propose a Biased Temporal Convolution Graph Network that jointly captures the temporal dependencies and spatial structure. In particular, we inject bias into the two carefully developed modules, the Multi-Scale Instance PartialTCN and Biased GCN, to account for missing patterns. The experimental results show that our proposed model is able to achieve up to $9.93$\% improvements over the existing methods on five real-world benchmark datasets. Our code is available at: https://github.com/chenxiaodanhit/BiTGraph.

### Rating

### Rating Number

### Confidence
3: You are fairly confident in your assessment. It is possible that you did not understand some parts of the submission or that you are unfamiliar with some pieces of related work. Math/other details were not carefully checked.

### Summary
The paper presented a multivariate time series forecasting model that applies temporal convolution and graph convolution. Such model is shown to handle missing values in inputs without additional pre-processing effort and outperforms the tested approaches.

### Strengths
The idea of introducing masked temporal convolution from vision tasks to time series is quite interesting and novel. 
The paper conducted intensive experiments including comparison against multiple methods and ablation studies.
The paper is well written in the technical details.

### Weaknesses
The experiment setup is not clear to me whether it's sound.
Specifically, (1) It is not clear what loss function is used in both the proposed method and the tested methods. The paper compared MAE, MAPE and RMSE; it's the authors' choice what loss function to be used. Hence, if the task is to optimize for RMSE, the loss function for all the tested methods should be RMSE because the output would be the optimal mean estimator. Without such clarity, it's hard to derive where the accuracy difference comes from; is it from the matching loss function and evaluation metric, or is it from architecture innovation?
(2) for MAE and MAPE, both are the evaluation metric for the median estimate as the denominator from MAPE, without clarifying, is assumed to be the same for all methods? But I saw for example in Table 2, under these two metrics, the ranking of methods can differ. This made me worry whether the experiment setup or the metric calculation is different from what I assumed.

Another minor note: an interval is implied for all the reported results and only in caption from Table 2, it was mentioned that 'the results are averaged over 5 runs'. What are these 5 runs referring to? Do they refer to different random seeds for training only? I assumed so given that the paper mentioned the train/test/validate is splitter based on ratio chronically which will fix the dataset so no variation from the data.

### Questions
Introducing missing masks to feature map, motivated from vision tasks, makes sense; yet it'd be good to compare against, introducing the missing masks as input feature directly so the model can be trained with the knowledge what inputs are missing.

It was implied that the proposed approach could capture missing pattern; yet the experiments seem to only tested the scenario where values are missing at random. In actual application, it's rare that values are missing at random. It'd be good to also test different scenarios to show the efficacy of the proposed methods.

### Summary
This paper introduces a Biased Temporal Convolution Graph Network (BiaTCGNet) for forecasting from partially observed time series. BiaTCGNet is designed to jointly capture the temporal dependencies within and spatial structure of time series, while accounting for missing patterns by injecting bias into its components (MultiScale Instance PartialTCN and Biased GCN). Experiments conducted on several real-world benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of BiaTCGNet over alternative approaches.

### Strengths
* The proposed Biased Temporal Convolution Graph Network (BiaTCGNet) is designed specifically to account for both the temporal and spatial aspects of multivariate time series. Namely, this is achieved through BiaTCGNet’s two constituent modules: a Multi-Scale Instance PartialTCN and a Biased GCN. The former is capable of performing instance-independent temporal convolution to capture temporal (intra-instance) correlations within each individual time series, while the latter constructs a graph and diffuses information over it to capture the spatial correlations between the time series instances (channels).

* In contrast to other existing time series forecasting methods, BiaTCGNet explicitly considers missing values in its model design through bias injection in the Multi-Scale Instance PartialTCN module that helps account for the different missing patterns; while progressively updating the missing patterns during Biased GCN’s information diffusion process.

* Experiments on five real-world benchmark datasets have been conducted, the results of which suggest that BiaTCGNet achieves improvements of up to 11% over the existing forecasting methods under various scenarios involving missing values.

* The paper is technically sound, well written and organized in a reasonably clear and comprehensive manner. The notation used throughout the paper is clear and consistent.

Update: Thanks to the authors for detailed responses, after reading them, as well as comments from all reviewers, I am updating my rating from 5 to 6.

### Weaknesses
* Generally speaking, BiaTCGNet appears to be a result of (1) an almost direct application of a TCN with a straightforward modification to account for partial observations (Liu et al., 2018), and (2) leveraging a conventional GCN for learning of an adjacency matrix relying on two node embedding sets so as to capture asymmetric spatial correlations. In that regard, the novelty of this work may be considered incremental. Therefore, I would encourage the authors to further clarify and/or elaborate on the novelty of the two modules within BiaTCGNet.

* In Eq. (8), the authors introduce $\beta$, a learnable weight that is aimed to serve as a time-window-specific bias that corrects the global spatial correlation strength in accordance with the present missing patterns. Nevertheless, the role of this weight has not been discussed further. I believe that this work would benefit from including the learned values of $\beta$ for each individual dataset used in the experiments. If possible, I would also suggest that the authors consider including a brief discussion on the interpretation of those values.

* There seems to be a fairly recent work [C1] on attention-based memory networks for joint modeling of local spatio-temporal features and global historical patterns in multivariate time series with missing values. Moreover, the forecasting problem formulation in [C1] seems to be consistent with the one considered in this work. Therefore, I would suggest that the authors consider comparing the GCN-M method from [C1] with BiaTCGNet. Alternatively, I would ask the authors to provide the specific reason as to why this method has not been included among the baselines?

### Summary
To handle missing values in time series, the paper employs
partial convolutions from computer vision. The authors then
use a graph neural network with channels as nodes and
a induced adjacency matrix for forecasting. They evaluate
their model on several datasets and show that it ourperforms
several baselines from the literature.

### Strengths
s1. handling missing values is an important problem,
   esp. in time series.
s2. treating missing values with partial convolutions is interesting.
s3. the method consistently reduces errors in the experiments.
s4. ablation study shows effect of the two different components
  of the method.

### Weaknesses
w1. limited methodological contribution: the paper merely combines
  two existing methods. 
w2.  missing principled  baseline: forecast based on the time series
  **and the imputation mask**.

### Questions
Using partial convolutions is a simple and plausible approach to
treat missing values in time series (s2). The experiments show a
consistent decrease in error over five datasets (s3) and the ablation
study shows the effect of the two different components (s4).

Two points one could discuss:
w1. limited methodological contribution: the paper merely combines
  two existing methods.
 
w2.  missing principled  baseline: forecast based on the time series
  **and the imputation mask**.
In the main experiment in table 2 the authors compare several
forecasting models for completely observed time series after
imputing zeros ("Transformer_0") and after imputing with a
specific imputation method ("Transformer_t"). However, this way
the information which observations have been missing gets lost,
and this might be relevant ("informed missingness").  The default
approach is to impute a zero **and** to add a channel carrying
the imputation mask (i.e., as "1" if the value was observed and
a "0" if it originally was missing and now has been imputed).
This way, the information about missingness is not lost. -- It
would be really important to add these principled baselines
to make sure that the specific way the proposed models deals
with the missing values really is causing the observed differences.
