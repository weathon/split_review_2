# MUBen: Benchmarking the Uncertainty of Molecular Representation Models

- Decision: Reject
- Scores: 5, 5, 5, 8

## Abstract
Large molecular representation models pre-trained on massive unlabeled data have shown great success in predicting molecular properties.
  However, these models may tend to overfit the fine-tuning data, resulting in over-confident predictions on test data that fall outside of the training distribution.
  To address this issue, uncertainty quantification (UQ) methods can be used to improve the models' calibration of predictions.
  Although many UQ approaches exist, not all of them lead to improved performance.
  While some studies have included UQ to improve molecular pre-trained models, the process of selecting suitable backbone and UQ methods for reliable molecular uncertainty estimation remains underexplored.
  To address this gap, we present \muben, which evaluates different UQ methods for state-of-the-art backbone molecular representation models to investigate their capabilities.
  By fine-tuning various backbones using different molecular descriptors as inputs with UQ methods from different categories, we assess the influence of architectural decisions and training strategies on property prediction and uncertainty estimation.
  Our study offers insights for selecting UQ for backbone models, which can facilitate research on uncertainty-critical applications in fields such as materials science and drug discovery.

### Summary
This paper proposes an evaluation method called MUBEN to benchmark various pre-trained molecular representation models. The authors fine-tuned different models with a series of molecular descriptors and provided assessments and insights for model selection.

### Strengths
This paper comprehensively investigated the uncertainty quantification for molecular representation models, including various pre-trained backbones covering string-based, graph-based, 3D-structure-based and hand-crafted models. Also, various methods of uncertainty quantification were involved such as Bayes by Backprop.

### Weaknesses
The novelty is limited. As a benchmark article, the final conclusion is pretty general that Ensemble methods seem to have better performance for evaluating molecular uncertainty.

As a benchmark paper,  it is necessary to illustrate the best configuration of backbone choice, UQ method and data splitting strategy for classification and regression tasks.

The arrangement of this paper could be improved to make it better. Some Tables provide redundant information, such as Table 1 and Table 2.

### Questions
1. This paper is not friendly for the general readers to read and follow. Since the UQ methods comparison is the key points of this paper, I highly recommend the authors to make simple schematic diagrams for each category of UQ methods, instead of only text used in Figure 1.

2. For the first category of pre-trained molecular representation models, why do you choose ChemBertTa? According to Molformer paper, Molformer has better representation ability than ChemBertTa.

3. In the regression results of Table 2, the SGLD seems to also have good performance. Please analyze the reasons.

4.  By comparing Uni-Mol, ChemBERTa, and DNN in Figure 4, it is concluded that larger models such as Uni-Mol are more confident to their results. However, the performance of two models is shown for each dataset. Are the figures for ‘ChemBERTa on FreeSolv’ and ‘Uni-Mol on Lipo’ missing? 

5. Do the Table 3 results only belong to Uni-Mol? If so, you should underscore the Uni-Mol in Table 3 title. And about the discussion for Table 3, the text mainly focuses on whether frozen backbone or not. How about split methods? Why does the random splitting perform better on classification tasks but worse on regression tasks than scaffold splitting?

6. It is better to illustrate the best configuration of backbone choice, UQ method and data splitting strategy for classification and regression tasks.

### Summary
This paper proposes a benchmarking platform for evaluating Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) methods in fine-tuning pretrained models for downstream tasks in molecular property prediction. The platform provides datasets and baselines in an open-source environment. For the dataset, it includes classification and regression tasks from MoleculeNet (widely used for assessing predictive performance in downstream tasks of pretrained models), namely BBBP, ClinTox, Tox21, ToxCast, SIDER, BACE, HIV, and MUV for classification; ESOL, FreeSolv, Lipophilicity, QM7, QM8, and QM9 for regression. These datasets are provided with scaffold splitting to evaluate the out-of-distribution (OOD) characteristics of UQ. The predictive performance in each downstream task is provided with ROC-AUC for classification, and RMSE and MAE for regression. Furthermore, the evaluation metrics for UQ include ECE, NLL, Brier score, and CE for classification; and Gaussian NLL and CE for regression. 

In addition, the paper comprehensively reports baseline performances on fine-tuning six pretrained models combined with UQ: ChemBERTa, GROVER, Uni-Mol, Fully-connected Neural Network with RDKit features, TorchMD-NET, and GIN. The UQ methods examined, namely Focal Loss, BBP, SGLD, MC Dropout, SWAG, Temperature Scaling, and Deep Ensembles, show that the combination of Uni-Mol model and Deep Ensemble performs exceptionally well.

### Strengths
Molecular representations pre-trained primarily through self-supervised learning on vast amounts of data have shown success in predicting molecular properties. However, when fine-tuning these models for downstream tasks, there's a risk of overfitting. They particularly tend to make overly confident predictions on test data that deviates from the training distribution. Consequently, the quantification of uncertainty (UQ) is recognized as an extremely crucial issue. Yet, there is a lack of standard benchmark platform to comprehensively and systematically investigate such methods. The benchmark proposed in this paper provides researchers with a practical testing platform to exhaustively assess both predictive and UQ performance across numerous downstream tasks. Moreover, the paper reports comprehensive benchmark results using several widely-used pre-trained molecular models. It provides empirically valuable insights into how the combination of pre-trained models and UQ methods can potentially impact both predictive and UQ performances.

### Weaknesses
The reported superior performance of the Uni-Mol model combined with Deep Ensembles raises several questions about the merits of conducting validation research based on this benchmark. Firstly, while Deep Ensembles are fundamentally distinct from other UQ methods being an intrinsic ensemble learning approach and it's intriguing that they perform well even with M=3, it can be intuitively expected that they would likely be the most stable. Although Deep Ensembles necessitate the training of multiple models, which can be resource and time-intensive, this aspect has not been thoroughly explored in this paper. Furthermore, the standout performance of Uni-Mol, which correlates highly with predictive capability, may suggest a straightforward interpretation that later models simply yield better results in UQ. This can be attributed to the fact that the MoleculeNet tasks utilized here have been widely employed for validating molecular pre-training. The original Uni-Mol paper already demonstrated its superior predictive performance compared to traditional methods, and it might be practically sufficient to have stable UQ by using deep ensembles of Uni-Mol. Therefore, if the UQ evaluation highly correlates with this, the implications provided by the validation using this benchmark might appear limited. If the focus is on UQ validation during fine-tuning of pre-trained molecular models, it might also suggest the need for a research environment that can conduct evaluations more broadly beyond just MoleculeNet.

### Questions
Q1. Methods like MC Dropout and SWAG are ultimately designed to efficiently extract UQ information. If one has the time and resources to implement Deep Ensembles, it is clear that it would be a preferred option. The paper concludes that Deep Ensembles come "with significant computation cost," but are there any actual comparative results on computation cost presented?

Q2. When using MoleculeNet as the downstream task based on this benchmark, how much of a difference is there in terms of computation cost? How long does it take to fine-tune? (I mean when comparing deep ensembles vs others)

Q3. I understand that scaffold splitting for train/test division is beneficial for evaluating out-of-distribution (OOD) characteristics. However, scaffold splitting has been widely used in evaluating the performance of existing pre-trained molecular representations for downstream tasks. Hence, the pre-trained models adopted as baselines in this benchmark have already been confirmed to perform well, assuming scaffold splitting (with MolecularNet data as the downstream tasks). In this regard, I feel it might be more appropriate, both for a realistic evaluation of UQ and in consideration of OOD characteristics, to base the benchmark on data other than MoleculeNet. Do you have any additional comments on this?

### Summary
The authors describe MUBen, a benchmark for assessing the performance of uncertainty estimation methods on molecular prediction models. MUBen employs four pretrained "backbone" models with near SOTA performance, one for each of four different input molecular representations: ChemBERTa for SMILES, GROVER for 2D graphs, Uni-Mol for 3D conformations, and fully-connected NNs for RDKit features. Two other pretrained models are included to provide additional insights: TorchMD-NET, a transformer pretrained on QM properties, and GIN, a powerful GNN. The authors fine-tune these models on MoleculeNet datasets, providing a mixture of classification and regression tasks across a variety of physiological, biophysical, physical chemical, and quantum properties. In the paper, the authors benchmark a number of uncertainty estimation methods: focal loss, temperatures scaling, deep ensembles, Bayes for Backprop (BBP), Stochastic Gradient Langevin Dynamics (SGLD), MC Dropout, and Stochastic Weight Average-Gaussian. For model performance, the authors report AUC for classification tasks, and RMSE and MAE for regression tasks. For uncertainty estimation, the authors report the negative log likelihood (NLL), Brier score, and expected calibration error for classification tasks, and Gaussian NLL and regression calibration error for regression tasks. By computing the performance and uncertainty scores for all models across all tasks, the authors qualitatively conclude that Deep Ensembles perform best overall, though are computationally expensive, while temperature scaling and MC Dropout are good choices for classification tasks, and BBP and SGLD are good for regression tasks. They also conclude that Uni-Mol, trained on 3D conformations, performs best among backbones.

### Strengths
- The paper is well written and easy to follow.
- The authors use a comprehensive selection of tasks and datasets.
- The appendix is an incredible resource, being a combination of textbook and comprehensive results.

### Weaknesses
- While interesting, MUBen is a straightforward product of models X datasets/tasks X uncertainty estimation methods, and does not rise to the level of a significant contribution suited for the main track of the conference
- The benchmark is really many benchmarks, and decisions about which methods or backbones are best are made by qualitatively assessing large tables of numbers
- The benchmark includes only one architecture per molecular input type, it would likely be more informative to train many architectures per input type and report distributions/aggregations of results instead.
- The authors train models with 3 different random seeds and report the average result, but it would be informative to report some notion of the spread amongst the three runs as well.
- When reviewing the benchmark results, the authors often provide hypotheses about why certain model-uncertainty estimator combinations perform the way they do, without further evidence. It would be very valuable to test some of these hypotheses (e.g. via ablations) and report on the findings.
- Some of the stated conclusions do not appear justified by the data, e.g. "Figure 3 shows that deterministic prediction tends to be over-confident, and Temperature Scaling mitigates this issue", however it is not at all obvious from Fig 3 that TS does mitigate. Also "As presented in the tables and Figure 5, TorchMD-NET’s performance is on par with Uni-Mol when predicting quantum mechanical properties but falls short in others", however TorchMD-NET seems to be as on par for biophysical properties too. This is a result of the lack of statistics from which to draw these conclusions.
- MoleculeNet is dated, and has been replaced by other benchmark suites like TDC.

### Questions
- Instead of making only qualitative assessments, compute summary statistics of the results and attempt to determine significance.
- Substantiate some/all of the hypotheses made about why the results are the way they are.

### Summary
The paper serves as a systematic benchmark of different uncertainty quantification (UQ) methods on various deep learning models for molecular machine learning tasks. With thorough and carefully-designed metrics and training protocol, the authors compared UQ methods for their effect on models' regression/classification accuracy. The paper also provides some analysis of UQ methods from other angles such as the extra computational cost. Overall, I believe that this manuscript is a high-quality, well-executed benchmark paper of UQ methods for molecular machine learning field. However, the paper can be improved by comparing UQ methods on areas besides their effect on model accuracy (detailed in the weakness section).

### Strengths
1. The training and evaluation protocols are well-designed. The experiments are conducted consistently to ensure fair comparison.

2. Benchmarks are thorough as models that take different molecular representations are included. Datasets are carefully selected such that various tasks are included.

3. The manuscript is written with high clarity, offering significant value to readers who are interested in this field.

### Weaknesses
1. Uncertainty quantification of machine learning or deep learning models has been an important topic as it aids the explainability of those models. Some of the influential works are missing from the reference of this paper. One example is (pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.jcim.0c00502), which should be discussed and included in the reference.

2. Besides the fact that UQ methods can improve the accuracy of models, it is also valuable in the domain of molecular machine learning because it can aid many other machine learning applications such as [1] identifying the activity cliff and adding explainability to model (e.g. pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/acs.jcim.2c01073), and [2] Active learning virtual screening of large compound libraries (pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/2021/sc/d0sc06805e). The uncertainty value (e.g. variance predicted by model or obtained from ensemble) can provided explainability to deep learning methods, especially in areas where explainability is important (such as drug discovery). The authors did not mention those advantages of UQ in molecular machine learning field.

3. Some of the models benchmarked are pretrained on larger dataset (ChemBERTA, Uni-mol). Some other models in this work bear the potential of being pretrained (e.g. GIN can be trained using contrastive learning on molecular graph, and TorchMD-net can be pre-trained in a denoising manner). It would be very interesting if we can understand the better performance of pretrained models from the UQ perspective. Unfortunately, the paper did not discuss how pretraining can affect the uncertainty of models.

### Questions
1. If I am understanding it correctly, the "Deterministic" method actually predicts a mean and a variance like mean-variance estimation, and is trained using gaussian negative log-likelihood loss. If so, it is confusing to call it “deterministic” because it can be misunderstood as non-UQ baseline. Can authors rename to avoid confusion? Also, I do not find any non-UQ baseline in this work. Can authors add a non-UQ baseline to show improvements brought by UQ methods?

2. For the deep ensemble methods, how does the number of models in the ensemble affects the ensemble variance on different benchmarks?

3. MoLFormer (www.nature.com/articles/s42256-022-00580-7) is a very strong model that takes SMILES as input based on my experience in the drug discovery industry. Understanding the uncertainty associate with MoLFormer should be very interesting to researchers in the industry. What is the motivation of the authors to choose ChemBERTa over MoLFormer to be included in the benchmark of this work?
