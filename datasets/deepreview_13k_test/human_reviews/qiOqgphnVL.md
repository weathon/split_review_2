# Democratized Diffusion Language Model

- Decision: Reject
- Scores: 5, 3, 3

## Abstract
Diffusion Models are a promising avenue for text generation, offering a multitude of frameworks for researchers and practitioners alike. These frameworks differ based on how the Diffusion Model is utilized for categorical data generation. This paper aims to look into these differences by examining the SSD and Plaid models, as well as our attentive replication of the CDCD models. Our study focuses mainly on the process of text generation performed at runtime by various frameworks. One of our research's notable findings is that, according to our observations, most models are capable of halting the generation process and facilitating an adaptive early exit. This feature proves instrumental in accelerating the speed of text generation by Diffusion Language Models without compromising the quality of the generated text.

### Confidence
5: You are absolutely certain about your assessment. You are very familiar with the related work and checked the math/other details carefully.

### Summary
This paper explores the use of diffusion models for text generation and compares different frameworks used in the process (CDCD, Plaid, SSD). The authors focus on the sampling process and propose an adaptive early exit mechanism to accelerate text generation without compromising quality. The main contributions:
- re-implementation of the diffusion language model trained with the CDCD framework.
- propose and evaluate three adaptive criteria for early exiting
- side-by-side assessment to show the convergence of generation

### Strengths
- Re-implementation benifts the community.
- The step-by-step analysis could help us understand the generation process of diffusion models.

### Weaknesses
- It is good to see analysis of sampling between different diffusion models, however, no further explanation about the deep reason to cause these differences.
- The advantage of DDLM is to early exit and speedup the generation process. However, compared with some faster ODE solvers (e.g. DPM-solver[1]), early exit of DDLM maybe not superior than them.
- Early exit leads to the downgrade of generation diversity.

### Questions
- Why after your findings that using a noise scale of 0.9 is optimal, you still use a scale of 1.0 in later experiments
- In table 2, it is weird AR-NLL=0.44 and dist_1=0 with noise=0, do you have generation examples?
- The GPT-Score is a relative value, with step-1000 as the reference text. However, the reference text may not be fluent. Is it possible to obtain the absolute value?
- Can you also compare with discrete diffusion models?
- Why in Fig5, the NLL of Plaid (c) (<3.6) is lower than the DDLM (a) (>3.68)? This contradicts to the main table.

### Summary
This paper reimplemented a Diffusion LM (DLM) trained with the CDCD framework and provided some analysis of DLMs. Besides, the paper showed that the generation process of most DLMs for general text generation can be halted.

### Strengths
1. This paper reimplemented the CDCD framework. If the code and checkpoint can be open-sourced, it can provide support for the research of DLMs.

2. This paper makes sufficient experiments and analysis on the existing DLMs, and obtains the early stopping strategy of DLMs by observing the AR-NLL curve.

### Weaknesses
1. The innovation of the paper is insufficient. The main contribution is to reproduce the CDCD structure and analyze the existing DLMs, without proposing new models or methods.

2. The length of the trained model is limited to 64, and it is not clear whether there will be different conclusions for longer lengths. The length of 64 is still a bit far from actual application.

3. We still care about the performance of pre-trained models on downstream tasks, and the paper did not select some downstream tasks for evaluation.

4. Writing issues:

    (1) The main contribution of the paper, such as the analysis of DLMs, is not given in the title. The writing style is a bit messy.

    (2) It is recommended to add the model parameter quantity to the comparison in Table 1.

### Questions
Does the model have the ability to output the </s> token? The sentences in Appendix D are all truncated results.

### Summary
The paper studies Diffusion Models for text generation. It exams the runtime distinction between different diffusion models such as SSD, Plaid and CDCD. 

A key observation from the research is the ability of most models to halt the generation process, enabling a faster text generation termed as "adaptive early exit" without diminishing the quality of the output.

The author also shares an open source re-implementation of the Diffusion LM trained with CDCD framework.

### Strengths
The paper studies a new field for text generation using diffusion models.  Given the inherent complexities and resource-intensive nature of running diffusion models continuously during generation, the research investigates the feasibility of early exiting by monitoring token switches across various pre-training checkpoints. The methodology of evaluating Cos between the score function and L2 norm the sample embeddings, and subsequently observing score angle changes, provides a novel insights to assess diffusion models.

### Weaknesses
The paper focuses on the concept of early stopping in diffusion models, which is an idea that has been previously explored, as noted in "Accelerating Diffusion Models via Early Stop of the Diffusion Process" as an example. The contribution to extend to text generation needs to be assessed. The technique of early stopping is a recognized practice during the inference stage of diffusion models. While the current paper's examination of token switches across different pre-training checkpoints offers a fresh angle, the approach's broader implications and significance in comparison to established methodologies could be further elucidated. 

From Table 1 main results, we can see the choice of steps also provides very marginal impact to the final performance. It might be beneficial for the research to delve deeper into how this method stands out from or builds upon existing techniques in the field of diffusion models.

### Questions
LLM as Judge has some known weakness, from the provided prompts [Judging LLM-as-a-Judge with MT-Bench and Chatbot Arena], it seems the prompt is very simple and does not consider LLM bias. Can author comment on this?
