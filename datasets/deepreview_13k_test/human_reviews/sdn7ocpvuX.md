- Decision: Reject
- Scores: 3, 3, 3, 3

## Abstract
Graph diffusion equations are intimately related to graph neural networks (GNNs) and have recently attracted attention as a principled framework for analyzing GNN dynamics, formalizing their expressive power, and justifying architectural choices. One  key open questions in graph learning is the generalization capabilities of GNNs. A major limitation of current approaches hinges on the assumption that the graph topologies in the training and test sets come from the same distribution. In this paper, we make steps towards understanding the generalization of GNNs by exploring how graph diffusion equations extrapolate and generalize in the presence of varying graph topologies. We first show deficiencies in the generalization capability of existing models built upon local diffusion on graphs, stemming from the exponential sensitivity to topology variation. Our subsequent analysis reveals the promise of non-local diffusion, which advocates for feature propagation over fully-connected latent graphs, under the assumption of a specific data-generating condition. In addition to these findings, we propose a novel graph encoder backbone, Advective Diffusion Transformer (ADiT), inspired by advective graph diffusion equations that have a closed-form solution backed up with theoretical guarantees of desired generalization under topological distribution shifts. The new model, functioning as a versatile graph Transformer, demonstrates superior performance across a wide range of graph learning tasks. Source codes will be made publicly available.

### Summary
This paper proposed ADiT that is composed of local message passing and global transformer to tackle topological distribution shift between training and test sets.
The sensitivity of local/non-local model results according to structural perturbation was analyzed.
Based on the analysis, a model using both local and global interactions was proposed, and comparative experiments such as classification and regression were performed.

### Strengths
1. Potential of transformer as a solution to topological distribution shift.

### Weaknesses
1. The motivation of this paper eventually converges to the composition of mpnn and transformer that already proposed before.
2. There is a lack of concept and experimental comparison with related papers.
3. There is a lack of analysis on out of distribution in experiments.

### Questions
1. On the design of PDE based graph learning model, what is the relevance and difference between and where is the experimental comparison with [1]?

2. The proposed method converges to the composition of local and global message passing. In that respect, compared to [2, 3], what is the difference in terms of model design and performance?

3. In order to learn a topology agnostic representation, one direction is to consider all possible connections, but it is also possible to ignore all connections. It is necessary to check the results of MLP as baseline performance.

4. What is the definition of hypothesis space size in proposition 3?

5. I would like to know clearly what topological shift was induced through splitting for OGB-Bace and -Sider.

6. Why local diffusion models have comparable performances compared to non-local diffusion models in Table 1?

7. It is necessary to compare with relevant non-local (transformer) models [4, 5], and models that considers out-of-distribution [6, 7, 8, 9].

8. Computational time comparison between (non-) local diffusion models is required.

9. Table 9 in the appendix shows that local interactions are more important than non-local interactions. These results may seem to contradict the logic of this paper, which advocates learning topologically agnostic representations to solve topological OOD.

### Summary
This paper investigates advective diffusion graph neural network models and study their generalization under graph topology changes.

### Strengths
This paper studies the generalization of graph advective diffusion models under graph topology changes.

### Weaknesses
1. The authors seem to be unaware of many related works that have already various aspects proposed in this paper. The novelty of the paper is thus unclear. 

1. The given bounds in Proposition 1 and  2 are very loose. Furthermore, these are Big-O bounds and do not justify the claim that the label prediction can be highly sensitive to topology perturbations. To make such a claim, a Big-Omega bound should be provided. I am unconvinced by the authors' motivations for this work.

1. There are critical flaws or gaps in the proofs. E.g., in the line before (76). There is no justification why the exponential operator can be factored out. Note that if $A$ and $B$ do not commute, then $e^{A+B} \ne e^A e^B$ or $e^{B}e^{A}$.

### Questions
1. The proposed model is very close to the following. The authors need to explain the differences.
  - ACMP: Allen-cahn message passing with attractive and repulsive forces for graph neural networks in ICLR 2023
  - Graph neural convection-diffusion with heterophily in IJCAI 2023

2. The effect of graph structure changes on neural diffusion GNN models have been studied in the following. Generalization results in GNNs have also been proposed. What are the additional new results in this paper?
  - Graphon neural networks and the transferability of graph neural networks in NeurIPS 2020
  - On the robustness of graph neural diffusion to topology perturbations in NeurIPS 2022
  - Transferability properties of graph neural networks in IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing.

3. In the proof of Proposition 1, it is stated that $\tilde{A}$ and $\Delta \tilde{A}$ share the same eigenspace. Why is this true? It seems to be a very critical assumption that needs to be comprehensively justified and stated up front.

4. How does the proposed model perform under heterophily datasets?

### Summary
This paper introduces Advective Diffusion Transformer to address the graph topologies generalization problems in GNNs under the assumption of a specific data-generating condition. However, there are errors in the proofs of Propositions 1, 2, and 3, as well as Theorem 1 and 2, which constitute the core contributions of this paper.  So the work lacks the necessary solidity for acceptance. These are substantial errors that call into question the paper's reliability. Additionally, this paper lacks a comparison of some highly related work.

### Strengths
1. The exploration of graph topological shifts under the assumption of graphon is interesting.
2. The experiments are thorough, encompassing a diverse array of datasets, which enhances the comprehensiveness of the study.
3. The integration of global attention with local message passing within the model presents an intriguing methodology.

### Weaknesses
1. I have some big concerns about this paper, especially when looking at the starting Proposition 1 and Proposition 2 in the paper. The authors say that changes in the graph structure affect the graph neural diffusion model a lot. But I don't think they've given enough proof for this, especially when I compare it to what's said in the paper [1]. \
In Proposition 1's proof, they say that $\tilde{A'}$ and $\tilde{A}$ can be swapped around (are commutative), **but that's not always true**. The whole point of Proposition 1 seems to depend on this being right. If it's not right, then Proposition 1 doesn't work. This makes me question the other things the paper says. \
Also, even if we say that their assumption is right, the result they get seems too general. **It's not as specific as the conclusion in the Proposition 1 of the paper [1]**. Proposition 2 also uses the same kind of reasoning as Proposition 1.\
The proofs in the paper have one fundamental flaw that leads to incorrect equations.  For instance, in many equations (Eg. Eq(40), (58), (60), (63), (64), (76) etc.), it uses $e^(X+Y) = e^Xe^Y$ **without considering the commutative between $X$ and $Y$.** \
Because of these problems, especially the mistake in Proposition 1, I don't think this paper should be accepted as it is. They need to go back, check their work and related works such as [1][9], and make it clearer.  
2. **Equation (73) in the proof of Proposition 3 is incorrect.** The validity of Equation (73) requires that **$\cal{H}$ be a finite hypothesis class and the loss function $l$ be bounded within $[0,1]$.** Specifically, the penultimate inequality in Equation (73) holds only if $\cal{H}$ is finite, and the last inequality is true when the loss function $l$ is bounded in $[0,1]$. However, this paper does not fulfill the required conditions: the hypothesis class $\cal{H}$  is not finite as it involves neural networks, and the loss functions used like cross-entropy or MSE are not bounded between $[0,1]$. As a result, the conclusions drawn in Proposition 3 are incorrect. **This issue also affects Equation (85) in the proof of Theorem 2, leading to incorrect in the Theorem 2 conclusions.**  In conclusion, the main claim of this paper, Theorem 2, rests on the incorrect assumption. This error is critical enough to question the entire paper's validity, making its findings untrustworthy.
3. Using Advective Diffusion Equations in GNNs is not new, see the related works such as [2] and [3].  
4. This paper also lacks a comparison and citation of related works, particularly those focusing on the generalization of topology distribution shift based on the graphon theory, such as references [6] and [7].  
5. Theorem 1 and Theorem 2 hold under the data generation hypothesis in Sec. 3.1. How does this data generation hypothesis correspond to the real-world datasets in Sec. 5.2? The citations of the graphon theory are not given in Sec. 3.1. Can you explain more about the graphon?  
6. In the proof of Theorem 1, why $C=\bar{C}+m log(I + \tilde{A}) - \beta \tilde{A}$ ?   
7. For the model implementation in Section 4.3, why have approximation techniques been chosen over the numerical solvers proposed in [4], which are commonly utilized in graph neural diffusion models such as GRAND, GRAND++, GraphCON[8], CDE[3], as well as GREAD[5] models? Have any ablation studies been conducted to compare the effectiveness of different numerical solvers?  
8. Why are there no results for ADIT-INVERSE in Table 1? Additionally, the results for ADIT-SERIES show only marginal improvement compared to GRAND. It would be beneficial to include more baselines of graph neural diffusion models, such as the model in [1][9] and GraphCON, for a more comprehensive comparison.  
9. No code has been submitted to reproduce the experiment results.

### Confidence
3: You are fairly confident in your assessment. It is possible that you did not understand some parts of the submission or that you are unfamiliar with some pieces of related work. Math/other details were not carefully checked.

### Summary
The paper proposed a new method ADIT which uses graph as advection term whereas diffusion term is computed globally. The authors provide theoretical support on the relation between locality of diffusion term and robustness of model against graph topological changes. The authors then provided experimental support on the performance of their method.

### Strengths
- The idea is noval to me.
- The problem it solves is significant. In a lot of cases, graphs are generated with randomness, whereas all state of the art graph diffusion methods I knew are not robust to randomness in graph structure.
- The paper is well presented and easy to read.

### Weaknesses
- Figure 3: needs a footnote explaining OOM

### Questions
The method is theoretically very nice, but not scalable at all. The global attention is too costly in computation. General graph diffusion methods cost O(E) whereas global diffusion of ADIT cost O(V^2). So I have a few questions on how the authors would think to extend this model to larger graphs.
- Is it possible to use methods from efficient transformer to speed up the global diffuison cost of the model? Are there some suggestions?
- Is it possible to split the graph into batches of vertices / edges, and do it batch-by-batch?
- A lot of linear graph diffusion methods corresponds to a random walk. What is the random walk counterpart of ADIT if there is any?
