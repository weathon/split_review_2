- Decision: Reject
- Scores: 8, 6, 5, 5

## Abstract
Point process models are widely used for continuous asynchronous event data, where each data point includes time and additional information called ``marks'', which can be locations, nodes, or event types. This paper presents a novel point process model for discrete event data over graphs, where the event interaction occurs within a latent graph structure. 
    Our model builds upon Hawkes's classic influence kernel-based formulation in the original self-exciting point processes work to capture the influence of historical events on future events' occurrence. The key idea is to represent the influence kernel by Graph Neural Networks (GNN) to capture the underlying graph structure while harvesting the strong representation power of GNNs. Compared with prior works focusing on directly modeling the conditional intensity function using neural networks, our kernel presentation herds the repeated event influence patterns more effectively by combining statistical and deep models, achieving better model estimation/learning efficiency and superior predictive performance. Our work significantly extends the existing deep spatio-temporal kernel for point process data, which is inapplicable to our setting due to the fundamental difference in the nature of the observation space being Euclidean rather than a graph. We present comprehensive experiments on synthetic and real-world data to show the superior performance of the proposed approach against the state-of-the-art in predicting future events and uncovering the relational structure among data.

### Summary
This paper proposes a flexible deep graph kernel point process model for marked point process data, where marks are treated as "nodes" in a graph. The interactions between marks are modeled through Graph Neural Networks (GNN), which are very flexible to capture various types of interactions over a graph. The kernel representation of the marked point process is then constructed through a convolution of kernels over the time domain and the graph. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated through extensive simulation studies and some benchmark data points, which outperforms many existing methods for marked point process data.

### Strengths
I found the idea of treating marks as graph nodes to be very interesting, which opens the door for many future research directions. The proposed kernel representation of the marked point process is straightforward but powerful, suggesting a wide range of possible applications. The paper is very well written and the presentation is clear. The numerical experiments are impressive and convincing.

### Weaknesses
It will be good to add some background information on the graph-based kernels so that the paper is more self-contained. It will also be helpful if the authors can comment on what types of network interactions can be modeled and what the limitations of such representation are. This way, the readers will have a better idea of the advantages and limitations of the proposed model.

### Questions
1. Some relevant recent work on Hawke's process on networks is missing. For example, [1]. In [1], the graph structure (i.e., the adjacency matrix) is observed, can you comment on how one can use this information in the proposed model? [1] also handles the heterogeneity of the nodes in the graph, can similar things be done using the proposed model?

2. As I mentioned before, it will be good to add some background information on the graph-based kernels so that the paper is more self-contained. It will also be helpful if the authors can comment on what types of network interactions can be modeled and what the limitations of such representation are. This way, the readers will have a better idea of the advantages and limitations of the proposed model.

3. On page 4, the basis functions of $g_d(\cdot,\cdot)$ typically need to be orthogonal. Can you comment on how to ensure the orthogonality of basis functions using the fully connected neural network? If orthogonality is not imposed, how do you ensure the uniqueness of the decomposition?

### Summary
The paper presents a novel point process model for discrete event data over graphs. It extends the influence kernel-based formulation by Hawkes to include Graph Neural Networks (GNN), aiming to capture the influence of historical events on future events' occurrence. The model combines statistical and deep learning approaches to enhance model estimation, learning efficiency, and predictive performance. The paper also demonstrates the superiority of the proposed model over existing methods through comprehensive experiments on synthetic and real-world data.

### Strengths
1.	The paper introduces an innovative approach by integrating GNN with the classic influence kernel-based formulation, offering a new perspective in point process modeling over graphs.
2.	The experimental setup and the methodologies used are sound and well-executed.

### Weaknesses
1.	The proposed approach appears to be a combination of existing methods, which raises questions about its novelty. To provide a valuable contribution to the field, it is crucial to address the limitations and shortcomings of existing approaches, such as kernel-based, deep neural network-based, and graph-based models. Additionally, the authors should clearly articulate the advantages of this new method compared to GNN-based models [1,2,3,4].

2.	Graph construction, including the definition of nodes and edges, is pivotal in GNN-based methods. The paper needs to provide a detailed explanation of how edges between nodes are established. Are the edge construction methods applicable universally across different scenarios, or do they require case-specific adaptations? While the process is well-defined for synthetic datasets, it is less clear in real-world data scenarios. The assertion that edges represent potential interactions should be elaborated upon to ensure clarity.
3.	The authors use THP-S and SHAP-G as baselines. However, these baselines employ powerful transformers and graph attention mechanisms. It would be expected that they offer significant flexibility. This work should provide a robust justification for why the proposed model outperforms these baselines. Is there a theoretical basis for the superior performance?
4.	Notably, the synthetic data is primarily generated using kernel methods. Hence, I think the proposed model should fit this data well. However, the observed improvement in likelihood compared to the baseline is very minimal and possibly not statistically significant. The authors should offer a convincing explanation for this limited improvement. 
5.	This concern follows question 4. The discrepancy between the log-likelihood, which is similar to the baseline, and the substantially improved time prediction MAE is perplexing. I am suspicious about the accuracy of the MAE calculation. I recommend the authors clarify how this probabilistic prediction model is employed for predictions – whether it is based on random sampling or mean predictions.
6.	In the evaluation using real-world data, Table 3 indicates that the advantage of the graph-based approach diminishes as the number of nodes increases. This observation runs counter to my expectation that graph modeling should excel in complex graph structures. The authors should provide a detailed analysis and potential explanations for this outcome.
7.	Lack of crucial baseline comparisons. A robust baseline comparison is essential for a comprehensive evaluation of the proposed method. The absence of such comparisons is a notable limitation in the paper. For instance, even without incorporating a graph, models like THP [5], and DAPP[6] possess the inherent capability to capture inter-event interactions. Additionally, there are intensity-free methods [7] available in the literature. Hence, it is necessary to compare the proposed model against state-of-the-art point process models [1,2,3,4,5,6,7].

### Summary
This paper proposes using graph neural networks to define the inter-mark relationship in triggering kernels of marked Hawkes processes. The proposed model represents the triggering kernels by localized graph filter bases, which permit flexible modeling of inter-event-category dependence, including non-stationary, multi-hop exciting, and inhibiting effects. The validity of the model was confirmed by the experiments on synthetic and three real-world data.

### Strengths
- The paper is well-written and easy to follow. The relationship with the related works is clearly presented.
- Experimental results support that the proposed model provides good predictive performance.
- The training algorithm scales linearly with the data size.
- The validity of the proposed model was evaluated on several real-world data.

### Weaknesses
- The good accuracy achieved by the proposed model is practically important, but the technical contribution of the model seems to be somewhat marginal because it is a reasonable but mediocre idea to use a GNN to model the inter-mark relationship in inference kernels, and any technical difficulty is not seen in the training algorithm.
- Any limitations of the proposed model are not discussed. For example, it seems that the intensity function of the proposed model could be negative even if the log-barrier method is adopted, while the conventional methods (e.g., RMTTP) are designed not to worry about it.
- (Minor comment) There are typos in Reference (e.g., rules of upper/lowercase is not consistent).

### Questions
- To the best of my knowledge, (Omi et al., 2019) doesn’t consider marks of each event in the model. How was FullyNN implemented in the experiment as a marked point process model?

### Summary
This paper introduces GNN into the spatio-temporal point process framework to enhance the expression ability of point processes on graph data. The idea of introducing graph neural networks to model the kernel of point processes is novel. The experimental results sufficiently support the effectiveness.

### Strengths
1. The paper is well-written and easy to follow.
2. The idea of modeling kernels in point processes by GNNs is novel and meaningful to the development of the community. The introduction of localized graph filters improves the scalability of our model when applied to large graphs.
3. The experiments are sufficient and support the main idea of this paper.

### Weaknesses
The main concern is the contribution of this article. Many previous works have tried to study point processes in the context of GNN. (For example, see [1]) From this perspective, this article is not innovative enough. Among them, the main idea of equation (2) comes from [2]. This article focuses on expressing the h_d function using localized graph filters. Although effective, the contribution appears to be limited.
