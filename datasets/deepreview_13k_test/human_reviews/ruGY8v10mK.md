# A Data-Driven Measure of Relative Uncertainty for Misclassification Detection

- Decision: Accept
- Scores: 6, 8, 6, 6

## Abstract
Misclassification detection is an important problem in machine learning, as it allows for the identification of instances where the model's predictions are unreliable. However, conventional uncertainty measures such as Shannon entropy do not provide an effective way to infer the real uncertainty associated with the model's predictions. In this paper, we introduce a novel data-driven measure of uncertainty relative to an observer for misclassification detection. By learning patterns in the distribution of soft-predictions, our uncertainty measure can identify misclassified samples based on the predicted class probabilities.  Interestingly, according to the proposed measure, soft-predictions corresponding to misclassified instances can carry a large amount of uncertainty, even though they may have low Shannon entropy. We demonstrate empirical improvements over multiple image classification tasks, outperforming state-of-the-art misclassification detection methods.

3: You are fairly confident in your assessment. It is possible that you did not understand some parts of the submission or that you are unfamiliar with some pieces of related work. Math/other details were not carefully checked.

### Summary
In this paper, the authors present a technique to learn their proposed uncertainty measure for misclassification detection. The learned uncertainty measure has a closed form solution which makes it easy to implement. The authors present a wide range of empirical results comparing against baselines trained with different loss functions, and looking at the ablation of various hyperparameters of their approach.

### Strengths
- The paper is well motivated and looks at the useful problem of identifying potential errors that models can make to avoid downstream problems. 

- The paper provides a theoretically sound approach to learning the uncertainty metric. 

- The ablation study provided by the authors is important in understanding the approach better given the # of hyperparameters in the approach.

### Weaknesses
- I think the paper can improve on its presentation. Most importantly, the authors should provide a clear description of how the learn their metric function $s_d$ because that's the crux of their paper. 

- While the ablation results provided by the authors are useful, this approach still requires a lot of knobs to be tuned, especially if someone is interested in applying it to a completely different application domain.

### Questions
- I think the paper would benefit from having an algorithm block just to clarify the exact learning procedure. For instance, information like the detector is tuned on a held-out set which the model wasn't trained out should be highlighted much clearly in the paper. 

- A high-level question here is: how is this different from some logit/feature transformation on held-out set? There has been some work in the literature (although around OOD detection) that looks at using latent representations from deep neural network backbone and training models that use them (see for e.g. [1]). I see that you have taken a slightly different approach here that looks at using closed form solution, but the idea seems very similar. Can you describe how your paper differentiates from this high-level approach of taking features from a deep net backbone and then applying some transformation to it to generate an uncertainty metric? 

- Building upon the prev point, would it make a lot of difference if you were to use a simple MLP architecture rather than the closed form solution you have right now to transform the soft outputs into an uncertainty measure that's being fine-tuned on held-out tuning set? The MLP can also be trained on held-out tuning set. 

- How do you think your approach compares with Bayesian neural networks which also introduce other forms of uncertainty such as model uncertainty? (see [2] for e.g.)

### Summary
In the paper, the authors propose a novel approach to learn a measure of "relative" uncertainty based on data. 
By utilising both positive (correctly classified) and negative (misclassified) instances, they construct a CxC matrix, which is needed for the proposed method.
This is an interesting approach, as typically to estimate uncertainty we use some ready-to-use formulas (like entropy or maxprob). And to the best of my knowledge, this is the first idea when misclassifications are directly used to derive a measure of uncertainty.

### Strengths
1. The paper is well written and I find it easy to follow.
2. The concept of learning a "relative" uncertainty measure from correctly and incorrectly classified data is innovative and novel.
3. The authors have provided a comprehensive experimental evaluation.
4. Authors provided code.

### Weaknesses
There are no major drawbacks that I see. But I think the following could improve the paper even further:
1. A more detailed discussion / description of the baselines, such as Doctor, would be beneficial. The same applies to different objectives like Mixup, RegMixUp etc.
2. I think it also should be mentioned that the paper is actually not the first one introducing a data-driven measure of uncertainty. There is a whole batch of works (see for example [1, 2, 3, 4]) that use data to derive estimates of epistemic or/and aleatoric uncertainties. I think it could help readers to correctly place the current paper in the right position in the broader research landscape.
3. A discussion on how "relative uncertainty" compares to well-known epistemic and aleatoric uncertainties would be insightful.

### Questions
Here I have not only questions, but also some comments.

1. Choice of lambda: can we choose it based on the data? Like $\lambda \sim \frac{1}{\text{Npos.examples}}$
2. In page 9: "no class labels required", but it is not really true. You need class labels to make positive/negative pairs. Saying this, I mean that we cannot use the approach in semi-supervised scenario, when objects without labels are available. We still need to know labels.
3. The confusion matrix in Figure 1, as I understood, was computed using the validation data. Shouldn't it be more fair to build it on test set?
4. In scenarios where there's a very good classifier and a high-quality dataset (like MNIST or CIFAR10, with low aleatoric uncertainty), there might be a significant imbalance between positive and negative samples. This could lead to the situation that the trained uncertainty measure is unreliable. How should one address this situation?

### Summary
This paper proposes to evaluate how classification model predictions tend to be wrong without knowing the groundtruth label. It proposes to calculate a distance matrix of different classes, and use it to calculate a measure for the task. Empirical evaluations using different model structures and data are conducted to compare the proposed method with existing entropy measures.

### Strengths
- The paper considers a practically important problem.
- It proposes a principled method and shows how to calculate with clear formulas.
- The proposed idea has a certain degree of originality.
- Thorough experiments are conducted and the source code is provided for reproduction.

### Weaknesses
- The paper is overall not easy to follow. For example, the related work section comes at a random place. Also, I encourage authors to conduct wider and more structured literature reviews, to cover related topics such as deep model calibration and classification with rejection, and present in a more structured way.
  - Please also give reivew on the measure of diversity investigated in Rao (1982), and how the proposed method is inspired. This accounts for the core contribution for the paper.
- Terminology is not unifed. For example, "soft-prediction", "the posterior distribution", "the predicted distrbution" is used, which seem to mean one same thing.
- Some words are used without clear definition or in a confusing way.
  - "feature" is used in cases where it seems to mean a data instance, such as an image.
  - lambda parameter for the proposed method is mentioned in experiments, but there is no definition.
- Presentation overall needs to be polished. See questions below.
  - At first, the presentation of "positive" and "negative" is confusing. I was even thinking about binary classification for a second.
  - In contribution 2, "closed-form solution for training REL-U" is confusing. In my opinion, if it is closed-form, usually is not considered as a traning process.

### Questions
- How to prepare positive and negative data for calculating the distance matrix at the first place?
- What does match and mismatch mean in experiments?
- Why use auc instead of the metric mentioned in Granese et al. 2021?

### Summary
The paper proposes a new measure to determine predictions’ uncertainty based on a distance between different labels that is found using additional data. Such distance can be found solving an optimization problem in closed form and the authors experimentally show the methods introduced obtain good results

### Strengths
The addressed topic is very relevant since the probabilistic assessment provided by supervised learning algorithms are often unreliable. The uncertainty metric introduced can be of interest and the fact that the distance between labels can be found in closed form is also valuable

### Weaknesses
In order to assess the paper contribution, the authors need to compare their methods with stronger techniques to assess predictive uncertainty, such as conformal prediction. For instance the authors could compare their method with a conformal predicition algorithm that instead of using data to obtain the uncertainty metric s_d, uses such data as calibration data to obtain prediction intervals. Such comparison is also important in that the assessment of prediction uncertainty in terms of prediction sets seems to be more useful in practice than that in terms of the metric s_d(x)

### Questions
Can you articulate the meaning of the metric in (3) in more precise terms? refer the distance d as an observer is a bit strange, what does the data-based distance d(y,y') describe?

It is not correct to refer to p_x,y as “probability density function” since Y has a finite range of values
