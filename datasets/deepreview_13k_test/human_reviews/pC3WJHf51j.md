## Abstract
Tracking biosignals is crucial for monitoring wellness and preempting the development of severe medical conditions. Today, wearable devices can conveniently record various biosignals, creating the opportunity to monitor health status without disruption to one's daily routine. Despite widespread use of wearable devices and existing digital biomarkers, the absence of curated data with annotated medical labels hinders the development of new biomarkers to measure common health conditions. In fact, medical datasets are usually small in comparison to other domains, which is an obstacle for developing neural network models for biosignals. To address this challenge, we have employed self-supervised learning using the unlabeled sensor data collected under informed consent from the large longitudinal Apple Heart and Movement Study (AHMS) to train foundation models for two common biosignals: photoplethysmography (PPG) and electrocardiogram (ECG) recorded on Apple Watch. We curated PPG and ECG datasets from AHMS that include data from ${\sim} 141$K participants spanning ${\sim} 3$ years. Our self-supervised learning framework includes participant level positive pair selection, stochastic augmentation module and a regularized contrastive loss optimized with momentum training, and generalizes well to both PPG and ECG modalities. We show that the pre-trained foundation models readily encode information regarding participants' demographics and health conditions. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that builds foundation models using large-scale PPG and ECG data collected via wearable consumer devices -- prior works have commonly used smaller-size datasets collected in clinical and experimental settings. We believe PPG and ECG foundation models can enhance future wearable devices by reducing the reliance on labeled data and hold the potential to help the users improve their health.

### Summary
This paper introduced foundation models for wearable sensor data using a large-scale population dataset of ECG and PPG signals. Its embeddings demonstrate generalization across an array of downstream tasks related to personalization and health inferences.

### Strengths
- Important domain with very limited available models 
- Solid results across an impressive array of downstream tasks
- Careful tuning and experimentation considering the idiosyncrasies of the data

### Weaknesses
- Some missing references and links to previous works
- Lack of discussion around scaling up the proposed models 
- No discussion around model/data release

### Questions
- The paper could better address previous research. For example, it claims that previous works employed biosignals recorded in clinical or controlled experimental settings, however, both [1] and [2] used large-scale _free-living_ datasets in the wild. 

- Regarding the augmentations, it is not clear whether assigned probabilities are found through hyper-parameter tuning or heuristics. I point the authors to this paper for further experimental decisions about the order and impact of these augmentations [3].

- There are very limited details about the availability of the dataset. Should we just assume it is private? Are there any public datasets that we could replicate (some of) the results of the paper? I would appreciate any discussion around these points.

- Given the number of participants, the paper could also attempt to increase the sequence length of the signals and assess whether longitudinal/day-level temporal dynamics can impact downstream tasks.

- The linear probing results and performance analysis should be put in context to previous works like [4], [2], and [5].

- The parameter size of the final model seems quite low considering the dataset size and number of participants. The paper could justify the word "foundation model" in its title by scaling up the experiments. For example, it should have been very exciting to find the Chinchilla-optimal parameter size for this sort of data. I would appreciate any discussions here around this topic, are there overfitting issues with bigger models? What about different architectures like Transformers?

### Summary
This paper employs self-supervised learning (SSL) on a large dataset comprising two types of data: photoplethysmography (PPG) and electrocardiogram (ECG) collected from the Apple Watch. The self-supervised learning is carried out on a comprehensive dataset, encompassing a vast span of 141K subjects.
Subsequently, the authors investigate various modules within the SSL framework to glean practical insights. They also elaborate on the effects of certain design choices, such as the selection of positive-negative pairs and data augmentation strategies.
The authors conducted a thorough evaluation and ablation studies for the foundational model they developed. The learned embeddings demonstrate predictive power across a wide array of downstream tasks, such as predicting demographic features and survey questions.

### Strengths
- The paper is well-articulated. The authors clearly presented the proposed method, experimental setup, and analysis.

- To the best of my knowledge, this represents the first attempt at training a self-supervised learning (SSL) foundational model for PPG and ECG data on such a grand scale. The results from this process offer valuable scientific insights.

- The authors conducted an exhaustive evaluation of the pretrained models. These pretrained embeddings were assessed against more than 50 diseases.

### Weaknesses
- There are potential concerns on the technical methodology front. While this study is the product of extensive training and evaluation, much of the methodology draws from pre-existing studies. Although there are several SSL studies tailored for time-series data, particularly in the realm of biosignals in healthcare, the authors did not extensively compare different model architectures. Readers might be keen to discern whether biosignal SSL performance is more contingent upon scale or the model architecture itself.

- While this study encompasses two modalities, it seems that the authors have considered them in isolation. Pretrained models have shown effectiveness across varied modalities like images and language. It would be beneficial for the authors to delve deeper into this aspect.

- The pretrained embedding for PPG appears to encapsulate more information than its ECG counterpart. This raises a question: given that PPG is passively sampled and ECG is actively collected by users, could this disparity in data collection methods influence such an outcome? Additionally, conventional clinical diagnoses often rely on 12-lead ECG or periodic information like HRV derived from ECG. It would be valuable if the authors could elucidate more why the ECG embedding doesn't seem as informative as the PPG.

- Lastly, the authors note that positive pairs are drawn from the same individual. However, a person's PPG and ECG patterns can vary based on different conditions or circumstances. It might be more insightful for the authors to determine positive pairs by taking additional attributes into account.

### Questions
- Even if the authors intend to display only aggregated information, it would be beneficial for them to include a representative visualization of both PPG and ECG signals. This would provide readers, especially those without a healthcare background, with a clearer understanding.

- In Figure 2, both PPG and ECG embeddings demonstrate good separability based on subject IDs. However, I'm curious if two subjects with similar demographic attributes should be distinctly separated.

- While ECG and PPG are pivotal for evaluating physiological status, there are also numerous other parameters to consider, such as HRV, heart rate, and possibly activity levels. The authors might wish to discuss this aspect further.

### Summary
The paper presents a significant advancement in the domain of health monitoring using wearable devices, specifically focusing on the tracking of biosignals, namely photoplethysmography (PPG) and electrocardiogram (ECG). Recognizing the potential of these biosignals, the authors highlight a major challenge: the lack of large, curated datasets with medically annotated labels for developing neural network-based biomarkers. To circumvent this, they leverage the Apple Heart and Movement Study (AHMS) and harness a self-supervised learning framework for training foundation models on PPG and ECG data from approximately 141,207 participants over a span of three years. This self-supervised approach integrates a participant level positive pair selection, stochastic augmentation, and a regularized contrastive loss optimized through momentum training. The authors demonstrate that these pre-trained models encode substantial information related to participant demographics and health conditions. Notably, this work distinguishes itself as the pioneering effort in building foundation models for PPG and ECG using large-scale data sourced from consumer wearables, as opposed to traditionally smaller datasets from clinical settings. The potential applications of these models are vast, with implications for enhancing wearable device capabilities, reducing reliance on labeled data, and ultimately benefiting users' health.

### Strengths
Strengths:
1. **First Work on Foundation Models for Wearable Biosignals**:
The research stands out as the pioneering effort to develop foundation models specifically for biosignals—photoplethysmography (PPG) and electrocardiogram (ECG)—collected via wearable devices. Such biosignals offer a treasure trove of biological and cardiac information, which can be instrumental in monitoring users' overall health. The convenience of wearable devices combined with the potential of these foundation models paves the way for continuous health tracking without disrupting daily routines, potentially leading to the early detection of health issues.

2. **Extensive Evaluation Using Linear Probing**:
The authors conducted a comprehensive evaluation of the trained models using linear probing for a plethora of tasks. This includes gender classification, age prediction, and both classification and regression for Body Mass Index (BMI). Furthermore, they delved into predicting variables extracted from questionnaires, providing a holistic understanding of the models' capabilities. The utilization of smooth effective rank as an evaluative measure underscores the robustness of the evaluation.

3. **Participant Level vs. Segment Level Positive Pairs**:
An intriguing facet of the research was the comparison between participant level and segment level positive pairs. This distinction is crucial because the granularity at which positive pairs are chosen can significantly impact the model's performance. The exploration of this dimension offers valuable insights into the optimal approaches for training foundation models on biosignals.

4. **Benchmarking with Other SSL Methods**:
To validate the efficacy of their approach, the authors benchmarked their models against established self-supervised learning (SSL) methods, such as SimCLR and BYOL. Such a comparative analysis not only situates the research within the broader landscape of SSL but also provides tangible metrics to gauge the relative performance of their models.

5. **Curation of a Large Dataset**:
One of the paper's major contributions is the meticulous curation of a vast dataset from the Apple Heart and Movement Study (AHMS) for the training of foundation models. With data spanning approximately 141,207 participants over three years, the effort required to curate, clean, and prepare such a dataset for effective training cannot be understated. This endeavor not only underscores the thoroughness of the research but also sets a precedent for future studies aiming to leverage large-scale datasets for health applications.

### Weaknesses
Areas for improvement:

1. **Exploration of KoLeo Regularization**:
An area of potential exploration is the specific impact of the KoLeo regularization on the model's performance. Ablation studies that incrementally remove or vary the strength of KoLeo regularization could provide clarity on its role and efficacy. Such an analysis would help in understanding whether the regularization is crucial for the model's success, and to what extent it contributes to the overall performance. This is particularly important as the unique characteristics of biosignals may interact with regularization techniques differently compared to other domains.

2. **Inclusion of All Results**:
Transparency and completeness in research reporting are essential for reproducibility and peer review. Therefore, it is recommended that the authors include all results, particularly those referenced as "results not shown" within the main body of the paper or the appendix. Having access to these results would allow the scientific community to fully evaluate the findings, methodologies, and claims made within the paper. It would also enhance the credibility and utility of the work for those looking to build upon it.

3. **Augmentation Impact Analysis**:
The paper would benefit from a deeper dive into the effects of various augmentation techniques on the performance of the biosignal models. Unlike image data, where the impact of different augmentations is well-studied, the domain of biosignals remains relatively unexplored in this aspect. An appendix providing detailed results and analysis of how different augmentations influence the learning process would be invaluable. This could include which augmentations contribute most to model robustness or performance, and any augmentation-specific phenomena observed with biosignals. Given the novelty of the field, such insights could be highly influential for future research in biosignal analysis.

4. **Demographic details missing**: The paper would benefit greatly from a more detailed presentation of demographic information related to the participants whose data underpin the foundation models. Such information is essential for assessing the diversity and representativeness of the dataset, which in turn, influences the generalizability of the model across various populations. The current omission of granular demographic details leaves a gap in understanding the scope of the model's applicability. It is recommended that the authors include statistics on age, gender, ethnicity, and other pertinent demographic factors. This would not only enhance the transparency of the research but also allow for a more nuanced evaluation of the model's performance across different demographic groups.

### Questions
**Concern Regarding Dataset Availability**:
The dataset from the Apple Heart and Movement Study (AHMS) is central to this research, offering immense value to the broader scientific community. However, the paper doesn't clarify if the dataset will be open-sourced upon acceptance. The release of this dataset, along with the associated models and code, is pivotal for reproducibility and further research.

If the authors don't have ownership of the dataset, detailed instructions on sourcing it would be essential. I kindly request clarity on this matter, as it will influence my final assessment of the paper.

### Summary
The proposed work presents a self-supervised learning (SSL) method for foundation models training using a large, longitudinal, multi-year dataset of unlabelled PPG and ECG samples recorded on Apple Watch devices. The performed experiments showed that the pre-trained models can readily encode participant demographics, conditions and medication. The introduced SSL framework incorporates various techniques, such as stochastic augmentation module or participant level positive pair selection proved to behave better than segment level selection. The work flows logically with a comprehensive analysis of how well PPG and ECG embeddings encode participants' information and ablation study of various parameters used in the work. The motivation of the work is clear and the method was compared to other existing techniques proving its robustness.

### Strengths
1) The work proposes pre-training of foundation models to a new domain using real data, acquired in uncontrolled environment, acquired over a  long period of time, what is a good indicator of how robust the method is.
2) Comprehensive analysis that includes comparison with other methods, linear probing to analyze how well both embeddings encode participants' information and a detailed evaluation of which one is more predictive, ablation study including analysis of visual representations after dimensionality reduction, validation loss and dispersion ratio. 
3) Presented results support claims made in the work, showing robustness of the introduced method and ability to encode participants' information.
4) Overall the soundness and completeness of the work is good in my opinion.

### Weaknesses
1) It would be great to include a figure representing the model showing encoder, MLP head and other implementation details.
2) What was the reason for choosing the InfoNCE loss vs. e.g., the normalized temperature-scaled cross entropy loss (NT-Xent) from SimCLR?
3) Usually large batch sizes and more learning steps are beneficial in SSL, have you experimented with even bigger batch sizes than 256?
4) Could you clarify the reason for selecting this specific encoder and specific embedding sizes, have you experimented with other models?
5) Are you going to make the dataset public?

### Questions
1) Would you be able to include results for PPG model trained on a smaller dataset (similar number of segments as ECG)? I believe this would be useful for comparing the behavior of the method given similar amount of data.
2) Have you thought about using both modalities in one model? Do you think that modulating, e.g., ECG with PPG embeddings would improve accuracy? Such approaches are useful when one modality is less descriptive than the other, so I was interested in learning more about your thought of how this would apply to this use case.
3) How easily will it be to improve the current labels given that they were acquired using self-reported metrics and tracing it back seems impossible?
