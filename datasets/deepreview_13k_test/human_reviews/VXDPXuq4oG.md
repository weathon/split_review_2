# Order-Preserving GFlowNets

- Decision: Accept
- Scores: 6, 6, 8, 6, 6

## Abstract
Generative Flow Networks (GFlowNets) have been introduced as a method to sample a diverse set of candidates with probabilities proportional to a given reward. However, GFlowNets can only be used with a predefined scalar reward, which can be either computationally expensive or not directly accessible, in the case of multi-objective optimization (MOO) tasks for example. Moreover, to prioritize identifying high-reward candidates, the conventional practice is to raise the reward to a higher exponent, the optimal choice of which may vary across different environments. To address these issues, we propose Order-Preserving GFlowNets (OP-GFNs), which sample with probabilities in proportion to a learned reward function that is consistent with a provided (partial) order on the candidates, thus eliminating the need for an explicit formulation of the reward function. We theoretically prove that the training process of OP-GFNs gradually sparsifies the learned reward landscape in single-objective maximization tasks. The sparsification concentrates on candidates of a higher hierarchy in the ordering, ensuring exploration at the beginning and exploitation towards the end of the training. We demonstrate OP-GFN's state-of-the-art performance in single-objective maximization (totally ordered) and multi-objective Pareto front approximation (partially ordered) tasks, including synthetic datasets, molecule generation, and neural architecture search.}

### Summary
This work proposes to extend GFlowNets, called Order-Preserving GFlowNets (OP-GFN), to sample candidates in proportion to a reward function such that the sampling is consistent with the provided partial order of the candidates. By this extension, they show how exploration and exploitation can be controlled, such that candidates higher in the hierarchy can be given more preference. The method shows benefits for both single objective and multi-objective cases by conducing experiments on a variety of tasks.

### Strengths
1. The paper introduces an important extension of the GFlowNets for multi-objective optimization when D > 1 objectives need to be optimized. 
2. The work also discusses how an efficient utilization of the GFlowNet policy can be achieved in difficult to explore settings.
3. The theoretical results and analysis are useful to understand the proposed method and its advantages.
4. The work also provides a good overview of the literature to benefit the reader.

### Weaknesses
1. The experiments section can be expanded to include more difficult environments. For example, for hypergrid,higher values of H and N can be tested as larger grids will help analyzing the exploration problems better.
2. Detailed balance objective can perform reasonably well in many settings. It will be beneficial to include it in all methods and numbers reported.
3. It will be useful to add standard deviation and error bars across experiments. It will also be useful to better understand the variance across different GFlowNet objectives and baseline methods.

By addressing these concerns with experiments, the authors will help address the empirical limitations to strengthen their theoretical discussions and the overall contribution.

### Questions
1. Is it possible to include some more difficult configurations of the environments? Hypergrid is one easy example for such an experiment.
2. It would be helpful if the variations across different seeds and runs could be provided for the experiments.
3. A hyperparam search for the best learning rate can also be sometimes a big contributing factor across different learning methods.

If these could be provided along with the comments in the weaknesses, section it will help in addressing most of my concerns towards the experimental contribution of this work.

### Summary
The paper introduces an innovative approach for training GFlowNets, eliminating the necessity for an explicit formulation of the reward function while ensuring compatibility with the provided order of candidates. This method involves the simultaneous training of a reward function, which maintains the order of samples in conjunction with GFlowNet. The authors conducted comprehensive experiments in both single and multi-objective settings, revealing that their proposed approach yields outstanding results in comparison to prior methods when dealing with only pairwise order relations and non-convex Pareto fronts.

### Strengths
The paper conducts extensive experiments under different objective settings and domains. Especially, the paper conducts experiments on NAS benchmark, which is a first attempt to apply GFlowNets into NAS while it is natural as we can make neural architecture by adding operations in a sequence manner. It also achieves superior results compared to other baselines in NAS benchmark.

The paper also tackles multi-objective problems with a non-convex Pareto front, which is hard to solve with prior multi-objective GFN methods such as PC-GFN. Additionally, the paper eliminates the necessity for fine-tuning the temperature parameter, β, which plays a critical role in GFlowNets' performance.

### Weaknesses
1. There is a possibility of encountering non-stationarity issues when jointly training GFlowNets and the reward function. It might be worth exploring alternative training strategies to mitigate this potential challenge.

2. Experimental results are not that persuasive, having little improvement over baselines. For example, this work just compares with simple GFN baseline in molecular tasks, more competitive baselines (e.g., subTB, FL-GFN, RL methods) are needed.

**Discussion needed regarding temperature conditioning methods**

There are some researches on temperature-conditioned GFlowNets, which learn a single model for multiple reward functions conditioned on different temperatures. It may be more persuasive to compare the proposed method with the following literature [1], [2], especially in single-objective settings. Note that reviewer understands that temperature-conditioned GFlowNets are too recently proposed, so the authors could not reflect this in this submission but suggest making some discussion in the final version for future researchers!

**Decision**

This work is novel, well-written, easy to understand, and provides insight for GFN communities. Although experimental results do not strictly outperform every competitive baseline, this work provides a lot of experiments over various tasks. To this end, the score would be 6.

### Questions
**Section 4.2**

Authors say that they compare the proposed method with GFN-$\beta$, where $\beta$ is the selected value from the previous work. As far as I know, the temperature is not tuned in the previous work. What if we assign high values to $\beta$? It seems that we can achieve higher topk reward by sacrificing diversity when we assign high values to $\beta$ and authors only consider maximal objective in single-experiment setting

**Section 5.2, 5.4**

Authors say that they use a replay buffer and do off-policy training. I am curious that as the reward function is trained across training, off-policy training may lead to degrading performance. 

**Minor Questions**

Section 4.1) $u_0\$ seems a typo. Maybe $R_0$?

Section 4.3) Authors propose two implementation tricks, KL regularization and trajectories augmentation. Especially trajectories augmentation has shown superior results in the previous paper. It is hard to capture when those two tricks are applied. While authors say trajectory augmentation is applied in molecule design (E.3.2), main paper say that trajectories augmentation is optionally used in NAS environment. It may be helpful when those two tricks are applied across differnt experiment settings.

### Summary
The paper proposes to use the GFlowNet framework to learn samplers of optimal points based on given orderings. This is useful because it applies to single and multi-objective problems alike.

The method works by learning a reward function that minimizes the divergence between the optimality distribution (i.e. the indicator function around the argmax of $\mathcal{X}$) and the distribution induced by the learned reward function, as learned by a GFlowNet. This function is learned simultaneously with the corresponding GFlowNet sampler that tries to match this non-stationary reward, which at convergence neatly results in finding the optimal points.

### Strengths
The idea proposed in the paper is solid and the execution is well done; the method is tested on a whole variety of tasks and relevant setups.  
The idea certainly relates to other rank-based methods, such as those in RL & search, but stands on its own in the GFlowNet framework.

### Weaknesses
My biggest criticism of the paper is really its presentation.

It's really not clear what the algorithm actually is, readers have to go all the way into the appendix to find it, and even there some questions remain, are $\mathcal{T}$ and $\mathcal{D}$ distinct? What is $\hat R$ trained on? Does it have distinct parameters? Shared? etc.   
From scrolling through the appendix, it appears that there are, understandably, a number of tricks that can be used. Most of them have some form of ablation in one task or the other, but a cohesive summary is lacking. The main criticism here is that it's important to disentangle what the contribution is from the algorithm itself, and from the tricks.

Investigative figures like Fig. E.6 should really be in the main body of the paper, and it would be much nicer to have such a figure for more complex domains. Generally the paper doesn't do a great job of showing _why_ the method works empirically.

### Questions
Notes:
- For someone not familiar with GFNs, Eq (3) may not be obvious (R being parameterized "through" P_F P_B & Z)
- I'm not sure that I fully appreciate the "piecewise linear" part of the contribution. Is there something I'm missing?
    - First of all, the whole thing is discrete and operating on sets. It makes no sense to talk about piecewise linearity because we are not in $\mathbb{R}$, the pieces "in between" don't even exist.
    - Ignoring the above, the shape of the function doesn't really matter? What matters is $\mathrm{order}(a,b) \equiv \mathrm{order}(\hat R(a), \hat R(b))$, which follows in a fairly straightforward way once we assume 0 loss.
- Proposition 3/6 is similarly weird, why this specific choice of MDP? I'd recommend either introducing why this choice matters, or maybe at least state that the general case is much harder to provide theoretical statements for. I find the current form a bit awkward
- 4.2; the authors seem to be using the molecular setup of Shen et al., not Bengio et al.. Shen et al.'s setup is quite different (and more simple, the state spaces are made to be much small so that computing $p(x; \theta)$ becomes tractable). It would be appropriate to note this. It's not clear what "choices" the authors are using from Shen et al. since quite a few are introduced in that work (which appear to have a significant impact)
- "optionally use the backward KL regularization (-KL) and trajectories augmentation (-AUG) introduced in Appendix E.1", these options don't seem to have that much impact, but it's a bit weird that they're just mentioned in passing in the main text.
- "we observe that OP-GFNs can learn a highly sparse reward function that concentrates on the true Pareto solutions, outperforming PC-GFNs." It's a bit weird to claim here that OP-GFNs are outperforming PC-GFNs, because they learn entirely different things. From Fig 5.1 it seems like PC-GFN is attributing some probability mass on the Pareto front points, which suggests to me that it has discovered them. 
    - This is maybe more of a comment on RL literature, but I'm also not a fan of comparing algorithms on a grid. Gridworlds are useful to sanity check algorithms, not to compare algorithms.
- In Sections 4 & 5, it would be good to clarify what work introduced what task and what MDP setup which is being used.
- Why build on GFlowNets? Don't get me wrong I'm a big fan of GFNs, but it seems to me like the use-case of that framework is to obtain "smooth" energy-based amortized samplers, whereas the proposed work is meant to converge to an extremely peaky distribution where essentially $p(x^*)=1$, and is much more akin to finding the optimal greedy policy in RL. There may be a very good reasons (I can think of some ;) but I think the paper could do a better job of explaining them.

### Summary
The paper proposes OP-GFN, order-preserving GFlowNets, that sample with probabilities in proportion to a learned reward function instead of explicitly defined reward, the learned reward is compatible with a provided partial order on the candidates. OP-GFN promotes exploration in the early stages and exploitation in the later stages of the training by gradually sparsifying the reward function during the training. The authors provide theoretical proof that the learned reward is piecewise log-linear with respect to the ranking by the objective function. OP-GFN are proposed for both the single-objective maximization and multi-objective Pareto approximation problems, where experimental results on synthesis environment HyperGrid and two real-world applications NATS-Bench and molecular designs demonstrate competitive performance.

### Strengths
The theoretical contribution of the paper is sound and novel, where1)  the log reward being piecewise linear with respect to the ranking enables exploration on the early training stages and the exploitation on the later sparsified reward R is a useful and desirable feature in many training procedures; 2) matching the flow F with a sufficiently trained OP-GFN will assign high flow value on non-terminal states that on the trajectories ending in maximal reward candidates, enabling sampling optimal candidates exponentially more often than non-optimal candidates.			

There is a range of comprehensive experimental results with details in the main document or in the supplementary material

The paper is well written and organized, making it easy to follow.

### Weaknesses
There can be more comparison against other state-of-the-art methods in the experimental section. The experiments, such as the hypergrid, only compares against the GFN-TB method. If the exploration-exploitation is the main benefit of OR-GFN in single objective problems, having more baseline comparison that encourages exploration of TB (such as https://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.17693.pdf or other variations of the reward besides beta-exponentiating) can make the paper stronger. 

In single-objective maximization, the form of the local label y of the Pareto set is explicitly given in section 3.2, however in the multi-objective case, it is not clear how the label y can be calculated a priori, when the Pareto fronts are unknown. “When the true Pareto front is unknown, we use a discretization of the extreme faces of the objective space hypercube as P.” It is not clear whether the proposed method works due to the good estimate of the P, i.e., whether GGN can also benefit from incorporating estimated Pareto fronts into reward definition somehow.

### Questions
In section 4.2, the results shown are for the top-100 candidates, are the results similar for other choices of K? 

In the experiment on neural architecture search, in Figure 4.2 the test accuracy comparison is against the clocktime, could you plot against the number of samples to understand the impact of learning the reward and sample efficiency of OR–GFN?

Have you considered other reward schemes besides the exponentially scaled reward? For example, some UCB-variant of the reward to balance between exploration vs exploitation?

The paper studies an interesting problem of GFlowNets -- training an order-preserving GFlowNets. The paper is also well-written and easy to follow.

### Weaknesses
> Note, that the optimal $\beta$ heavily depends on the geometric landscape of $u(x)$.

There have been a few related works that attempt to determine the optimal $\beta$ either from the perspective of dynamically annealing temperature or training a temeperature-conditioned GFlowNet that can generalize across a set of different temperatures. 

In addition, it would be better to also compare OP-GFN with these baselines besides GFN-$\beta$.

> Therefore, we only focus on evaluating the GFlowNet’s ability to discover the maximal objective.

If the goal is to discover the maximal objective, why do you use GFlowNets and not RL, wher the latter learns an optimal policy that maximizes the return.

>  The ability of standard GFlowNets, i.e. $R(x) = u(x)$, is sensitive to $R_0$.

The performance of trajectory balance is indeed senstive to the value of $R_0$ (which is also mentioned in the paper), which leads to large variance. However, this is usually not the case for flow matching, detailed balance, and sub-trajectory balance. It would be better to make this claim in a more clear way. In addition, it would be better to include a more extensive study of OP-GFN with other more advanced learning objectives (e.g., FM, DB, SubTB with temporal difference based objective) with a more thorough discussion. 

> Large $R_0$ encourages exploration but hinders exploitation since a perfectly trained GFlowNet will also sample non-optimal candidates with high probability; whereas low $R_0$ encourages exploitation but hinders exploration since low reward valleys hinder the discovery of maximal reward areas far from the initial state. 

$R_0$ actually determines the sparsity of the reward function -- with a larger $R_0$, the reward function is less sparse, while a smaller $R_0$ corresponds to a high sparsity in the reward function. Therefore, it is inappropriate to say that "Large $R_0$ encourages exploration" and "low $R_0$" encourages exploitataion. Whether encouraging exploration (or exploitation) for the agent is determined by the learning algorithm itself, instead of $R_0$ (which is the underlying environment).

> We observe that the OP-GFN outperforms the GFN-β method by a significant margin.

It would be better to also include more advanced baselines and methods in the field of NAS.
