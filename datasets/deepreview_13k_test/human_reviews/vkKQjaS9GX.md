# SDM-RL: Steady-State Divergence Maximization for Robust Reinforcement Learning

- Decision: Reject
- Scores: 5, 3, 3, 3

## Abstract
While reinforcement learning algorithms have achieved human-level performance in complex scenarios, they often falter when subjected to perturbations in test environments. Previous attempts to mitigate this issue have explored the training of multiple policies with varied behaviors, yet these efforts are compromised due to suboptimal choices in diversity measures. Such measures often lead to training instability or fail to capture the intended diversity among policies. In this research, we offer a unified perspective that ties together previous work through the common framework of maximizing divergence between steady-state probability distributions induced by different behavioral policies. Most importantly, we introduce an innovative diversity measure, simply used as an intrinsic reward, that addresses the limitations of prior work. Our theoretical advancements are complemented by experimental evidence across a diverse set of benchmarks.

### Summary
The paper proposes a new measure for learning an ensemble of RL policies that exhibit behavioral diversity in an MDP, while solving the task at hand or achieving near-optimal environmental returns. The proposed measure builds upon the concept of maximizing the divergence between the steady-state visitation distributions of the component policies, a notion well-explored in existing literature. In practical terms, optimizing the measure involves augmenting the environmental reward with an intrinsic reward and employing any conventional RL algorithm. The authors contrast their approach with the existing diverse RL methods based on mutual-information maximization and use of successor features. Experiments in grid-world environment and MuJoCo continuous control locomotion environments indicate that the proposed method generates diverse policies that are more robust to environmental perturbations, compared to the baseline methods.

### Strengths
Designing algorithms for generation of high-performing, diverse RL policies is an interesting and challenging problem, with a wide variety of practical use cases. The authors provide a good motivation for their solution by highlighting the limitations of the existing methods – namely, the dependence of existing diversity measures on the current policy, that could lead to exploitation of the diversity reward and other hyperparameter tuning challenges. The detailed exposition on prior work on information-based and successor-feature-based methods is insightful and helps to contextualize the paper’s contribution.

### Weaknesses
The writing and presentation of the material needs improvements in several places. There are notational inconsistencies and unclear descriptions that make certain parts hard to grasp. The experiments sections could include better interpretations and intuitions about the observed trends.

### Questions
1.	Please add an algorithm box in the main paper that outlines the complete algorithm. It's difficult to understand how the paper's contributions work with the deep RL algorithms otherwise.
2.	The notations $\pi_{z^{-1}_i}$ and $\pi^{-1}_i$ denote the same entity I believe, but they seem to be mixed unnecessarily at places which causes confusion while reading. For example, Equation 1 uses the former, while the next line (which is describing the equation) uses the latter. Please be consistent wherever possible.  
3.	Equation 3 – the LHS seems to be incorrect. Please check the steady-state distributions inserted in the KL term.
4.	Equation 6 – check the LHS here as well. Should the distributions be put in the other order?
5.	The connection between Equation 3/4 and Equation 2 is not clear from the contents of section 3. To me, it became evident much later that you are learning a network (v) to estimate the distribution ratio: uniform(s)/d(s). Please add more details to Section 3 about this.
6.	It is claimed that the metric in Eq 2 is “independent” of the current policy. The metric still involves sampling states from the steady-state distribution under the current policy. Please properly qualify what you mean by “independence” in this context. 
7.	Theorem 1 – should it be “larger” instead of “smaller” in the statement?
8.	Grid-world Experiments – please add some explanation or intuitions as to why prior methods like Kumar et al. and Zahavy et al. collapse to a single policy in such a simple MDP. This observation is quite counter-intuitive to me. 
9.	All experiments – how many policies are trained simultaneously in the ensemble and what’s the effect of the ensemble-size on the algorithm? Also, it is possible to compute the overall diversity metric (Equation 2) as the training progresses and include a plot of this metric over time?

### Summary
This paper proposes a method for promoting diversity via an intrinsic motivation term that maximizes the entropy of the steady-state distribution.  The paper provides a way of more easily approximating this term by rewriting the KL divergence and using function approximation.

### Strengths
The paper attacks an important problem of discovering more diverse policies, which is often helpful in exploring new environments. They approached the problem differently than much of the prior work, offering some diversity in the study of promoting diversity in policies.

### Weaknesses
The paper is often quite vague. For instance, It was hard to tell what was claimed to be "ideal" and why that would be "ideal."  Theorem 1 references the "idea diversity measure," but there is never an equation or expression named that clearly. Similarly, for the "information-based diversity" and the "proposed diversity".  

Similarly, there are many equations in section 3 that are claimed to be related, but the relationships are never proven or stated formally. Where they are formal, they appear to be incorrect. For instance, equation 3 claims a direct correspondence between the KL divergence and a function approximator, which would not be true for a random neural network.  It's not clear how this function approximator factors into equation 2 since neither KL divergence nor the function approximator are listed in equation 2.

There are also many references to nitty-gritty details of other methods which are never introduced or made explicit enough to track down. For instance, the sentence before equation 5 states that it removes the need for an indicator variable, but it's not clear why that would otherwise have been needed.


A related issue to the lack of clarity is the lack of motivation. For instance, equation 2 appears quite arbitrary and is not really introduced. The justification comes later when it is claimed that it is equivalent to maximizing the entropy of the steady-state distribution but is easier to compute. If that is true, then "maximizing the entropy of the steady state distribution" should be the measure, and this should be later introduced as a way of more easily computing it.

Similarly, there is a claim in the introduction that having more policies helps robustness, but it is not clear why that would be.

### Questions
In what sense is maximizing entropy "ideal" when most random states of the system are useless or dangerous? For instance, most random arrangements of matter are useless, and most large random changes make society worse.

### Summary
The paper present an exploration strategy based on diversity that aims at maximizing "divergence between steady-state probability distributions induced by different behavioral policies". This diversity measure is used as an intrinsic reward. The paper provides some theoretical justifications as well as some experiments.

### Strengths
- The paper is overall well-written
- It tackles an important topic

### Weaknesses
- It is slightly unclear how the method is significantly different than other similar existing techniques. In particular, the following stated hypothesis seems to be achieved with other techniques: "Does the proposed measure induce diverse polices without collapsing to a single policy".
- It is unclear how the proposed method could scale to complex environments
- Some good practice for the experiments are not followed, for instance there is no standard deviation information for the results

### Questions
- In Table 1, it is written that all the polices except your own collapse "into an optimal policy resulting in them under-performing compared to our method in the test scenarios.". Other techniques such as adding an entropy regularizer in the policy could already achieve better performance than all the baselines used. Are there other relevant baselines that could be considered?
- Can you add standard deviation information for the results?
- Can you provide some clarifications to elements such as "the test environment was defined with additional unseen obstacles in the training"? It seems that obstacles are added but that the state the agent perceives is the same? Otherwise you could still get the optimal policy for the training environment but due to the generalization capabilities of neural networks, it could end up with different policies on unseen tasks.

### Summary
Classical robust MDP-based methods require knowledge about the permissible range of perturbations that can be applied to the environment in test time. To overcome it, diversity RL tries to generate different close to optimal behaviors in the training to have robustness in test time. However, previous methods are compromised due to suboptimal choices in diversity measures. This paper offers a new diversity measure, which could be used as an intrinsic reward. Finally, the authors justify the proposed diversity measure theoretically and empirically.

### Strengths
* The proposed diversity measure seems novel and theoretically closer to the ideal measure in the discrete state space setting

### Weaknesses
Quality:
* There is no standard deviation reported in experiments.
* The cumulative reward of proposed methods seems too bad in the continuous action scenario. 
* Since the authors don't provide any code to reproduce results, I am a little bit doubtful about the results of SAC. Due to the property of maximum entropy, SAC was shown to solve some robust RL problems by maximizing the lower bound on a robust RL objective [Eysenbach and Levine 2022, Maximum entropy RL solves some robust RL problems]. 
* It is better to give empirical results under different perturbations. Additionally, more results of other discrete environment (e.g., perturbed CartPole) and MuJoCo environment experiments (e.g., HalfCheetah, Walker) are expected.

Clarity:
* Currently, related works are placed between approach and experiments. It would be better as a subsection after the introduction to give readers more background knowledge.
* In Appendix A, there is no need to repeat the LHS of the equation again and again.
* Some typos
  * Section 2.1 -> (S, A, p, r)
  * Section 2.2 no (s, a) for \psi
  * Repeated proof and proof sketch after Theorem 1
