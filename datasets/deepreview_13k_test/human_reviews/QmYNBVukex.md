## Abstract
This work focuses on leveraging and selecting from vast, unlabeled, open data to \emph{pre-fine-tune} a pre-trained language model. The goal is to minimize the need for costly domain-specific data for subsequent fine-tuning while achieving desired performance levels. While many data selection algorithms have been designed for small-scale applications, rendering them unsuitable for our context, some emerging methods do cater to language data scales. However, they often prioritize data that aligns with the target distribution. While this strategy may be effective when training a model from scratch, it can yield limited results when the model has already been pre-trained on a different distribution. Differing from prior work, our key idea is to select data that nudges the pre-training distribution closer to the target distribution. We show the optimality of this approach for fine-tuning tasks under certain conditions. We demonstrate the efficacy of our methodology across a diverse array of tasks (NLU, NLG, zero-shot) with models up to 2.7B, showing that it consistently surpasses other selection methods. Moreover, our proposed method is significantly faster than existing techniques, scaling to millions of samples within a single GPU hour. Our code is open-sourced \footnote{Code repository: \url{https://anonymous.4open.science/r/DV4LLM-D761/}}. While fine-tuning offers significant potential for enhancing performance across diverse tasks, its associated costs often limit its widespread adoption; with this work, we hope to lay the groundwork for cost-effective fine-tuning, making its benefits more accessible.

### Summary
This paper introduces a data selection method GOT-D at the pre-fine-tuning stage to improve the task adaption performance. The setting assumes access to both the pre-training distribution and the target fine-tuning distribution, and the key idea is to prioritize samples that most effectively shift the pre-training distribution closer to the target fine-tuning distribution. GOT-D leverages the OT distance as the distribution discrepancy measure to construct the optimization objective. Experiments on diverse tasks demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed method.

### Strengths
1. This paper is well-motivated. It argues the data selection methods based on distribution matching do not directly apply to fine-tuning problems, then points out that the fine-tuned model reflects a weighted combination of pre-training distribution and fine-tuning distribution. This naturally introduces this paper’s idea that the selected data should pull the model toward the target task.

2. The evaluation spans a wide spectrum of tasks.

### Weaknesses
1. The baseline methods are limited. Although the related work discusses a batch of work for language data selection, only DSIR and DAPT (RTP on toxicity, TAPT on GLUE) are compared in the experiments. It will be more convincing to include more baseline methods or illustrate why some are excluded.

2. The performance improvements, particularly in Tables 3 and 4, seem marginal, especially when taking the standard deviations into account.

### Questions
1. To compute the OT distance, what’s the representation of the involved data points?

2. Because the pre-training dataset is undisclosed, the authors resort to a proxy dataset that has a composition proximate. Is it possible to implement a synthetic task where the pre-training dataset is known to verify the proposed method?

### Summary
This paper studies data selection for pre-fine tuning a pre-trained language model for fine-tuning.  The proposed approach uses OT to select a budgeted amount of data from a pre-training corpus that is different from the original pre-training data and similar to the downstream task data  to first continue training, then fine-tune on new data for the downstream task.  The proposed approach GOT-D shows improvements on domain adaptation tasks, GLUE benchmark, and fairness evaluations.

### Strengths
The proposed approach has clear motivation and intuition as the pre-training dataset can be quite different from the training set for the downstream tasks.  Holding out a specific subset based on downstream evaluations can help gradual transfer of the model leading to better performance.  OT is also a natural choice to compare distributions and select data, and authors note that this can be done quickly.   Authors compare with recent prior work in the space and demonstrate better performance on all tasks.

### Weaknesses
* The proposed approach shows only marginal improvement on a number of domain adaptation and GLUE benchmarks - les than 1% over prior approaches, and in some cases only 1% higher than baseline performance.  Another concern with the evaluation is that it is only evaluated on small models (128M) that may be trained with more limited data.  In contrast, it would be beneficial to evaluate whether using the pre-fine tune set also leads to better performance on a larger model (1/7B+).

* While the performance on toxic detection are strong, these improvements come at the cost of increased perplexity.  Further the (token?) perplexity of these models are quite high.  Regarding the above concern, authors can evaluate on a larger model with reduced perplexity to see if the impact increases perplexity at the cost of decreasing toxicity.

* Authors only conduct limited evaluation on the pre-fine-tuning dataset size at 50K and 150K.  An experiment at different amounts of data from small data to continual pre-training with comparison to prior works can help to better motivate GOT-D as an approach for selecting pre-fine tuning data.

* Part of the motivation appeared to be not needing as much data for the downstream task, however it appears they still need the full fine-tuning data.

### Questions
Q1: Where does the data for pre-fine-tuning come from? In the main text, the authors suggest that it can come from the Pile, however GPT-2 is trained on WebText, and not necessarily subsets of the Pile.  in this case, the experiments are adding more pre-training data where even in small amounts are expected to increase performance.

Q2: What type of data is selected from the pre-training set? Is there a comparison selected data vs. fine-tune data and random pre-train data?

### Summary
This paper tackles data selection for *pre-finetuning* LLMs in order to improve performance and reduce the need for manually curated fine-tuning data. The authors differentiate this setting from continued-pretraining, which has been explored in past works, because the data selection budget is assumed to be smaller. Their proposed method is then motivated by the key observation that the common practice of selecting data based upon distribution matching may lead to many redundant selections of examples already well-learned from pre-training. Instead, they choose the examples which most effectively nudge the training distribution closer to the target via optimal transport. They then test their method on toxicity prevention and language understanding tasks and compare to previous baselines.

### Strengths
Overall, the authors tackle a well-motivated problem and the high-level idea to avoid redundancy when selecting for fine-tuning data seems quite interesting/novel. Their method runs efficiently (compared to previous works), due to only requiring solving one OT problem, and holds promise for scaling up to larger datasets. The empirical results on the toxicity reduction are also impressive.

### Weaknesses
The two main areas of improvement for this paper are (1) presentation, particularly reducing reliance on the Appendix for key details; (2) more thorough experiments/ablations to assess the core aspect of their method (i.e., to me, this is the idea that it is important to "select data that is not redundant with pre-training")  

(1) Presentation
- There were several details that I think are important to share more up front. For instance, in the experiments, it should be clear both (a) what the candidate datasets are; (b) what feature space/function is being used to calculate costs in OT. I also think the different pre-processing steps different methods do to the candidate set should be mentioned. 
- While having an extended related work in the Appendix is fine, it would nice if more of this content could be covered in the main. 
- Some aspects of the notation could also be cleaned up (see Questions below)
- The All Domains baseline is mentioned on pg. 6 before being defined. 
 
(2) Experiments
- For the experiments in Sec 3.2-3.3, the improvements from GOT-D over previous baselines don't seem to be that much in most cases (i.e., within standard deviations)? Perhaps the authors can comment on significance here?
- Currently, it seems there are several differences between DSIR and GOT-D besides just that one does distribution matching and the other finds the most informative examples (given pre-training distribution). Particularly, they both involve preprocessing the candidate pool in and use different feature representations to perform selection (i.e., DistillBERT v.s. n-gram). I think more controlled ablations of these other factors are important to ablate what precisely causes GOT-D to perform better. 
- In the BERT experiments, do DSIR and DAPT/TAPT use the same pre-processing procedure to select relevant domains as described for GOT-D? I'd be curious what happens if this step is left out for GOT-D. 
- It would be nice to show some qualitative examples of what kinds of examples get selected by GOT-D but are not as emphasized in distribution matching approaches (e.g. DSIR).

### Questions
(1) In the introduction it is mentioned that *"Intuitively, fine-tuning a pre-trained model with such samples would boost its performance on the target dataset. We prove the validity of this intuition under certain assumptions, thereby setting our method on a solid theoretical foundation."* To me, this suggested there would be a formal theorem statement in the text that explicitly outlines assumptions and a guarantee? Section 2 does describe and link together some existing results in prose but it's not as clear what has been newly proven? 

(2) In the toxicity reduction experiments, am I correct in understanding that no methods did the second round of task-specific fine-tuning? If so, I don't think this would change the core conclusion but I think it is still important to include a baseline which trains on just the initial 2.5K target examples. Similarly, it would be nice to confirm that the improvements of GOT-D over other methods persists after doing the fine-tuning round on these examples. 

(3) As a general comment, the distinction between the terms "pre fine-tuning" and "continued pre-training" remains a bit unclear to me. My understanding from the paper is the same methods could be applied to both but the main difference is just how much data is involved. But in some places "pre-training" is still used a bit interchangeably (e.g.. *"This experiment involves two stages: pre-training over selected data and then fine-tuning over the downstream task."* in Sec 3.2, pg. 7). What is the motivation for defining the new term as opposed to saying something akin to "continued pre-training with limited budget"? 

(4) Miscellaneous
- It seems sometimes $D_S, D_R, etc.$ are used interchangeably to represent (finite) datasets and distributions. Perhaps the authors can make this distinction clearer? 
- In Eq. (3), should the last term of the expansion include $\lambda \cdot (D_U - D_S)$ instead of just $\lambda \cdot (D_U)$?
- The version of TAPT here seems to be the "curated-TAPT" described in Gururangan et al. rather than "TAPT", which I've more typically seen as just training on the unlabeled end-task inputs. Perhaps the authors can add a clarifying note here, or better, include results for both versions of TAPT. 
- In Table 3, it seems TAPT should be bolded for RCT. Also the text right above mentions "All domains" but it seems to be missing from the table?

### Summary
This work presents "pre-fine-tuning" as a method to utilize open, unlabeled data to enhance task adaptation of LLMs. It proposes a new strategy, GOT-D, which adjusts the pre-training distribution closer to the target distribution via optimal transport. Evaluations on various language tasks show the advantages of GOT-D in performance as well as efficiently handles millions of samples.

### Strengths
1. The idea of pre-fine-tune is novel and interesting. The proposed GOT-D is well motivated, theoretically principled, and scalable.
2. Extensive experiments show the superiority of the proposed method
3. Overall, the paper is well-organized and comprehensible, despite the inclusion of some mathematical derivations.

### Weaknesses
I don't see any major weakness of this work, but I'm not fully convinced by the idea of pre-fine-tune. For example, what if we jointly fine-tune the model on both the selected unlabeled dataset and the target dataset, like this prior work does [1]? 

In addition, it would be better to include in-depth study on the scaling of pre-fine-tune. For example, if we keep increasing the data for pre-fine-tune, would it lead to a reduction of need for target data?
