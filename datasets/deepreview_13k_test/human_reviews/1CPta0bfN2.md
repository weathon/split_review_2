## Abstract
Cross-encoder (CE) models which compute similarity
by jointly encoding a query-item pair perform better than
using dot-product with embedding-based models (dual-encoders) 
at estimating query-item relevance.
Existing approaches perform $k$-NN search with cross-encoders by 
approximating the CE similarity with a vector embedding space fit either with 
dual-encoders (DE) or CUR matrix factorization.
DE-based retrieve-and-rerank approaches suffer from poor 
recall as DE generalizes poorly to new domains and
the test-time retrieval with DE is decoupled
from the CE.
While CUR-based approaches can be more accurate than
the DE-based retrieve-and-rerank approach, such approaches
require a prohibitively large number of CE calls
to compute item embeddings, thus making it impractical 
for deployment at scale.
In this paper, we address these shortcomings with our proposed sparse-matrix factorization based method
that efficiently computes latent query and item representations to 
approximate CE scores and performs $k$-NN search with the approximate CE similarity.
In an offline indexing stage, we compute item embeddings by
factorizing a sparse matrix containing query-item CE scores
for a set of train queries.
Our method produces a high-quality approximation while 
requiring only a fraction of CE similarity calls 
as compared to CUR-based methods, and allows for leveraging 
DE models to initialize the embedding space while 
avoiding compute- and resource-intensive 
finetuning of DE via distillation.
At test time, we keep item embeddings fixed and perform retrieval over multiple rounds, 
alternating between a) estimating the test query embedding by 
minimizing error in approximating CE scores of items retrieved thus far,
and b) using the updated test query embedding for retrieving more items in the next round.
Our proposed $k$-NN search method can achieve up to 5\% and 54\% improvement 
in $k$-NN recall for $k=1$ and 100 respectively over the widely-used DE-based retrieve-and-rerank approach.
Furthermore, our proposed approach to index the items by aligning item embeddings with the CE 
achieves up to 100$\times$ and 5$\times$ speedup over CUR-based and 
dual-encoder distillation based approaches respectively while matching or improving
$k$-NN search recall over baselines.

### Summary
This paper considers a new approach to retrieval and indexing that attempts to match the accuracy of cross encoders with lesser training time. Cross-encoders based retrieval allows for computing a relevance function over query and each point in the retrieval corpus and finding the point(s) most relevant. As this are expensive for inference, in practice, dual encoders with separate encoding stacks for query and corpus are used with k-NN used to quickly find the most relevant documents. A compromise on cross-encoder is a CUR decomposition of the relevance signal. This paper proposed a method (AXN) that improves upon recall of dual encoder methods and is much faster than CUR based approaches.

AXN starts with a dual encoder (treated as black box) and iteratively mines for items near a query using the query's representation. Then it uses a cross encoder to score the limited set of items retrieved. It uses this to refine the query representation, search for another limited set of items and so on. The method limits the cross attention to far fewer items than the corpus size. Experiments show that AXN improves the recall of dual encoder and can match the recall of CUR methods.

### Strengths
1. AXN yields better recall than dual encoders with faster training times compared to CUR methods
2. They can build on any dual encoder methods (although experiments don't say if they improve on DE encoders)

### Weaknesses
1. The inference time and its comparison to simple DE+kNN approaches is not made clear. Would a large dual encoder with same inference time as AXN match its recall? Some of this is tucked away in the appendix in Fig 5 and 6 which seems to suggest the margins between DE and AXN are low normalized for inference cost.
2. The choice of DE is not discussed. Is it completely irrelevant? Is it being compared to state-of-the-art encoders?

### Questions
1. would a large dual encoder with same inference time as AXN match it's recall? Or would DE saturate well before AXN.
2. What is the unit on x-axis in Figure 6?
3. Could you talk about the scaling properties of your algorithm as the corpus grows larger? 
4. Why are not all methods not represented on each sub-figure in Figure 3?

### Summary
The authors proposed a sparse-matrix factorization-based approach to improve the efficiency of fitting an embedding space to approximate the cross-encoder for k-NN search. Unlike DE-based and CUR-based methods, which lack good generalizations and computation efficiency, the new AXN method constructs a sparse matrix containing a cross-encoder score of training queries and all items.  The item embeddings are learned from matrix factorization. During test time, AXN alternates between updating the query embedding and retrieving more items for k-NN indexing.

### Strengths
1. The authors proposed AXN, a novel cross-encoder-based k-NN search algorithm. By learning item embeddings from sparse matrix factorization and fixing them during query time, the algorithm is more computationally efficient than other methods.
2. The authors explained their method very clearly in section 2.
3. The extensive experiments and ablation studies supported their claims.

### Weaknesses
1. Figure 1's legends and corresponding subplots are hard to read. The subplots are too small, and hard to map points to the legends.

### Questions
1. In the experiment section it was not clear how many rounds of updates are performed in all AXN experiments. 
2. Consider fixing max of CE calls B_{CE}, but varying the number of iterative search rounds and the number of items to retrieve in each round. Will it affect AXN's performance and total indexing time?

### Summary
Cross-encoder (CE) models outperform Dual-encoder (DE) models (especially at zero-shot problems) in the ranking task but are very expensive to use during inference. To alleviate this usually a retrieve then re-rank approach is used where a set of items are first retrieved using a DE model and then further ranked by CE. This paper proposes an alternate approach where the CE model is first distilled into a lightweight factorized model and at test time query representation is iteratively fine-tuned such that the dot product between test query embedding and indexed item embeddings gets closer and closer to the CE assigned relevance. This approach helps in reducing the CE calls required to accurately rank items for the test query.

### Strengths
- The approach is simple to plug into existing retrieval and ranking frameworks
- The paper is in general well-written and easy to follow
- The proposed approach is compared against relevant baselines and the evaluation is thorough

### Weaknesses
- The proposed approach is evaluated only on zero-shot tasks, does this approach also benefits standard retrieval tasks
- Gains are primarily under fixed index time scenario which is usually a one-time cost

### Questions
- It is a bit surprising that RnR DE models are performing worse than TF-IDF on Hotpot, is it because this CE model was trained on triplets mined using TF-IDF?
- CE model is trained conditioned on some specific negativing mining distribution so maybe for RnR baselines we should also compare with a retrieval model which is the same as the retrieval model used for the negative mining so that the train and test-time behaviours are same
- For a given budget $X$ of CE calls, how should one distribute $X$ calls in the number of rounds and $K$ CE calls inside each round in AXN inference

### Summary
The paper proposes AXN, a test-time multi-run query embedding adaptation approach that leverages KNN search to approximate cross-encoder scores. This method successfully reduces the expensive computational costs associated with cross-encoder calculations, surpassing the performance of DE-based and CUR-based alternatives.

### Strengths
The paper presents a novel adaptive retrieval technique that utilizes a limited number of cross-encoder (CE) calls to approximate the quality of cross-encoder results. This approach is scalable to handle a large volume of items.

### Weaknesses
1)	This paper uses K nearest neighbor search to iteratively update query embedding and approximate cross-encoder results. However, many references of nearest neighbor search are missing.
2)	AXN utilizes sparse matrix to reduce index costs. The paper lacks detailed analysis regarding this technique's impact on results concerning varying degrees of sparsity.
3)	Both AXN and CUR-based methods need to compute low-dimensional embeddings for queries and items. AXN uses sparse matrix to reduce the cost. This can also be applied to CUR-based methods to reduce the index time. It is unclear if other techniques of AXN generate substantial improvements over CUR-based methods. It would be great if the authors can add more ablation study experiments.
4)	The paper only covers the total index time as a benchmark, and future exploration could include query latency measurements since various steps are executed many times, including Solve-Linear-Regression and topk search.
5)	It introduces lambda to ensemble the generated query embedding with a query embedding from DE or inductive matrix factorization. However, it fails to conduct an analysis of lambda impact on evaluation. It is the same for all experiments, or should be tuned in each experiment?
6)	It runs R times Solve-Linear-Regression and topk search. How to choose R? It is fixed in all experiments or should be tuned in each experiment? Should it be large in large dataset?
7)	The same problem for hyper-parameter Ks.

### Questions
1)	“CUR” appears without any definition.
2)	What is the topk search method? Is it brute-force search?
3)	Please address the above weaknesses.
