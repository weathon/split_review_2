- Decision: Reject
- Scores: 5, 6, 6, 8

## Abstract
The goal of this paper is to investigate distributed temporal difference (TD) learning for a networked multi-agent Markov decision process. The proposed approach is based on distributed optimization algorithms, which can be interpreted as primal-dual Ordinary differential equation (ODE) dynamics subject to null-space constraints. Based on the exponential convergence behavior of the primal-dual ODE dynamics subject to null-space constraints, we examine the behavior of the final iterate in various distributed TD-learning scenarios, considering both constant and diminishing step-sizes and incorporating both i.i.d. and Markovian observation models. Unlike existing methods, the proposed algorithm does not require the assumption that the underlying communication network structure is characterized by a doubly stochastic matrix.

### Summary
The paper studies the TD learning for a networked multi-agent Markov decision process. The authors use exponential stability of primal-dual ODE dynamics to study the convergence of TD learning. The authors characterize the solution error rates in both iid and Markovian sampling cases. A numerical example is used to show the performance.

### Strengths
- The paper is well organized and key results are explained well. 

- The authors provide a nice review of recent works on the exponential stability of primal-dual ODE dynamics when the constraint matrix is rank-deficient. 

- The authors study the exponential stability of a primal-dual ODE dynamics, which has improved the dependence on problem parameter. 

- The authors propose a new distributed TD learning algorithms, and characterize the solution error rates in both iid and Markovian sampling cases, which has weaker assumptions compared to other distributed TD learning algorithms.

### Weaknesses
- The exponential stability of primal-dual ODE dynamics is known in the literature when the constraint matrix is rank-deficient. The improvement is only some constant for a special case of objective and constraint functions, which might be not very important to the TD analysis. 

- The proposed distributed TD learning is based on a known distributed primal-dual ODE dynamics. The error rate analyses follow the Lyapunov-based analysis from the previous work. The technique novelty is questionable. 

- The conducted primal-dual ODE based analysis can only guarantee mean-path performance, which might be not very useful in practice due to large variance.   

- The provided example is artificial, and there is no comparison with existing distributed TD algorithms.

### Questions
- Is a missing $\mathbf{P}^\pi$ in projected Bellman equation?

- Can the authors provide numerical experiments to justify the convergence rates in Theorem 3.2? Why do you have an improvement? 

- Can the authors explain more how the new TD learning algorithm is built on the result of Wang and Elia (2011)? When does strongly convexity hold?  

- The dependence of solution error rates on problem parameters is not clearly explained. What are parameters $w$, $h_1$, $h_2$ in Theorem 4.2 and Theorem 4.3?

- Can the authors conduct comparison experiments with other existing algorithms?

### Summary
This paper provides a primal-dual perspective on the distributed TD-learning approach. The paper considers a distributed TD-learning setup where each agent shares its information to the neighbors. The parameter-update step is formulated as the dynamical system and then the paper uses Lyapunov theory to conclude about the stability (or, convergence to the equilibrium).

### Strengths
The distributed TD learning is an important question and this paper has provided new insights.

The results seem to be correct.

### Weaknesses
1. The paper only considers the average reward scenario. However, there can be another reward scenario (cooperative or competitive), can the result be extended to those setups?

2. There is already quite a bit of work on the multi-agent RL framework for the average-reward case. Please see [A1]. The authors should discuss both in terms of methodology and the results whether they are related or different. The above paper provides the sample complexity bound, and even consider general function approximation case.

3. In terms of practicality of the algorithm, there is an inherent assumption that each agent has the same feature space $\phi$, however, this might not be true in practice.

### Questions
1. Can the authors emphasize more on the technical challenges?

### Summary
•	This paper analyzes the finite time convergence results for multi-agent distributed TD learning algorithms under a partially connected networking setup. In the paper, they assumed each network agent has local policies and local reward functions, and the goal is to estimate the sum of rewards over all agents with linear local approximation parameters that can be shared with connected neighbors only. In the analysis, they first captured the stochastic algorithm by its continuous-time ODE counterpart, then consider the linear system as the primal-dual gradient dynamics and prove the convergence results through the Lyapunov method applied to the gradient dynamics. The author considered both constant and diminishing step-sizes and both iid and Markovian observation models in their results. Different from previous works, the modified the proof to make the results hold when the graph Laplacian of the associated network graph is not doubly stochastic matrix.

### Strengths
•	The strengths come from three parts. 
1) The first one is the proof is very sound. Based on that, in this paper, the convergence results are better than existing papers.
2) The second part is that the literature reviews seem to be very detailed, carefully performed, and up to date. 
3) The author used a lot of citations throughout the whole paper.

### Weaknesses
•	However, there are several weaknesses as far as from my perspective. 
•	The first one is I think the paper is not organized very well: the author mentioned several literature many times throughout the whole paper, which feels very tedious; when reading section 3, I was confused since I don’t know the reason of introducing and proving those lemmas until I read section 4, also the notations in section 3 do not closely correspond to the notations used in the rest of papers.
•	The second one is I think the simulation results are too little. In the paper they proved the convergence results for the constant and diminishing step size, but in the simulation section, both figures are for constant step size. I expect seeing diminishing step size case in the main body of the paper.
•	The third one is that the analysis doesn't feel very original. The main difference from the cited existing papers from my understanding are a linear mapping and a multiplication of LL^+. Also, the results rely on the relationship between the smallest and largest eigenvalue of the graph Laplacian, and I don’t know how many network graphs can meet those requirements.
•	There are several other definitions that are not clear, see below.

### Questions
•	In the abstract you mentioned your algorithm and method do not require the network structure characterized by a doubly stochastic matrix. But through the whole paper, I didn’t see an introduction to the doubly stochastic matrix and how it is related to communication networks. This is an important contribution of your paper, but I still don’t know what kind of networks correspond to a doubly stochastic matrix and what kind of networks do not. So I don’t know how significant the contribution is.
•	In the proof of theorem 4.2, when using constant step-size, the convergence results rely on the \lambda_max and \lambda_min of the network graph, and the choice of step-size also is based on the \lambda_max. I don’t know how many network graphs can meet the requirements on lambda max and min. Also, you provided an existing bound on lambda_max, so how hard is it to find the lambda_max and how hard is it to find a working eta since you require the eta≈1/ \lambda_max?
•	The citation when you mentioned total variation distance, ergodic and geometric decaying rate is confusing, you may want to cite the original paper that introduced them instead of a recent paper.

### Summary
The paper studies the distributed TD learning algorithms for multi-aget MDPs. Using ideas from distributed optimization and control systems, the paper presents a new distributed TD learning algorithm that does not requre of doubly stochastic communication matrix (which is often needed in the existing distributed TD learning algorithms). Finite-time error bounds are developed for the proposed algorithm under both iid and Markovian data models.

### Strengths
+ A distributed TD learning algorithm with requiring a doubly stochastic matrix;
+ Convergence rate results for the algorithm under both IID and Markovian data models;
+ Numerical verifications

### Weaknesses
- There exist some grammar issues, such as "there exists \bar{h}_1 amd \bar{h}_2..." "the proposed distributed TD-learning do not require". Please check and polish the presentation.
