# Pose Modulated Avatars from Video

- Decision: Accept
- Scores: 6, 6, 6

## Abstract
It is now possible to reconstruct dynamic human motion and shape from a sparse set of cameras using Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) driven by an underlying skeleton. However, a challenge remains to model the deformation of cloth and skin in relation to skeleton pose.
Unlike existing avatar models that are learned implicitly or rely on a proxy surface, 
our approach is motivated by the observation that different poses necessitate unique frequency assignments. 
Neglecting this distinction yields noisy artifacts in smooth areas or blurs fine-grained texture and shape details in sharp regions.
We develop a two-branch neural network that is adaptive and explicit in the frequency domain.
The first branch is a graph neural network that models correlations among body parts locally, taking skeleton pose as input.
The second branch combines these correlation features to a set of global frequencies and then modulates the feature encoding. 
Our experiments demonstrate that our network outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of preserving details and generalization capabilities.

### Summary
This paper introduces a method for pose-modulated animatable human avatar creation using Nerfs. The key idea that the paper introduces is to modulate the frequencies of the sinusoidal embeddings used to encode input 3D locations, before they are input into the Nerf's MLP for inference, depending on their local position and nearest bones' pose. These are key to modeling fine-grained texture details of folds caused by bone deformation on clothing, etc. To achieve this the authors propose a module to that first encodes the poses of joints via a graph neural network structure and then predict the frequency modulation of a 3D location based on its local bone's encoded GNN features and position in 2D space relative to the skeletal structure. The authors compare the proposed method to several existing competing methods, both qualitatively and quantitatively, and observe superior performance for their method.

### Strengths
In terms of novelty, the problem of animatable neural human avatar creation is a widely studied one. However this paper proposes the original new idea of modulating the frequency bands used in Nerfs to correctly learn to model wrinkles on clothes based on the deforming pose. This idea is conceptually sound and provides an interesting novel insight to the problem of human avatar creation. Modeling the deformation of loose clothing is still a fairly unsolved problem within this domain and hence advances the field forward.

The proposed solution and experimental methodology are technically sound. The paper will well-written and structured. Many details are described in the supplement. The authors have promised to released the code.

### Weaknesses
The main weaknesses are in terms of the results and experiments. 

1. Overall the results in the supplementary videos are quite blurry. The effect of the improvement in texture quality of the wrinkles with the proposed method are also subtle and hard to really appreciate. The numerical results in Table 2 of the paper correlate with this fact and show marginal numerical improvement in the reported metrics. Do the authors believe these numerical improvements are statistically significant?

2. For the novel view synthesis task, I am curious as to why the authors did not compared against the following several more recent state-of-the-art methods, which result in higher rendering quality.

a) Guo et al., Vid2Avatar: 3D Avatar Reconstruction from Videos in the Wild via Self-supervised Scene Decomposition, CVPR 2023.

b) Jiang et al.,  Neuman: Neural human radiance field from a single video, ECCV 2022.

c) Weng et al., Humannerf: Free-viewpoint rendering of moving people from monocular video, CVPR 2022.

d) Yu et al., MonoHuman: Animatable Human Neural Field from Monocular Video, CVPR 2023.

3. Related also to question 2, is why did the authors choose to not report quantitative metrics for geomtric reconstruction quality and compare it to the existing state-of-the-art methods listed in question 2?

### Questions
I would like to see the authors' response to the questions I have posed in the "weaknesses" section of my review. 

Overall, I feel that while the idea of pose-conditioned frequency modulation to model wrinkles on clothing is interesting and worth sharing with the wider research community, the rendering quality of the proposed method is below that of the state-of-the-art methods. It would have been ideal if the authors had built their method on of the more recent high-quality nerf-based human avatar methods to achieve both overall high-quality and improvements in modeling of surface wrinkles.

5: You are absolutely certain about your assessment. You are very familiar with the related work and checked the math/other details carefully.

### Summary
The authors tackle the problem of human avatar modeling from a monocular video sequence. The paper proposes a pose-driven frequency modulation approach for the underlying NeRF model to achieve a higher accuracy of the rendered images. This approach is shown to be effective for modeling people with tight closing compared to some of the baseline methods.

### Strengths
- The problem of avatar modeling has high practical significance
- The frequency modulation approach makes sense to introduce the details in cases where they are required, which can serve as a regularization measure
- The paper is fairly well written

### Weaknesses
- The comparison lacks modern baselines, such as Vid2Avatar, MonoHuman, and HumanNeRF, which were referenced in the related work.
- Video results have very low FPS, and therefore, the temporal smoothness of the proposed approach cannot be evaluated.
- It is unclear whether or not GNNs are actually needed for this task, ex. Vid2Avatar uses pose conditioning without GNNs to directly produce the embeddings via an MLP
- No experiments on loose clothing where the method's effectiveness for high-frequency clothing modeling can be asserted.

### Summary
The paper presents a framework that learns an animatable human body model from video without relying on surface information. The approach builds on previous research by incorporating frequency modeling with pose context. The experiments conducted show that the proposed method is capable of generating higher-quality images and has improved generalization abilities when dealing with new poses and viewpoints.

### Strengths
* The paper is well-written. Technical details are also well-elaborated.
* Based on the evaluation, the overall quality of the results seems to be satisfactory. Additionally, the quantitative results show better performance compared to DANBO.

### Weaknesses
Motivation:
* I find the motivation in Figure 1 to be unclear. The two poses are quite different - the first contains wrinkles while the second doesn't - but their frequency distribution appears quite similar. Perhaps it would be better to choose a sample with poses that are closer to each other and have more significant differences in frequency.
* The paper mentioned that even when a subject is in a similar pose, the frequency distributions can still be distinct. This seems contradictory to the motivation of pose-dependent frequency modulation, as one might wonder why pose-dependent frequency modulation would be beneficial.

Evaluations:
* Are the point locations clearly separated by the learned weights for each part, or are the parts mixed around the joints? It would be best to visualize the weights for the areas where the bones overlap.
* The novel pose results on MonoPerfCap do not match the numbers reported in DANBO. Is there a setup difference?
* Table 1 (b) caption seems to be incorrect. Is the ablation study tested on Human3.6M S9, or is it on MonoPerfCap? 
* The ablation should be performed on the complete setup to allow for better comparison with DANBO. Additionally, the current ablation study is unable to determine which specific design element is responsible for the model's improved performance compared to DANBO.
* Is there a specific reason why NeuMan is not being compared with Template/Scan-based prior methods and HumanNeRF for the template-free method in Table 2? A discussion or quantitative comparison would be better.
* It would be more convincing to evaluate the performance of the model on the entire ZJU-Mocap dataset rather than a few selected frames.

Minor:
* The code link seems to be missing.
