## Abstract
Rectified linear unit (ReLU), as a non-linear activation function, is well known to improve the expressivity of neural networks such that any continuous function can be approximated to arbitrary precision by a sufficiently wide neural network. In this work, we present another interesting and important feature of ReLU activation function. We show that ReLU leads to: {\it better separation} for similar data, and {\it better conditioning} of  neural tangent kernel (NTK), which are closely related. Comparing with linear neural networks, we show that a ReLU activated wide neural network at random initialization has a larger angle separation for similar data in the feature space of model gradient, and has a smaller condition number for NTK. Note that, for   a linear neural network, the data separation and NTK condition number always remain the same as in the case of a linear model. 
  Furthermore, we show that a deeper ReLU network (i.e., with more ReLU activation operations), has a smaller NTK condition number than a shallower one. 
  Our results imply that  ReLU activation, as well as the depth of ReLU network, helps improve the gradient descent convergence rate, which is closely related to the NTK condition number.

### Summary
This paper studies several properties of wide neural networks in the neural tangent kernel (NTK) regime. By comparing the cases with and without the ReLU activation function, it is shown that ReLU has the effects of (i) better data separation, and (ii) better NTK conditioning. These results also indicate that deeper ReLU networks have better effects, and that ReLU activations can accelerate the optimization procedure.

### Strengths
- This paper introduces an interesting perspective in the study of deep neural networks focusing on the angles between data in the feature space.
- The presentation of the paper is clear.
- The experiments match theory results well.

### Weaknesses
- The major conclusions of this paper (about the advantages of ReLU) are only demonstrated in comparison with linear networks. This makes the results not very strong, as the advantages of non-linear activations over linear networks are fairly clear. 
- Since the comparisons are only made between ReLU networks and linear networks, the results of the paper may not be very comprehensive. For example, in the title, “ReLU soothes NTK conditioning” may give readers the impression that ReLU activation has a unique property when compared with other activation functions, which is not really the case. The results would be more comprehensive if the authors can extend the comparison between ReLU and linear activation functions to a comparison between a general class of non-linear activations and the linear activation. 
- The results of this paper may not be very surprising. As the authors mentioned, the major known advantage of non-linear activation is to improve the expressivity of neural networks. It seems that the conclusions of this paper, to a large extent, are still saying the same thing. Better data separation, better NTK conditioning, and faster convergence to zero training loss, all seem to be more detailed descriptions of better expressivity. 
- The impact of the results are not sufficiently demonstrated. For example, it is not very clear what is the benefit to achieve better data separation in the feature space.

### Summary
This paper studies the effect of the ReLU activation on the conditioning of the NTK and the separation of data points when passed through a deep neural network. The authors show that in contrast to linear activations, the ReLU activation causes an increase in angle separation of data points as well as an improvement in the condition number of the NTK. Additionally, this effect scales with the depth of the network. They corroborate their theoretical results with numerical experiments on a variety of datasets.

### Strengths
1. The main result appears to be fairly novel and interesting. 
2. Numerical experiments corroborate the theory well.
3. The experiments are thorough and clear.

### Weaknesses
1. The writing style and general clarity in some parts of the paper is lacking.
2. The main theoretical results compare with the baseline of a fully linear network, which is not a very interesting comparison. It does not seem that surprising that a linear model cannot increase angle separation while the ReLU model can. A more interesting comparison would be with other non-linear models like kernel machines for example.
3. The theory of the improved convergence rates of gradient descent is restricted to the infinite or large width regime where the NTK is constant. However, it is observed in practice that the NTK changes significantly in most interesting cases [1], and this change corresponds to important feature learning. Per my understanding, the theory in this work fails to extend to this changing NTK regime.

### Questions
1. Can the authors comment on possible ways to extend this result to other non-linear models like kernel machines?
2. Does the conditioning result extend to the finite-width empirical NTK?

### Summary
This paper studies the effects of ReLU in the neural tangent kernel regime. Specifically, the authors compare ReLU network with linear network and show that (1) ReLU is able to produce better data separation in the feature space of model gradient and (2) ReLU improves the NTK conditioning. The authors further show that depth is able to further amplify those effects.

### Strengths
The proof of this work is clean and solid and the presentation of this work is very clear. The idea of analyzing the model gradient feature makes sense and is an interesting subject in kernel learning. I do appreciate the authors' result on providing the exact formula of model gradient angle in Lemma 4.3.

### Weaknesses
This work overall gives the reviewer a feeling that it is more or less a direct consequences of [1] as [1] also shows the formula for the angle between post-activations. I applaud the authors for studying Equation (7) and (8) as they are challenging objects. However, the current results (Theorem 4.2 and Theorem 4.4) are only considering the points that are very close to each other $\Theta(x,z) = o(1/L)$ and if $L$ is big, this quantity is very small. As the authors mentioned, for small $z$, $g(z)$ behaves like identity. Thus, although Theorem 4.2 and Theorem 4.4 is able to show that ReLU improves the data separability, the improvement is also very small in the regime the authors are considering in this paper. Thus, the model gradient angles are nearly non-changing from the input angles. This is also why the improvement for the condition number in Theorem 5.2 can also be very small. It would be more interesting to see ReLU can improve data separability for input pair with small angle (but larger than the regime this paper presents). Further, although Proposition 5.1 is able to connect the model gradient angle with the upper bound of the smallest eigenvalue and the lower bound of condition number, it is also not clear how tight the upper bound is.

### Questions
Another question that can be explored is whether other non-linear activation has the same properties (better data separation and conditioning) as ReLU. Although for activations other than ReLU, it is significantly more challenging to get a close-form formula.

### Summary
This paper studies the effect of the ReLU activation function in terms of (i) the data separation in the feature space of the model gradient, and (ii) the conditioning of the NTK. As for (i), Theorem 4.4 proves that, if two network inputs have small angle, then the model gradients become less and less aligned as the depth of the network increases. As for (ii), Theorems 5.2 and 5.3 show that the condition number of the NTK is smaller than that of the Gram matrix containing the inputs (meaning that the NTK is better conditioned). Specifically, Theorem 5.2 looks at the case in which we have only 2 data samples and shows that the condition number decreases with depth; Theorem 5.3 looks at an arbitrary non-degenerate dataset (i.e., inputs not aligned), considers the NTK of a two-layer network where the outer layer is not trained, and proves that the condition number of such NTK is smaller than the condition number of the Gram matrix of the input. All NTK results refer to the infinite width limit. For comparison, in a linear network, data separation and condition number of the NTK do not change with depth. The fact that the NTK is better conditioned has implications on optimization which are shown via numerical results on MNIST, f-MNIST and Librispeech (see Section 6). Numerical experiments also demonstrate the better separation and conditioning of ReLU networks (compared to linear networks).

### Strengths
* While there has been some work on the impact of the activation function on the NTK (mentioned below), the results presented here are new. Specifically, the authors focus on the regime in which the angle between two data points is small and establish what's the effect of the ReLU nonlinearity on the corresponding gradients in the infinite-width limit. 

* The numerical results show a similar phenomenology also at finite widths, which is a nice addition.

* The results appear correct (after also looking at the appendix).

### Weaknesses
Overall, although the results are correct and the regime being investigated is new, the findings are a bit underwhelming, due to the restrictive regime in which they hold.

Specifically, Theorem 4.4 only tracks the input angle which is assumed to be $o(1/L)$. Other relevant parameters such as the input dimension $d$ and the number of samples $n$ are assumed to be constant (which is rather unrealistic in typical datasets). 

The regime being restrictive is even more evident in the NTK results. Theorem 5.2 holds only for two data points. Theorem 5.3 holds for a general two layer network with the outer layer being fixed. However, it implicitly requires that the input dimension $d$ is bigger than the number of samples $n$. In fact, if that's not the case, $G$ is not full rank, and the statement becomes trivial (as the smallest eigenvalue of $G$ is $0$, and it is well known that the smallest eigenvalue of the NTK is bounded away from $0$). Note that having $d>n$ is violated in all the experiments of Section 5. Actually, the numbers reported in Figure 2(b) when $L=0$ are a bit suspicious. I would expect the condition number to be $\infty$ since $G$ has at most rank $d$. Or am I missing something here?

### Questions
(1) Can the authors comment on the points reported in Figure 2(b) when $L=0$?

(2) A clear way in which the results can be made stronger is to track the quantities $d, n$ in the various results. Having some assumption on the data (e.g., sub-Gaussian tails) may be necessary in order to provide non-trivial statements. Also being able to track the number of neurons $m$ (and therefore consider the empirical NTK) would add value to the narrative of the paper.

(3) There are some works that study the impact of the activation function on the NTK, see [R1], [R2]. How do the results of the manuscript compare to such existing works?
