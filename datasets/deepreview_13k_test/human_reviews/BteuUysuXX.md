- Decision: Accept
- Scores: 8, 6, 6

## Abstract
Large vision-language models (VLMs) such as GPT-4 have achieved exceptional performance across various multi-modal tasks. However, the deployment of VLMs necessitates substantial energy consumption and computational resources. Once attackers maliciously induce high energy consumption and latency time (energy-latency cost) during inference  of VLMs, it will exhaust computational resources.
In this paper, we explore this attack surface about availability of VLMs and aim to induce high energy-latency cost during inference of VLMs. We find that high energy-latency cost during inference of VLMs can be manipulated by maximizing the length of generated sequences. To this end, we propose \textbf{\textit{verbose images}}, with the goal of crafting an imperceptible perturbation to induce VLMs to generate long sentences during inference. Concretely, we design three loss objectives. First, a loss is proposed to delay the occurrence of end-of-sequence (EOS) token, where EOS token is a signal for VLMs to stop generating further tokens. Moreover, an uncertainty loss and a token diversity loss are proposed to increase the uncertainty over each generated token and the diversity among all tokens of the whole generated sequence, respectively, which can break output dependency at token-level and sequence-level. 
Furthermore, a temporal weight adjustment algorithm is proposed, which can effectively balance these losses. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our verbose images can increase the length of generated sequences by 7.87$\times$ and 8.56$\times$ compared to original images on MS-COCO and ImageNet datasets, which presents potential challenges for various applications.

### Summary
The computation cost, including energy consumption and latency time, is an important issue for the development of large vision-language models. This paper investigates the computation cost and observes that it highly correlates with the generated sequence length. To maximize the generated sequence length, this paper seeks to craft an imperceptible perturbation during the inference stage and proposes three losses to guide the derivation of the verbose image, including a delayed EOS loss, an uncertainty loss and a token diversity loss. In addition, a temporal weight adjustment algorithm is proposed for better optimization. Experiments on MSCOCO and ImageNet show the effectiveness of the proposed verbose images. Beyond inducing longer generated sequences, the verbose images can introduce more dispersed attention and enhance the object hallucination.

### Strengths
1. The problem is well-formulated. The solutions and results are delivered clearly. I appreciate the writing and presentation.
2. Simple yet effective methods to induce longer generated sequences. Adding imperceptible perturbation is a reasonable way to induce longer sequences. Optimizing the verbose images via the sequence losses is also quite straightforward.
3. The experimental results are quite convincing. The models, when faced with verbose images, perform much worse than original results. The ablations and qualitative explorations show intriguing results.

### Weaknesses
Despite the simplicity and effectiveness, I think this paper lacks novelty.

### Questions
The verbose images reveal some susceptible aspects of current LVLMs. I am interested to see how such findings can further shed light on the learning of LVLMs. By the way, I suspect whether such a phenomenon always exists in the data-driven deep-learning approach? So, is there any insight on optimizing LVLMs?

### Summary
This paper propose an attack that makes a VLM model generate a very long sequence such that its power consumption become much higher. The paper adopts existed approaches and augments them with two new design into the training framework.

### Strengths
1. The proposed method demonstrates the attack power on VLM and make the model generate very long output.

2. The paper proposed new loss ($L_3$) and temporal weighting to train the model better.

### Weaknesses
1. A simple defense of the service provider could be set the limit of token based on the statistics of the clean data. As shown in Fig. 5 and 6, the original distribution focus certain length. In such case, it seems that this attack won't be too sever anymore?

2. I am not sure is this a real problem or not, as pointed by 1, a simple approach can resolve it (but with some tradeoff); on the other hand, as the attacked results do not make sense anymore (e.g. Fig.8), it seems the attacks can be easy identified. I think the problem definition should be constrained on the results are still make sense and good. That is, the evaluation should consider the performance of those tasks.

### Questions
1. Why the quality output won't be a metric? Does it mean that this attack are designed to be easily spotted? As one of current practice is using another LLM to inspect the output of current LLM.

2. In Fig. 3, 5 and 6, why the attack distribution results in like two-mode distribution?

3. What is the image embedding distance between the original image and the attacked image? 

4. What is the energy consumption for generating one attack image?

5. When showing the results of length in the Table, the standard deviation should be added.

### Summary
The paper investigates the attack of VLMs, which will induce high energy-latency cost during inference via maximizing the length of the sequence. To achieve this aim, the paper proposes three losses, which first decrease the probability of the end-of-sequence token, and then increase the uncertainty of output tokens and diversity of token embeddings. Experiments are done on popular VLMs models including BLIP, BLIP-2, InstructBLIP, and MiniGPT-4, and on common datasets including MS-COCO and ImageNet datasets.

### Strengths
* The paper investigates an important and interesting problem, which attacks the inference efficiency of VLMs. The proposed solution is simple and does not cost much.
* The paper is well-written and easy to follow. The figures are presented well.
* Experiments have been done on a variety of models with two tasks. Improvements in sequence length and latency are obvious. Also, the paper gives a detailed ablation study.

### Weaknesses
* The motivation or the reason for the effectiveness of the second loss is weak. I think the second loss, which increases the uncertainty of tokens is more like destroying the accurate outputs. While the paper claims that the second loss can help with longer sequences, I do not see a strong correlation. Can the authors give some description to build the relationship between sequence length and token uncertainty, which usually indicates less favorable accuracy performance? 

* In the third loss part, the paper claims that “for a matrix, the calculation of the matrix rank is an NP-hard non-convex problem”, and thus proposes the third loss. Unfortunately, this is not true. For the 2-way matrix that corresponds to [token, hidden_states] in this example, the rank calculation is available by Gaussian elimination and is not NP-hard. Therefore, I keep doubting the motivation and design of the third loss, which also shows the least performance improvement in the ablation study.

* The paper seems to target the problem in VLMs and claims that VLMs have special things like vulnerabilities from the manipulation of visual inputs. While it says that other methods for LLMs, can not be directly applied to VLMs, I do not see the special design or consideration in this method for challenges in VLMs.
