# On the Optimality of Activations in Implicit Neural Representations

- Decision: Reject
- Scores: 6, 5, 6, 6

## Abstract
Implicit neural representations (INRs) have recently surged in popularity as a class of neural networks capable of encoding signals as compact, differentiable entities. To capture high-frequency content, INRs often employ techniques such as Fourier positional encodings or non-traditional activation functions like Gaussian, sinusoid, or wavelets. Despite the impressive results achieved with these activations, there has been limited exploration of their properties within a unified theoretical framework. To address this gap, we conduct a comprehensive analysis of these activations from the perspective of sampling theory. Our investigation reveals that, particularly in the context of shallow INRs, sinc activations—previously unused in conjunction with INRs—are theoretically optimal for signal encoding. Additionally, we establish a connection between dynamical systems and INRs and leverage sampling theory to bridge these two paradigms. Notably, we showcase how the implicit architectural regularization inherent to INRs allows for their application in modeling such systems with minimal need for explicit regularizations.

### Summary
In this paper, the authors establish a connection between sampling theory and implicit neural representations, advocating for the sinc function as a better activation function with theoretical backing to minimize reconstruction error to any desired positive threshold. By demonstrating how shifted sinc functions constitute a Riesz basis—unlike common activation functions like sinusoidal and ReLU, which form weak Riesz bases—the paper provides a solid theoretical foundation for the sinc function's advantages. Finally, the authors showed the effectiveness of sinc functions on a variety of implicit representation tasks such as NeRFs, image reconstruction, and modeling dynamical systems.

### Strengths
**Coherent Narrative:** The paper presents a well-structured narrative, effectively linking various theorems to construct the main argument. The authors maintain a clear focus on their main message, presenting sufficient detail without overwhelming the reader, which facilitates a smooth reading experience and understanding of the core concepts.

**Novel Perspective on Implicit Representations:** The authors offer a fresh angle on implicit neural representations by examining them through the lens of sampling theory.

**Insights into Dynamical Systems:** The application of implicit neural representation perspectives to model dynamical systems is both novel and valuable and extends the utility of implicit neural representations.

### Weaknesses
**Limited Analysis of Failure Modes:** The paper's primary limitation is the insufficient exploration of the failure modes of the sinc activation function. Although the authors illustrate that a two-layer MLP can utilize sinc functions to approximate a signal within an acceptable error margin, this guarantee and the suggested architecture in B.1.2 is closely tied to a specific two-layer architecture. The emphasis on shallow MLPs might stem from this architectural dependency(Correct me if I am wrong). Understanding where the sinc activation function falls short or lacks expressiveness compared to other functions is a valuable addition to the paper.

**Clarification of Notation:** Regarding the mathematical notation, it would enhance clarity to emphasize the argument 'x' in Equation 3, written as $A_\Omega(s(x))$.

### Questions
**Q1:** How does increasing the depth of the neural network affect the theoretical guarantees associated with Riesz basis functions?
Could you elucidate on potential failure modes of the sinc activation function? Are there particular scenarios where traditional activation functions might outperform sinc?

**Q2:** Considering that state-of-the-art INRs often employ positional encoding (which by themselves can be deemed as an activation function), how does the sinc activation function interact with common positional encodings like random Fourier features[1] or sinusoidal encodings[2]? Moreover, is there a positional encoding strategy that effectively incorporates the sinc function?

### Summary
The authors study neural network activation functions from the perspective of Shannon-Nyquist sampling theory. This study is particularly relevant to implicit neural representations, which are usually overfitted to regularly sampled signals, e.g., the coordinate-intensity pairs of an image. 

The authors prove a universal approximation theorem for 2-layer, $\mathrm{sinc}$-activated networks and note that the same theorem does not hold for ReLU, $\sin$, and Gaussian activations and could but does not necessarily hold for wavelet activations.

The authors demonstrate the practical relevance of their theory by using INRs to perform image reconstruction, construct neural radiance fields, and discover the governing dynamics of chaotic dynamical systems.

### Strengths
I am quite excited about the theoretical results in this paper. The authors' results offer a simple criterion for activation functions that is easy to check in practice to determine whether they will work well for INRs. I checked all proofs in detail and believe they are correct; they follow elegantly from reasonably elementary results from functional analysis. Finally, I found the author's construction for the 2-layer INRs achieving an arbitrarily small approximation gap elegantly simple.

### Weaknesses
Unfortunately, the brilliance of the ideas is significantly diminished by the unacceptably low quality of writing. Concretely, the paper looks and reads like a draft that is 80-90% complete.

In particular:
- There are countless typos in the paper, including undefined notation, which makes parsing the contents quite challenging. For example, I believe that in the paragraph below Eq 5, T is undefined, and I think it should be 1/Omega instead. Similarly, there's an inequality sign missing in the bound on $|\varepsilon_{corr}|$ in Thm 3.7.
- This is an even more serious problem in the appendix, where it appears that the content wasn't even re-read once, as there are gross typos (including some mathematical ones) in every second to third sentence. For example:
  - Appendix A (which is also unreferenced in the main text) has several typos of the form $10^20$ instead of $10^{20}$
  - The title of Appendix B is "proof of theorems in Sec 3.2", but the theorems are stated in Sec 3.3
- The notation should be optimized significantly. As the prime example, parsing notation like $\bar{\hat{\tilde{F}}}$ is quite challenging.
- The figures are low-quality, and their legends, axis labels, and axis ticks are completely unreadable.
- Sections 4.3.1 and 5 are extremely terse and poorly explained. Several concepts are not defined or referenced (e.g., spectral derivatives), and a reader like me, who's unfamiliar with dynamical systems, will get completely lost.
- The Related Works section is far too technical at the beginning of the paper. I suggest the authors move it to the end of the paper and also simplify its content.
- As a more minor point, please use `\sin` and `\mathrm{sinc}`; or ideally, define `\sinc` using `\DeclareMathOperator{\sinc}{\mathrm{sinc}}`.

Furthermore, I found the proofs of Prop 3.3, Thm 3.7, and Lemma 3.8 in Appendix B to be much too terse for a machine learning venue. For a reader unfamiliar with functional analysis, the proofs are completely inaccessible. Furthermore, the proofs that the translates of the activation functions studied form a weak Riesz basis, i.e., that they fulfill condition 1 in Def 3.1, are missing.

E.g., Prop 3.3 could be clarified significantly by stating and referencing the Poisson summation formula explicitly and stating that an equivalent condition for the integer translates of $F \in L_2(\mathbb{R})$ to form a Riesz basis is that $A \leq \sum_{k \in \mathbb{Z}} |\hat{F}(\omega + 2\pi k|^2 \leq B$ where $\hat{F}$ is the Fourier transform of $F$, which can be shown in a couple of lines.

Finally, I think the author's claim that $\mathrm{sinc}$ is optimal among INR activations is misleading because they do not state a clear optimality condition with respect to which the claim holds. What the authors mean is that $\mathrm{sinc}$ is the only activation among the ones they study for which their universal approximation theorem holds. I think the authors should clarify this in the text. 

If the authors improve the writing by the end of the rebuttal period, I will be happy to recommend acceptance for the paper.

### Questions
- To define a notion of optimality of an activation function for a given class of functions, maybe the authors derive bounds on the growth of $n(\varepsilon)$ in Thms 3.4 and 3.10?
- It would be interesting to investigate whether gradient descent can recover the 2-layer INR weight settings that the authors use for their constructions in Thms 3.4 and 3.10.
- While the universal approximation theorems hold for 2-layer $\mathrm{sinc}$-INRs, it is unclear to me whether $\mathrm{sinc}$ retains its advantage in deeper architectures. Could the authors comment on this?

### Summary
This paper provides a detailed analysis of approximation properties of implicit neural representations (INR) by deploying tools from harmonic analysis. Specifically, while a variety of activation functions have been investigated for use within INR models, a unified treatment is missing and comparisons appear to be entirely numerical on a small set of images. This paper categorizes the current options in the literature in terms of whether or not they form a Riesz basis or weak Riesz basis. A basis based on shifted sinc functions is described, and the correspond approximability analysis involves an interesting use of older results from Unser. Applications to dynamical systems is discussed and a small set of experiments are presented.

### Strengths
1. Despite the existing theoretical results dealing with INRs, the paper's categorization of known results in terms of Riesz basis is interesting. 
2. The approximation analysis of bandlimited signals using $\Omega$-scaled signal space, is a valuable addition to known results on INRs.
3. The theoretical analysis overall and Thm 3.4 and 3.10 in particular will likely be used by follow-up papers on the topic. 
4. Several different experimental examples are considered, from image representation to dynamical systems.

### Weaknesses
1. Not a major weakness but the use of orthogonal polynomials (such as Hermite) has been proposed for use as activation functions, and  its convergence/approximation properties as well its empirical benefits have been demonstrated. This paper does offer more than yet another activation/basis (which is a plus) but Prop 3.3 and the text leading up to it will benefit from a clearer positioning of why the result will be incomplete or weaker unless the characterization was in terms of Riesz basis. 

2.  While it is clear that the main selling point of the paper is the technical analysis, the experimental presentation can be more thoroughly presented (even if it is short). Fig. 1 would have us believe that for the dataset described, the proposed method yields the best overall performance. Very little additional discussion is provided. Nerf experiments are presented yet there is no discussion of whether the changes can be dropped into current implementations commonly used by practitioners. Dynamical systems experiments are nice but its not obvious why the vanderpol oscillator dynamics would be more challenging than those in Fig. 1.

### Questions
Overall I like the paper and its creative use of harmonic analysis for this problem. Please comment on the two minor weaknesses. 

The paper would also benefit from a careful proof reading. See section title of 3.2, overloading of $s$ and others.

### Summary
The paper views INR fitting through the lens of sampling theory and shows that the sinc activation function is particularly amenable due to two properties: shifted sinc functions form a linearly independent basis in the space of bandlimited functions, and they also form a partition of unity in this space. The authors show that these two conditions are uniquely satisfied by sinc, and that existing activation functions only satisfy at most the first property. These two conditions allow one to construct an INR with just a single hidden layer and sinc activation that can approximate any L^2 function to arbitrary accuracy. The authors empirically demonstrate that this simple method achieves superior performance on radiance field fitting and dynamical system fitting.

### Strengths
This paper introduces a simple and effective method, yet the theoretical grounding is highly original and strongly motivated. The experiments are also fairly strong, with an interesting and unique combination of demonstrating applications to NeRF as well as solving dynamical systems.

### Weaknesses
My key concern is that the paper is hard to read, especially for many potential users of this work (e.g. NeRF practitioners). When the paper involves this much theory, it is particularly important for the presentation to be clear and to offer graphics / intuition when possible. In particular, everything from def 3.5 to lemma 3.8 seems to have the sole purpose of demonstrating the importance of the PUC condition in bridging the gap between V(F) and L^2(R), but after reading it I still don't have an intuitive understanding of how the PUC condition enables this (I believe that only if I carefully followed the proofs in the appendix would I understand this). This lack of intuition also makes it difficult to think critically about the connection between the theory and behaviors of the different activations in practice. (e.g. to what extent is the performance of ReLU activations actually limited by them not forming a Riesz basis?) Since this subsection (def 3.5 to lemma 3.8) constitutes 1.5 pages of very dense material, I think the authors should move some of this to the appendix and focus on building intuition. One way of doing that would be to answer: "what happens if you try to fit a function in L^2(R) but not in V(F) with a weak Riesz basis vs. a strong basis?" and offer a simple graphical demonstration with such a toy function.
There are also a few notational problems (see questions section below for some examples) that make the theory part a little harder to read.

### Questions
- under def 3.1 I don't understand the step "the upper inequality in (1) implies that the L^2 norm of a signal sinV(F) is finite". how did you bring sin into this?
- almost all modern radiance field parameterizations with INRs use some form of explicit spatial representation (Instant NGP, ZipNeRF, TensoRF, DVGO, factor fields, and many more) usually with just a single hidden layer in the MLP decoder. since theorem 3.10 only requires a single hidden layer, it would be interesting to examine whether sinc activations yield improvements in those kinds of models as well

Minor typos / notational problems:
- eqn 1 should have l \in [1,...,L-1]
- right below that, "weights biases" -> "weights and biases"
- I think remembering what all the symbols mean would be much easier if you chose a convention and stuck with it, e.g. all functions are uppercase, neural networks are calligraphic letters, etc. Right now you use f at different points to denote a neural network, a function in V(F), and a Schwartz function.
- in eqn 5, it is not clear what argument the central dot is supposed to represent or where it comes from
- F with bar + hat + tilde is excessive. and what is bar?
- be consistent in how you write summation over integers (k \in Z vs. from -inf to inf)
- Fig 2 and 5 captions use excessive negative vspace
- Conclusion: "samplingh theory"
