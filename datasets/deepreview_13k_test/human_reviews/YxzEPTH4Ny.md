# Arithmetic with Language Models: from Memorization to Computation

- Decision: Reject
- Scores: 3, 3, 6, 5

## Abstract
A better understanding of the emergent computation and problem-solving capabilities of recent large language models is of paramount importance to further improve them and broaden their applicability. This work investigates how a language model, trained to predict the next token, can perform arithmetic computations generalizing beyond training data. Binary addition and multiplication constitute a good testbed for this purpose, since they require a very small vocabulary and exhibit relevant input/output discontinuities making smooth input interpolation ineffective for novel data. We successfully trained a light language model to learn these tasks and ran a number of experiments to investigate the extrapolation capabilities and internal information processing. Our findings support the hypothesis that the language model works as an Encoding-Regression-Decoding machine where the computation takes place in the value space once the input token representation is mapped to an appropriate internal representation.

### Confidence
3: You are fairly confident in your assessment. It is possible that you did not understand some parts of the submission or that you are unfamiliar with some pieces of related work. Math/other details were not carefully checked.

### Summary
The paper delves into the area of mathematical reasoning within Large Language Models (LLMs), with a specific emphasis on Transformer-based models and their handling of arithmetic tasks. The core investigation revolves around understanding the computational mechanisms and processes employed by LLMs when performing arithmetic operations. The authors ran their investigations on toy encoder-decoder models (likely similar to the T5 models).

### Strengths
* Exploring the limitations of Large Language Models (LLMs) and the transferability of findings, especially in arithmetic tasks, is both relevant and crucial for the community at this time.

### Weaknesses
* The experimental setup is quite basic, and it's unclear how these findings apply to current Large Language Models. The research primarily focuses on binary addition and multiplication using a simplistic model, which might not be representative of more complex, real-world scenarios.

* The paper could benefit from clearer writing. Specifically, the abstract and introduction lack clarity regarding the nature of the investigation. It's not immediately apparent what the central findings are, the experiments conducted to arrive at these conclusions, and how this differs from existing knowledge in the field.

* There is a noticeable absence of some relevant literature. The authors should consider reviewing "A Mechanistic Interpretation of Arithmetic Reasoning in Language Models using Causal Mediation Analysis (Stolfo et al. 2023)," as well as other works cited in that paper, which seem pertinent to this study.

* Prior research indicates that certain types of positional encoding, such as Sinusoidal Positional Embedding—a fixed form of positional encoding—struggle with extrapolation to unseen positions. The use of this method in the toy models might result in outcomes more attributable to positional embedding issues rather than the arithmetic aspects under investigation.

### Questions
* Considering the experimentation was carried out in a very constrained setting, how do the findings of this work extend to broader applications or more complex scenarios? Specifically, what broader implications or learnings can be derived from the study's outcomes?

* What advantages does investigating encoder-decoder models offer in the context of this research, as opposed to exclusively examining a GPT-like model (i.e., decoder-only)? Additionally, how do you anticipate the results or observations might differ if the study were to shift its focus to decoder-only models?

### Summary
This paper investigates language models' ability to perform arithmetic computations.
It focuses on language models trained on a single arithmetic operation—either addition or multiplication—which operates on binary natural numbers between 0 and 127.
These numbers are zero padded in their most significant digits (so they always have the same length when input to the models), and are reversed (going from least significant to most significant digit).
The paper proposes a Encoding-Regression-Decoding hypothesis, arguing models encode input digits, perform a regression task in its hidden states space, and then decode the output digits.
The paper then runs a number of experiments:
* **Performance in distribution.** In the first experiment, the models are simply trained and evaluated on i.i.d train-validation split. The models reach ~100% accuracy in both train and validation.
* **Memorisation baseline.** In the second experiment, models are trained on a dataset for which outputs are randomly sampled. In this setting, the model takes much longer to reach a reasonable training performance, and never passes chance validation performance.
* **Performance out of distribution.** In the third experiment, models are trained on two train--validation splits designed to evaluate o.o.d. performance. Two splitting strategies are proposed: (i) one creates o.o.d. splits based on the hamming distance between the strings (e.g., 01101000) representing the input digits, and (ii) the second creates o.o.d. splits by putting all inputs representing numbers from 32 to 64 in a validation set. In these experiments, the authors find that models have a harder time generalising in the second setting, and take this as evidence of the Encoding-Regression-Decoding hypothesis.
* **Embedding Distance and Correlations.** The authors also: (i) get the hidden state of their model when input the same value twice (e.g., when input $A+A$), (ii) compute the distance between each pair of hidden states representing $A+A$ with $A \in [0, 127]$, (iii) compute the (Hamming and value) distance between each pair of  inputs $A \in [0, 127]$, (iv) evaluate the correlation between hidden state and input distances. In this task, the authors find that hidden state distances correlate more strongly with Hamming distances in early and final layers, but with numerical distances in middle layer. This is taken as evidence for the Encoding-Regression-Decoding hypothesis.
* **Performance with reverse vs normal strings.** The authors compare model performance when predicting reversed or normal digits. They show learning arithmetic tasks with reversed digit strings is easier, which they take as evidence that language models compute outputs iteratively one bit at a time.

### Strengths
This paper tackles an important and interesting question.

The simplified setting which is analysed here allows the authors to isolate training/optimisation issues (to some extent) and analyse the strategy used by the models to perform arithmetic tasks.

The experiments in the paper are clearly written, and give important insights about how language models implement arithmetic tasks.

### Weaknesses
The main weakness of this paper, in my opinion, is that it does not engage with the model interpretability literature (neither in “mechanistic interpretability” or “probing”).
* It cites a single probing paper on probing numeracy in embeddings, which is a highly relevant topic here, but many more exist (e.g., Naik et al. 2019, Sundararaman et al. 2020). 
* It cites no work on probing, many of which have discussed techniques similar to the presented here. E.g., manipulating datasets on which a model is trained/evaluated to analyse its computational strategy (e.g., Linzen et al. 2016, Warstadt et al. 2020). E.g.2, computing distances in embedding space which are representative of other notions of distances (e.g., Hewitt and Manning. 2019, White et al. 2021,  Limisiewicz and Mareček. 2021)
* Many issues have been pointed out with this type of non-causal probing analyses (e.g., Elazar et al. 2021, Ravfogel et al. 2021, Lasri et al. 2022) which would be interesting to acknowledge.
* It cites no related mechanistic interpretation work either. Hanna et al. (2023), in particular, study how GPT models implement a greater than operation, which is quite related to the research question investigated here.

Related to the issue above, the set of experiments already in this paper are a nice start on the quest to understand how arithmetic operations are implemented in language models. But this paper’s contributions could be much stronger if the authors engaged with the literature above and applied some of the more recent probing/interpretability techniques in their analyses. As is, I do not think this paper’s contributions are strong enough to warrant publication in ICLR.

### Questions
I thought the paper was relatively clear and I have no specific questions. I am not sure if any specific response from the authors would change my opinion regarding this paper, but maybe they would wish to address the lack of engagement with the literature in their response, or why the referred papers are in their opinion perhaps not relevant in this case?

## Minor Presentation Issues

I thought section 4.5 was confusing at a first read because you use the same notation ($A$ and $B$) there as in previous sections, but you refer to different inputs in this section, as opposed to the two values in a single input. This could likely be made clearer to the reader.

Plots are not currently readable in black and white.

Citation Wei et al. (Chain of thought) is currently duplicated.

### Summary
This work investigates how arithmetic operations like addition and multiplications happen inside a Language Model (LM). They train a small language model using few tokens to show that language model works as encoding-regression-decoding machine where the computation take place in value space. To show this claim they train LM with different configurations of training datasets by first showing the language model doesn't memorize the input and output and then showing how excluding certain regions from training set leads to degradation in performance of language model.

### Strengths
- Clean experiments with each section supporting the claim they want to make.
- Explains how arithmetic operations works inside a language models and showing they act as encoding-regression-decoding machines.

### Weaknesses
- Explores it for very simple LM not sure if the results generalize to large LLMs. Showing results on different open-source LLMs might be helpful to make the claim stronger.
- Lack of novel insights after reading the paper I am like okay they act as encoding-regression-decoding machines but I don't know how to use this information to build models better at doing arithmetic computation.

### Summary
A transformer encoder-decoder is trained to perform binary addition and multiplication, and (somewhat surprisingly) it learns multiplication well. Two hypotheses are investigated for how it multiplies: either by manipulating symbols or by using activations to estimate the magnitude of the multiplicands and product.

### Strengths
The two hypotheses for how the transformer might do multiplication make sense and are interesting. The experiments in 4.5 seem to point to the ERD hypothesis.

### Weaknesses
It's a little bit mysterious why previous authors have observed that it's difficult for a transformer to learn multiplication, but here it learned it perfectly.

Since the paper is arguing that the ERD hypothesis is correct, I would have appreciated a more detailed explication of what the transformer might be doing -- ideally, an explicit construction of a transformer that multiplies, but if that's not possible, at least some kind of sketch.

Section 4.6 was not very clear to me. Previously (page 5) $v_A$, $v_B$, and $v_R$ were stated to be vector representations of the values (as opposed to the binary represntations) of $A$ and $B$. But in 4.6, $v_A$ has become the concatenation of the vectors of $a_0, a_1$, etc., which are the bits of $A$? This seems more like symbolic manipulation to me.

The ablation study in section 5 shows that the position embedding is necessary, but this has to be so, because otherwise the encoder would know nothing about the order of the digits.

### Questions
Could you explain Section 4.6 a bit more?
