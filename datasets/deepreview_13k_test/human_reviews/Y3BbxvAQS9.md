- Decision: Accept
- Scores: 6, 8, 6, 5, 6

## Abstract
Recently, 
3D generative models have shown promising performances in structure-based drug design by learning to generate ligands given target binding sites.
However, only modeling the target-ligand distribution can hardly fulfill one of the main goals in drug discovery -- designing novel ligands with desired properties, e.g., high binding affinity, easily synthesizable, etc. This challenge becomes particularly 
pronounced when the target-ligand pairs used for training do not align with these desired properties.
Moreover, most existing methods aim at solving \textit{de novo} design task, while many generative scenarios requiring flexible controllability, such as R-group optimization and scaffold hopping, have received little attention. 
In this work, we propose \method, a structure-based molecular optimization method based on a controllable and decomposed diffusion model. 
\method presents a new generation paradigm which combines optimization with conditional diffusion models to achieve desired properties while adhering to the molecular grammar,
Additionally, 
\method offers a unified framework covering both \textit{de novo} design and controllable generation. 
To achieve so, ligands are decomposed into substructures which allows fine-grained control and local optimization. 
Experiments show that \method can efficiently generate molecules with improved properties than strong \textit{de novo} baselines, and demonstrate great potential in controllable generation tasks.

### Confidence
3: You are fairly confident in your assessment. It is possible that you did not understand some parts of the submission or that you are unfamiliar with some pieces of related work. Math/other details were not carefully checked.

### Summary
Through this paper, the authors aim to establish a structure-based molecular optimization model that can be applied to both *de novo* molecular design and controllable generation. To accomplish this, the authors propose to train a diffusion model with decomposed ligands.

### Strengths
- The writing is easy to follow. The concept figure also aids the understanding.
- The experimental results show the effectiveness of the proposed method and ablation studies were also conducted. The experiments about controllability (R-group optimization and scaffold hopping) seem interesting.

### Weaknesses
- The authors did not provide the codebase to reproduce the results.
- The authors used the term *controllable generation* to indicate tasks like R-group design and scaffold hopping. However, *controllable* is a widely used expression with a general meaning and *de novo* molecular design can also be controllable in a broad sense. There is some lack of rigor in the choice of wording.

### Questions
- What is the specific difference between DecompOpt and DecompDiff? One of the claimed contributions is that the authors designed a unified framework via a decomposed diffusion model (the 3rd bullet point in the introduction), but DecompDiff has already proposed and applied this to SBDD.

### Summary
This paper introduces a controllable and decomposed diffusion model for de novo molecular optimization. More specifically, the paper presented a method for molecular optimization while maintaining the constraint that the crucial binding region undergoes minimal alteration. The author conducts a comprehensive benchmarking of their work against numerous existing baselines, revealing strong performance across a wide range of quality-related metrics, although it does exhibit a lower score in terms of diversity.

### Strengths
1. The motivation is evident and firmly grounded. 
2. The paper provides a great tool for chemistries to design the molecular and it is expected to be highly practical and beneficial.

### Weaknesses
I observed that you employed the reference ligand as the input for optimization, while most of the baseline methods, except RGA, did not. Moreover, the reference ligand exhibits exceptionally high quality, surpassing all the Gen-based baselines in terms of success rate. This leads me to question whether this comparison might be somewhat unfair to these baseline methods. I acknowledge that the primary focus of the method lies in optimization, making this kind of bias understandable. In light of this, I wonder whether it is necessary to include the Gen-based methods as baselines.

### Questions
1. How similar is your generated ligand to the reference ligand?
2. Can you demonstrate the influence of the reference ligand's quality on performance?

### Summary
The paper focuses on the task of conditional generation in structure-based drug design, aiming to generate drugs with specific properties. The proposed method is an optimization approach based on a controllable and decomposed diffusion model, offering fine-grained control and local optimization. The method introduces a mechanism for precise control over the arms of the generated ligands. Subsequently, the ligand molecules, including atom coordinates, atom type, and bond type, can be generated by conditioning on certain arms and the target pockets using the diffusion model. Once a ligand molecule is derived, it is treated as a reference molecule and further optimized using evolutionary algorithms. The author presents the results from two perspectives: the generation perspective and the optimization perspective  to evaluate the target binding affinity and molecular properties.

### Strengths
The paper gives a decomposed method on drug design, generation on arms and scaffold. DECOMPOPT combines the advantages of diffusion models and optimization algorithms, utilizing diffusion models to extract molecular grammar and optimization algorithms to effectively optimize desired properties.

### Weaknesses
The method section containing diffusion part also used in the previous tasks while the author does not point out their novelty. The implementation detail is hard to reproduce

### Questions
1. Why can solely maximizing the likelihood of training data mislead SBDD models?
2. What is your novelty in section 3.1 comparing to DecompDiff?
3. How is diversity achieved in the generated ligand molecules without explicitly introducing regularization over the representation space of conditions?
4. Have you try multiple time experiments with differnet random seeds to avoid the randomness?

### Summary
This paper aims to address the problem of generating 3D molecules with desired properties by introducing a controllable and decomposed diffusion model. Specifically, this paper proposes a model DECOMPOPT, which learns molecular grammar by iterative molecular optimization.The approach decomposes the molecules into scaffolds and arms, aiming to replace underperforming arms with new arms that exhibit improved properties.

### Strengths
1.	The paper is well-written and easy to follow.
2.	The experiment results are comprehensive.

### Weaknesses
1. My main concern regarding this article is the lack of alignment between the motivation and the approach. While the article acknowledges the importance of the property, it doesn't directly address it.

   a) Which part of the article is designed to address QED or easily synthesizable compounds?

   b) The Vina score from Table 1 appears to be subpar. Although I understand that the Vina score may not be the most suitable metric due to its weak correlation with affinity, the authors use it for optimization and as an indicator for data analysis(Figure 1). This raises the question of why they emphasize the results of Vina min and but not reporting the median or some other indicator.

2. I am curious about the inference efficiency of the diffusion model. Since diffusion models are not known for their efficiency during inference, could the authors compare the generation efficiency of the proposed method with that of other models?

3. Did the authors evaluate the rationality of the generated conformations? For instance, did they assess the energy difference before and after force field optimization? As diffusion-based models like DecompDiff has problems with this.

4. The second case in Figure 3 seems questionable or may be difficult to interpret. I recommend redrawing it for clarity.

5. Scaffold hopping is an interesting aspect, but the authors have not considered the potential changes in molecular properties (vina score, for example) after the hopping process.

### Questions
(Updated) Thank you for providing additional experimental details and clarification. I appreciate that my main concerns have been mostly addressed, especially the results for conformation optimization. I would raise the score from 3 to 5.

### Summary
The paper proposes DecompOpt, a framework for de novo design and optimisation of ligands in protein binding sites conditioned on the pocket and a set of templates for arms and scaffold. The method is trained on the CrossDocked2020 benchmark and applied to de novo design, R-group optimisation and scaffold hopping.

### Strengths
- DecompOpt is a flexible framework that is applicable to practical use cases in drug design
- SOTA results on CrossDocked2020 benchmark

### Weaknesses
- Confidence intervals in evaluation are missing.
- The overall clarity of the text should be improved (typos/grammar/…). 
- The complex framework is not described very well and is hard to grasp. For example, the “model architecture, training loss etc” is taken from DecompDiff and only referenced. An overview figure might help to better show the overall framework and identify novel contributions. 
- It is not clear what the arm / subpocket conditioning exactly encodes: Is this just guiding towards similar arms, or is the sub-pocket important here? An additional ablation using only the arms, A_k = Enc(A_k), would be informative.
- It is unclear / not evaluated, how much the method relies on the availability of high-quality reference ligands vs the generative capabilities of the diffusion model. For example, a simple 2d baseline that recombines arms of different reference structures might already perform very well if already a large set of references is available.

### Questions
- Criteria for success rate seem arbitrary. How were these thresholds chosen?
- Where does the difference for the DecompDiff results between Tabs 1 and 3 stem from?
- Is DecompOpt applicable if no/only few reference ligands are available? How does the performance depend on the number / performance of initial reference ligands?

Update:
I thank the authors for the extensive answers to my questions and the additional experiments and clarifications. I raised my score accordingly.
