- Decision: Accept
- Scores: 5, 6, 6, 8

## Abstract
Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) have garnered considerable attention due to their energy efficiency and unique biological characteristics. However, the widely adopted Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (LIF) model, as the mainstream neuron model in current SNN research, has been revealed to exhibit significant deficiencies in deep-layer gradient calculation and capturing global information on the time dimension. In this paper, we propose the Learnable Multi-hierarchical (LM-H) model to address these issues by dynamically regulating its membrane-related factors. We point out that the LM-H model fully encompasses the information representation range of the LIF model while offering the flexibility to adjust the extraction ratio between historical and current information. Additionally, we theoretically demonstrate the effectiveness of the LM-H model and the functionality of its internal parameters, and propose a progressive training algorithm tailored specifically for the LM-H model. Furthermore, we devise an efficient training framework for our novel advanced model, encompassing hybrid training and time-slicing online training. Through extensive experiments on various datasets, we validate the remarkable superiority of our model and training algorithm compared to previous state-of-the-art approaches. Code is available at [https://github.com/hzc1208/STBP_LMH](https://github.com/hzc1208/STBP_LMH).

### Confidence
3: You are fairly confident in your assessment. It is possible that you did not understand some parts of the submission or that you are unfamiliar with some pieces of related work. Math/other details were not carefully checked.

### Summary
The paper extends the LIF model for SNN to a more generalized version called LM-H, enhances its flexibility by making certain parameters learnable, and designs a progressive learning procedure to effectively train the network. Some experiments on relatively small datasets were presented to show that the proposed approach is superior to relevant prior methods.

### Strengths
The LM-H model and the learning algorithm were respectively inspired by and similar to existing works, however put together the paper still proposed a novel and practical framework for SNN learning.

### Weaknesses
The experiments only covered several relatively small datasets. The ImageNet 200 dataset was the largest one in the paper is actually a tiny subset of ImageNet. Datasets like ImageNet 1k/22k would be more convincing to validate the practical value of the proposed approach.

Performance comparison in the experiment section is somewhat inconsistent, e.g. only ImageNet 200 results included the radical version showing better performance.

Grammar errors scatter through the paper, further proof-reading is suggested.

### Questions
Why only small datasets were experimented upon, was it because the proposed approach has scalability issues on larger and more practical datasets?

Why the performance of the radical version was only presented for ImageNet while missing for other datasets, was it because that it didn't show better accuracy?

### Summary
The authors of this paper address the limitations of the widely used LIF model in SNN by proposing a novel LM-H model. The LM-H model overcomes issues related to gradient calculation in deep networks and capturing global information along the time dimension. The authors also develop a progressive training algorithm specifically for the LM-H model. Experiments on various datasets demonstrate the superior performance of the LM-H model and the training algorithm compared to previous state-of-the-art SNN approaches.

### Strengths
1 Did a lot baselines and achieved SOTA performance
2 A novel neuron model LH-M that is a extension of LIF model

### Weaknesses
1. In the context of deep residual architectures, LIF neurons are known to exhibit issues to either vanishing or exploding gradients. How has the LH-M model effectively addressed and mitigated these challenges?

2. Both ImageNet and CIFAR datasets focus on static image classification, whereas the LH-M model incorporates historical data and demonstrates superior performance. Could you elucidate the underlying reasons for this enhanced performance in the context of LH-M's utilization of historical information?

3. How was the conversion from Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) to Spiking Neural Networks (SNN) executed, given that ANNs do not inherently incorporate temporal information? Considering the significance of historical data within the LH-M model, how was this temporal aspect effectively integrated during the conversion process?

### Questions
1. LIF neurons have a gradient vanishing or exploding problem in deep residue architecture, how did LH-M solved this problem?

2. ImageNet and CIFAR are all static image classification datasets, but LH-M involves historical information and performed better. Can you give an explaination?

3. How did you perform ANN2SNN conversion? ANN do not include temporal information, but in LH-M historical information is an important property.

3: You are fairly confident in your assessment. It is possible that you did not understand some parts of the submission or that you are unfamiliar with some pieces of related work. Math/other details were not carefully checked.

### Summary
This work proposed a new neuron model, Learnable Multi-hierarchical (LM-H) model, to effectively extracting global information along the time dimension and propagate gradients in deep networks. In the LM-H model, the scaling factors from the dendrite layer regulate the proportion of historical information extracted by the model, while the factors from the soma layer determine the degree of potential leakage and the intensity of the input current at present.

### Strengths
The proposed LMH model, along with GLIF, TC-LIF, enriches the family of the spiking neuron models. This approach is unique and original, as it combines existing ideas in a new way to solve a problem in Spiking Neural Networks. The proposed model and training algorithm address the deficiencies of the widely adopted LIF model and offer a new approach to solving problems in this field.

### Weaknesses
While the proposed model and training algorithm are unique and original, the paper could benefit from a more detailed discussion of why they propose the new model, how they differ from existing methods, and what specific contributions they make to the field of Spiking Neural Networks. 
What are the significant deficiencies in deep layer gradient calculation and capturing global information on the time dimension, as mentioned in this paper?

### Questions
Does the author address the gradient vanishing & exploding problem in deep residual architectures with the new LMU model? 
How? 
The authors listed results of cifar data set on resnet, can you provide results on vgg as well?

5: You are absolutely certain about your assessment. You are very familiar with the related work and checked the math/other details carefully.

### Summary
This paper analyzes the limitations of the vanilla LIF neuron model, including the problems of gradient vanishing and exploding, as well as the inability to differentiate the current response by extracting past information. Based on these analyses, the authors propose a novel learnable multi-hierarchical model that has a wider calculation scope along the time dimension by incorporating the functions of dendrite and soma. Additionaly, they further design a progressive STBP training framework for the LM-H model.

### Strengths
1.The proposed model is neural-inspired.  

2.The work is solid. The authors provide rigorous theoretical analysis of the LM-H model and demonstrate that the LIF model is merely a subset of the LM-H model.

3.The progressive training method efficiently solves the multi-parameter learning problem of the LM-H model.

4.Experimental results demonstrate the significant advantages of the LM-H model across multiple datasets.

### Weaknesses
1.The authors illustrate the issues of gradient vanishing and exploding faced by the LIF neuron. However, they have not demonstrated how the proposed LM-H model addresses these problems.

2.The figures displayed in this paper solely depict the vanilla LM-H model. It would be good if the authors can also integrate the radical version of the LM-H model into these figures.

### Questions
1. Please provide a more comprehensive explanation and analysis of the radical version of the LM-H model, and discuss its advantages compared to the vanilla LM-H model.

2. Regarding the hybrid training framework of the LM-H model, the author used the conversion framework based on the IF model during the ANN-SNN conversion phase. How about LIF neurons? Does it fit into this framework?

3. The authors have illustrated the distinction between their work and that of TC-LIF in the related works section. I suggest adding it into the introduction as well.


-------------------------------------------
Thank you for the clarification and for incorporating my suggestions in the revised version! Having read all the reviews, I concur with the opinions of the other reviewers that the authors have made a substantial contribution to developing novel neuron models for SNNs. This work will be of sufficient significance to advance the field of neuromorphic computing.
