## Abstract
Inductive reasoning is a core problem-solving capacity: humans can identify underlying principles from a few examples, which robustly generalize to novel scenarios. Recent work evaluates large language models (LLMs) on inductive reasoning tasks by directly prompting them yielding ``in context learning.''
This works well for straightforward inductive tasks but performs poorly on complex tasks such as the Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC). 
In this work, we propose to improve the inductive reasoning ability of LLMs by generating explicit hypotheses at multiple levels of abstraction: we prompt the LLM to propose multiple abstract hypotheses about the problem, in natural language, then implement the natural language hypotheses as concrete Python programs. These programs can be verified by running on observed examples and generalized to novel inputs. 
To reduce the hypothesis search space, we explore steps to filter the set of hypotheses to implement:
we either ask the LLM to summarize them into a smaller set of hypotheses or ask human annotators to select a subset.
We verify our pipeline's effectiveness on the ARC visual inductive reasoning benchmark, its variant 1D-ARC, string transformation dataset SyGuS, \revise{and list transformation dataset List Functions}. On a random \revise{$100$}-problem subset of ARC, our automated pipeline using LLM summaries achieves \revise{$30\%$} accuracy, outperforming the direct prompting baseline (accuracy of \revise{$17\%$}). With the minimal human input of selecting from LLM-generated candidates, performance is boosted to \revise{$33\%$}. 
Our ablations show that both abstract hypothesis generation and concrete program representations benefit LLMs on inductive reasoning tasks.\looseness=-1

### Confidence
2: You are willing to defend your assessment, but it is quite likely that you did not understand the central parts of the submission or that you are unfamiliar with some pieces of related work. Math/other details were not carefully checked.

### Summary
This paper proposes a pipeline to solve abstraction and reasoning tasks. The pipeline prompts LLMs to propose hypothesis about the problem, convert the hypothesis into executable programs, which is later validated against the ground truth outputs given inputs. Experiments on ARC, 1D-ARC, and SyGus demonstrates that the proposed pipeline is effective.

### Strengths
- The ablation studies are quite extensive. The authors dissect the effect of each component in the pipeline by, for example, skipping the program generation, skipping generation of natural language hypothesis. The performance improvement of the full pipeline is also clear.
- The abundant technical details contribute to the reproducibility of the work.

### Weaknesses
- Which part of the pipeline is novel is not quite clear from the paper writing

The paper introduces every part the proposed pipeline in intensive details - but it is not quite clear which part of the pipeline is novel. I feel compared to earlier works like program-of-thoughts, the novel part is generating natural language hypothesis before program generation and a verification step to verify the correctness of hypothesis. I suggest adding a paragraph in introduction to highlight which parts are novel and the contributions of the work.


- I feel some experiments, such as comparing the performance of GPT 3.5 and GPT 4 is not relevant to the main contribution of the paper. The numbers of these experiments can be moved to appendix to avoid distraction.

### Questions
- In Table 3, why are the names of the methods different from Table 1. Does "Full" in Table correspond to any method in Table 1?
- For negative results presented in Sec. 3.4, I suggest to summarize them in a table as well.

### Summary
The paper addresses the challenge of inductive reasoning in large language models (LLMs). Directly prompting by in-context learning may not be able to solve complex tasks. The authors propose a novel approach inspired by the Bayesian rule that involves generating explicit hypotheses in natural language and then translating them into concrete Python programs, which can be verified. This approach, tested on tasks like ARC, 1D-ARC, and SyGuS, significantly improves LLMs' performance. By combining abstract reasoning with programmatic logic, and filtering hypotheses through LLM summaries or human annotators, the method demonstrates substantial improvements, achieving up to 37.5% accuracy on ARC, compared to a 12.5% baseline. The paper highlights the synergy between natural language processing and programmatic approaches in enhancing LLM inductive reasoning.

### Strengths
1. The paper introduces a novel method of enhancing inductive reasoning in LLMs by generating explicit hypotheses and translating them into Python programs. This approach creatively combines the strengths of natural language processing and programmatic logic, offering a unique solution to the challenge of inductive reasoning in complex tasks.
2. The paper stands out for its robust methodology and the quality of its experimental results. The authors thoroughly test their approach on challenging datasets like ARC, demonstrating significant improvements in LLM performance. The ablation studies further substantiate the quality of the research, clarifying the contributions of each component of the proposed method.
3. The presentation is good with clarity, presenting complex ideas and methodologies in a comprehensible manner. This clarity enhances the paper's accessibility to a broad audience, which is crucial for disseminating innovative ideas.

### Weaknesses
1. While the method of generating and implementing hypotheses as Python programs is innovative, it may pose scalability challenges. For instance, generating a large number of hypotheses for complex problems could be computationally intensive and time-consuming. Moreover, the filtering process—whether automated or human-assisted—might not efficiently narrow down to the most effective hypotheses. To improve, the authors could explore more sophisticated algorithms for hypothesis generation that prioritize efficiency and scalability, possibly through more advanced heuristics or machine learning techniques.
2. The paper demonstrates success in specific datasets like ARC, 1D-ARC, and SyGuS, but it's unclear how well this method generalizes to other types of inductive reasoning tasks, particularly those with differing structures or complexity levels, or even cannot be solved with python programs. Also, the baselines are limited only with direct prompting and ablated baselines, with no baselines from related works. In other words, the range of experimental tasks presented is somewhat limited, potentially restricting the scope of the paper’s conclusions.
3. The hypothesis proposal and selection process is essentially a search problem. The proposed iterative sampling and verification process is costly and inefficient from the perspective of search. The authors could consider more advanced search methods, such as DFS/BFS/MSTC, etc. Get some inspiration from the recent tree search prompting literature, like Tree-of-thoughts, reasoning-via-planning, etc.

### Questions
- Is there potential for the proposed method to be generalized across a broader array of tasks beyond those presented in the paper?
- How might this method perform tasks that are inherently difficult or perhaps impossible to encapsulate within a programmable framework?
- Could the authors clarify the missing elements in the appendix that might be pertinent to the paper's methodology or findings?
- Regarding the ARC tasks, what is the average duration, and why do most exceed the 4096 token limit imposed by many LLMs?
- The Direct Prompting baseline, is it just few-shot prompting or Chain-of-thought prompting?

### Summary
This paper presents the hypothesis search approach for inductive reasoning. Specifically, hypothesis search first generates multiple hypotheses on the shared transformation rule for the given input-output pairs. Afterward, a subset of hypotheses is selected by humans, or summarized by the LLM. Finally, the LLM generates the Python program given a hypothesis, and the program is executed on the input-output pairs to verify the correctness. They evaluate their approach on ARC, 1D-ARC and SyGuS. Using GPT-4, their approach outperforms the baselines that directly generate the answer or the Python program without hypothesis generation. In particular, they demonstrate that using hypotheses generated by GPT-4 achieves the same performance as using human-written hypotheses.

### Strengths
1. Inductive reasoning is an important and challenging problem. This work achieves a notable improvement on ARC and 1D-ARC, showing that combining both abstract hypothesis and concrete code is beneficial.

2. The approach of hypothesis summarization is interesting. Also, it is an interesting finding that using GPT4-generated hypotheses achieves the same performance as using human-written hypotheses, demonstrating the promise of LLMs for generating high-quality hypotheses for inductive reasoning.

### Weaknesses
While the overall results are promising, a lot of important ablations and details are missing in the draft.

1. What is the performance with different number of hypotheses? Specifically, in Table 1, it is important to know the performance with fewer number of initial generated hypotheses, such as 8. Comparing hypothesis summarization with directly generating 8 initial hypotheses can validate the importance of the hypothesis summarization stage.

2. In Table 1, the comparison of sample size and token size among different methods is unclear. Specifically, for hypothesis summarization, it is better to uniformly require the model to generate 8 programs for each of the 8 hypotheses for all problems, instead of only applying to 21 tasks, so that the sampling size is more comparable to the program prompting. Similarly, for human-selected hypotheses, it is unclear how many hypotheses are kept after filtering. It is better to always keep 8 hypotheses after filtering. In addition, it is unclear why the number of execution rounds varies for different methods. It is better to unify the setup for a fair comparison.

3. From Table 2, it is interesting to see that the final performance of GPT-3.5 is comparable to GPT-4. Have you tried gpt-3.5-turbo-16k, which has a longer context length? The performance may further improve.

4. The findings on SyGuS are divergent from the main evaluation, as the best result is achieved with purely code generation.

5. Please provide a quantitative analysis on the failure mode; i.e., the percentage of error cases where none of the hypothesis is correct, and the percentage of error cases caused by the wrong generated programs.

6. Please provide the full prompt including the few-shot demonstrations. The appendix only contains the zero-shot prompt. What is the performance of zero-shot prompting? How much does adding 1 or 2 problems in the prompt affects the performance?

7. The evaluation sets of ARC and 1D-ARC are too small. It is better to include at least 100 tasks.

### Summary
This paper prompts LLMs to generate Python programs to solve symbolic pattern recognition problems. This may be better than letting the model directly predict answers. On Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC) where the inputs are 2D or 1D pixel grids, letting GPT-4 generate natural language hypotheses to then guide program generation improves the result. Hypothesis generation slightly harms the performance on SyGuS where the inputs are strings.

### Strengths
1. The paper proposed to let GPT-4 generate programs to solve symbolic pattern recognition tasks. It shows that using natural language hypotheses to guide the program generation can be helpful on ARC, on which letting the model directly generate programs results in bad programs.
1. The paper reports the limitation that on SyGuS where the model can directly generate programs, hypothesis guidance is not helpful.
1. The presentation is clear and several findings are interesting.

### Weaknesses
1. The technical novelty is limited and the main challenge of generating high-quality programs is largely unsolved.
2. The effectiveness of the proposed method of using hypotheses to guide program generation has unclear applicability. (1) GPT-3.5 fails to generate meaningful hypotheses. (2) GPT-4 hypotheses are not helpful on SyGuS where GPT-4 can directly generate good programs. (3) GPT-4 hypotheses are helpful on ARC, but ARC results are still only 37.5 with the hypotheses. Practitioners will have to develop alternative models that can better understand 2D geometry to solve the task and then natural language hypotheses may no longer be helpful as in SyGuS. (4) Model-generated hypotheses hurt the performance of Parsel, a compositional program generation method that can significantly  improve the performance when model-generated hypotheses are not used.
3. Multiple questions need to be clarified; some requires experimental results. Please refer to Questions.
4. Typo: Sec 3.1 "It contains Although simpler..."

### Questions
1. Sec 3.2.2 says summarized hypotheses can often become vague and ambiguous. Will the hypotheses used to guide program generation be of higher quality if you let the model rank the hypotheses? You could analyze the recall@k, i.e., whether top k hypotheses contain a correct one.
1. ARC: In Table 2, using human written hypotheses only has 37.5 accuracy. Does that mean LLM fails to write programs based on correct hypotheses? The statement at the end of page 5 that "GPT-4 is pretty good at both generating hypotheses and realizing them as programs" requires some more evidence or explanation.
1. ARC: In Table 2, the accuracy with human-selected and human-written hypotheses are both 37.5. Does this mean model-generated hypotheses for each task almost always contain a correct one? Or is it the case that model-generated hypotheses sometimes have mistakes but, when correct, leads to better programs, and thus both 37.5? Can you evaluate the recall of model-generated hypotheses, either by some automatic metric or human evaluation?
1. For ARC, why do you only consider top-1 accuracy but not top-3 as in the official evaluation? Can you compare your method with state-of-the-art methods on the task?
1. What are the types of tasks that (1) program generation and (2) hypotheses search can be helpful? Can you summarize the features of such tasks? "Inductive reasoning tasks" is too general and abstract. To begin with, is it true that the method is applicable only to symbolic pattern recognition tasks?

### Summary
This paper proposes a new program synthesis framework for solving inductive reasoning problems based on large language models and prompting techniques. The idea is to first generate hypotheses based on the training samples, and then select a few hypotheses to realize their implementations. The implementations are verified on the training samples and the best implementation is selected to perform inference on the test samples. Experiments on ARC and 1D-ARC verify the effectiveness of the proposed method, while the proposed method doesn't outperform direct prompting on SyGuS.

### Strengths
This paper shows that large language models can generate natural language hypotheses based on the training samples. The generated hypothesis can improve the performance of program synthesis on inductive reasoning benchmarks.
The paper conducts experiments on ARC, which is a challenging benchmark for inductive reasoning.

### Weaknesses
The overall prompting framework in this paper is very similar to self-debug[1] , except that self-debug focuses on iterative refinement, while this paper emphasizes hypothesis search. If this is the point, the authors should provide a deeper analysis of the generated hypotheses. Algorithm 1 has a similar high-level idea of Figure 3 from the self-debug paper. So this paper is more like revisiting self-debug from a different perspective, which limits its novelty and contribution. This paper also misses an important citation[2].
Experiments results are not sufficient to justify the significance of the method. Of the 3 datasets used in the paper, the proposed method only works on ARC and 1D-ARC, which are very similar. Besides, it only uses 40 samples for inference and the variance of the performance is not reported. It is likely the observation in this paper may be overestimated due to variance in performance and model selection.
The contribution of this paper is not very clear. From the intro, it looks like the authors try to solve the inductive reasoning problem. From the experiments, there is no comparison with non-LLM baselines, and it looks more like an ablation study of using natural language hypotheses in program synthesis.

### Questions
Questions:
Is there any deeper connection between Hypothesis Search and the Bayesian learner mentioned in the introduction?
Sec. 2.4. “a lower bound” -> It is not very clear to me why it is a lower bound before I read the experiment section. May rewrite the last sentence.
Sec. 3.1. “It contains” -> incomplete sentence.
Sec. 3.2.1. perf -> per
Sec. 3.2.1. Human-Selected Hypotheses. Why do you use 3 rounds of execution feedback here? The other experiments are based on 2 rounds.
Sec. 3.2.3. How about the ability of GPT3.5 in generating hypotheses? Why is there no table for this section?
Sec. 3.4. Why is there no table for this section? Also the last sentence is an overclaim. It’s the improvement of GPT-4 over CrossBeam, not the proposed prompting technique.

### Summary
The authors propose to use large language models (LLM) to generate hypothesis for abstraction and reasoning corpus (ARC). 
Given a task in ARC, the LLM first propose a set of hypothesis, then either a language model or a human in the loop can select a subset hypothesis for generating a program that satisfy the hypothesis as the specification. 
The automated pipeline which uses the LLM to perform the selections has 27.5% accuracy, and with human in the loop has 37.5%.

### Strengths
Originality: 5/5 
The idea of using the LLM to generate hypotheses and then synthesizing the downstream Python program is novel and interesting. The experimental result gives positive feedback that the natural language is capable of representing human intuition in this low data in-context learning environment. 

Quality: 3/5
The experimental result shows promising improvement in the methodology. However, it seems still quite expensive and not reliable enough to generate 64 different hypotheses for the language model by setting the temperature to 1.0. It would be nice to have a chart on the GPT-4 query number against the rate where it hit the correct hypothesis. 

Clarity: 3/5
There are quite a lot of details that are necessary to help understand the work in the supplementary material, for example, the GPT-4 prompts. 

Significance: 4/5
This work is important to the program synthesizing community in how to synthesize a natural and intuitive program, instead of synthesizing a functionally correct but not necessarily generalizable program.

### Weaknesses
See strength.

### Questions
It would be nice if there a statistical analysis on the failure case analysis.
