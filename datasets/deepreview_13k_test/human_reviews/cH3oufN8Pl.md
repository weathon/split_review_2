# Label-Focused Inductive Bias over Latent Object Features in Visual Classification

- Decision: Accept
- Scores: 6, 8, 6

## Abstract
Most neural networks for classification primarily learn features differentiated by input-domain related information such as visual similarity of objects in an image. While this focus is natural behavior, it can inadvertently introduce an inductive bias that conflicts with unseen relations in an implicit output-domain determined by human labeling based on their own world knowledge. Such conflicts can limit generalization of models by potential dominance of the input-domain focused bias in inference.
To overcome this limitation without external resources, we introduce Output-Domain focused Biasing (ODB) training strategy that constructs inductive biases on features differentiated by only output labels. It has four steps: 1) it learns intermediate latent object features in an unsupervised manner; 2) it decouples their visual dependencies by assigning new independent embedding parameters; 3) it captures structured features optimized for the original classification task; and 4) it integrates the structured features with the original visual features for the final prediction.
We implement the ODB on a vision transformer architecture, and achieved significant improvements on image classification benchmarks. This paper offers a straightforward and effective method to obtain and utilize output-domain focused inductive bias for classification mapping two different domains.

### Summary
This paper analyzes the inductive bias problem in existing methods and proposes Output-Domain focused Biasing (ODB) training strategy to overcome this limitation without external resources. The authors implemented ODB on  a vision transformer architecture and achieved improvements on image classification benchmarks.

### Strengths
1. This paper raises the interesting issue of inductive bias in existing methods.

### Weaknesses
1.Humans benefit from world information being able to avoid input domain bias. This actually benefits from humans having more prior information and being able to build better semantic relationships between classes. While Output-Domain focused Biasing (ODB) is more like a feature enhancement method, which improves performance through decoupling and enhancement of features.

2.Figure 2 shows that the class centroids between some semantically unrelated classes are close to each other. Using triplet loss or contrast loss can also achieve the effect of widening the class centroids distance. It is recommended to add comparative experiments with this type of method.

3.The paper is not easy to follow, especially the descriptions of Visual Dependency Disconnection and Non-visual Feature Structuring need more details.

4.The proposed method has limited improvement in performance.

### Questions
1.Is the ODB method equally effective in convolutional networks?

### Summary
This paper addresses the issue where vision neural networks learn latent features which are (naturally) too focused on the exact pixels that are part of the training dataset -- since this is all they see, ignorant of the real-world relationships between objects (as illustrated by how ignorant a neural network can be of the distance between a mop and a komondor dog). To remedy this, the authors propose a novel method (ODB) where an auxiliary loss is introduced in order to enforce diversity in the latent vectors across classes. This loss term is disconnected from the regular discriminative visual features, so as to not pollute it. The authors show across 5 random seeds that they achieve better results on ImageNet1K than well-known baselines.

### Strengths
* The ODB approach does not use additional pre-training with large datasets and/or regularization such as MixUp or CutMix
* The performance of the approach is inspected thoroughly both quantitatively and qualitatively.
* The authors include transparent results on how they selected their hyperparameters in the appendix.

### Weaknesses
* The term of output-domain knowledge is very vague/difficult to interpret. At one point in the introduction you instead write 'undescribed world knowledge', which I think refers to the same thing, and is more clear to me. Would it make sense to use another name than ODB? Specifically to change the OD to something else. This would make the paper clearer. Output domain is the domain where you test, which I think does not really do the job here.

* In the related work, a knowledge graph is mentioned briefly while describing the method of one work. However, I miss a small section about the general idea of including hierarchical information or knowledge-graph representations into visual representations, which these authors are not the first to explore. For that reason, it becomes a bit difficult to buy when the authors claim they are the first to raise the issue of the implicit 'output-domain' knowledge missing during training, and a more complete related work section here would make the paper stronger (see for example the related work of Pan et al.)

* The conclusion and future work section does not really contain recommendations for future work.

### Questions
### Detailed comments

* In A.1, you refer to Tables 7a and 7c although I believe you mean Figure 7 and 7c.
* Conclusion: the phrasing "harbors unseen knowledge from human labeling" was difficult to parse and ambiguous.
* Conclusion: "on vision transformer architecture" >> "on the Vision transformer architecture"
* Conclusion: "in qualitative and quantitative analysis on its results" >> "through qualitative and quantitative analysis of its results"
* Table 2: Why not show the standard deviation if in effect these results were run using 5 random seeds? It seems relevant in your comparison to the baseline which is quite close (84.80 vs. 84.40). You cannot use the term 'significant' in the Ablation study section of Section 5.1 if you do not show these standard deviations.
* Table 2: explain what w/o Pos. stands for in table caption, even if you also say it in the text (if somebody glances quickly at the table.)
* Formatting of references generally needed, use {} around text which should be case-sensitive in the .bib-file. (e.g., "mixup" >> "MixUp" for Zhang et al.)
* In the end of Section 5.2, it would be great to specify either in the text or in the figure caption which classes numbers 1173 and 1813 correspond to. Are they the quill and paperknife or other visually similar classes?
* 5.1 title: quantiTative*
* Section 4: "doesn’t" >> "does not" (too informal)
* Section 4: "provide series of analysis the impact" >> "provide a series of analysEs OF the impact"
* The second paragraph of the related work contains a duplicate sentence "Lemesle et al...". Should be removed.
* Fig. 3 is a nice figure. Howeve,r it currently says "L_diveristy"  whereas I think you want to say "L_diversity".

### Summary
The paper shows that neural networks tend to focus on input-domain-related information, such as visual similarities, which can conflict with unseen relations determined by human labeling in the output domain. This conflict limits the generalization of models. To address this problem, the authors propose a training strategy called Output-Domain focused Biasing (ODB), which emphasizes inductive biases based on output labels. ODB consists of four steps: learning intermediate latent object features, decoupling visual dependencies, capturing structured features optimized for classification, and integrating these features for prediction.

### Strengths
1. The paper aims to create inductive biases based on output labels, in order to avoid the dominance of input-domain focused bias. The motivation is relatively novel.
2. The paper is well-structured and written in an accessible manner.

### Weaknesses
1. The experimental improvements over the baselines are relatively modest, suggesting that the significance of Output-Domain focused Biasing (ODB) may be limited.

### Questions
Is it possible for the authors to validate the efficacy of ODB in the context of domain adaptation? Is there a meaningful application of ODB in addressing input-domain bias when dealing with diverse visual domains?
