# Leveraging Behavioral Cloning for Representation Alignment in Cross-Domain Policy Transfer

- Decision: Reject
- Scores: 3, 5, 3, 5, 5

## Abstract
The limited transferability of learned policies is a major challenge that restricts the applicability of learning-based solutions in decision-making tasks. In this paper, we present a simple method for aligning latent state representations across different domains using unaligned trajectories of proxy tasks. Once the alignment process is completed, policies trained on the shared representation can be transferred to another domain without further interaction. Our key finding is that multi-domain behavioral cloning is a powerful means of shaping a shared latent space. We also observe that the commonly used domain discriminative objective for distribution matching can be overly restrictive, potentially disrupting the latent state structure of each domain. As an alternative, we propose to use maximum mean discrepancy for regularization. Since our method focuses on capturing shared structures, it does not require discovering the exact cross-domain correspondence that existing methods aim for. Furthermore, our approach involves training only a single multi-domain policy, making it easy to extend. We evaluate our method across various domain shifts, including cross-robot and cross-viewpoint settings, and demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing methods that employ adversarial domain translation. We also conduct ablation studies to investigate the effectiveness of each loss component for different domain shifts.

### Summary
The paper presents a novel approach to align representations between two robotic domains by training an encoder, a policy based on an MDP, and a decoder. The method is tested in downstream tasks, showing promise in its primary objectives. However, it requires additional experimentation to substantiate its claims and illustrate its significance fully.

----- Edit -----

I have read the author's response. I appreciate they helped clarify my questions. Unfortunately, the provided empirical evidence fail to illustrate the strength of their contributions. The concern I have about the existing evaluations is that: the choice of Point2Ant seems arbitrary, and need more systematic evaluation to show its generalization (Point2Hopper, Ant2Hopper, Hopper2Ant, Point2Walker, Ant2Walker, etc). To the authors' credits, they added Ant2Spider, which is an interesting evaluation. Nevertheless, I think adding more evaluation across more tasks would be essential to prove the proposal's generalization. So I chose to keep my score.

### Strengths
- Demonstrates an improvement over existing baselines on some tasks.
- Tackles a convincing problem statement that is relevant and well-articulated.

### Weaknesses
The test environments selected are overly simplistic and appear arbitrary, which undermines the potential impact and applicability of the proposed methods.

### Questions
1. Clarify the environment setup. Specifically, define the observational shift in P2P-obs and detail the P2A action space for both Point and Ant agents.
2. Expand the variety of domain transfers. This paper completed P2P and P2A. But we have never had a robot resembling a Point robot in the real world. Why not Ant2Hopper? Can you run more combinatorial options: Ant2Hopper, Ant2Walker2D? Can you include multiple source domains e.g., Ant, Hopper, Walker2D and HalfCheetah? With the promise of a general alignment method, it is necessary see how well the method perform on general and more realistic domains. While P2P and P2A transfers have been completed, the absence of a Point robot raises questions. Exploring transfers like Ant2Hopper or Ant2Walker2D and including multiple source domains (e.g., Ant, Hopper, Walker2D, HalfCheetah) would significantly showcase the generalizability of the method across more realistic domains.
3. Reevaluate the manipulation task in the R2R-Lift scenario. The current evaluation R2R-Lift is completed on end effector delta space. So the task setup combines (1) tabletop manipulation task like lift where the robot barely needs to rotate the wrist, (2) in end effector delta space, (3) using low dimensional vector space representation. The current setup is too simplistic to conclusively determine the method's effectiveness. Introducing tasks that require wrist rotation, controlling manipulators over joint space, or running R2R in the visual space could provide a more robust assessment.
4. V2V uses the same robot in the transfer. In this case, the encoder is essentially learning a viewpoint transformation. Address the V2V task's potential overlap with existing viewpoint transformation methods. A comparison with state-of-the-art viewpoint alignment methods could highlight the unique contributions of your work.
5. The proposal is learning two modules, encoder and decoder. It could help increase the impact of this paper to design evaluations to separately test how well your proposal is learning the encoder (e.g. your V2V task where the visual inputs are from different perspectives) and decoder (e.g. transfer between two domains with non-trivial action space).
6. Increase the robustness of statistical claims by conducting more trials. Ideally, such simulator task should be evaluated with ≥3 different random seeds across ≥20 runs.
7. Discuss the assumption that multiple MDPs share a common latent structure. The paper should acknowledge the potential risks of aligning distributions that do not naturally overlap, and if possible, provide an argument against this critique.
8. Explore and discuss alternative loss functions. The motivation behind the choice of losses is clear, yet an exploration of alternatives could be insightful for the reader and the field.

### Summary
The paper addresses the problem of transferring learned policies across domains. To this end, the paper proposes to align latent state representations across different domains using unaligned trajectories of proxy tasks and an MMD based loss. The proposed method is evaluated across various domain shifts, including cross-robot and cross-viewpoint settings.

### Strengths
• The proposed PLP approach is novel and interesting. The core idea of having a common latent space aligned using MMD is promising.

• The paper is well written. Figure 1 provides a good overview of the proposed approach.

• The proposed two phase alignment and adaptation training scheme is novel.

• Results in Figure 3 show clearly that the proposed model training with MMD is able to learn a common latent space.

• Results in Table 1 show that the proposed PLP approach is able to successfully perform cross domain policy transfer in complex environments.

### Weaknesses
• Relation to work in generative modelling: The proposed cross modal domain alignment architecture is very similar to “Latent Normalizing Flows for Many-to-Many Cross-Domain Mappings, ICLR 2020”. This work also includes domain specific encoders/decoders and a shared common latent space aligned using a INN.

• The paper should discuss the evaluation datasets/tasks in more detail. E.g. for the R2R-Lift task, the paper should explain in more detail the action spaces of the source and target domains. The paper only mentions that “a robot has to learn from another robot with a different number of joints and different grippers”. How much of a change in the action space / number of grippers can the proposed PLP method deal with?

• In Figure 5, the paper should explain in more detail the factors that effect the alignment across tasks. E.g., why is there is a significant difference in the alignment between P2P-umaze and P2P-medium?

• Application to real-world tasks such as autonomous driving: The paper focuses mostly on synthetic tasks. It would be interesting to see if the proposed approach is applicable to real-world tasks such as autonomous driving e.g. transferring from CARLA to nuScenes.

### Questions
• A more detailed discussion of related work will be very helpful.
• The paper should also discuss the evaluation datasets/tasks in more detail.

### Summary
The paper presents a novel approach to cross-domain transfer learning, specifically within the context of reinforcement learning and imitation learning. The core innovation of the paper is a method that enables knowledge transfer across different domains without the need for exact one-to-one correspondence between those domains. This is particularly useful in scenarios where the domains are significantly different in terms of observation space, action space, or agent morphology.

To achieve this, the authors propose a technique that leverages a shared latent representation space. This space is crafted using signals from multi-domain imitation learning and is further refined with domain confusion regularization via Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD). This contrasts with previous methods that heavily relied on domain translation techniques. It requires only a policy network and a few loss terms for optimization, making it more straightforward than other offline cross-domain transfer methods that typically need more models and objectives.

The authors evaluate their approach across a variety of domain shifts, including changes in observation, action, viewpoint, and agent morphology. The results demonstrate that their method outperforms existing methods, especially in situations where an exact translation of states or actions is difficult or impossible to achieve. The paper also shows that the method has superior adaptation capabilities for out-of-distribution tasks and that MMD regularization performs better than discriminative training approaches in these contexts.

### Strengths
1) The authors innovatively address the challenge of cross-domain policy transfer by adapting unsupervised domain adaptation techniques to the reinforcement learning paradigm, showcasing a novel intersection of methodologies.
2) The paper presents a comprehensive evaluation of the proposed methods across complex transfer scenarios, including cross-robot and cross-viewpoint transfers, demonstrating the method's versatility and effectiveness in diverse environments, including the adaptation capabilities for out-of-distribution tasks.
3) The proposed method leverages a shared latent representation space, which facilitates the transfer of knowledge without the need for direct domain correspondence, thus overcoming a significant limitation in traditional domain adaptation, such as more robust hyperparameters and training instability, reducing computational overhead and simplifying the implementation.

### Weaknesses
My concerns focus on the possible novelty issues and motivations.
1) The paper posits that existing domain translation methods struggle with large discrepancies between domains and may not provide stable cross-domain alignment. However, this claim lacks empirical evidence or a theoretical foundation within the paper, which weakens the argument. A comparative analysis or quantitative evidence would strengthen the case for the proposed method's necessity and superiority. Besides, in general, we conduct the domain adaptation when there is no huge distribution shift.  For example, in [1], the target shift is difficult to solve if there are no further assumptions. The examples shown in the introduction parts have less practical application significance, such as the adaption from the agent with no legs to other agents with multiple legs.
2) For this toy motivational example, despite acknowledging this issue, this paper doesn't involve it in their experimental evaluations. Including such a scenario, especially one that has been previously explored in the literature, would not only validate the method's effectiveness in extreme cases but also provide a direct comparison to existing solutions. This toy experiment has been explored in [2]. 
3) The paper could benefit from a more thorough discussion of other methods that tackle generalization in reinforcement learning. By comparing the proposed method to these existing approaches, the authors would better situate their work within the current research landscape and potentially highlight the unique advantages of their approach. For example, [2,3,4,5] also explores the generalization problem in the reinforcement learning field. 
4) The potential novelty issue.  This method is based on MMD, which is widely used in domain adaptation. What is the unique contribution to introducing MMD into reinforcement learning? Do the weaknesses in MMD still exist in this field, such as MMD's sensitivity to kernel choice and its performance in high-dimensional spaces?
5) While the method claims to be computationally simpler, the paper does not provide a detailed analysis of computational costs or training times compared to other methods. Such an analysis would be beneficial for practical applications where computational resources and efficiency are critical factors.

### Questions
As a reviewer with expertise in domain adaptation rather than reinforcement learning, my evaluation of this paper is primarily grounded in the principles and challenges specific to domain adaptation. My current assessment may evolve following a detailed discussion with the authors and other reviewers to ensure a comprehensive understanding of the paper's contributions.

The critical points of my review, detailed in the Weaknesses Section, revolve around the foundational motivation for the proposed method and questions regarding its novelty and empirical support. Specifically: 1) Why do existing domain translation methods struggle with large discrepancies? 2) How can we verify this? 3) Can this method be used for the toy example shown in the introduction?  4) What is the unique contribution beyond MMD and what are the advantages of this method over [2,3,4,5]?

### Summary
The paper proposes a method (PLP) for aligning latent state representations across different domains using unaligned trajectories of proxy tasks. It leverages multi-domain behavioral cloning to shape a shared latent space, as well as a few regularization terms (i.e., MMD and TCC) to further encourage cross-domain alignment, allowing policies trained on the shared representation to be transferred to another domain without the need for exact cross-domain correspondence or translation. The method is found to outperform existing methods that employ adversarial domain translation in various domain shift scenarios, including cross-robot and cross-viewpoint settings.

### Strengths
- PLP does not require discovering the exact cross-domain correspondence as a common practice well adopted in prior works, making it more flexible and applicable in various scenarios.
- PLP reflects on the widely-held adoption of domain classifier for distribution matching, demonstrating MMD helps with aligning latent distribution within a more modest manner and largely keeps the original representation structure.
- The method outperforms existing baselines that employ adversarial domain translation in different domain shift scenarios by a fairly observable margin.

### Weaknesses
- Novelty: learning a canonical representation space, as well as MMD and TTC, has already been applied in many transfer learning and cross-domain settings, not to mention that TCC actually proves to trivially contribute to performance improvement in experiement section. In the design of PLP, I simply see a combination of previous well-founded thoughts, however, expecting to see something more distinctively insightful to shed light on the avenue of cross-domain policy transfer where over recent years people have failed to deliver something new from a technical angle.
- Formula misalignment: the formulation of $\mathcal{L}\_{TCC}$ simply involves two encoded trajectories, which poses a mismatch with $\mathcal{L}\_{BC}$ and $\mathcal{L}\_{MMD}$ that are in expectation format over datasets.
- Shorthand misclaim: authors explains P2P and P2A in Figure 3 neither in the caption nor in the paragraph they first mention these shorthanded parlances in the main text (P5), but eventually in the experiment section, which would probably make readers confused at first.
- Seemingly symbol misclaim: inner optimization variable "q" appears to be missed to claim about what it means.
- Citation misspecification: "Kevin Zakka, Andy Zeng, Pete Florence, Jonathan Tompson, Jeannette Bohg, and Debidatta Dwibedi. XIRL: Cross-embodiment inverse reinforcement learning. In Conference on Robot

### Summary
This paper presents a new method named Portable Latent Policy (PLP) for cross-domain policy transfer and demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed method on standard robot control benchmarks such as D4RL, in both cross-robot and cross-viewpoint scenarios. The technical contribution of PLP is to leverage multi-domain behavioral cloning to align latent state representations across different domains. The key idea is to enable the transfer of policies trained on the shared representation.

### Strengths
1. Quality: This paper is well-structured and provides a clear and detailed description of the proposed method and the results. Despite the diverse experimental settings, most contents are clear and easy to follow.
2. Novelty: Overall, the core idea of multi-domain behavioral cloning via latent state alignment is novel for cross-domain policy transfer (although individual components like MMD and TCC are not new). Further, it is practical, as it avoids the need for labeling the exact correspondence of the cross-domain trajectories.
3. Experimental findings: The paper provides solid empirical findings by evaluating the proposed method in various domain transfer scenarios. The results show that PLP outperforms the existing methods.
4. Good reproducibility.

### Weaknesses
1. In Table 1, the proposed model commonly has a larger standard deviation than the compared methods. It would be good if the authors could provide more analysis of these results. Besides, I wonder if PLP (including PLP-disc) is sensitive to the hyperparameter choices.
2. In Table 2, the ablated variant of the proposed model, BC + MMD, outperforms PLP-full on three out of six tasks. This raises a question about the necessity of the TCC component in the overall framework. Further clarification on the role and impact of TCC in improving performance across various tasks would provide valuable insights. 
3. The method's effectiveness appears to be closely tied to the similarity between the source and target domains. However, the paper lacks an in-depth analysis of this issue concerning PLP's performance in various practical scenarios. It would be valuable to explore how the method performs when dealing with expert demonstrations solely from a highly dissimilar source domain, as well as when utilizing demonstrations exclusively from the target domain (where the source and target domains are identical). Additionally, the paper could benefit from further discussions regarding strategies for identifying a reliable source domain.
4. A minor issue: The description in the caption for Figure 4(e) appears to correspond to Figure 4(f).
