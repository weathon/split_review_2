# Learning Large DAGs is Harder than you Think: Many Losses are Minimal for the Wrong DAG

- Decision: Accept
- Scores: 6, 5, 6, 6

## Abstract
Structure learning is a crucial task in science, especially in fields such as medicine and biology, where the wrong identification of (in)dependencies among random variables can have significant implications. The primary objective of structure learning is to learn a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) that represents the underlying probability distribution of the data. Many prominent DAG learners rely on least square losses or log-likelihood losses for optimization. It is well-known from regression models that least square losses are heavily influenced by the scale of the variables. Recently it has been demonstrated that the scale of data also affects performance of structure learning algorithms, though with a strong focus on linear 2-node systems and simulated data. Moving beyond these results, we provide conditions under which square-based losses are minimal for wrong DAGs in $d$-dimensional cases. Furthermore, we also show that scale can impair performance of structure learners if relations among variables are non-linear for both square based and log-likelihood based losses. We confirm our theoretical findings through extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world data.

### Confidence
4: You are confident in your assessment, but not absolutely certain. It is unlikely, but not impossible, that you did not understand some parts of the submission or that you are unfamiliar with some pieces of related work.

### Summary
This work examines the behavior of score based and continuous optimization approaches to causal discovery when mean squared error is used as the objective measure. Building off of the work of Loh & Buhlmann who studied the behavior, and inapplicability, of the MSE under unknown variances, the work examines behavior under non-linear dependence and characterize the failure conditions. The authors then show that under the Gaussian noise assumption all log-likelihood based scoring functions are susceptible to scaling failure conditions. Empirical results are presented on synthetic data which coincide with the theoretical results.

### Strengths
This work provides an interesting and important extension in analyzing the issues with applying mean squared error as an objective in structure learning. Given the recent rise in continuous optimization approaches for structure learning I believe this is particularly important. The inclusion of both optimization and scored based methods is also nice. The authors do a good job of clearly defining the problem, and presenting the analysis in a clean manner, along with the implications of results.

### Weaknesses
I think the biggest issue here is a lack of discussion of / contextualization with constraint based approaches. This seems particularly important since constraint based discovery still constitutes a large portion of commonly applied discovery algorithms. It would also have been good to see comparisons to constraint based discovery in the experiments.

### Questions
Not necessarily a question, but it would be useful if the authors can add a discussion and / or empirical comparison of constraint based discovery methods.

### Summary
In this paper, the authors provide conditions under which using square-based losses will lead a wrong DAG result in structure learning in d-dimensional cases. They also show that scale influences the performance of structure learning if relations among variables are non-linear for both square based and log-likelihood based losses.

### Strengths
the authors provide conditions under which using square-based losses will lead a wrong DAG result in structure learning. The conclusions drawn in the paper are reasonable.

### Weaknesses
I think that the findings in the paper aren't unexpected. Learning causal structures should go beyond just predictive effects (MMSE). I don't see the paper as particularly significant.

### Questions
1.	In this article, MMSE seems to be used for prediction, rather than for learning causal graphs. The definition of MMSE is the sum of squares of predicted residuals, which characterizes the statistical correlation of variables rather than causal relationships. It is an obvious conclusion that only using statistical correlation for causal graph learning will lead to errors.
2.	In structure learning algorithms, the score function usually contains penalty terms, and the variable that needs to be optimized in the score function is the adjacency matrix W, rather than data X. In addition, the adjacency matrix W will also be included in the penalty term. So, why does the score function directly degenerate into a square based loss function? Or, why is optimizing the score function equivalent to optimizing MMSE?
3.	In practical applications, most of the score functions we choose are not affected by data normalization, just like the SRL function mentioned in this article. Thus, this article does not have a clear critical objective, or rather, the critical target seems to be rare in practical applications, which greatly reduces the significance of this study.

### Summary
The paper points out the issue that structural learning approaches that are based on a log likelihood or squared error loss, such as NOTEARS, are typically not scale invariant. This is, these approaches are typically sensitive to the scaling of the data, where rescaling can arbitrarily change the inferred graph structure. The authors provide multiple theoretical statements connecting the variance of the data with the squared loss of a structure learning approach under specific assumptions and evaluate the statements experimentally.

### Strengths
- The paper addresses a very important problem and common misconception when log likelihood or squared loss based approaches, like NOTEARS, are used for inferring graph structures.
- Great introduction to the problem.

### Weaknesses
- While the implications of the statements are definitely important, they appear rather obvious, since, for instance, it is well known that the L2 loss is closely connected with the variance. In that sense, the issue with the scaling is already discussed in other works. However, that being said, I did not find a paper that particularly focuses on this issue in a self-contained manner.
- The need for A2 remains unclear. In particular, the "invertibility" of the "function" in the related literature typically refers to the invertibility with respect to the noise, not with respect to the input. This is, in a general SEM Y = f(parents, noise), the f needs to be invertible with respect to the noise, but it doesn't matter for the parents. Otherwise, this would be an extremely strong assumption. In the case of additive noise models, this invertibility is always given by definition, since N = Y - f(parents), i.e., it is not a restriction on f. However, I might have also missed something here and maybe the authors can clarify this.
- While you reference great related literature commenting on the same issue, it remains unclear where they lack and where you are filling the gap.
- The proposed approach in Section 3.3 seems rather trivial. Here, I think the main focus of the paper should rely on the theoretical statements.

### Questions
The paper points out some very important issues with L2 and log likelihood based approaches. However, many points need more clarification. Some of my questions and remarks, which I hope the authors can address:

- Consider introducing the graph G more formally as a collection of nodes/vertices and edges.
- It would be very insightful to comment more on the assumption A1, since it seems to be very strong. For instance, the formulation of A1 implies that you only consider a chain or a fork or a collider, but none of the combinations. If this is true, this needs a particular remark and justification. Otherwise, it does not seem to be useful for any realistic graph structure beyond these trivial ones. 
- In this regard, at the end of paragraph 3, you say that with A1 you consider "all possible substructures", but A1 is clearly defined as "either .." and not a combination.
- Assumption A2 is a bit confusing, since typically, one only requires invertibility with respect to the noise and not the functional relationships (as mentioned in the 'Weakness' section). For instance in DAG-GNN, the "invertibility" only refers to the invertibility of Y = f(X, N) with respect to N. Similar to the previous point,  the need for A2 requires more justification and explanation, since it appears to be a very strong assumption in the current form.
- The unit measurement assumption is a bit unclear. Why is the unit of a node relevant, since, as you also write it, the "rescaling" is part of the functional relationships. In particular, the current paragraph even reads as that these measurements need to be comparable, but looking at the theoretical statements, I don't see why. For instance, one could model "Latency in ms -> Click Rates on a website as discrete number -> Revenue in dollars", where all nodes have a completely different unit.
- While I understand the focus on the MMSE, it should be noted that in an optimization task, some regularization is required. Otherwise, the best solution for ||X - f(X)||_2 is f(X) = X, the identity. Here, a brief remark on this would be insightful to avoid confusion.  
- One of my concerns is that the theoretical statements are rather commonly known points. For instance, there is a clear connection between the least squares error and the conditional variance, which is clearly not scale invariant. However, as mentioned before, I still see the value in bringing all these points together in a single paper in the context of structure learning.
- In Section 3.3, the exclusion of "free variance terms" needs more clarification. It currently reads as that one needs to know the graph structure to identify these terms, while the whole task is to infer the graph structure in the first place. I assume there is a misunderstanding where the authors can maybe comment on.
- With regards to the previous point, maybe looking at the conditional variance instead of the marginal variance could help in focusing on the structural connection.

### Summary
The paper considers many common score/loss functions used in learning DAGs and shows thay can lead to identifying a DAG different than the ground truth. More precisely, the authors show that the (non-)linear score functions are sensitive to the units of measurement used for representing the data, which can at worst lead to the discovered graph encoding an incorrect set of d-separations. This then could lead to bad results in inference. The authors also propose an approach for mitigating the sensitivity to the variance. The theoretical results are complemented by multiple empirical experiments on both synthetic and real-world data to provide evidence of the correctness of the claims.

### Strengths
While perhaps not surprising due to structure learning being a notoriously hard problem, the paper presents interesting and to my knowledge novel results on how susceptible many score functions are to scaling and the used units of measurement. One crucial observation the authors make is that poorly chosen units of measurement can lead to the discovered DAG encoding different conditional independencies than which the ground truth DAG encodes. I find this especially important since even finding a DAG from the equivalence class of the ground truth would be sufficient for many problems, but the paper demonstrates that the algorithms may fail to find such a DAG.

The empirical experiments demonstrate well the claims of the paper, i.e., model mean squared error and log-likelihood based losses leading to wrong predictions about the structure of the DAG.

### Weaknesses
My main concern is the practicality of the results for the non-linear case; see Questions. I'd be happy to consider increasing my score if the authors offer compelling arguments against my concerns.

Minor + typos:
- Line 5: Add space between "." and "The"
- Table 1 is a bit hard to understand for now. I would add a short explanation in the caption about what the reported probabilities represent (i.e., did the outputted prediction match your expectation).
- Sec. 3.1: The domain of the function $f$ should probably not be the set of parents but instead the power set of the nodes
- End of Sec. 2.2: Missing period after "GraN-DAG (Lachapelle et al., 2020)"
- I'd emphasize that the DAG encodes conditional independencies in Sec. 2, not just independencies

### Questions
Could the authors explain how these results relate to the identifiability results of Peters et al. [1, Cor. 31]? They state that the ground truth graph is identifiable assuming that each f is three times differentiable and non-linear, so what is then the motivation of considering MMSE in the non-linear case if it can lead to an incorrect graph as the authors describe?
