# Universal Backdoor Attacks

- Decision: Accept
- Scores: 6, 5, 5, 6

## Abstract
Web-scraped datasets are vulnerable to data poisoning, which can be used for backdooring deep image classifiers during training. Since training on large datasets is expensive, a model is trained once and reused many times. Unlike adversarial examples, backdoor attacks often target specific classes rather than any class learned by the model. One might expect that targeting many classes through a naïve composition of attacks vastly increases the number of poison samples. We show this is not necessarily true and more efficient, 
 _universal_ data poisoning attacks exist that allow controlling misclassifications from any source class into any target class with a slight increase in poison samples. Our idea is to generate triggers with salient characteristics that the model can learn. The triggers we craft exploit a phenomenon we call _inter-class poison transferability_, where learning a trigger from one class makes the model more vulnerable to learning triggers for other classes. We demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of our universal backdoor attacks by controlling models with up to 6,000 classes while poisoning only 0.15% of the training dataset.

### Summary
Whereas in traditional backdoor literature attacks focus on a specific target class, the proposed work introduces a method to embed backdoors from any source class to any target class. The method proceeds in three steps: 1) finding the class-wise centroids of clean-data feature extractions (using CLIP), 2) encoding each centroid into a N-dimensional bit-string, and 3) generating triggers corresponding to each bit-string (and, hence each target class). Classes with similar features are encoded to have similar embeddings. They show that their method performs and scales well with ResNets on four ImageNet-21k subsets.

### Strengths
- The writing was clear and easy to follow
- Their bit-string encoding approach is a novel and elegant way to share feature information between classes while generating a class-specific backdoor trigger.
- The experiments section was well-motivated and well-explained.

### Weaknesses
- In general, each experiment should be averaged over multiple seeds for statistical significance
- A major part of the backdoor attack regime is the preservation of clean accuracy, and there is no analysis on how well the proposed method protects a model's clean accuracy. This should certainly be included in future versions of the paper.
- The proposed triggers in Fig. 2 seem quite obvious to the human eye and may be susceptible to input-space defenses. I would like to see some analysis on the necessary intensity of these triggers and their brittleness to input-space defenses like STRIP.
- On the defense side, the authors "[halt] any defense that degrades the model’s clean accuracy by more than 2%." I'm open to feedback here, but this has the potential to straw-man some defense mechanisms in scenarios where removing a backdoor is worth the cost of clean accuracy. Including some results without this limitation would be nice.
- In addition to the above, the attack was not evaluated on data-cleaning defenses like SPECTRE, which I think would be particularly effective against this regime. I would like to see these defenses evaluated as well--and not limited to specific target classes.
- The experiments are limited to ResNet variants. It would be nice to show generality by including one other architecture in the experiments section.
  - Since most vision models rely on pretraining, one idea I would find particularly compelling would be to run the attack on a pretrained ViT.
- In Section 4.4, only a single setting of observed percentage is tried. The analysis here would be stronger if more percentages were tried
- I'm not sure about the timing here, but the authors claim that they "are the first to study how to target every class in the data poisoning setting." However, while [1,2] address slightly different settings, they seem to be *at least* related and possibly published earlier.
  - Depending on the nature of this relationship, I would like to see 1) these statements qualified, 2) a more thorough analysis of how the work is positioned in relation to similar work including but not limited to the papers mentioned.

### Questions
There are a few questions embedded in the above weaknesses. In addition to those I'm curious about the effect of pretraining on the proposed attack. Could the attack be injected in a fine-tuning regime?

**Note:** I'm happy to raise my score after the weaknesses and questions have been addressed.

### Summary
This paper investigates the utilization of a small number of poisoned samples to achieve many-to-many backdoor attacks. The authors leverage inter-class poison transferability and generate triggers with salient characteristics. The proposed method is evaluated on the ImageNet dataset, demonstrating its effectiveness. The authors provide evidence of the transferability of data poisoning across different categories.

### Strengths
1.The paper demonstrates clear logic.
2.The topic is intriguing and warrants further exploration.

### Weaknesses
1.The design motivation of the algorithm is unclear.
2.The concealment of the patches is poor.
3.The comparative methods are outdated.

### Questions
1.	The related work lacks a specific conceptual description of "many-to-many" and an introduction to recent works in this area.
2.	In Section 3.3, the encoding method used in the latent feature space is rather simplistic, where values greater than the mean are encoded as 1 and others as 0. What is the motivation behind this encoding method, and how does it contribute to improving the transferability of inter-class data poisoning?
3.	The author employs a patch and blend approach to add triggers, resulting in poor concealment of the backdoor triggers. Visually, the differences between poisoned and clean samples can be distinguished. Has the author considered more covert methods for backdoor implantation, such as injecting triggers in the latent space and decoding them back to the original samples to reduce the dissimilarity between poisoned and clean samples?
4.	Selection of baselines. The chosen comparative methods are both from 2017. It is recommended to include comparative experiments with the latest backdoor attack methods.
5.	The experimental results in the paper compare the average attack success rates across all categories. It is suggested to provide individual attack success rates for representative categories or other statistical results such as minimum, maximum, and median values.
6.	The authors validated the effectiveness of the method under model-side defense measures. It is recommended to include defense methods in data-side.

### Summary
This paper introduced a universal backdoor attack, a data poisoning method that targets arbitrary categories. Specifically, the authors crafted triggers by utilizing the principal components of LDA in the latent space of a surrogate classifier. Experiments showed that the generated triggers can attack any category by poisoning a certain percentage of samples in the training data.

### Strengths
$\bullet$ The authors proposed a method that was designed to poison any class, instead of targeting a single class.

$\bullet$ The proposed attack is effective than the previous method, especially when the poisoning rate is low.

### Weaknesses
$\bullet$ It is not clear why the proposed method improves the inter-class poison transferability and, in particular, how it ensures that an increase in attack success against one class improves attack success against other classes. Does the proposed method increase the transferability (attack success rate) of any two classes, even if these two classes differ significantly in the latent space?

$\bullet$ The formula in Section 3.2 needs to be formulated more appropriately and clearly. Specifically, do y' and y in the formula refer to any two categories or any two similar categories? If they refer to any two categories, please explain why categories that are very different in the latent space can also improve the success rate of the attack; otherwise, if they refer to any two similar categories, please give a clear definition of similarity.

$\bullet$ The experimental results require further discussion and analysis. For example, in Table 1, the proposed method significantly outperforms the baseline method when the poisoning samples are 5000 (i.e., the attack success rate is 95.5% vs. 2.1%), but the proposed method is suddenly worse than the baseline method when the poisoning samples are 8000 (95.7% vs. 100%). The potential reasons for the sudden improvement in the performance of the baseline method need to be discussed. Similarly, in Table 2, the attack success rate of the baseline method suddenly drops from 99.98% for ImageNet-2K to 0.03% for ImageNet-4K, which also needs to be discussed.

### Questions
What are the requirements for the surrogate image classifier? The proposed method requires sampling in the latent space of the surrogate image classifier, not the original classifier. Is it possible to use any latent space of any surrogate classifier? For example, if there is a significant difference in the distribution of the hidden spaces between the surrogate classifier and the original classifier, will this result in a significant decrease in the attack success rate of the proposed method?

### Summary
The paper presents a new approach for crafting universal backdoor attacks, i.e. backdoor attacks that target several classes at inference time, as opposed to traditional backdoor attacks that target a single class. In order to mount a universal backdoor attack, the adversary crafts triggers that increase the ASR on several classes simultaneously.  To that end, the authors leverage a pretrained model to extract the feature representation of the training samples, and then craft triggers that correlate with features used by samples from several classes. 

The authors evaluate their attack on several subsets of ImageNet-21k, and against BadNet's baseline presented in Guo et al. By poisoning 0.39% of the training data, the authors are able to mount an effective backdoor attack when no defense is applied. The authors then test the effectiveness of their attack when several defenses are applied, and notice a drop in ASR although the attack remains effective. 

Finally, in order to test how much triggers applied to a single class help triggers applied to other classes, the authors fix the number of triggers in some classes, then vary the number of triggers in other classes, and observe the ASR over the fixed classes increases as more poisoned samples are added to other classes.

### Strengths
- the paper presents an interesting approach to backdoor attacks where triggers affect several classes simultaneously
- the authors validate the effectiveness of their attack on a large scale dataset, and against several defenses

### Weaknesses
- the required number of poisoned samples seems a bit high, even for imagnet. other papers have shown that around 300-500 samples are enough to mount an effective backdoor attack [1, 2]. this is in contrast with the results observed in Table 1, where the baseline attack is not successful even with 2k poisoned samples.
- the authors only consider a single baseline model against which their attack is compared. this comparison is helpful, however, given the large number of poisoned samples required, it would be nice to see how other baselines would compare at that scale
- the parameters of the defenses were tuned for a simple baseline (BadNets). the effectiveness of the attack might be very different if the parameters of the defense were tuned to the authors' attack

### Questions
- can you please look into a setup with fewer poisoned samples? it should be possible to have a successful backdoor attack with close to 500 samples on ImageNet
- can you also tune the parameters of the defense against each attack you are considering?
-  if possible, can you provide a good baseline for attacks to compare against?
