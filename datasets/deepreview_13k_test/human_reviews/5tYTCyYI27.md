- Decision: Reject
- Scores: 5, 8, 3

## Abstract
While modern deep neural networks have achieved remarkable success, they have exhibited a notable deficiency in reliably estimating uncertainty. Many existing studies address the uncertainty calibration problem by incorporating regularization techniques to penalize the overconfident outputs during training. In this study, we shift the focus from the miscalibration encountered in the training phase to an investigation of the concept of calibratability, assessing how amenable a model is to be recalibrated in post-training phase. We find that the use of regularization techniques might compromise calibratability, subsequently leading to a decline in final calibration performance after recalibration. To identify the underlying causes leading to poor calibratability, we delve into the calibration of intermediate features across neural networks’ hidden layers. Our study demonstrates that the overtraining of the top layers in neural networks poses a significant obstacle to calibration, while these layers typically offer minimal improvement to the discriminability of features. Based on this observation, we introduce a weak classifier hypothesis: Given a weak classification head, the bottom layers of a neural network can be learned better for producing calibratable features. Consequently, we propose a progressively layer-peeled training (PLT) method to exploit this hypothesis, thereby enhancing model calibratability. Comprehensive experiments show the effectiveness of our method, which improves model calibration and also yields competitive predictive performance.

### Summary
This work investigates the calibratability and accuracy of various regularization techniques and a post-hoc calibration method. The author find a U shape calibration phenomenon where the calibration ability of the low layer and high layer representation is poor (high ECE), while the calibration ability of the middle layer representation is high (low ECE). 
The author further proposes a progressively layer-peeled training method (PLT) which gradually freezes higher layers during training.

### Strengths
- This paper gives a good background study and related work review. 
- The U-shape calibration ability phenomena in Figure 2 is interesting and intuitive. 
- The proposed PLT method is also simple and easy-to-understand.

### Weaknesses
- This work points out the reason for poor calibration as strong compression. For example in section 1 *"to ensure that the top layers of the neural network do not excessively compress information, thereby enhancing the model’s calibratability"* and section 3.2 *"significantly compress the sample information, thereby reducing the model calibrability"*.  However, this is no evidence to support this point. For example, a post-hoc calibration method that changes the temperature of softmax can change calibration ability without any information compression. 

- The explanation of experimental results doesn't align with the experiment itself. For example, in table 1 (weight decay = 1e-3), top layer (index 17) improves validation accuracy from 71.5 to 75.9. That is NOT a *"limited accuracy gain"*.  But this paper explains this result as *"We can observe that for all the weight decay policies, the top layers significantly improve the calibrated ECE with limited accuracy gain."*

- Wrong / unclear experiment settings. This paper claims that **applying weight decay to frozen layers is one key to the success of the proposed method** (in section 3.2). By my understanding, however, it is meaningless to apply weight decay to frozen layers. Because "frozen layers" mean the corresponding parameters are fixed.  How to apply weight decay on fixed parameters?

### Questions
- typo error "same same" in section 3.2.
- I suggest using "increase ...." instead of "improve the calibrated ECE" in section 3.1. Because "improve" means "make it better!"

### Summary
This paper investigates the issue of 'calibratability': specifically, which training techniques yield better calibration performance when combined with post-hoc calibration methods, and which techniques might lead to a decline in final calibration performance after recalibration. Building upon prior research, the authors found that common normalization techniques aimed at enhancing accuracy while penalizing overconfidence, i.e., weight decay, mixup, distillation, label smoothing, indeed hurts the final calibration (measured by ECE) when combined with temperature scaling (a post-hoc calibration method).

To study the problem, the authors analyzed the calibration performance of features from each layer using linear probing. They observed that for the initial layers, the calibration improves as training progressed. In contrast, the latter layers exhibited an increasing calibration error. The authors used the information bottleneck principle to interpret this phenomenon, suggesting that the initial layers of the model is fitting the training distribution, while the subsequent layers progressively compress model information to enhance the separability between classes. This compression process might compromise the model's calibratability (losing uncertainty information?).

Based on these observations, the authors proposed the 'weak classifier' hypothesis, which advocates for not overtraining the model's compression capability and not losing excessive information to preserve its favorable calibration performance, while still retaining methods like weight decay to maintain its accuracy. The implementation of this weak classifier involves gradually freezing the latter layers to ensure that the initial layers receive the most training, and the final layers receive the least.

### Strengths
**Originality:** 1) This paper introduces the concept of "calibratability". While prior works have touched upon some of its findings, this study offers more comprehensive empirical findings and insights. 2) While I am not deeply familiar with related works on "layer-peeled training," this appears to be the first paper emphasizing its role in calibration.

**Quality/Clarity:** This is a quite comprehensive and solid study that :
1. Introduces a pressing research question: Which kind of normalization techniques possess good calibratability?
2. Investigates this question through experiments to yield insightful empirical findings.
3. Explains these findings using information bottleneck principle, whose rationale fitting naturally and with empirical findings to support.
4. Proposes a solution based on these findings and understandings.
5. Verify this method through experiments.

**Significance:** The training method presented can enhance both calibration and accuracy, loosening the need for trade-offs and making it also practical.

### Weaknesses
**Quality/Significance:** The empirical findings and experiment results are based on resnet 18/resnet 50. Currently, more prevalent models lean towards vision transformers. From my observations, many transformer-based models behave differently from traditional resnet-type models in terms of calibration. For example, as highlighted in the "Revisiting the Calibration of Modern Neural Networks" study, models with better capacity like transformers tend to be more well-calibrated, while traditional models such as ResNet tend to be overconfident.

### Questions
Problem Definition & Empirical findings: 
1. Defining calibratability as "how amenable a model is to be recalibrated in the post-training phase" seems a bit inappropriate? For instance, in figure 1a, after training using the student distillation method, the ECE error is significant. However, after applying temperature scaling, there's a considerable error reduction. From this perspective, it seems the model is calibratable. But because its performance after adding TS remains inferior to standard training + TS, the model appears less calibratable. I think the description of calibratability should be related to the final calibration performance after combining with a post-hoc calibration method?
2. It's interesting that figure 1 g/h have different tendencies. Do you have any intuition  why different dataset have different tendency for ECE dynamics? 
3. Regarding that this compression process might compromise the model's calibratability", is it because the model, during the process of pushing each sample towards the class center, loses the uncertainty information of each sample in terms of their confidence?
4. Regarding post-hoc calibration methods, it seems you've only compared scaling-based methods. What about binning-based methods or kernel-density-estimation-based post-hoc calibration methods? Will they display similar behavior, and if this phenomenon also holds true with other methods? It's fine if there isn't time to do the experiments, I just feel it would be more solid to involve them. 
5. I wonder if the reconstruction error is related to the dimension of the feature embedding of each layer. That is, if the feature embedding dimension begins to decrease e.g. from 4096 to 2048, will the model begin the compress their information? Or even the layer dimension remains 4096, it is still doing compression? I wonder whether we can infer from the dimension that at which layer the inflection point might occur? The thought behind this question is that to gain the best accuracy, whether the model will try to keep all the related information, even those unnecessary?

**Experimental section:**
1. Can the average ranking be calculated separately based on different metrics? It would make it easier to compare performance improvements on ECE and accuracy. Also, can the ranking variance be provided?
2. It might be better if there is standalone performances of the method without combining with temperature scaling? Without temperature scaling, does this method show improvement compared to other training-based calibration algorithms? It's fine if there's no improvement since the ultimate goal of this paper is calibratability. But if there's an improvement, it indicates the method is still of some value when there is no validation set for post-hoc calibration (it is true that we can also leave a validation set for post-hoc calibration, but it also involves trade-off between the gain from validation set and the gain integrating the validation set into training).
3. PLT still uses weight decay. Given the previous findings indicating that weight decay is quite sensitive in enhancing calibratability, how was the hyperparameter for weight decay chosen? Are hyperparameter selections needed?
4. In Table 2, it would be better to clearly indicate that these are the performances combined with temperature scaling.
5. The caption for Table 4 mentions different models (Table 4: The comparative results on Tiny-ImageNet with ResNet-18 (top) and ResNet-50 (bottom)), but the references seem to differentiate between training from scratch and fine-tuning. It seems inconsistent.
6. Some typos: figure 1 (h): there is a "!". Page 7 "Weight decay for frozen layers" line 2: there are two "same".

### Summary
This paper proposes the concept of calibratability, which refers to whether a trained model can achieve better calibrated performance after post-calibration. The authors conduct experiments to demonstrate the correlation between calibratability and model parameters. Based on this, they propose a progressive Layer-peeled Training strategy. Experiments are conducted to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method.

### Strengths
1. The experiments and analysis in the paper are thorough. For example, many experiments are conducted to demonstrate that previous regularization-based methods have poorer calibratability.
2. The calibratability problem studied in this paper is interesting.

### Weaknesses
1. The writing of the paper lacks clarity. For example, in academic writing, abbreviations should be explained when first introduced. However, the paper does not do this, leading to confusion about concepts and wasted time for me as a reader. For instance, abbreviations like WD, LS, MT appear in Figure 1 without explanation. The y-axis in Figures G and H should be calibrated ECE instead of plain ECE, right?
2. Despite extensive experiments analyzing why previous regularization-based methods have poorer calibratability, the paper fails to draw definitive conclusions. The various analyses only show correlation, not causation, between network depth and post-calibration ECE. Specifically, we can see depth is correlated with post-calibration ECE, but cannot conclude depth causes poorer post-calibration ECE. This is an issue with the motivation for the proposed method.
3. While the experimental analysis is thorough, the paper lacks theoretical analysis and guidance to lead to clear conclusions about factors influencing model calibratability.
4. The paper lacks formal definitions for key concepts like calibratability.
5. The performance of the proposed method is poor. In most cases, it does not even outperform plain training. When combined with plain training, it can even hurt ECE (the authors relegate this result to the appendix rather than the main text).
