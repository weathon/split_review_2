# DySTreSS: Dynamically Scaled Temperature in Self-Supervised Contrastive Learning

- Decision: Reject
- Scores: 5, 3, 5, 6

## Abstract
In contemporary self-supervised contrastive algorithms like SimCLR, MoCo, etc., the task of balancing attraction between two semantically similar samples and repulsion between two samples of different classes is primarily affected by the presence of hard negative samples. While the InfoNCE loss has been shown to impose penalties based on hardness, the temperature hyper-parameter is the key to regulating the penalties and the trade-off between uniformity and tolerance. In this work, we focus our attention on improving the performance of InfoNCE loss in self-supervised learning by proposing a novel cosine similarity dependent temperature scaling function to effectively optimize the distribution of the samples in the feature space. We also provide mathematical analyses to support the construction of such a dynamically scaled temperature function. Experimental evidence shows that the proposed framework outperforms the contrastive loss-based SSL algorithms. Our code is available at \href{https://www.

### Summary
The authors focus on improving the performance of InfoNCE loss by proposing a cosine-similarity dependent temperature scaling function. The authors also provide experimental results to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

### Strengths
1. The writing of this paper is clear, and the descriptions and justifications of the methods are comprehensible.
2. This paper provides a comprehensive analysis of the impact of temperature coefficients on feature representation in contrastive learning.

### Weaknesses
1. The design of Algorithm 1 in the paper is merely based on certain rules and lacks theoretical underpinnings.
2. While the paper mentions that adjusting the temperature coefficient can improve feature distribution, corresponding results are not presented in the experimental section.

### Questions
1. On what basis is the cosine function used in Algorithm 1? Are there any theoretical results to support this choice?
2. Is there experimental evidence to support the claim that adjusting the temperature parameter can improve feature representation?
3. Why wasn't a comparison made with the method proposed by Kukleva et al. [1]?
4. There was a recent paper [2] in ICML that utilized individualized temperature parameters to optimize the contrastive learning loss. How do these two papers differ?

### Summary
The paper investigate the role of temperature in InfoNCE based SSL methods. The paper also provides analysis to support the construction of the method.

### Strengths
- The empirical results looks promising 
- The authors provided code to support their method

### Weaknesses
- I would advise the authors to continue polishing the presentation. For example, I had a hard time looking at the x-axis and y-axis of Figure 1(d), (e)
- Although terms TP, TN, FN might be well-known, I think it needs to be carefully explained and presented when you are using it under your circumstance. For example, it is unclear to me what is the exact definition of FN pairs in images. How do we measure it? When the representation are not formed, how do we effectively decide what is TP, TN, FN pairs without making mistakes?

### Questions
1. For Figure 1(b), why would the ideal convergence only have few points? To me, Figure 1(c) also looks ideal? The paper explains as "the ideal global structure should consist of N closed subser with Minimum intraclass scattering and maximized interclas distance". However, class itself, it a very vague and "human-biased"  term. For example, in imagenet, there are many classes that look very like each other, in this case, would it be ideal to have minimum intraclass scattering? In that case, would it be what's known as the neural collapse in supervised training? So, would that be an "ideal" representation we truly need? I think the motivation here needs to be very carefully explained and justified. 

2. In Algo1, s_ij is defined as the cosine sim of the pair (x_i, x_j).  If x_i and x_j are images, do we flatten them and compute the cosine sim? Or do we compute the cosine similarity differently? in the latent space?

3. If we go back to the motivation, would the proposing method giving us better representation? Visually? Is the method learning representation with more intra distance and less inter distance?

4. Does the method incur extra training cost? If so, how does it compare with the gain in performance? Because computing cosine similarity constantly could be a non-trivial increase in terms of computation (resource and time)

### Summary
This paper proposes DySTreSS to improve the performance of InfoNCE loss in self-supervised contrastive learning methods, especially for negative-required CL methods. Then, the author provides a mathematical analysis to support the construction of the proposed dynamically scaled temperature function. However, Experimental results show limited improvements over the baselines. Besides, due to the limitation of negative-required methods (batch size sensitive), and the mainstream of CL is the negative-free framework (DINO, iBOT), the significance of exploring NCE loss is somewhat limited.

### Strengths
The paper is well-written and easy to follow.

The proposed method is sound and the experimental results show a few improvements over the baselines.

### Weaknesses
1. As stated in the summary, due to the limitation of negative-required methods (batch size sensitive), and the mainstream of CL is the negative-free framework (DINO, iBOT), the significance of exploring NCE loss is somewhat limited.

2. The improvements are limited, which can be obtained by switching hyperparameters (e.g., lr, wd). Could the author provide the mean and variance over 5 times running?

3. The accuracies reported in Table 2 are too low. For example, Barlow Twins with 100 epoch pretraining can actually achieve 67+ top-1 accuracy. However, only 62.9 is reported in Table 2. Perhaps the author should tune the hyperparameters to make the proposed method comparable.

4. missing references. The authors miss some negative-free methods (e.g., Zero-CL, W-MSE, DINO, ARB) and should compare with them the main results (as they also provide results on ResNets). I recommend the author discuss the advantages and disadvantages of the proposed methods and these negative-free methods.

### Summary
This paper intends to control the temperature to improve the performance of the self-supervised contrastive learning in image classification, long-tailed image classification and semantic textual similarity estimation. Specifically, author propose to compute sample-wise temperature in the consideration of cosine-similarity between data pairs. The proposed methodology prevents hard negative samples from being repulsed away, thereby improving the performance of the baseline method (SimCLR).

### Strengths
1) This paper proposes a novel dynamic temperature scaling method for self-supervised contrastive learning and reports improved performance.
2) The paper shows that the proposed method can improve performance on a variety of tasks, including image classification in long-tailed datasets, small-scale benchmarks, and semantic textual similarity (SES).
3) The paper honestly cites related works related to core concepts ([1], [2]) and sufficiently shows that the uniformity-tolerance trade-off caused by temperature scaling is an important concept that has been discussed in many papers.
4) The paper well proves the necessity of dynamic temperature scaling through mathematical intuition.

### Weaknesses
1) The paper lacks explanations of key concepts. For example, to understand this paper, it is important to understand what FN, PN, and TP mean, but the paper does not kindly define each of them.
2) Some experimental results are omitted. For example, the paper states in the second paragraph of page 4 that it was inspired by the EMD ratio of TN and FN, but the experimental results are not reported.
3) There are some coarse parts of the notation. For example, the sample index is written as a superscript in equation 5, but not in other equations. In addition, p^(i↓j)+p^(ij↓) seems to be a typo of p^(i↓j)+p^(j↓i). In addition, ∂L/(∂s_ij )>0=δ in equation 7 should be changed to ∂L/(∂s_ij )=δ>0.
4) The theoretical analysis seems a bit strange. First, the proposition contains information about the slope of the temperature function, but this is not a mathematically proven fact, but just about the idea of the proposed algorithm. In addition, the author's claim that ∂L/(∂s_ij ) in equation 8 is always negative is suspicious.
5) Originally, only one temperature hyperparameter needs to be tuned for existing contrastive learning, but the proposed DySTress has more hyperparameters (τ_min,τ_max,Δ_s,k) as a result, and it can be seen from Table 6 that the performance of DySTress is sensitive to the values of hyperparameters.

### Questions
1) True negatives with high cosine similarity may actually belong to different classes. However, could DySTreSS hinder the proper repulsoin from those TNs, thereby accumulating noises and aggravating overfitting?
2) Why is the temperature scaling function used in the main text different from the temperature scaling function obtained from the ODE solution in the appendix? And why was the function in Algorithm 1 chosen as the temperature scaling function among several candidates? Are there any comparison experiments with other temperature scaling functions?
3) In the Experimental Results section, the proposed method seems to have been carefully tuned for optimal performance w,r,t tge hyperparameters (Δ_s,k, etc.). Were the hyperparameters for the other baseline methods also tuned in a fair manner?
4) Cosine similarity is high for hard negative samples, so it makes sense to give them a high temperature to reduce their weight. However, why do we need to increase the temperature for easy negative samples with low cosine similarity? I think a monotonically increasing temperature function would make more sense. Are there any experiments with this?
