- Decision: Accept
- Scores: 6, 6, 6, 6

## Abstract
Learned lossless data compression has garnered significant attention recently due to its superior compression ratios compared to traditional compressors. However, the computational efficiency of these models jeopardizes their practicality. This paper proposes a novel system for improving the compression ratio while maintaining computational efficiency for learned lossless data compression. Our approach incorporates two essential innovations. First, we propose the Finite-State AutoRegressive (FSAR) entropy coder, an efficient autoregressive Markov model based entropy coder that utilizes a lookup table to expedite autoregressive entropy coding. Next, we present a Straight-Through Hardmax Quantization (STHQ) scheme to enhance the optimization of discrete latent space. Our experiments show that the proposed lossless compression method could improve the compression ratio by up to 6\% compared to the baseline, with negligible extra computational time. Our work provides valuable insights into enhancing the computational efficiency of learned lossless data compression, which can have practical applications in various fields. Code is available at https://github.com/alipay/Finite_State_Autoregressive_Entropy_Coding.

### Summary
This manuscript proposed a finite-state autoregressive entropy coding method for efficient learned lossless compression, which utilizes a lookup table to expedite autoregressive entropy coding. Specifically, a straight-through hardmax quantization scheme is proposed to enhance the optimization of discrete latent space. Experimental results show that the proposed lossless compression method could improve the compression ratio by up to 6% compared to the baseline, with negligible extra computational time.

### Strengths
This paper addresses the shortcomings of existing autoencoder-based codecs and makes targeted improvements from several aspects. The concept of autoregressive modeling based on finite-state Markov model via look-up table is reasonable to alleviate the computational burden of autoregressive models. Besides, an end-to-end adaptive optimization method for selecting learnable state number is proposed to reduce the look-up table size. Furthermore, the straight through hardmax quantization method is proposed for optimizing vector quantized discrete latent space models.

This manuscript is well structured. The technique descriptions is detailed and easy to follow. 

Experimental results show that the proposed lossless compression method could improve the compression ratio by up to 6% compared to the baseline, with negligible extra computational time.

### Weaknesses
1) Some technique details in Fig. 2 are not clear enough. For example, how to obtain quantize latent y from discrete latent variables z and adaptive state number module?  How to obtain the codebook? There are two bitstream in Fig. 2. Is there any operations proposed for optimizing the data steam?

2) Experimental results are conducted on CIFAR 10 and ImageNet32/64. How about the results on Kodak dataset  and Tecnick dataset? Besides, only the decoding time are provided in Table 1, how about the encoding time? 

3) The proposed method achieve RD performance gain and computational efficiency at the cost of memory consumption. Will the size of memory change with different datasets?

### Summary
This paper studies lossless image compression and proposes a finite-state autoregressive model to model the data, relying on a lookup table to predict likelihoods. They also present a soft relaxation of VQ to improve optimization.

### Strengths
The paper focuses on improving compression rates without increasing computational needs. In Table 2, we see that the authors succeed at this, improving over PLIC without significantly slowing the method down.

The soft VQ variatn (STHQ) is sensible.

The idea to parameterize a lookup table with an MLP and rely on the discrete nature of the inputs is smart.

### Weaknesses
Presentation of Results
- I had a very hard time following the results. Some suggestions: Please clarify what architecture was used for Table 1. I did not find it in the text and initially was confused why the IN32 results are so much higher than what is typical in the literature
- Can you consider replacing Table 2 with a three figures like in PLIC? Where we have one figure for each dataset, and see DSpd vs. BPD? This would make it much much easier to understand the contribution of this paper. Also, some of the methods that have been published for a long time are missing in the table (IDF, IDF++), and I don't know where the 0.057 MB/s for L3C is coming from, interpolating from Table 54 in their paper, I arrive at 0.66MB/s (I was confused because I remember they were only 3x slower than FLIF)

Related work
In the context of STVQ, I am missing a citation to Agustsson et al, 2017, "Soft-to-Hard Vector Quantization for End-to-End Learning Compressible Representations", https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.00648. IIUC, they applied a similar Gumbal Softmax trick, but also used it in the forward pass (whereas STVQ uses argmax for the forward). Still, this seems related.

Minor
- Please remove the negative vspace around tables, it's very hard to know what is table and what is text.

### Questions
What is the state number you use? Ie if you use LSN, what is predicted?

### Summary
## Summary
* The authors propose a accelerated auto-regressive entropy coding system for discrete autoregressive coding. It utilizes a look-up-table (LUT) that somewhat reminds me of n-grams markov model. Further, it proposes a hard-max version of gumbel-softmax VQ, with the sampling step replaced by an arg-max operation. The empirical results support their claims well.

### Strengths
## Strength
* The finite state MC model seems to be a very interesting middle point between vanilla neural network based autoregressive model and vanilla n-gram model. It achieves a good balance between compression ratio and speed.
* The STHQ training of VQ-VAE looks interesting and experimental results show that the improvement of nll (bpd) is quite consistent over many hyperparameter setting. The proposed approach and result is interesting to general readers beyond compression community, as VQ-VAE are widely used in generative modeling (Latent-Diffusion, Dalle).

### Weaknesses
## Weakness
* I think the FSAR that authors propose is an entropy model, not entropy coder. Usually I only regard general coders such as AC, ANS, RANS / RANGE as entropy coder. And I tend to agree that autoregressive model, FSAR are only entropy model. Though they can be deeply coupled with entropy coder, I still think they are only entropy model. 
* As the authors have setup VQ-VAEs with various architectures, I suggest the authors test more variant of VQ-VAE training, such as expoential moving average codebook, and expectation maximization VAE, beyond the current original VQ, gumbel-softmax VQ and SQ. Furthermore, subtle variants of gumbel-softmax VQ, e.g., soft-gumbel / ST-gumbel, penalize KL-term or not can also be studied. Furthermore, it is also interesting to evaluate the sample quality of those VQs, in terms of FID / IS. As the models with better nll (bpd) might not have better sample quality, and vice versa [A note on the evaluation of generative models]. This can provide a more comprehensive understanding of the proposed hardmax-gumbel training strategy. And make this paper more interesting to density estimation community.

### Questions
## Questions
* The FSAR seems to be a general approach that is not necessarily used with rANS. Can it be used with any FIFO coding approach?
* The hardmax gumbel VQ seems to converge to softmax gumbel VQ as temperature cools down. The current form of hardmax gumbel VQ can be viewed as a softmax VQ with forward temperature 0. Is that possible to tune the annealing of softmax gumbel VQ to achieve the same effect of hardmax gumbel VQ?

### Summary
This paper investigates efficient learnt lossless data compression, aiming to improve the compression performance while maintaining computational efficiency.  
The model is based on autoencoder-based learnt codecs, with discrete autoregressive latent space.  
The paper proposes Finite-State AutoRegressive (FSAR) entropy coder, which combines a low-complexity autoregressive Markov model with a fast entropy coder to achieve efficient latent coding.  
The paper proposes Straight-Through Hardmax Quantization (STHQ) to opotimize the discrete latent space.  
The proposed method improves the compression ratio by up to 6% compared to commonly used discrete deterministic autoencoders, with negligible additional computational time.

### Strengths
Most related works are properly cited and discussed, thus the proposed methods are well motivated.  

The manuscript is well written and friendly to readers, with in-depth analysis of previous learnt compression architectures.  

The experiments are thorough and extensive. I like the informative appendix.   

Though the proposed FSAR and STHQ are improvement based on previous techniques as already explained in the manuscript, the technical novelty is enough from my point of view.

### Weaknesses
The memory consumption shown in Table 1 is significantly larger than previous methods. 

It is great to compare the net and coder latency separately in Table 1, however, the coder of each methods are not explained. It is important to mark the coder of each methods since the latency of network is very close.

Only CIFAR10, ImageNet 32/64 are used in the experiments. It is better to show the scalability of the proposed methods on larger image sizes.

Missing citations. For efficient lossless image compression, I noticed there exist two very efficient design [R1, R2]. Although comparison is not required, these two paper should be discussed to better reflect recent progress regarding efficient learnt lossless image compression.
