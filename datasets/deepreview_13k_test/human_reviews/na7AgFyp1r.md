# Empowering Active Learning for 3D Molecular Graphs with Geometric Graph Isomorphism

- Decision: Reject
- Scores: 6, 6, 6

## Abstract
Molecular learning is pivotal in many real-world applications, such as drug discovery. Supervised learning requires heavy human annotation, which is particularly challenging for molecular data, e.g., the commonly used density functional theory (DFT) is computationally very expensive. Active Learning (AL) automatically queries labels for most informative samples, thereby remarkably alleviating the annotation hurdle. In this paper, we present a novel and powerful AL paradigm for molecular learning, where we treat molecules as 3D molecular graphs. Specifically, we propose a new diversity sampling method to eliminate mutual redundancy built on distributions of 3D geometries. We first propose a set of new 3D graph isometrics for 3D graph isomorphism analysis. Our method is provably more powerful than the geometric Weisfeiler-Lehman (GWL) test. The moments of the distributions of the associated geometries are then extracted for efficient diversity computing. To ensure our AL paradigm selects samples with maximal uncertainties, we carefully design a Bayesian geometric graph neural network to compute uncertainties specifically for 3D molecular graphs. We pose active sampling as a quadratic programming (QP) problem using the novel components and conduct extensive experiments on the QM9 dataset. Results demonstrate the effectiveness of our AL paradigm, as well as the proposed diversity and uncertainty methods.

### Summary
This paper studies active learning (AL) for 3D geometric modeling for molecules. It introduces a diversity matrix to augment the active sampling in the AL process and reaches good empirical performance.

### Strengths
- The problem of active learning is an important and novel task in AI for drug discovery.
- The experiments seem solid.

### Weaknesses
- Some claims need to be corrected.
    - In the first paragraph in Sec 1, the 3D graph usually does not include chemical bonds.
    - In the third paragraph in Sec 1, it should be SE(3)-equivariant, not SE(3)-invariant. If the model is SE(3)-invariant (as it is now), then the claim that “can be applied in conjunction with any 3D GNN architecture” is not correct because there are equivariant models not included in invariant modeling.

- The core method needs more clarity to be understood:
    - In Sec 2.1.1, what does “equivalent” mean in “$h_{f(a)}$ is equivalent to $h_a$”? Does it mean identical? Equivariant (if so, there’s no such a statement for equivariance)? Or sth else?
    - In Sec 2.1.1, what do the curly brackets mean in “We define A to be mapped {-Reference Distance, … } isometrically to B, if …”? I can understand this sentence if without the curly brackets. More clarifications are needed here.
    - In Sec 2.1.1, what does “together with an additional constraint for each scenario” mean?
        - This sentence is saying, “A is isometric to B, if … s.t. …”. Then the authors say that “and with additional constraint for two scenarios: (1) If …, s.t. …; (2) If …, s.t. …; (3) If …, s.t.”
        - With all due respect, I do not fully understand what these sentences mean.
        - I can guess what the authors mean from the context, but such a description is not good enough and needs polishment.

- Almost all the equivariant geometric models (SchNet, EGNN, SphereNet, GemNet, TFN, Equiformer, etc) satisfy the ‘isometric’ condition. I am not sure why the authors highlight this in Sec 2.1.1 - 2.1.2. Besides, Sec 2.1.1-2.1.2 are disconnected from Sec 2.1.3 and Sec 2.2.

### Summary
The paper introduces an active learning pipeline for molecular learning by viewing molecules as 3D geometric graphs. A notable contribution is the introduction of 3D graph isometrics for 3D graph isomorphism. The authors provide theoretical proof demonstrating the superiority of the proposed method over the existing geometric WL test. A Bayesian geometric GNN is proposed and integrated into the active learning framework to compute uncertainties, which is accomplished by leveraging the estimated moments of the distributions of the 3D geometrics. The active sampling is formulated as a quadratic programming problem. Experiments on QM9 dataset are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

### Strengths
+ The introduction of 3D graph isometrics in this paper is both intriguing and novel. Despite its deep theoretical roots in group theory, the application to the problem of active learning is innovative and well justified. The authors have done a good job in detailing the theoretical proofs of the proposed graph isometrics, alongside a comprehensive comparison with existing methodologies like the geometric WL test.

+ The paper is well-written and articulate. While there’s room for enhancement (see questions and weakness), the current version of the manuscript efficiently facilitates a clear understanding of both the overarching motivation and the technical details in the proposed methodology.

+ The experimental results presented are compelling, effectively underscoring the practical efficacy and reliability of the proposed method.

### Weaknesses
One aspect that appears to be lacking in the method section is a detailed discussion on the motivation behind choosing the specific three 3D isometrics proposed. While it’s evident that these constitute a complete isometry space, there exist various alternative approaches and descriptors to delineate the isometry space, such as using the first and second fundamental forms. Enhancing the section with additional references and a more thorough discussion that delves into the rationale behind the selection of these particular 3D isometrics would significantly bolster the clarity and comprehensiveness of the presentation.

### Questions
- The paper keeps using "2D graph/molecule" to refer to "planar graph/molecule" or "topological graph". It is not quite concise, as "2D" already indicates geometric information is considered

- \mathcal{SE}(3) -> $SE(3)$

- Page 2 Section 2.2.1, how to ensure the bijective function f always exists? What if A and B have different numbers of points?

- Page 2 Section 2.2.1, how do you define A and B? I guess you are using the matrix by concatenating the point positions, but an explicit definition is required.

- Page 5 Section 2.3, what is the specific "off-the-shelf QP solver" being used? It is important to reveal the info here since different frameworks can result in very different computational speeds, as is already demonstrated in the experimental section. For example, how do you project the continuous solution to the binary space, are you using branch-and-bound?

- For the experiments, I noticed almost all the cases, the proposed method achieves a better performance than baselines in a large margin at the beginning of the iteration. Though it can be attributed to the proposed GNN, I was wondering what will happen if the proposed method starts from a "bad" set of initial samples. How robust is the proposed method to the initialization? Can it still converge to a better result if the initialization is worse than existing methods?

### Summary
The authors consider molecular graph classification where the data sets consists of a graph + 3d coordinates modeling a molecule. Thy introduce a set of isometrics which are meant to encode the graphs geometric structure and then use this isometrics to guide active learning on the molecular data set.

### Strengths
Able to integrate both spatial and graph information into an active learning pipeline. Promising preliminary numerics

### Weaknesses
Proposed method is slower than most of the competing methods because of the need to solve a QP

It would be good to more clearly the entire method (and how all the submodules fit together) a more clear way, e.g., algorithm environment, itemized list, figure.


The proof that your descirtors are stronger than GWL is less impactful because it is ** before ** the computation of moments. The hard part of getting a maximally expressive GNN is an injective aggregation scheme

The authors should make it more clear how \zeta is constructed from the different notions of isometry

The proof of theorem A.1 introduces new notation without explaining it

The proof of theorem 2 (part 2) omits the word ``theorem" while citing theorem 1 and also seems to misquote theorem 1. The proof of theorem 2 says cross angular is the strictest, but thats not what theorem 1 says.

Minor Issue

Sections A.2 should be before A.1. (I want to know what the GWL is BEFORE I read the proofs.)

### Questions
Theorem 1 gives relationships between 2 subsets of the isometrics. Can anything be said of the remaining subset?

Could you please provide a more specific reference to the theorem of Hall that you reference (i.e. theorem number and/or page number)
