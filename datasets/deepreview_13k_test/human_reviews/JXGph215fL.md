## Abstract
\looseness=-1
The process of revising (or constructing) a policy at execution time---known as \textit{decision-time planning}---has been key to achieving superhuman performance in perfect-information games like chess and Go.
A recent line of work has extended decision-time planning to \emph{imperfect-information} games, leading to superhuman performance in poker.
However, these methods involve solving subgames whose sizes grow quickly in the amount of non-public information, making them unhelpful when the amount of non-public information is large.
Motivated by this issue, we introduce an alternative framework for decision-time planning that is not based on solving subgames, but rather on \emph{update equivalence}.
In this update-equivalence framework, decision-time planning algorithms replicate the updates of last-iterate algorithms, which need not rely on public information. This facilitates scalability to games with large amounts of non-public information.
Using this framework, we derive a provably sound search algorithm for fully cooperative games based on mirror descent and a search algorithm for adversarial games based on magnetic mirror descent.
We validate the performance of these algorithms in cooperative and adversarial domains, notably in Hanabi, the standard benchmark for search in fully cooperative imperfect-information games.
Here, our mirror descent approach exceeds or matches the performance of public information-based search while using two orders of magnitude less search time.
This is the first instance of a non-public-information-based algorithm outperforming public-information-based approaches in a domain they have historically dominated.

### Summary
The paper studies decision-time planning (DTP) which is crucial in achieving superhuman performance in games, especially in imperfect-information games. The authors introduce the concept of update equivalence, a new framework for DTP that replicates the updates of global policy learners. This approach allows for sound and effective decision-time planning in games with extensive non-public information. The authors propose two DTP algorithms, mirror descent update equivalent search (MD-UES) and magnetic mirror descent update equivalent search (MMD-UES), and evaluate their performance in various games.

### Strengths
1. The introduction of the notion of update equivalence is novel, which is not constrained by the amount of non-public information, making it applicable to a wider range of imperfect-information games.
2. The proposed algorithm  presents competitive or superior results compared to state-of-the-art subgame-based methods while requiring significantly less search time.

### Weaknesses
1. The requirement that algorithm needs to exhaust all the search budget seems inefficient and the performance highly depends on this computational costs.
2. I would prefer a separate "related works" section to make the presentation more clear.

### Questions
How does the proposed framework of update equivalence fundamentally differ from the traditional subgame-based approach in DTP? Can authors put the differences or advantages into several points so that the ideas are clear?

### Summary
This paper studies the decision-time planning problem with imperfect information by relating it to global policy learners. It introduce an update equivalence framework, based on which two algorithms are proposed to turn global policy learners to decision time planners. Experiments on games validate the promising performances of the proposed algorithms.

### Strengths
+ Gaming with imperfect information is a challenging problem, and this work provides an approach that is different from the conventional Public Belief State (PBS)-based planning.
+ The experiment results seem promising.

### Weaknesses
The presentation of this work is poor, which makes it very hard to understand the core idea of this work and assess its soundness and contribution. Specific examples include:
- Several notations are never defined, such as $S^t$, $A^t$, $H^{t+1}$, $h_i^t$, $h_i$, etc.
- The definitions of global policy learner and decision-time planning are not clear. 
- Proposition 3.2 shows the connection between $\mathcal{U}^{global}$ and $\mathcal{U}^{global}_Q$. However, it is unclear how could Algorithm 1 converts a global policy learner to a decision-time planner, as claimed in the paper.
-  What does it mean by policy iteration local updating function? How to plug it into Algorithm 1? Why it can turn the algorithm to Monte Carlo search? 
- What is the definition of $\sigma$ and how to integrate the constraint on $\sigma$?

### Questions
- Does Proposition 3.2 rely on the definition of global policy learner operating with action-value feedback?
- How to guarantee the desired connection between $\mathcal{U}^{global}$ and $\mathcal{U}^{global}_Q$ exist, and if so, how to obtain the corresponding function?

### Summary
This paper studies decision-time planning for general imperfect-information games, such as poker. Previous methods face limitations when dealing with games where the amount of non-public information is extensive, primarily due to the rapid growth in subgame sizes. To address this issue, this paper introduces a framework for decision-time planning, focusing on the idea of update equivalence rather than subgames. Experimental results demonstrate that these algorithms, when applied to Hanabi, 3x3 Abrupt Dark Hex, and Phantom Tic-Tac-Toe, either match or surpass state-of-the-art methods.

### Strengths
The main contribution of this work is proposing a new framework called "update equivalence" for decision-time planning in imperfect information games. The key idea is that instead of viewing DTP algorithms as solving subgames, they can be constructed to be equivalent to updates of global policy learners in the limit.

### Weaknesses
I find the proposed methods to be somewhat straightforward and intuitive, and I would encourage the authors to highlight the novelty and distinctiveness of their approach. 

The theoretical results, such as Theorem 3.3, appear to be relatively basic and directly inferred from standard findings. Additionally, these results do not provide a comprehensive characterization of global convergence.


In terms of the empirical evaluation, I have reservations about the performance of the proposed methods, as they don't appear to offer a substantial improvement over existing algorithms. To strengthen the paper, it would be advantageous for the authors to broaden the scope of their evaluation, encompassing more complex scenarios.

### Questions
In terms of the definition of finite-horizon partially observable stochastic games, the observation function should be $\mathcal{O}_i: \mathbb{S} \rightarrow \mathbb{O}_i$ instead of $\mathcal{O}_i: \mathbb{S} \times \mathbb{A} \rightarrow \mathbb{O}_i$?

### Summary
The paper studies an equivalence between global policy learners and decision-time planning algorithms for imperfect information games. It argues that by using this equivalence, a new family of algorithms can be derived for solving imperfect information games that do not reply on public information. This makes the algorithms more efficient and more suitable for games where most information is non-public. The authors further tested the proposed approach in the Hanabi game, and demonstrated the advantage of the approach.

### Strengths
The paper seems to study an important problem relevant to interesting and high-impact applications of imperfect information games.

### Weaknesses
The paper is quite hard to follow. Through the current presentation, I don't find a clear message about the main approach and key idea of the work; See Questions. The notation and statements seem to lack clarity and rigor. The results presented look either confusing or trivial (e.g., Theorem 3.3).

### Questions
- What are the objectives of the algorithms (global policy learners and DTP algorithms)? Do they compute an equilibrium of the game, or do they just compute policies for the next iteration? What is the solution concept applied for the games studied?

- What does $g$ represent in $U^{global}: (\pi_t, g) \rightsquigarrow \pi_{t+1}$ when you introduce the global policy learners? 

- $\pi_i$ is initially defined as the policy of player $i$, but when you introduce the global policy learners, $\pi_t$ seems to be associated with a time step $t$, so what does $\pi_t$ refer to here? Is there an iterative updating process where a new policy is used in each time step $t$? 

- It is said that squiggly arrows are used to indicate randomness in the output. When you write $U_Q^{global} : \Delta(\mathbb{A}_i) \times \mathbb{R}^{|\mathbb{A}_i|} \rightsquigarrow \Delta(\mathbb{A}_i)$, the output is already a distribution over $\mathbb{A}_i$. Do you mean that there is a further randomization over the output distribution (i.e., a distribution over $\mathbb{A}_i$ is randomly chosen)?

- What is $\mathcal{P}_\pi$ in Algorithm 1? It seems undefined. What is $G$ samples in the algorithm?
