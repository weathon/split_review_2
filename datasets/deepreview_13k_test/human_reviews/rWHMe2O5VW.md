# Graph ODE with Factorized Prototypes for Modeling Complicated Interacting Dynamics

- Decision: Reject
- Scores: 3, 6, 5, 6

## Abstract
This paper studies the problem of modeling interacting dynamical systems, which is critical for understanding physical dynamics and biological processes. Recent research predominantly uses geometric graphs to represent these interactions, which are then captured by powerful graph neural networks (GNNs). However, predicting interacting dynamics in challenging scenarios such as out-of-distribution shift and complicated underlying rules remains unsolved. In this paper, we propose a new approach named Graph ODE with factorized prototypes (GOAT) to address the problem. The core of GOAT is to incorporate factorized prototypes from contextual knowledge into a continuous graph ODE framework. Specifically, GOAT employs representation disentanglement and system parameters to extract both object-level and system-level contexts from historical trajectories, which allows us to explicitly model their independent influence and thus enhances the generalization capability under system changes. Then, we integrate these disentangled latent representations into a graph ODE model, which determines a combination of various interacting prototypes for enhanced model expressivity. The entire model is optimized using an end-to-end variational inference framework to maximize the likelihood. Extensive experiments in both in-distribution and out-of-distribution settings validate the superiority of GOAT.

### Summary
This paper proposes a model for interacting dynamical systems. Their approach uses a Graph ODE with factorized prototypes and disentangled system and object level representations to enable greater generalization.

### Strengths
The paper outlines the key features needed in a system for predicting interacting dynamics 
1) Capturing continuous dynamics
2) Being expressive enough to capture complex dynamics
3) Generalizing out of distribution. 
They introduce different GNNs for different interacting prototypes with different updating rules.

### Weaknesses
This paper is very hard to read and uses jargon that most ML people may not be familiar with. I believe this paper is trying to do not just interacting dynamics but actually agent-based modeling. Given this context, I am completely unclear as to what a "factorized prototype" is, the authors just use this term without definition and repeatedly explain the method this way. The other key feature of an agent based system thats not just in an interactive dynamic system (like a gene regulatory network) is that the graph consisting of agents changes with time based on the movements of the agents. This would be the key challenge to using a GNN/Graph ODE to model agent dynamics and this is not  addressed here clearly despite defining the data as consisting of different graphs at different timepoints. 

Additionally the authors refer to some type of hierarchical representation which is again completely unclear. My best guess is that each object somehow evolves based on a combination of those GNN "factored prototypes" but that seems somewhat strange. Couldn't we just learn an individualized evolution based on a GNN with an MLP aggregation layer? What is the need for "factored" prototypes, I can at least see an argument for selecting a prototype (using a softmax or something of this sort).

The problem setup seems to sweep the most important thing under the rug. They talk about the problem of forecasting the dynamics of predicting the features, but what about continuously predicting the changes in the graph? Or are these all given? Aren't their observations discrete? Don't the graphs have to be updated continuously also, and how exactly is the graph changed at each iteration of the graph ODE? These and many question are unanswered. 

I would recommend for the authors to rewrite the paper from scratch, not assuming anyone knows anything about agent dynamics or object contexts. Define every technical term, and fully specify the problem. Without a thorough rewrite it is very unclear what is going on.  

Moreoever there are other agent based models like the agent former that the authors have not compared their method with.

### Questions
Exactly what sort of dynamics are you thinking of modeling and how does the graph changing over time get modelled in your system?

### Summary
This paper delves into the modeling of interacting dynamical systems, employing Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) as a fundamental tool. A novel approach, termed GOAT, is introduced, which capitalizes on disentangled contexts to formulate factorized prototypes for graph ODEs, aiming for heightened expressivity and improved generalization. GOAT meticulously extracts both object-level and system-level contexts through an attention-based GNN framework. The incorporation of disentangled representation learning alongside a mixture of experts strategy further propels the system's generalization and expressivity. Through rigorous experimentation on physical and molecular dynamical systems, the paper substantiates that GOAT surpasses existing methods in performance.

### Strengths
The technical robustness of the proposed method is commendable. Additionally, the paper goes the extra mile by conducting an exhaustive ablation study, ensuring a thorough validation of each model component's effectiveness, which adds a layer of credibility to the findings.

### Weaknesses
On the flip side, the complexity of the proposed method is rather high. The integration of a mixture of experts not only elevates the intricacy but also augments the number of parameters, consequently escalating the training cost when juxtaposed with the baseline methods. A comparative analysis with an ensemble of baseline methods might present a fairer landscape for evaluation, given the escalated complexity and training cost.

### Questions
The training cost is a pivotal factor for practical implementation. How does the training cost of the proposed method compare with that of the baseline methods? This comparison would provide a clearer understanding of the practical implications entailed by the proposed method.

### Summary
The paper introduces a graph neural net based architecture to model the dynamics of interacting objects. The architecture is an original combination of neural ordinary differential equations (NODEs), graph neural nets (GNNs), and transformer networks.

### Strengths
* The way the attentional GNN ideas are incorporated into the Graph NODE framework is novel.

* The way Equation 7 derives system-level features from an aggregation of instance-level features makes intuitive sense.

* The paper conducts experiments  on multiple challenging setups, compares against some state-of-the-art methods and reports strong results.

### Weaknesses
* While I appreciate the effort made in the paper to give theoretical guarantees, I have reservations about its correspondence to the mail goal. Lemma 3.1. guarantees only that the ODE has a unique solution, which covers only the computational aspect. This is not a surprising, nor a crucial result. In machine learning approaches to time series modeling, the main challenge usually is not to design ODEs with well-defined solutions. It comes straightforwardly after the Lipschitz continuity assumption that is easy to satisfy when the function approximators are neural nets. The main challenge is rather the predictive power and generalization capacity of the developed models.

 * It is very surprising that despite the extreme similarity of the paper structure, even Figure 1 and Lemma 3.1, to the material reported in (Luo et al., 2023), the paper does not clarify the difference of the proposed method to this recent work. Likewise, the paper aims to solve the exact same problem as Yildiz et al., 2022’s I-GPODE, which even has a subsection about the disentanglement properties of their Graph ODE based interaction model. Yet the proposed method is not differentiated from it. To me even a numerical comparison to such recent work developed for the same exact purpose (interaction modeling) based on the same conjecture (disentanglement) is essential. Overall, I think the literature positioning aspect of the paper is extremely premature.

--- POST REBUTTAL ---

The rebuttal response did not address my concerns. We appear to agree with the authors about the scope of the theoretical contribution of the work but we will remain in disagreement about its significance.

I also do not think my concern about the HONE paper is properly addressed. I still wonder what big weakness of HONE the current approach addresses, where the extreme similarity of the proposed material to this prior work comes, and why it is not addressed properly in the paper. I do not consider the difference in the empirical results as a justification for novelty. I was wondering about the cause, not the effect. I keep my score unchanged.

### Questions
* What is the connection between maximum likelihood estimation and representing a distribution by its mean mentioned in Section 3.3 by sentence: **Following the maximum likelihood estimation, here we solely produce …”**

* The ELBO part of the loss makes perfect sense. The way the other two terms are used in Equation 18 are also derived following well-justified desiderata. However, using the three terms together as part of a Bayesian inference objective is another game.  What is the forward model implied by the eventual loss in Equation 18? 

* How does the proposed method compare numerically against I-GPODE of (Yildiz et al., 2022)?

Because of a few major weaknesses, I set my initial score below the threshold. However, there is decent potential that these weaknesses can be resolved during the rebuttal, hence my score may increase.

### Summary
In this paper, the authors propose a variational encoder-decoder model to predict the dynamics of a system of interacting objects given a sequence of historical observations. The system is expressed as a graph, where each node represents an object and the edges represent the interactions between the objects.

The historical trajectories are processed by an attentional GNN encoder to produce the node representations, which are then aggregated to produce a global representation of the system.

A neural ODE decoder is designed to address the problem of modeling the continuous dynamics of interacting systems. The core of the architecture is a graph neural network, in which each node employs a mixture of several globally shared message-passing functions to aggregate information from its neighbors and model the velocity of its latent state. These message-passing functions are called prototypes and are learned from the data. The mixture weights for each node are determined by a function of the node representation and the global representation, which means that the mixture may vary across nodes.

The model is trained using the usual VAE objective. To facilitate the representation learning on the encoder side, the authors propose two auxiliary contrastive losses to encourage the encoder to learn 1) disentangled representations of the objects and the system; and 2) informative system representations. A set of known system parameters is used as a supervisory signal for the second loss.

### Strengths
- Nodewise mixture of message-passing functions is an interesting idea and seems novel to me in the context of neural dynamics modeling on graphs.
- The experiments are thorough and convincing. The authors show that the proposed model outperforms the baselines in both in-distribution and out-of-distribution settings. The ablation studies are also helpful in understanding the contributions of the proposed model components. The influence of the hyperparameters is also considered.
- A theoretical analysis about the existence and uniqueness of the solution to the proposed graph ODE is provided.

### Weaknesses
- The mixture-of-experts architecture is not well-motivated. While the authors introduce the mixture as a way to enhance the expressivity of the model, it is unclear to me what is the advantage over a single message-passing function that also takes the node representation $\mathbf{u}_i$ and the global representation $\mathbf{g}$ as input.
- GNN-based discrete-time models are not compared in the experiments. It would be interesting to see how the proposed model compares to these models. For example, the NRI model (Kipf et al., 2018) (where the Springs and Charged datasets are from) could be a good baseline.
- Missing related work: https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1lGU64tDr, where GNNs are also used to model the dynamics of interacting objects and similar auxiliary losses are designed for representation learning.

### Questions
- The authors claim that the mutual information estimator is trained **adversarially**, but I don't see any adversarial training in Appendix D. The authors should clarify this point.
