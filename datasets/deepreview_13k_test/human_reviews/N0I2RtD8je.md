## Abstract
\looseness -1
Reinforcement learning (RL) requires either manually specifying a reward function, which is often infeasible, or learning a reward model from a large amount of human feedback, which is often very expensive.
We study a more sample-efficient alternative: using pretrained vision-language models (VLMs) as zero-shot reward models (RMs) to specify tasks via natural language.
We propose a natural and general approach to using VLMs as reward models, which we call VLM-RMs.
We use VLM-RMs based on CLIP to train a MuJoCo humanoid to learn complex tasks without a manually specified reward function, such as kneeling, doing the splits, and sitting in a lotus position. For each of these tasks, we only provide \emph{a single sentence text prompt} describing the desired task with minimal prompt engineering.
We can improve performance by providing a second ``baseline'' prompt and projecting out parts of the CLIP embedding space irrelevant to distinguish between goal and baseline.
Further, we find a strong scaling effect for VLM-RMs: larger VLMs trained with more compute and data are better reward models.
The failure modes of VLM-RMs we encountered are all related to known capability limitations of current VLMs, such as limited spatial reasoning ability or visually unrealistic environments that are far off-distribution for the VLM.
We find that VLM-RMs are remarkably robust as long as the VLM is large enough. This suggests that future VLMs will become more and more useful reward models for a wide range of RL applications.

### Summary
This paper proposes the VLM-RM method, which uses a pre-trained CLIP model as a reward for training vision-based agents. VLM-RM models the reward as the alignment between a language instruction specifying the task and the current observation image while regularizing relative to a baseline prompt to remove irrelevant information from the reward. VLM-RM is empirically validated in classic control tasks and reaching various poses in MuJoCo.

### Strengths
- The proposed VLM-RM method is simple and works well. VLM-RM provides a way to use CLIP models easily as a zero-shot reward signal from text without having to finetune the CLIP model. Furthermore, the prompts used for the reward model in VLM-RM are simple and intuitive, highlighting the ease of applying VLM-RM.
- The experiments show the applicability of VLM-RM. In CartPole and MountainCar, the CLIP reward predictions align with the true success state, and we see the goal-baseline regularization helping for MountainCar. VLM-RM is also able to learn a variety of behaviors in the high-dimensional humanoid task. While the success of the humanoid experiments was evaluated by just one of the authors, the videos on the website convincingly show the correct behaviors.
- The work clearly explores the limitation of VLM-RM that the environments should be visually realistic for CLIP to provide a meaningful learning signal. In MountainCar, realism produces better alignment between CLIP and the true success state (Fig. 2c). In Fig. 3, we see the impact of modified textures and the camera placement on performance. I believe the limitation around the realism of the observations is more a limitation of the environments rather than VLM-RM. 
- The work shows evidence that VLM-RM scales to better performance with larger, more capable CLIP models. Fig. 4, shows the humanoid kneeling task is only possible with the largest CLIP model.

### Weaknesses
- The paper states that the "CLIP rewards are only meaningful and well-shaped for environments that are photorealistic enough for the CLIP visual encoder to interpret correctly," yet the paper focuses on control environments without realistic visuals. Why not instead focus on more visually realistic simulation benchmarks and not have to modify the environment to make the rendering more realistic to fit the algorithm? 
- It's unclear if the goal-baseline regularization is necessary. The primary experiments in Table 1 don't use any goal-baseline regularization. The analysis in Fig. 4a shows the maximum or minimum amount of goal regularization to be best. Additionally, to what degree can the same effects of the goal-baseline regularization be incorporated in the goal prompt? A more detailed goal prompt can just specify to ignore the irrelevant information. 
- While the paper shows the strong final results of VLM-RM, the RL training stability of VLM-RM is unclear. Is it easy for RL methods to learn from the VLM-RM reward? How does this compare to a ground truth reward? See my further comments under the questions section.

### Questions
- What exact values are selected for $\alpha$ in Fig. 4a? I recommend putting an indicator in this plot to show which values are used. 
- What is the optional context $c$ in Eq. 1 used for? I don't see it referred to later in the paper.
- Can the paper include the RL learning curves for all the experiments showing the number of samples versus either the predicted CLIP return or a ground truth metric, like true reward in the classic control tasks or EPIC in the humanoid tasks? Given there is a ground truth reward in the classic control tasks, can the authors also include that as a reference for the VLM-RM learning curves? It is important to see the training stability and efficiency under the CLIP model reward.

### Summary
This paper investigates the use of pre-trained visual-language models for specifying reward models for reinforcement learning agents via natural language. In its simplest form, a single sentence text prompt is passed to a CLIP model along with the pixel observation of the agent to produce a score that translates to the reward. A more sophisticated method is also proposed, labelled goal-baseline regularisation, with the intention of removing irrelevant information about the environment from the observation embedding. Specifically, it involves projecting the observation embedding on to the the line spanned by the task embedding and a baseline embedding, the latter of which originates from a generic description of the environment. The CLIP alignment is then calculated using an interpolation of the original observation embedding and the projection embedding. The approach is validated in the context of two simpler task, CartPole and MountainCar, as well as more complex ones in the Humanoid environment. For the first two, it is shown that the CLIP-induced reward aligns well with the ground-truth reward (which is not provided to the agent) and that agents trained with the former can learn to perform well in the initial task. In the Humanoid environment, agents are trained on complex tasks with no available ground-truth reward, and are shown to perform well in most tasks as judged by a human evaluation. It is shown that modifying the backgrounds and textures of the visual observations to make them more realistic can have a large effect on the success of agents. Furthermore, scaling experiments are run that demonstrate that using more powerful VLMs leads to better agent performance.

### Strengths
- The paper tackles the important and challenging problem of reward specification in reinforcement learning and effectively demonstrates a promising approach using VLMs.
- The method is clearly explained and theoretically simple to implement.
- There is valuable insight derived from the ‘tricks’ that get the method to work, namely the goal-baseline regularisation and the re-rendering of the observations to make them more realistic.
- Interesting idea to evaluate performance on tasks with no ground truth reward via EPIC distance with human-evaluated reward.
- The scaling experiments that show that performance improves with the size of the VLM are very encouraging for the scalability of the method.

### Weaknesses
- Risk of bias in human experiments. While this is duly acknowledged in the paper, the fact that the human analysis was conducted by one of the authors of the paper is a potentially strong source of bias in the human evaluation.
- It is stated that ‘minimal prompt engineering’ was required to find the right single text prompt for the reward function but the process for discovering the right prompt and the robustness of the method with respect to noise in the prompt / semantic variations is not discussed.
- There is some evidence in the experiments of reward misspecification with the VLM, a theoretical limitation acknowledged by the authors in the conclusion. It is noted that when the regularisation strength is high for realistic MountainCar that the CLIP reward function reflects the shape of the mountain. The fact that going up the small hill to the left gives high CLIP reward is useful because it encourages a policy where the mountain car oscillates in the valley until it has enough momentum to reach the top right (where the ground truth reward lies), but this is somewhat of a fortunate coincidence as there is actually a mismatch here with the ground-truth reward, which only rewards reaching the top right.

### Questions
- Could the authors elaborate on the ‘minimal prompt engineering’ required to find the single sentence prompts for each task? Also, are there any results demonstrating the robustness of the method to syntactic variations in the prompt?

### Summary
Using VLM to generate intrinsic rewards is a new venue since manually specifying reward functions for real-world tasks is often infeasible. In this paper, the authors propose VLM-RM, a method for using pre-trained VLMs as a reward model for vision-based RL tasks. In more detail, they introduce a baseline as regularization for the final reward. The baseline aims to remove the irrelevant part in the CLIP embeddings. This irrelevant info means the natural language description of the environment setting in its default state, irrespective of the goal. As for the experiment part, the authors validate their method in the standard CartPole and MountainCar RL benchmarks.

### Strengths
1. Designing a more RL-friendly reward is an interesting research direction. It can help the generalization of policy learning. 
2. Removing the unimportant part from the CLIP embeddings seems to be a reasonable direction for improving the performance of VLM rewards.
3. The paper is easy to follow.

### Weaknesses
1. The contribution is limited and the motivation is not clear. Intuitively, I can also claim that the background information of the language description is not useless since different instructions may have different meanings in different environments. I encourage authors to provide more theoretical analysis to support the effectiveness of the proposed baseline if any. In addition, simply proposing one regularization is not novelty enough unless the authors can prove it can boost performance in a wide range of tasks. 

2.  The experiments are not sufficient. Taking Figure 3 as an example, more seeds and more tasks should be included for baselines.

### Questions

### Summary
The paper proposes to use pre-trained CLIP embeddings as 0-shot language-conditioned rewards for RL. It further proposes a "baseline regularization" technique that aims to normalize rewards by removing features from the reward function that are irrelevant to the task. The paper demonstrates learning of humanoid posing tasks for which ground truth rewards are hard to specify and discusses several approaches for evaluating the reward models in such scenarios without groundtruth rewards.

### Strengths
The problem of learning reward functions for RL is important, since for many applications, e.g. real world robot learning, it is hard to specify ground truth reward functions without serious instrumentation of the environment. The paper shows impressive results on several humanoid posing task that require a level of granularity unseen in previous 0-shot CLIP reward papers.

The proposed "baseline regularization" technique for learned rewards is interesting and novel to my knowledge. I also found the discussion of using EPIC distance to offline-score the reward model interesting.

Overall, the paper is well-written and easy to follow. I appreciate that the authors provide qualitative videos of the learned behaviors.

### Weaknesses
The proposed approach of using a CLIP model 0-shot to specify language-conditioned rewards is not novel, and the relevant references are cited in the related work section (Cui et al., Mahmoudieh et al.). The main technical novelty is in proposing the baseline regularization. However, the main experiment on learning humanoid posing tasks does not use this regularization at all. As such, it appears that the used approach in these experiments is identical to those proposed in prior work (Mahmoudieh et al), just applied on a different task.

In the same vein, the paper is lacking any comparison to prior work. This may be because the method is identical to prior work, just applied on a different domain? I do think it is valuable to show that CLIP-based rewards can work 0-shot in more challenging domains, but without technical novelty this contribution seems insufficient to warrant acceptance.

Figure 4 shows that the proposed technical novelty of the baseline normalization does improve EPIC distance between the learned and a human-provided reward function. However, the paper lacks evidence that this improvement in EPIC distance indeed translates in an improvement in policy performance once trained on the reward function (the performed evaluation is a single step function from 0% to 100% success, so it's not informative enough to show good correlation, an environment with a more finegrained reward function may be required).

A minor weakness is, that the experiments were performed in a clean, simulated environment, without distractors or other moving objects. Thus it is unclear whether the reward functions would be robust to such distractors (though admittedly prior works also did not evaluate realistic scenes).

Finally, albeit impressive, the experiments are only performed on one non-toy environment (the humanoid). So even if the authors demonstrated that the proposed baseline regularization helps to improve policy performance, it would be good to add evaluations on at least a second non-toy environment, e.g. a robotic manipulation task, to prove that the effects are consistent.

### Questions
- how does the evaluated approach for Table 1 differ from prior works like Mahmoudieh et al that also use 0-shot CLIP embeddings for language-conditioned reward computation?

- in Mahmoudieh et al. the non-finetuned model does not work at all as a reward function -- is the fact that the model in the submission works well purely based on the chosen task domain? 


## Summary of Review
Overall, the paper shows some interesting learned behaviors with a simple method, but the novelty over prior work is not well demonstrated in the experimental results. No comparisons to baselines are performed and the introduced algorithmic changes are not used in the experiments. As such, I do not recommend acceptance of the paper in it's current form. I do think the paper has potential and I encourage the authors to
- add experimental results that demonstrate that the proposed baseline regularization leads to improved policy performance
- add experiments on at least one additional non-toy domain, e.g. a robotic manipulation task
- demonstrate experimentally the correlation between the offline EPIC reward distance metric and policy performance once trained on the reward function

# Post-Rebuttal Comments

Thank you for answering my review!
I want to emphasize that I do not devalue empirical works in any way -- there are lots of examples for very high impact empirical works that shed light on shortcomings of the existing literature and provide practical implementation advice to "make things work".

The critical elements for such papers are that they provide technical "tricks" that are specific to the core algorithm yet demonstrate that they help across a wide range of applications of this algorithm (ie are not overfit to one task / environment etc.).

Based the on the rebuttal the paper claims three main “tricks” to make things work:
   - (1) model size —> this one makes sense and is validated with experiments
   - (2) reward formulation —> this one is not validated experimentally
   - (3) choice of RL optimizer algorithm —> this one seems orthogonal to the core question of how to formulate reward functions and is also not experimentally validated

Further, I reiterate my concern that all experiments are conducted in a single non-toy environment — this is in my opinion insufficient to claim that the paper introduces “a general way to make CLIP-rewards work”.

If the main scope of the paper should be “tricks to make CLIP-rewards work”, the writing would need to change substantially, the experimental evaluations mentioned above would need to be added and more non-toy enviornments would need to be evaluated.

Finally, it remains confusing that the main technical contribution is not used in the main experimental evaluation and the rebuttal did not provide a convincing reason for this.

Thus, in summary I do not see my concerns addressed by the rebuttal and maintain my score.

5: You are absolutely certain about your assessment. You are very familiar with the related work and checked the math/other details carefully.

### Summary
The paper investigates using pretrained vision-language models (VLMs) as zero-shot reward models to specify tasks via natural language. Specifically, they use CLIP models to train a MuJoCo humanoid to learn complex tasks, e.g., kneeling, doing the splits, and sitting in a lotus position. Besides, they also propose a technique called goal-baseline regularization to improve performance. They also study the scaling effect of VLMs for being a reward function.

### Strengths
**Experiments and conclusion** The authors conduct extensive and solid experiments from the standard CartPole and MountainCar environments to the relatively complex MuJoCo humanoid environment to validate a natural idea of utilizing VLMs as a reward function to learn the agent. Besides, some in-depth studies are also well conducted, such as the scaling effect of VLMs, and various humanoid tasks specified by human language. The conclusion is interesting. 

**Method**  Goal-Baseline Regularization is a novel and smart technique proposed in this work to project out irrelevant information about the observation and improve the practicability of the CLIP-based reward model.

**Writing**  The writing is clear and easy to follow; each contribution is explicitly listed and highlighted, and the section/subsection titles make navigation effortless.

### Weaknesses
**Real world impact**  Although the work shows the potential of VLM-RMs, all conducted experiments have been based on relatively simple and synthetic tasks, rather than from the real world. To further increase the potential impact of this work, it would be beneficial to consider some more tasks with real-world applications.

### Questions
When using the VLMs as the reward function for a task, one may need to consider if one should use it as a dense reward signal or a terminal reward, can the authors elaborate on how they considered this question?
