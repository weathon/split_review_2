## Human Reviewer 1

### Summary
The paper proposes **PCE (Planner–Composer–Evaluator)**, a modular framework that enhances LLM agents’ ability to plan and act in multi-agent embodied environments. The **Planner** generates potential next steps, the **Composer** extracts hypotheses from plans and structures them into a decision tree, and the **Evaluator** assesses candidate actions based on expected gain and cost of paths on the decision tree. The system aims to make LLM agents more consistent and efficient by explicitly modeling future actions and uncertainty. Experiments conducted on two benchmarks, C-WAH and TDW-MAT, across multiple backbone LLMs demonstrate improvements in task success rate with decreased communication. Furthermore, human studies on PCE show that the system is more helpful and efficient.

### Strengths
- The **motivation for PCE is clear and well-grounded**. By designing the planning module to explicitly model upcoming steps and their corresponding confidence scores, analogous to a world model, the approach enables LLM agents to act more consistently and **avoid redundant or unproductive communications**, leading to more efficient collaboration.
- Across both C-WAH and TDW-MAT benchmarks, **PCE consistently achieves faster goal completion and higher success rates** under all three backbone LLMs (GPT-4o mini, GPT-OSS:20B, and Gemma3:4B). This demonstrates the strong performance of PCE. Meanwhile, smaller communication times make PCE more efficient when cooperating with humans.
- The authors systematically evaluate the necessity of each component and provide clear explanations of their functionalities. This detailed analysis and transparent modular design make the system **relatively easy to reproduce and adapt** to other tasks or environments.

### Weaknesses
- The designs of the planner, composer, and evaluator in the planning module essentially prompt LLMs to perform planning, extraction, and evaluation. Meanwhile, the evaluation metric is the score output by an LLM judge. Given that LLM scores are not very accurate, it may be challenging to accurately measure the system's stability.
- As in Tables 1 and 2, regarding the token usage metric, the result is not significant. This makes me think about whether the system is sending too many tokens at one time in the communication channel, or if the system has a higher latency in planning for the next step.
- Typos:
    - In the composer part of Fig 1., “assumtion” should be “assumption”.

### Questions
- Regarding Weakness 1, can the authors analyze the accuracy of the LLM-generated scores? It is important to understand their stability.
- Regarding Weakness 2, for the metrics, does the **Usage** metric measure only communication tokens or all tokens generated within the system? If it’s the former, could the authors also compare the total generated tokens with the baselines? I believe this would be a good proxy for both the latency and cost of the designed system.
- From Table 3, we observe an interesting phenomenon: removing the **planner** dramatically increases the number of communication rounds (from 1.70 to 9.52), whereas removing the **composer** decreases them. Could the authors explain why this happens?

### Summary
This paper proposes PCE (Planner-Composer-Evaluator), a framework for uncertainty-aware planning in LLM-based embodied agents. The key idea is to extract implicit assumptions from LLM reasoning traces and structure them into a decision tree, enabling effective multi-agent coordination without heavy communication. However, the technical contribution is limited and differentiation from similar work is unclear.

### Strengths
- The paper effectively identifies the communication overhead problem.
- User study results showing that PCE produces more efficient communication patterns demonstrate practical value.
- Consistent improvements across GPT-4o mini, GPT-OSS:20B, and Gemma3:4B suggest broad applicability.

### Weaknesses
- The distinction between the proposed methodology and existing multi-agent task planning techniques remains unclear. In particular, the paper needs to articulate clear differences from approaches like ProAgent, CoELA, REVECA, and CaPo, which also perform tasks through multi-agent communication.
- Furthermore, while the main contributions are presented as the Planner-Composer-Evaluator structure and the decision tree-based techniques in the Composer and Evaluator, these appear to be applications of existing methods rather than novel contributions.
- In the experimental section, the performance degradation when removing the Composer appears minimal. This raises questions: if the Planner-Evaluator structure alone achieves higher performance than baselines that utilize collaborative agents, what accounts for this superiority? The analysis lacks clarity on why performance exceeds baselines even without the Composer, and where specifically the Composer contributes to performance improvements. Such analysis should be included to better understand the contribution of each component.

### Questions
- What is the recovery method when assumptions at decision tree nodes are incorrect?
- How does PCE perform in environments where communication is completely blocked?
- How do you evaluate and ensure the quality of assumption extraction?

## Human Reviewer 3

### Summary
This paper identifies a key challenge for LLM-based embodied agents in partially observable, multi-agent settings: the heavy reliance on inter-agent communication to resolve uncertainty, which incurs significant token, time, and human workflow costs.

To address this, the authors propose PCE, a Planner-Composer-Evaluator framework. The core idea is to leverage the implicit, fragmented assumptions that LLMs generate in their reasoning traces.

- The **Planner** produces an initial action and its reasoning trace.

- The **Composer** extracts these latent assumptions and structures them into an explicit decision tree (a "scenario tree"). Internal nodes represent assumptions (with True/False branches), and leaves represent the final action to be taken under that scenario.

- The **Evaluator** scores each root-to-leaf path (scenario) based on its estimated likelihood (L(S)), conditional gain (G(a)), and execution cost (C(a)) .

This allows the agent to make a rational, uncertainty-aware choice—including whether to communicate or take a physical action—by selecting the action from the scenario with the highest final utility score, U(S,a)=E[gain]−λC(a). Experiments on two multi-agent benchmarks (C-WAH and TDW-MAT) with three different LLM backbones show that PCE outperforms communication-centric baselines in success rate and efficiency. A user study also suggests that PCE's communication patterns are perceived by humans as more efficient and trustworthy.

### Strengths
- **Originality and Significance**: The paper's core contribution is novel and insightful. Instead of simply using an LLM's reasoning trace (like Chain-of-Thought), the PCE framework performs meta-reasoning on the trace itself. The idea of "turning LLM reasoning into... planning"  by extracting, structuring, and formally evaluating latent assumptions is a clever way to operationalize the implicit knowledge within LLMs for decision-making under uncertainty.

- **Problem Formulation**: The work addresses a well-defined and critical problem. As LLM agents become more capable, their reliance on frequent communication becomes a bottleneck, especially when humans are in the loop. This paper offers a principled alternative to naive, communication-heavy strategies.

- **Methodological Clarity**: The proposed PCE framework is modular, logical, and well-explained. The three-stage pipeline is intuitive, and the Evaluator's scoring function provides a principled mechanism for balancing scenario likelihood, potential gain, and the distinct costs of physical vs. communicative actions.

- **Thorough Empirical Evaluation**: The experimental validation is a significant strength.

  * __Generality__: The method is tested on three diverse LLM backbones (including commercial and open-source models) across two challenging benchmarks , consistently outperforming four representative baselines.

  * __Ablation Studies__: The ablations are comprehensive. The component analysis (Table 3) successfully demonstrates that each part of the PCE pipeline is necessary for good performance .

   * __Scaling Analysis__: The "LLM Scaling" study (Figure 3) provides compelling evidence that the performance gains are attributable to the PCE framework itself, not just to using a larger model. It shows that while scaling models (e.g., Gemma3 4B → 27B) improves a "Planner only" baseline, PCE reaps greater benefits, widening the performance gap .

   * __User Study__: The inclusion of a user study  is commendable. It directly validates the paper's central hypothesis: that reducing communication intelligently leads to a human-agent collaboration that is not only more efficient but also perceived as more trustworthy and useful.

### Weaknesses
- **Scalability of the "Multi-Agent" Claim**: The experiments are exclusively conducted in two-agent settings. While technically "multi-agent," this does not sufficiently support the paper's broader claims of solving uncertainty in "multi-agent... environments". The complexity of tracking collaborator intentions and partial observations scales combinatorially with the number of agents. It is unclear how the Composer's decision tree and the Evaluator's scoring would handle branching on assumptions about n−1 other agents without becoming intractable.

- **The Composer**: The entire framework's effectiveness hinges on the Composer module. This module is tasked with complex, non-trivial reasoning steps: (1) semantically identifying the most critical uncertainties from a free-text reasoning trace , (2) ranking them by abstract criteria like "influence" , and (3) proposing new atomic assumptions from scratch when needed. The paper states this is approximated using "LLMs' commonsense reasoning"  and provides a prompt (Figure 9), but this sweeps a massive amount of complexity under the rug. The paper offers no analysis of the Composer's reliability. If the Composer fails to extract the key assumption or hallucinates an irrelevant new one, the entire decision tree is built on a faulty foundation, and the Evaluator's "principled" scoring becomes meaningless. The ablation in Table 3 only shows that no Composer is bad, not that the current Composer is robust.


- **Potentially Overstated Scaling Claims**: In the scaling ablation (Figure 3), the performance improvement (i.e., the slope of the line) for "Planner only" appears quite similar to that of "PCE." For example, in Figure 3(b), both methods see a drop of ~9-10 steps when moving from "Low" to "High" reasoning. The paper's claim that PCE "amplifies the benefits of scaling"  seems slightly overstated; the data suggests the benefit of the PCE framework is largely additive—PCE starts at a better baseline, and that baseline advantage is maintained or slightly widened as the model scales.


- **Missing Related Work**: The related work section  focuses primarily on communication-centric methods (like ProAgent, CoELA, etc.). However, it seems to overlook other recent lines of work on long-horizon LLM planning in partially observable environments that do not rely on heavy communication. For example, [1].

[1] Nayak, Siddharth, et al. "LLaMAR: Long-Horizon Planning for Multi-Agent Robots in Partially Observable Environments." arXiv preprint arXiv:2407.10031 (2024).

### Questions
- **On the Composer's Reliability (W2)**: The Composer's ability to correctly identify assumptions and generate new ones is critical. How robust is this process? What happens if the Planner's reasoning trace is vague or does not contain an obvious, extractable assumption? Is there any quantitative analysis of the Composer's "hit rate" for identifying the correct critical uncertainty?

- **On Scalability (W1)**: Could you elaborate on how you expect the PCE framework, particularly the Composer's tree generation, to scale to n>2 agents? Would the tree depth D=3  be sufficient to model the compounded uncertainties from multiple collaborators?

- **Clarification of Figure 2**: The visualization in Figure 2(c) is slightly confusing. It highlights a path corresponding to nodes 1(False) → 5(False) → 4 as the "best scenario." To clarify: at the time of decision-making, the truth values of the assumptions are unknown. Does this highlighted path simply represent the leaf node (action [gocheck] cabinet) that received the highest utility score U from the Evaluator, and the path shown is the scenario (i.e., the set of assumptions) under which that action is optimal?

- **Clarification of the Communication Mechanism**: The user study strongly supports that PCE's communication is more efficient. To confirm my understanding: is communication reduced simply because the [send_message] action is treated as just another potential leaf in the decision tree, which must then "win" the U(S,a) competition against all physical actions? This seems to be the implicit gating mechanism, and it's elegant, but I want to ensure I'm not missing a more explicit component. If that is the case, its best to explicitly mention it in the paper.

## Human Reviewer 4

### Summary
The paper proposes PCE (Planner–Composer–Evaluator) for embodied decision making. PCE is a modular framework that turns implicit assumptions inside an LLM’s reasoning trace into a structured decision-tree for uncertainty-aware planning in partially observable multi-agent environments. Experiments (including human evaluations) on C-WAH and TDW-MAT show that PCE consistently outperforms communication-centric baselines  across three LLMs. This work also provides ablation and user studies.

### Strengths
1. It is interesting to introduce an uncertainty-handling mechanism to this field. PCE explicitly extracts and evaluates the LLM’s latent assumptions and plan with structured decision-tree.
2. The experimental results show strong gains in success rate and step efficiency on two benchmarks, with comparable computational cost. It is also good to include human evaluations.
3. The ablations on reasoning and different LLMs also show the consistency of performance gain.

### Weaknesses
1. It is unclear how the hyperparameters were chosen. The authors set D = 3, alpha = 1, beta = 1, lambda = 1, Kaction = 10, Kmessage= 3 empirically, but no according further explaination or ablation is provided.  
2. The related work section should discuss tree-search-based methods (e.g., CoTS) more clearly.  The authors need to clearly articulate how their method differs conceptually and why PCE is needed beyond existing tree reasoning or search frameworks.
3. The paper would benefit from more case studies or qualitative analyses to illustrate how PCE behaves in different uncertainty scenarios and to provide deeper insight into its decision-making process.

### Questions
See weaknesses, and

1. Why is the Usage of PCE lower than CoELA? According to my understanding, PCE’s three modules all require LLM inference, which should make the total cost higher than CoELA, which only infers twice. Please clarify this discrepancy.  
2. How about using MCTS based on distance as a comparison or baseline? It might provide a stronger reference for tree-based planning efficiency.

I am willing to change my score if the concerns are addressed
