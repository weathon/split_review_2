# Deep-Learning Approaches for Optimized Web Accessibility: Correcting Violations and Enhancing User Experience

- Decision: Reject
- Scores: 5, 5, 3

## Abstract
With the increasing need for inclusive, user-friendly technology, web accessibility is crucial to ensuring equal access to online content for individuals with disabilities, including visual, auditory, cognitive, or motor impairments. Despite the existence of accessibility guidelines and standards such as Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) and the Web Accessibility Initiative (W3C), over 90% of websites still fail to meet the necessary accessibility requirements. Manually detecting and correcting accessibility violations can be time-consuming and error-prone, highlighting the need for automated and intelligent solutions. While research has demonstrated methods to find and target accessibility errors, limited research has focused on effectively correcting accessibility violations. This paper presents an automatic deep-learning-based approach to correcting accessibility violations in web content. We aim to enhance web accessibility, promote inclusivity, and improve the overall user experience for individuals with impairments. We employ website accessibility violation data and prompt engineering to identify potential accessibility issues within HTML code. Leveraging accessibility error information, large language models (LLMs), and prompt engineering techniques, we achieved an over 50% reduction in accessibility violation errors after corrections. While our research successfully illustrates the ability of prompt engineering techniques to efficiently correct website accessibility violation errors, further research may be necessary to explore a larger range of website URLs or to focus on researching techniques for best handling specific common accessibility errors. Our work demonstrates a valuable approach toward the direction of inclusive web content, and provides directions for future research to explore advanced methods to automate web accessibility.

### Confidence
4: You are confident in your assessment, but not absolutely certain. It is unlikely, but not impossible, that you did not understand some parts of the submission or that you are unfamiliar with some pieces of related work.

### Summary
The paper proposes an automated approach utilising the GPT-3.5-turbo-16K model with prompt engineering to fix over 50% of 171 web accessibility violations from 25 websites. By integrating the Playwright API for accessibility testing and leveraging the GPT-3.5-turbo-16K model for corrections, the claims that this would be a more efficient alternative to manually correcting errors.

### Strengths
The paper was generally easy to follow. The authors explored different prompting techniques and had a good discussion on the strengths and limitations of the GPT-3.5-turbo-16K model in fixing the accessibility issues.

### Weaknesses
Sec 3.3 was unclear: What system was created for generating the prompts? The types of websites in the study were also unclear, e.g., were these static/dynamic papers? The authors tested their approach with GPT3.5 and GPT4 only; a few other models could be explored to test the generalisability of the method.

There needs to be a baseline to compare the performance of the approach. The score allows us to compare the different prompting techniques but not judge whether the approach overall is better than humans with accessibility testing tools.

Minor typos/comments:
- A few references were missing -- pages 2 and 3
- table II below -- Table 2? (page 7)
- What is ARIA; define?

### Questions
1. What types of websites were used: dynamic or static? Were there React apps or similar apps? OR Would this approach work for React or similar apps?

2. Were there any perfect web pages? If yes, what did the proposed model do in that case?

3. What was the maximum number of violations observed?

4. Were the typos in the "Suggested change" part of Fig 4 intentional? Was this an actual example?

5. How many system and user messages were generated?

6. Can you explain the process that was used to generate the "suggested change" and "incorrect" in the User Message? Were these done manually, and if so, how did the team decide the best phrasing for the suggested changes?

### Confidence
3: You are fairly confident in your assessment. It is possible that you did not understand some parts of the submission or that you are unfamiliar with some pieces of related work. Math/other details were not carefully checked.

### Summary
This paper presents deep-learning based technique to correcting accessibility violations in the web content. Their main goal is to promote web accessibility and inclusivity, and improve the overall user experience for people with impairments. They find issues in HTML code using website accessibility violation data and prompt engineering. They could get above 50% reduction in accessibility violation errors after corrections using accessibility error information, large language models and prompt engineering techniques. This paper shows an approach for inclusive web content, and advances to automate web accessibility.

### Strengths
1/ By automating accessibility violation corrections, the paper tends to eliminate the inefficiency and inaccuracy associated with manual error corrections.
2/ Their approach is able to decrease severity scores by over 50%
3/ They pioneer an innovative automated approach using LLMs for efficient, low-cost violation corrections.
4/ The paper promotes broader dialogue on societal inclusivity and equality in the digital era.

### Weaknesses
 1/ Typo in line "Section 2 presents our the creation of our dataset benchmark system for evaluating error correction."
2/ Results from Table 2 to 5 are not discussed. Since the paper can be organised in a compact way, authors can discuss the result to give more clarity.
3/ FEW-SHOT GUIDED PROMPTING could be written more elaborately. Some of the questions: what does "by increasing the examples provided in the system message"mean?

### Questions
as above in weaknesses - major concern on discussion of results.

### Summary
The paper introduces an approach to automatically correct accessibility issues on websites, aiming to improve
accessibility for individuals with impairments while minimizing the need for manual corrections. To achieve this, the
authors utilized an established website accessibility evaluation tool to identify potential issues within the HTML code.
This process yielded a dataset containing the violations of 25 URLs. By leveraging OpenAI's GPT models and prompt
engineering, the system automatically revised the HTML code, resulting in a notable decrease of the accessibility
violation errors.

### Strengths
The issue of accessibility is highly relevant and research in this area is definitely required to advance automation.
The presented system proved to be able to automatically improve HTML code to successfully increase accessibility. The
evaluation, although not particularly extensive, is transparent and traceable. Since the authors have provided the dataset
and the code, it should be possible to reproduce the results to a certain extent. To enable future comparisons with other
methods, the resulting dataset should be made publicly available.
The authors have cleverly used existing components, such as OpenAI's GPT model, and creatively combined them to
solve an essential and socially relevant problem.
The approach certainly has potential and quality, but the paper needs some revision, as it does not seem quite mature in
its current form.

### Weaknesses
Although the introduction effectively underscores the importance of enhancing and automating accessibility, it could benefit from a more comprehensive integration within the landscape of the really closely related work. While the authors touch on recent automatic and semi-automatic approaches, they just mention that there have also been studies that considered improving accuracy through semi-automatic techniques of manual correction and even a few automating this correction using prompt engineering (most related), without providing specific examples or literature. If the deployment of prompt engineering is something completly new in this context, the authors must either point this out more clearly or highlight the differences and advantages of their approach compared to the existing state of the art. 
Regarding the cited related work, it should also be noted that the mentioned automatic strategies mainly cover the generation of alternative text for images and in this context the insufficient quality of the automatic alt-text approach of facebook is pointed out. This aligns with the statement on page 1, that the most common issue in accessibility is the lack of text equivalents or alternate text for images, but is also incidental after it becomes apparent (page 7) that images cannot be processed at all by the system presented by the authors.

With regard to the proposed method, it is difficult to tell which components were pre-existing and which were developed by the authors, making the contribution not directly apparent. The presented approach does not seem to involve any fundamentally novel non-basic components, but its strength lies in the adept engineering and smart combination of existing components. This has certainly its own value when it is shown that an existing problem can be solved in new ways. Hence this is not really the issue.
However, my main criticism is that there is no quantitative or qualitative comparison with existing methods. As much as I appreciate the research in this area and recognize the need for automated methods, there is unfortunately no substantial evidence presented that the authors' method is in any way at least equivalent to existing approaches, or even superior to them. The authors should try to compare with existing approaches, as the mere improvement over the initial situation is arguably not so meaningful. This would be different, if their method uniquely addresses unresolved accessibility issues and a comparison might not be feasible or possible. However, it appears that this is not the case, or at least it is not evident and must be clearly pointed out and proven by facts. The same applies to the authors' claim within the conclusion section that they have invented a new subfield of automated accessibility.

Other weaknesses:
- I don't see the necessity of the mathematical formulas in section 3.4. The expressions appear to artificially introduce complexity, making it more unnecessary challenging for the reader to comprehend. Rather than introducing variables with no subsequent significance, it would be more effective to use an illustration of the pipeline or at least pseudo code. Especially since the definitions lack clarity and precision, for instance, the term "sub" was used without prior explanation, and both the definition and the necessity of F_{HTML_fix}'s definition remain incomprehensible, raising doubts that it is mathematically well-defined. Furthermore, most of the variables are unnecessary for defining the terms of R and I. A clear verbal introduction would have sufficed and enhanced comprehension.
- Section 5 is not really a discussion, but a summary. There is no critical examination present.

Minor weaknesses:
- The title is misleading. "Deep Learning" refers solely to the use of pretrained LLMs and not to the direct embedding of deep learning techniques.
- In table 2 the space is missing in some cells of "final / avg".
- Typo in Figure 4: "messasges"
- Page 2 and 3 contain faulty links to literature
- The figures/tables should be referenced in the main text to put them in context and improve readability by guiding the reader. Also, the context of some tables, such as Table 3 , is not discussed or mentioned in any way, so it is not clear what the reader is supposed to do with this information.

### Questions
- Why is there no comparison to other existing methods?
- Since missing alternate text for images is in general a key issue, how would approaches addressing alt-text, such as the
one of Facebook, perform on your data set? Even if the authors' method ignores images, this could help to assess the
overall performance (assuming the URLs contain a realistic number of images).
- How were the 25 URLs in the dataset selected? Which URLs were previously used by related work? Why weren't the
same ones used, or is there no information available?
