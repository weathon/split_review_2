# Revisiting High-Resolution ODEs for Faster Convergence Rates

- Decision: Reject
- Scores: 3, 1, 8, 3

## Abstract
There has been a growing interest in high-resolution ordinary differential equations (HR-ODEs) for investigating the dynamics and convergence characteristics of momentum-based optimization algorithms. As a result, the literature includes a number of HR-ODEs that represent diverse methods. In this work, we demonstrate that these different HR-ODEs can be unified as special cases of a general HR-ODE model with varying parameters. In addition, by using the integral quadratic constraints from robust control theory, we introduce a general Lyapunov function for the convergence analysis of the proposed HR-ODE. Not only can a large number of popular optimization algorithms be viewed as discretizations of our general HR-ODE, but our analysis also leads to several critical improvements in the convergence guarantees of these methods, both in continuous and discrete-time settings. The notable improvements include enhanced convergence guarantees, compared to prior art, for the triple momentum method ODE in continuous-time and for the quasi hyperbolic momentum algorithm in discrete-time settings.

### Summary
The approach of this paper is (1) to provide a unifying high-resolution ordinary differential equations (HR-ODEs) to several ones in the literature for momentum-based methods for minimization, and then (ii) to use a tool from control theory called integral quadratic constraints (IQC) to derive a Lyapunov function used for convergence analyses.

For strongly convex and smooth functions, it:
- achieves a faster convergence rate for the triple momentum method,
- achieves a faster rate for the Quasi Hyperbolic Momentum method (and for a larger step size range).

### Strengths
- The overall idea of unifying ODE for the momentum-based HR-ODEs is interesting. 
- The paper improves some of the convergence rates in the literature for accelerated methods in the strongly convex regime.

### Weaknesses
# Novelty \& incremental results

The main concern is the incremental contributions.
- The techniques used are well known (Lyapunov analysis, Grönwall lemma, etc), e.g. Thm. 3.2. is an instance of Gronwall lemma. The application of these techniques, while sound, does not introduce substantial novelty. The Lyapunov functions, although presented as a family, are derived using standard methods, and the analysis follows a well-trodden path. The limit analysis mentioned, while a specific step, is still within the scope of typical Lyapunov analysis techniques.
- The improved factor for NAG is only 2. The triple momentum method is not widely used; there has been less focus on improving its rate. While any improvement is welcome, the practical impact of a factor of 2 on the convergence rate for NAG is marginal, and the focus on the triple momentum method, which lacks widespread adoption, further diminishes the significance of this result.
- *GM2-ODE.*  In terms of structuring, it is surprising that the proposed GM2-ODE is stated in the introduction. Moreover, this ODE is not derived but rather considers a set of some HR-ODEs that exist and aims to unify them in the sense that these can be seen as instances of the GM2-ODE. This is fairly straightforward to do given several ODEs as the terms that appear have already known interpretations; there's no discussion or further development if this ODE is general enough to lead to other useful methods. Also, it is very similar to the existing ODE in Zhang et al. (2021), see eq. GM-ODE in the main part. Considering all, this is a fairly limited contribution stated as central/main. The argument that GM2-ODE is more consistent in terms of ODE and algorithm recovery needs more justification, as the practical implications of this consistency are not clearly demonstrated. The claim that the Lyapunov function corresponding to GM-ODE does not achieve optimal rates requires a more detailed explanation and comparison.
- The only considered setting is (deterministic) smooth, strong convexity. The analysis is limited to a specific and well-studied setting, which further restricts the impact of the results. The lack of consideration for more general settings, such as non-convexity or stochasticity, limits the applicability of the proposed framework.

Although these contributions are interesting, they are not developed sufficiently for acceptance.

# Writing 

The paper reads well, and I enjoyed reading it. However, content-wise, it is not on point regarding the actual focus of this paper / exact contributions / motivation for these contributions, etc. It often focuses on general optimization comments that are enjoyable to read but perhaps more suitable for a textbook, etc., and due to that, it is not concise in bringing the reader to the actual contributions and their motivation. For example:
- Abstract. A large part focuses on general comments about HR-ODEs or the Lyapunov function, which is an intermediate step of proving convergence that many methods can be seen as a discretization of the ODE, which is often the case. 
   - Importantly, it leaves very unclearly what precisely the "improved convergence guarantees compared to prior art" are -- it would be helpful to state precisely if the constants or the order is improved and by what factor; what is the precise advantage of this unifying HR-ODE (is it more interpretable, etc), etc.
   - It does not even mention the setting, e.g., that the results are for strongly convex functions
   - That discrete methods can be viewed as discretizations of ODEs is well known. If keeping this sentence, it is worth mentioning the type of discretization.
- Introduction. The first two paragraphs that refer to (discrete) optimization methods generally are very enjoyable to read. Still, the motivation for using continuous-time analyses is rushed, which is more relevant to this paper. The paper would benefit from reconsidering the content vs. the page limit and prioritizing better.



# Missing smoothness assumption in Thm 3.1 and unclear notations

Thm. 3.1. states that $f$ is strongly convex, but the proof relies on Thm. 6.4 in (Fazlyab et al., 2018), which uses the assumption that $f$ is also $L$ smooth. This assumption should be stated. 
The proof in App. B.2. also mentions $\sigma$, which is not defined in the paper.
The curly F notation, used in the main part and Thm. A.1 was not introduced.

# Other

- The constant $C_{QHM}$ that appears in Cor. 4.1.1. is not defined

# minor comments

- missing full stop in eq. (1)
- typo: instable
- sec. 3 title should be continuous-time analysis

### Questions
1. The abstract highlights that different methods can be seen as discretizations of the GM2-ODE. There are many discretization methods, and many works highlight that discrete methods can be obtained of a general ODE under some discretization [1]. Could you elaborate on why your work concentrates on crafting ODE that yields the methods through the SIE discretization versus the others and why it is more validating the derived ODE versus the other? Or is it providing more consistency with the discrete analysis? I believe this is central to be discussed since it is highlighted.
2. On Page 7, with "the phase space representation [..] cannot exactly recover the NAG algorithm after discretization", which discretization do you assume here?
3. In the [2] follow-up work of Shi et al., 2021 (on which this work builds the idea of HR-ODEs), a more "consistent" way of deriving the HR-ODEs is proposed. App. A.3. of [2] points out that such derivation is more consistent because the Taylor expansion is done on all applicable terms instead of some. Does your HR-ODE unify the HR-ODEs of the NAG and HB methods derived that way? 
4. Do you know if this HR-ODE will lead to better convergence rates on other setups, e.g., convex? In other words, is the benefit of modifying the ODE of Zhang et al. 2021 specific to the strongly convex setup?
5. Is the upper bound dictated by Thm 4.1. matching the known one for this setting for the constants?

### Summary
This paper proposes a high resolution ODE (GM2-ODE) for analyzing accelerated gradient descent (AGD) for convex optimization. A Lyapunov function based on integral quadratic control is derived to analyze the stability and convergence rate of GM2-ODE. Semi-Implicit Euler discretization (SIE) of the ODE recovers the accelerated gradient algorithms and the known optimal convergence rates. Many previous ODEs for accelerated gradient descent can be formulated into the proposed GM2-ODE form and the convergence rates 
 can be obtained using their results.

### Strengths
The paper is well written. The presentation of their results is clear and sound.

siginificance:
The proposed GM2-ODE enjoys intuitive form and design of Lyapunov function. The discrete time convergence rates based of the continuous time Lyapunov function recovers the optimal convergence rate of accelerated gradient method. The analysis framework applies to many previous ODEs for accelerated gradient methods and recover (even enhance) the discrete-time convergence rates.

### Weaknesses
 - This work follows the line of research on understanding accelerated methods via (high-resolution) ODE. Given the vast literature on this topic, I am afraid the contribution of this work is not significant enough. Although generalization and unification are developed, the results derived here are expected and the techniques are quite standard.
- The theoretical improvements are kind of minor to me, for example, improving the constant from $1/2$ to $2/3$. The theoretical understanding based on this new high-resolution ODE does not provide any new insight on acceleration. Neither does it lead to any novel algorithms with more attractive practical performance.

### Summary
The paper proposes a general high-resolution ordinary differential equations (ODE) model to investigate the dynamics of various momentum-based optimization methods. The high-resolution ODE proposed unifies many different ODE models and leads to improvement in the convergence guarantee of several existing algorithms, such as triple momentum method in continuous setting and quasi hyperbolic momentum algorithm in discrete setting.

### Strengths
This work provides a high-resolution ODE framework ($\text{GM}^2$-ODE) that unifies and extends different ODEs in literature. The theoretical analysis is solid and provides some improvement over existing results of accelerated methods. The presentation of the paper is also clear to me.

### Weaknesses

Given the vast literature on this topic, I am afraid the contribution of this work is not significant enough. Although generalization and unification are developed, the results derived here are expected and the techniques are quite standard.

Neither does it lead to any novel algorithms with more attractive practical performance.

### Questions
- As I mentioned in Weakness, I am afraid the contribution of this work is significant enough given many existing works on the same topic using almost the same analysis techniques. Could the authors justify this point? Is there any particular novelty in technical and algorithmic developments I'm missing?
- The work is focused on the theoretical analysis of existing momentum-based algorithms. I'm wondering if the understanding can help develop some new approaches leading to stronger practical performance? For example, does the best possible rate improve empirical performances in practice?
- In Figure 2, it is observed that NAG is the algorithm with fastest convergence against QHM. I'm curious if the viewpoint of the ODE developed here can provide some explanation to this phenomenon.
