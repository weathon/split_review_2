# Visual Evidence Prompting Mitigates Hallucinations in Multimodal Large Language Models

- Decision: Reject
- Scores: 5, 6, 6, 5

## Abstract
Despite the promising progress achieved, Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs)  still suffer from the hallucination problem, i.e., they tend to predict objects and relations which are non-existent in the target images. These unfaithful outputs degrade the model performance and greatly harm the user experiences in real-world applications.  Fortunately, traditional small visual models excel at producing professional and faithful outputs, but they are not adept at interacting with humans. Therefore, this work explores how small visual models complement the LVLMs by effectively extracting contextual information from images to generate precise answers.
In particular, we show how such hallucination mitigates naturally in LVLMs via a simple method called visual evidence prompting, where a few visual knowledge evidences are provided as contexts in prompting. Experiments on three large language models show that visual evidence prompting improves performance on the evaluation of object hallucinations, as well as the new benchmark for relation hallucinations. We hope our work will not only serve as the minimal strongest baseline for the challenging hallucination benchmarks, but also highlight the importance of carefully exploring and analyzing the enormous visual evidence hidden inside small visual models before crafting ﬁnetuning LVLMs.

### Summary
The research addresses the persistent issue of hallucination in Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs, such as GPT-3) where these models tend to make predictions of objects and relations that do not exist in the input images. The study highlights that while traditional small visual models produce professional and accurate outputs, they lack the ability to effectively interact with humans.

The primary focus of the research is to investigate how small visual models can complement LVLMs by extracting contextual information from images to generate precise answers. The proposed approach, known as "visual evidence prompting," demonstrates a natural mitigation of hallucination in LVLMs. This technique involves providing visual knowledge as context to reduce the hallucination problem. The study includes experiments conducted on three large language models, showing improved performance in addressing object hallucinations and a new benchmark for relation hallucinations.

Overall, the research aims to serve as a baseline for challenging hallucination benchmarks and emphasizes the significance of exploring and analyzing the substantial visual evidence concealed within small visual models before fine-tuning LVLMs. The paper presents an intriguing approach to mitigating hallucination in LVLMs, but there may be room for further clarification and validation of the proposed method in different scenarios and datasets. Additionally, it would be beneficial to provide a more detailed discussion of potential applications and practical implications of the findings.

### Strengths
1. The motivation is clear
2. The presentation is good

### Weaknesses
In light of the issue of object and relation hallucinations within the existing LVLM model, this paper employs the object and relation information captured by the visual component of the mini model as a contextual query to mitigate the LVLM hallucination problem. However, this approach gives rise to two significant concerns:

Efficiency: What degree of efficiency degradation can be expected with the introduction of new mini models for object detection and scene graph generation into the original method?

Domain Compatibility: Is there any overlap between the datasets used for training the small target detection and scene graph generation models and the LVLM hallucination test set? 
In the context of an open-world scenario where the small model might struggle to efficiently capture target and relation information, to what extent will the acquisition of false evidence affect the LVLM's otherwise accurate responses? It's worth noting that despite the findings presented in Figure 3, my skepticism regarding this issue persists.

### Summary
The paper studies the object hallucinations in large-VLM. It points out that the vision model detects the explicit objects that can be used for visual prompts and mitigates the issue of object hallucination. Sufficient experiments shed light on how the vision model and the visual prompts affect object-level hallucination.

### Strengths
The paper has good motivation, i.e., the vision model affects the hallucinations and the detection results can be used as visual prompting for LLM. The experiments also demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed idea. The paper is also well-written.

### Weaknesses
The authors utilize small detection and scene graph models as evidence, potentially introducing domain-specific knowledge that skews the results. It's crucial to clarify the differences in training data between these small models and the evaluation data. Additionally, the paper should address whether the proposed method remains effective when applied to out-of-domain models. The paper should also explore the impact of using larger detection models, as the current comparison between small detection models and large language models (LLMs) may not be entirely fair. 

The authors should extend their comparisons to include boosting and bagging methods, especially considering the paper primarily demonstrates performance improvements for yes/no VQA questions. This would provide a more robust validation of the proposed method. The current evaluation primarily focuses on yes/no questions, which might not fully capture the nuances of hallucination in more complex scenarios. A more comprehensive analysis should include open-ended questions and tasks that require more detailed reasoning.

The paper should incorporate a wider array of multilingual large language models (MLLMs), particularly those trained on Visual Genome (VG) data. A comparison with models like LLaVA 1.5, which achieves state-of-the-art performance with a minimal domain data, is essential. The authors should delve into why evidence-based methods might be superior to sampling fine-tuning techniques in this context. The current analysis lacks a thorough comparison with fine-tuning approaches, which are a common method for adapting models to specific tasks. A more detailed discussion on the trade-offs between evidence-based methods and fine-tuning is needed.

### Summary
This work explores visual evidence prompting and shows how small visual models complement the LVLMs by effectively extracting contextual information from images to generate precise answers. Experiments on both object and relation halluaciations shows the effectiveness of the proposed method.

### Strengths
- This paper proposes a simple method on mitigating LVLM's object and relation hallucination problem.
- The proposed method shows improvement for all the models and for both object and relation hallucinations.
- The authors also propose a dataset and benchmark for relation hallucinations.
- The authors also provide in-depth analysis on visual evidence prompting.

### Weaknesses
There are some unanswered questions regarding visual evidence, please refer to the **Questions** section.

### Questions
1. Have the authors explored questions regarding how overlapped between objects in questions and objects in evaluation datasets' questions?
1.1 What is the current stats on how overlapping between objects in questions and objects in evaluation datasets' questions?
1.2 What if visual evidence prompt contains objects that are not in the question? what if the prompt contains objects that are not in the questions exclusively?
1.3 What if the object names are switched to the synonyms to the objects appear in question?


2. Another question is regarding the pixel locations of detected objects? does it matter to change the scale of the image? for example, `cup <0, 284, 133, 424>'  to '<0 /width, 284 / height, 133 / width, 424 / height>'. or to '<0 /width * 2, 284 / height * 2, 133 / width * 2, 424 / height *2>'. I wonder to what extend LVLMs will differentiate object relations
