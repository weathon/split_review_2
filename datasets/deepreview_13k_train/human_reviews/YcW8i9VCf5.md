# Adversarial Causal Bayesian Optimization

- Decision: Accept
- Scores: 6, 6, 6, 6

## Abstract
In Causal Bayesian Optimization (CBO), an agent intervenes on an unknown structural causal model to maximize a downstream reward variable. In this paper, we consider the generalization where 
other agents or external events also intervene on the system,
which is key for enabling adaptiveness to non-stationarities 
such as weather changes, market forces, or adversaries. We formalize this generalization of CBO as {\em Adversarial Causal Bayesian Optimization (\acbo)} and introduce the first algorithm for \acbo with bounded regret: {\em Causal Bayesian Optimization with Multiplicative Weights} (\alg). Our approach combines a classical online learning strategy with causal modeling of the rewards. To achieve this, it computes optimistic counterfactual reward estimates by propagating uncertainty through the causal graph. 
We derive regret bounds for \alg that naturally depend on graph-related quantities. We further propose a scalable implementation for the case of combinatorial interventions and submodular rewards.
Empirically, \alg outperforms non-causal and non-adversarial Bayesian optimization methods on synthetic environments and environments based on real-word data. Our experiments include a realistic demonstration of how \alg can be used to learn users' demand patterns in a shared mobility system and reposition vehicles in strategic areas.\looseness=-1

### Summary
The authors propose an extension of the framework of CBO, named ACBO, where other agents (or external events) can also intervene on the system. This is to be able to model changes in the environment. The ACBO framework proposes a concrete algorithm to solve this problem, CBO-MW, which computes optimistic counterfactual reward estimates and enjoys cumulative regret bounds.

### Strengths
- Interesting setting of doing BO with causal relationships among variables and external interventions
- Interesting applied problem in the experiments

### Weaknesses
 - The main weakness is the naming of the method, which refers to CBO (Aglietti et al 2020) and hereby its relationship with the CBO setting. The paper claims to show a generalization of CBO, which it seems to be an * algorithm * proposed in Aglietti et al 2020 as a solution to the "Causal Global Optimization" (CGO) problem. Here, in the abstract but also in the main paper, (1) no mention to the CGO problem is made (2) CBO seems to refer to the "setting" (somehow as a replacement to CGO), while the algorithm proposed here is CBO-MW. But CBO is not a setting, as said, it's an algorithm to solve the CGO under certain assumptions. In CBO, there are intervention *sets* and intervention *values/levels* (continuous-valued). I cannot see any of these here throughout, so it's unclear whether interventions on multiple variables here are excluded or what. In general, are you trying to also solve the CGO problem (a suitably modified version under external interventions, of course) or not ? Again on this point, the authors claim to compare using "previous CBO benchmarks", but there are no benchmarks actually from the CBO paper of Aglietti et al 2020, and the CBO-CW is actually *not* compared (nor experimentally, nor methodologically with a discussion) to CBO itself. There is also no "causal prior" associated to the GP as in CBO. 
- My understanding then from the above is that this work is actually not an extension of CBO at all (although I would like to hear from the authors), rather an extension of GP-MW which is mentioned a lot and compared to experimentally. 
- Strengthening my belief wrt to the "distance" of this work with CBO, the authors here evaluate performance with the **cumulative** regret. This does not seem to be used at all in CBO, where instead a simple regret seems to be used (Aglietti et al 2020).

### Questions
If the authors clarify significantly the relationship with CBO, and modify the claims and narrative in the paper accordingly, I am open to increasing my score.

### Summary
The paper studies causal bayesian optimization under certain kinds of adversaries who can pick additive variables in the causal graph post seeing the variables of the agent up to time t-1. 

- They derive regret upperbounds for a variant of the multiplicative weights algorithm and show scaling with sqrt(T). 
- The analysis is reasonably strong, but motivation could be made more clear -- the motivating examples are not necessarily adversarial.

### Strengths
- Experiments show that the algorithm is strong for the use cases considered.
- Well written problem statement.
- For the model chosen, the analysis is sound.

### Weaknesses
 - The related work ignores causal bandit literature?
- The problem is not well motivated. Why is SMS adversarial and not stochastic?
- The graph notations are confusing. The typical graph has 1 root node. But in causal graphs, we may have multiple nodes without parents.
- The adversary cannot see the action taken by agent before taking its action. Is this adversary weak? You have considered that the agent can see adversary's action before choosing their own action set, but what about vice-versa?
- The additive term Beta^{N+1} does seem high.
- Note that "Causal Bandits for Linear Structural Equation Models" Varici et al 2023 show that the regret scales as length of the longest causal path in the graph for linear SCMs, whereas you consider N - length of path to root node. The former (not cited in your work), seems tighter.
- Is the assumption of usage of only finite action spaces chosen from continuous Reals_[0,1] feasible? If we draw an epsilon net over [0,1], then the computation complexity of Alg 1 may rise.
- There are exponential combination of adversarial choices, for each of which a counterfactual computation may be taken up. This is computationally demanding.
- Page 2: If X_m is a leaf, and it is the reward variable, then it has no parents? Did you mean X_0 is the reward variable?
- You speak of Adversarial CBO, but assume a SCM. Do Causal Bayesian Networks involve the functional relations between the variables?
- Why does cumulative regret go down with increasing rounds for Dropwave Penny in Figure 2?
- What is the lower bound for regret?
- You speak to a sqrt(t) dependence on regret, but the regret curve flattens for your experiment (and even decreases) in the graphs. Why do you believe this is happening?
- Notation question: fi: Zi × Ai × A′i → Xi. Should this not be fi: Zi × Ai × A′i × Ω → Xi
- You say "Because mechanisms can be non-monotonic and nonlinear, one cannot simply independently maximize the output of every mechanism. We thus defer this task to an algorithmic subroutine (denoted causal UCB oracle)". In this algorithm, you use a neural network explicitly. Does the error in functional approximation due to nn use not flow into the regret term?
- Can line 7 in Alg 1 be amended to optimize over a' in [0,1] as well?
- Why is it necessary to learn the causal function at each node, and not just at node Y, or at parents of Y? To bound reward estimates at Y, do we need equally good estimates at all nodes in the graph? (If not the search space for a,a' goes lower and therefore the number of calls to Alg2).

### Confidence
2: You are willing to defend your assessment, but it is quite likely that you did not understand the central parts of the submission or that you are unfamiliar with some pieces of related work. Math/other details were not carefully checked.

### Summary
The paper studies a model where an agent interacts with an unknown causal model that is partly controlled by an adversary. The problem is formulated as a Bayesian optimization problem. The paper proposes an algorithm based on multiplicative weights to solve the problem, which also uses the idea of the upper confidence bound algorith, that adopts an optimistic view in the face of uncertainty. Regret bounds were derived in the paper, and the proposed algorithm was evaluated empirically.

### Strengths
The idea of studying an online causal model looks interesting.

### Weaknesses
I don't see any fundamental difference between the studied model and a standard bandit or Bayesian optimization problem, where part of the model is stochastic and part of it is controlled by an adversary. Therefore, apart from having a causal model in the story, the novelty of the contribution seems limited.

- It is mentioned in the problem statement that the adversary does not know the action to be performed by the agent. Could you explain what the choice of the adversary's action is based on? If the worst-case analysis is applied here, does it matter whether the adversary know the agent's action or not since the adversary will always act in the worst way anyhow? Or does the adversary choose the worst action based only on history actions? But then do they know the agent's algorithm or not? The assumption that they don't know the agent's action seems a bit odd.

- Could you explain the difference between your model and a model that combines stochanstic and adversary bandit?

### Abstract

- I think there is some ambiguity w.r.t. the first sentence: the DAG can be known but the relationships (the mechanisms) of the DAG unknown, or vice versa. Which one do you mean? In the original paper (Aglietti et al) the DAG was always assumed known but there are other settings where the DAG is assumed unknown.
- Good abstract. Perhaps a bit more information on the experiments you performed (just the one sentence ought to do it).

### Introduction

- The supply example is great, but the way you introduce it in the second paragraph, reads a bit forced. Consider rephrasing. It doesn't sound very good at the moment.
- If you are modelling a phenomena in an environment that is changing, why is it not possible to model that with a temporal DAG? Or dynamical DAG? There is plenty of that type of work being done. 
- Fig 1c - I am confused. Your blue nodes sound very much like standard non-manipulative variables and the idea of non-manipulative variables in causal setting, was introduced a long time ago. How are your blue nodes different?

### Background and problem statement

- There is some confusion here. In the abstract you said that $\mathcal{G}$ was unknown and now at the start of paragraph one you say that $\mathcal{G}$ is in fact know. Which is it?
- Is there a reason you deviate from the standard SCM definition from Pearl with $\langle U,V,P,F \rangle$? It seems unnecessary to introduce new notation for a setting which is well defined and well studied. You are just saying, in different words and notation, the interaction between the endogenous and exogenous variables in the SEM. More confusingly though you say that the $\mathcal{G}$ is part of your SCM definition whereas in the standard setting (well, Pearl's setting) the causal diagram is induced by the SCM, not part of it. See chapter 3 (Pearl, 2009).
- What is the reasoning behind using soft rather than hard interventions? What would happen if you used hard instead?
- There are as many actions as there are nodes $m$ in the graph? But then you are also intervening on the reward variable which is non-manipulative?
- To check my understanding: actions are continuous, but there are a finite amount of continuous actions, the cardinality of the domain of each action is then $K$? Why isn't each action just continuous?
- I think you should rephrase the uncertain parts of your problem statement: it is not the case that the causal model is unknown (this typically means the graph) but rather that the mechanisms of the SCM are unknown. You are not being precise enough at the moment to ward off ambiguity. Please change.

### Method

- I think this very important part deserves a deeper treatment, you say "Contrary to standard CBO (where algorithms can choose actions deterministically), in adversarial environments such as ACBO randomization is necessary to achieve no-regret" - why is that the case? Are you then saying that if you are using deterministic action selection it would be impossible to attain no-regret?
- Consider using left-pointing arrows in algorithm 2 to make it more procedural, in place of using equality signs on line 4 and 5. That goes in general for all your algorithms.
- How many times do you have to initialise the neural networks in algorithm 2 for this to work?

### Analysis

- It would be helpful if you gave an example of a Lipschitz continuous kernel, for uninitiated reader. I would also like to know what the consequence would be if you did not make this continuity assumption and how realistic it is?

### Computational considerations in larger action spaces

- Can you please comment on this line: "even with a large number of action variables $m$, $|\mathcal{A}|$ may still be small and thus CBO-MW feasible to implement" - what is 'large' here? When does it become unfeasible? Some numerical ballpark figures would be helpful. 

### Experiments

- To confirm: you are considering the causally sufficient setting i.e. you assume there are no unobserved confounders? If so, please state that early on in the paper (apologies if I missed it).
- Would it also make sense to also compare against CBO? Don't worry this review is not conditional upon you doing that, I am merely wondering why it is not part of your analysis, seeing as you talk about it early on.
- The SMS example is _great_. Really enjoyed reading that.
