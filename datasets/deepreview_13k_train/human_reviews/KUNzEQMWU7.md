- Decision: Accept
- Scores: 5, 8, 8, 8

## Abstract
Large Language Models (LLMs) and Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) exhibit impressive problem-solving skills in many tasks and domains, but their ability in mathematical reasoning in visual contexts has not been systematically studied. To bridge this gap, we present \dataset, a benchmark designed to combine challenges from diverse mathematical and visual tasks. \new{It consists of 6,141 examples, derived from 28 existing multimodal datasets involving mathematics and 3 newly created datasets (\textit{i.e.}, IQTest, FunctionQA, and PaperQA). Completing these tasks requires fine-grained, deep visual understanding and compositional reasoning, which all state-of-the-art foundation models find challenging}.

\new{With \dataset, we have conducted a comprehensive, quantitative evaluation of 12 prominent foundation models. The best-performing GPT-4V model achieves an overall accuracy of 49.9\%, substantially outperforming Bard, the second-best performer, by 15.1\%. Our in-depth analysis reveals that the superiority of GPT-4V is mainly attributed to its enhanced visual perception and mathematical reasoning. However, GPT-4V still falls short of human performance by 10.4\%, as it often struggles to understand complex figures and perform rigorous reasoning. This significant gap underscores the critical role that \dataset will play in the development of general-purpose AI agents capable of tackling mathematically intensive and visually rich real-world tasks. We further explore the new ability of \textit{self-verification}, the application of \textit{self-consistency}, and the interactive chatbot capabilities of GPT-4V, highlighting its promising potential for future research.}

### Summary
This work introduces MathVista, a benchmark for evaluating the mathematical reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs) and large multimodal models (LMMs) within visual contexts. The work uses data from a broad range of existing math and visual question-answering datasets and constructs three novel datasets: IQTest, FunctionQA, and PaperQA. The work evaluates nearly a dozen models with MathVista and finds that Multimodal Bard, the best-performing model, achieves 58% of human performance.

### Strengths
1. Curating the datasets from existing sources and developing three new datasets contribute to comprehensive and diverse testing.

2. Evaluating nearly a dozen models and comparing their performances with a human benchmark provides insight into current performance.

3. Mathematical reasoning within visual contexts is an important field.

### Weaknesses
1. The results have been completely superseded by GPT-4 Vision, which together with GPT-4 are SotA in vision-language models.

2. The methods have been superseded by recent prompting methods.

### Summary
The paper proposes a mathematical and visual reasoning benchmark to evaluate various visual-based mathematical skills of large-language models (LLMs) and large-multimodal models (LMMs). The authors introduce a taxonomy for mathematical visual reasoning which involves seven different types of mathematical reasoning scenarios and five associated tasks including figure-based question answering, math world problems and geometry problem solving. The visual scenarios are targeted to be diverse involving real images, synthetic scenes, charts and plots, scientific figures, etc. While majority of the benchmark is formed through 28 existing publicly-available datasets, authors form three new datasets targeted to fill gap for mathematical scenarios not covered by existing datasets. 

The benchmark is relatively small and meant to be a zero-or few-shot evaluation benchmark divided into a "testmini" (1000 examples) and "test" (5141 examples). Evaluation of several model types (including LLMs, LLMs with visual context augmentation and large m) under different setups (including chain-of-thought, program-of-thought, few-shot) is performed and results indicate that current models perform poorly in comparison to humans. A brief error/success analysis and qualitative examples are provided for multimodal bard and context-augmented GPT-4.

### Strengths
1. The construction of a visual-based mathematical reasoning benchmark to evaluate current LLMs and LMMs is well motivated and relatively novel. The method for construction and statistics of the final benchmark are adequately described with appropriate references to source datasets and prior works.

2. The identified taxonomy covers a broad range of mathematical reasoning scenarios and tasks, and diversity is also maintained in the visual contexts. Further, the 3 newly collected datasets consider new tasks not covered by past works. 

3. Evaluation is performed on prominent LLMs (such as GPT-4, ChatGPT, Claude) and LMMs (mPLUG-Owl, InstructBLIP, LLaVa, Multimodal-Bard). LLMs are evaluated in zero-shot, few-shot, chain-of-thought and program-of-thought settings and also when they are augmented with visual contexts. Further, human performance is computed and qualitative analysis and fine-grained result comparisons are performed to better highlight capabilities and limitations of existing models. 

4. Paper is generally well written with appropriate figures and details illustrating the dataset examples and analysis, performance breakdown, qualitative examples, model prompts/settings and annotation methods.

### Weaknesses
1. For data collection of the 3 new datasets, it is not clear if inter-annotation consistency checks were conducted and how the mentioned "rigorous review process" was conducted (details are missing).  

2. Few-shot performance is computed only for LLMs and not LMMs. Given LMMs such as Multimodal-Bard, Flamingo/Open-Flamingo and mPLUG-Owl also support few-shot learning, these can also be evaluated few-shot to better evaluate the benchmark challenges. 

3. Further, LLMs can also be evaluated on a broader range of K-shot settings (currently only 2-shot is evaluated). Evaluation over {2,4,8,16,32} could provide better evidence of whether mathematical reasoning capabilities can be learned in a few-shot manner.

Relatively minor:

4. Benchmark is relatively small (6141 examples) and meant as an evaluation benchmark primarily drawn from existing datasets (5405 examples) with no finetuning subset which could be useful for improving mathematical reasoning capabilities of current models.

### Summary
The paper proposes a benchmark to evaluate the ability of math reasoning with visual contexts. The test-only benchmark contains a relatively large number of examples (6k), featuring a wide coverage of math reasoning types (7), data sources (28), and task types (5). On the benchmark, representative multi-modal LLMs are evaluated. The results show that Bard is the best performing model among all the evaluated ones, getting 35% accuracy, which indicates that the current models still suffer from math reasoning.

### Strengths
1. The dataset is well-designed and relatively large. It contains 6k examples, coming from various (28) sources including existing ones and newly collected ones. The datasets also evaluate various types of reasoning abilities and tasks. The images contain synthetic, real and text-heavy images, which is a good coverage of different types.
2. The paper focuses on a specific topic and defines the problem well, which is important for LLM evaluation.
3. Several SoTA multimodal LLMs, including miniGPT-4, LLaVA(R), Bard, Instruct-BLIP, etc. are evaluated on the benchmark, and show reasonable results.

### Weaknesses
1. How to disentangle the visual understanding ability or text understanding ability with the math reasoning ability? For example, if a model incorrectly answers “how many cars are to the left of the tree”, it could be the error in spatial understanding (failing to find the cars on the left), or error in counting, or the model cannot understand this question. In the current form of the dataset, there is no disentangled evaluation of the visual/text understanding versus math reasoning. A possible way to address this questions could be having the annotations for **rationales** (results of intermediate reasoning steps or sub-questions), and evaluate the model’s performance against the intermediate steps.
2. Why is the human accuracy only 60.3% on the dataset? Does this suggest that the dataset is noisy, containing ambiguous/uncertain cases, or simply the task is very difficult thus humans are not good at it as well? An analysis on the 40% of the data where humans cannot answer correctly will be preferred. 
3. While it is good that the paper defines 7 types of fine-grained reasoning ability, what are the take-away messages (of Tab-2) that can be derived with the differences in the 7 types? It would be nice if the expertise of different models can be reflected using the fine-grained types, besides that Bard is the best model
4. Results of GPT-4V? I understand that the model is not released by the submission deadline, but it would be good to have the results in later versions.

### Summary
The paper focuses on the evaluation of mathematical reasoning based on visual inputs. This work presents a review of existing work on the topic, a new benchmark (MathVista) made of existing datasets plus three new ones, and a large evaluation of existing large pretrained models on this benchmark.

### Strengths
- Thorough review of the existing work on the topic, with a proposed taxonomy that clarifies and organizes the capabilities and settings relevant to visual/mathematical reasoning.

- Consolidation of existing datasets into a comprehensive benchmark.

- Large evaluation of existing models, under various settings (zero-shot, few-shot ICL, with various prompting strategies).

### Weaknesses
W1. A potential downside of the chosen tasks is that they "amalgamate" mathematical and visual reasoning (as stated in the abstract). This does not seem desirable since one would usually also wants to understand the capabilities of a model for these two steps (visual understanding and reasoning) independently. The argument that there exists other benchmarks that do look at these individual capabilities means that this is however not a critical issue.

------

W2. The low human performance on the benchmark (~60% accuracy) is concerning. Could this indicate an issue with data quality of annotation noise? (rather than intrinsic task difficulty)

### Questions
Please comment on W2 above.

Minor question regarding the sampling of data for "testmini", the text mentions the following:
"The KL Divergence and Total Variation (TV) distance between the testmini set and the entire set are 0.008 and 0.035"
What is being compared with KL and TV distances? Distributions of what?
