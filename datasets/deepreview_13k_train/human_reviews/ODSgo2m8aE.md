- Scores: 6, 6, 8, 5

## Abstract
Relational learning has gained significant attention, led by the expressiveness of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) on graph data. While the inherent biases in common graph data are involved in GNN training, it poses a serious challenge to constraining the GNN output perturbations induced by input biases, thereby safeguarding fairness during training. The Lipschitz bound, a technique from robust statistics, can limit the maximum changes in the output concerning the input, taking into account associated irrelevant biased factors. It is an efficient and provable method to examine the output stability of machine learning models without incurring additional computational costs. Recently, its use in controlling the stability of Euclidean neural networks, the calculation of the precise Lipschitz bound remains elusive for non-Euclidean neural networks like GNNs, especially within fairness contexts. However, no existing research has investigated Lipschitz bounds to shed light on stabilizing the GNN outputs, especially when working on graph data with implicit biases. To narrow this gap, we begin with the general GNNs operating on relational data, and formulate a Lipschitz bound to limit the changes in the output regarding biases associated with the input. Additionally, we theoretically analyze how the Lipschitz bound of a GNN model could constrain the output perturbations induced by biases learned from data for fairness training. We experimentally validate the Lipschitz bound's effectiveness in limiting biases of the model output. Finally, from a training dynamics perspective, we demonstrate why the theoretical Lipschitz bound can effectively guide the GNN training to better trade-off between accuracy and fairness.

### Summary
This paper addresses the problem of individual fairness in the relational learning task (graph datasets). The measure of fairness in this work fairness is based on the notion that similar inputs must have similar outputs. The authors argue that to ensure fairness, Lipschitz's constant of GNN must be small. To this end, they characterize the lipschitz's constant in Jacobian and optimize it along with the loss function to achieve fairness. Empirical results show improved individual fairness at competitive or better utility.

### Strengths
- Characterizing fairness in terms of the Lipschitz constant and optimizing this constant is an interesting approach to achieving individual fairness in GNNs. 
- The proposed approach, JacoLip, outperforms other fair learning methods --- JacoLip achieves a better fairness score while having the best or close to the best utility. Further, the authors show that it can even improve an existing fair learning method to some extent. These observations, coupled with the evaluation over several datasets, increase confidence in the proposed idea.

### Weaknesses
### Computational Efficiency
- At several places in the paper, the authors have emphasized that their method has no computational overhead. However, no empirical evidence is provided for this. For example, comparing training time and memory usage of different approaches could be a way to support this argument. Specifically, a comparison of the time per iteration and peak GPU memory usage across different methods on a representative dataset would be valuable. Without such data, the claim of no computational overhead remains unsubstantiated.
- The proposed approach involves computing norms of the Jacobian matrix in the loss function. This could lead to computing gradient of gradient during backpropagation (implicitly by PyTorch), which can be memory and compute-intensive. How the authors got around this is unclear. The computation of the Jacobian norm, even if done implicitly, involves backpropagating through the computation graph, which could introduce significant overhead, especially for large graphs. The authors should clarify whether they are using any specific techniques to avoid second-order derivatives or if they are relying on automatic differentiation, which could be costly.

### Questions
- In the introduction, the authors mention, "... computational approach utilizes intermediate tensors extracted..." What intermediate tensors are being referred to here?
- Eq 7 describes the jacobian of the i-th node. Shouldn't it be a 3D tensor? $Y_{jk}$ (output of node-j) depends on $X_i$ (node i) due to message passing. Are $\frac{dY_{j1}}{dX_{i1}}$ $i\neq j$ and such terms ignored? I think the discussion about the computation of the Lipschitz constant could be more elaborate, with a clear indication of the dimension of the tensors. 

I think the paper shows good empirical results. Still, it would help to make the section about the Lipschitz constant more straightforward and compare training time and memory usage to support computational efficiency claims.

### Summary
The paper focus on individual fairness in GNNs by constraining the output perturbations induced by input biases. The authors propose a Lipschitz constant-based approach to examine the output stability of GNNs and demonstrate its effectiveness in limiting biases in the model output. They also introduce a computational strategy using the Jacobian matrix to efficiently compute the Lipschitz constant. The paper includes experiments on real-world datasets and comparisons with existing methods.

### Strengths
1. The paper addresses an important and timely problem of fairness in GNNs, which has gained significant attention in recent years.

2. The use of Lipschitz constants to control the stability of GNN outputs provides a provable method for examining output stability without additional computational costs.

3. The theoretical analysis and formulation of the Lipschitz constant for GNNs operating on graph data is well-structured.

### Weaknesses
1. The proposed method does not need manual annotation of sensitive attributes. However, lack of information would surely compromise the guarantee of ensuring fairness. Discussions on the drawback compared to other fairness methods that explicitly use sensitive attributes should be included.

2. The methodology in sec 3 does not appear to be specifically tailored for fairness problems. Is there any guarantee on how fairness regarding sensitive attributes is ensured for the proposed JacoLip algorithm?

3. The experimental results are not organized clearly. For example, in Table 1 JacoLip isn’t always achieving the best performance, but best results are not in bold or otherwise marked, making it difficult to compare across methods and datasets.

### Summary
This paper designs an approach to estimate the Lipschitz constant for GNNs efficiently. Adding such an estimation as a regularization to limit output changes induced by input biases helps align the model with principles of rank-based individual fairness. The authors validate the proposed method through experiments on node classification and link prediction tasks. Results show the approach effectively improves fairness while maintaining accuracy. In particular, this paper provides insights into how constraining the Lipschitz constant influences training dynamics and the trade-off between accuracy and fairness.

(2) Extensive experiments are performed and presented. The superiority exhibited by the experimental results in most cases seems promising.

(3) The efficient computation of the Lipschitz constant via the Jacobian matrix makes the proposed approach scalable.

### Weaknesses
(1) This paper lacks a motivating example to deliver the significance of the proposed approach in applications.

(2) No time complexity / running time comparison is provided. This undermines the claimed advantage in efficiency.

(3) While experiments validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, more analysis could be provided on the sensitivity of the method to different hyperparameters.

### Questions
(1) What is the motivation of the proposed approach? The practical value would be much clearer if any motivating example could be provided.

(2) What is the time complexity of the proposed approach? It would be desired if any time complexity analysis / running time comparison could be provided.

(3) Is the proposed framework sensitive to the value of $u$ (i.e., the weight assigned for the regularization term) in Algorithm 1?

### Summary
I’m not an expert in the GNN, fairness community but has some experience on the estimation of Lipschitz constant. 
Accordingly, my reviews are purely based on reading the paper without comparison to the related literature on GNN and fairness.

In my understanding, this paper studies the use of Lipschitz constant of graph neural networks for fairness. To derive the Lipschitz constant, the Jacobian based approach is proposed and verified by several experiments on classification and prediction tasks.

### Strengths
- Estimate the Lipschitz constant of GNNs via Jacobian matrix
- Comprehensive experiments on GNNs for the bias

### Weaknesses
Since I’m not familiar with GNN and fairness, it appears difficult to evaluate the contribution.

For the estimation of the Lipchitz constant, the approach is based on the Jacobian matrix, which is loose. In this community, there are several advanced and promising approaches for the Lipschitz constant estimation on DNNs. So I’m wondering how this can be extended to the GNN setting, and what’s the difficulty issue behind this?
