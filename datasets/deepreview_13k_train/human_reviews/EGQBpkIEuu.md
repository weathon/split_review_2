- Decision: Accept
- Scores: 6, 6, 6, 6

## Abstract
Various data augmentation techniques have been recently proposed in image-based deep reinforcement learning (DRL).
Although they empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of data augmentation for improving sample efficiency or generalization, which technique should be preferred is not always clear. 
To tackle this question, we analyze existing methods to better understand them and to uncover how they are connected.
Notably, by expressing the variance of the Q-targets and that of the empirical actor/critic losses of these methods, we can analyze the effects of their different components and compare them.
We furthermore formulate an explanation about how these methods may be affected by choosing different data augmentation transformations in calculating the target Q-values.
This analysis suggests recommendations on how to exploit data augmentation in a more principled way.
In addition, we include a regularization term called tangent prop, previously proposed in computer vision, but whose adaptation to DRL is novel to the best of our knowledge. 
Compared to different relevant baselines,  we demonstrate that it achieves state-of-the-art performance in most environments and shows higher sample efficiency and better generalization ability in some complex environments.

### Summary
This paper theoretically analyzes and compares the impact of current data augmentation techniques on Q-target and actor/critic loss in visual reinforcement learning. The regularization term "tangent prop" proposed in computer vision is also applied to reinforcement learning to learn invariant.

### Strengths
The theoretical analysis of the paper is sufficient, which is difficult to see in many similar works. At the same time, the experimental data are also considerable.

### Weaknesses
1) The work in this paper seems to be equivalent to adding an explicit regularization to implicit regularization, is it equivalent to DrQ combined with DrAC in terms of functionality?
2) How the proposed algorithm addresses the initial question "Although they empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of data augmentation for improving sample efficiency or generalization, which technique should be preferred is not always clear.". The main idea of the paper is not analyzed.

3) Please check that the two terms in the KL divergence in Eq. 8, and there seems to be an ambiguity with Eq. 4 and Eq. 9.
4) How to prove that the distributions of $\nu$ and $\mu$ in Eq. 11 and Eq. 12 are the distributions of $\hat{\nu}$ and $\hat{\mu}$ satisfying Lemma 1?
5) How to show that "even using complex image transformations such as random convolution in the target". We did not find an experiment in the paper that verifies this conclusion.
6) In the experimental part, the grid search for $ \alpha_{KL}$ and $ \alpha_{tp}$ is too sparse, and the final choice of 0.1 leads to curiosity about the results within [0,0.1]. A similar situation occurs with the SVEA comparison experiment of 0.5 selected from {0.1, 0.5}.
7) I'm curious about the method of determining $ \alpha_i$, which seems to be missing the reason(s) in the paper. Does it have a specific value for each augmentation in the set, or does it choose an average weight?
8) In Figure 2, the batch size of DrQ reproduced in the results is 256 instead of 512 in the original DrQ. The scores of DrQ will decrease under some environments when using a smaller batch size. Compared with the official results of DrQ (https://github.com/denisyarats/drq), some results of DrQ shown in Figure 9 are lower. Such as ball_in_catch , walker_walk, walk_run. Therefore, to make a fair comparison, the author should completely use the hyperparameter settings in DrQ to reproduce, or use the scores in DrQ.

### Summary
This paper delves into the realm of data augmentation methods in Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL), conducting a thorough analysis of existing techniques. The authors provide a theoretical framework to understand and compare these methods and propose a new regularization term, tangent prop, to enhance invariance. Their contributions lie in offering a theoretical understanding of data augmentation methods in DRL, suggesting how to use data augmentation in a more theoretically-driven manner, and introducing a novel regularization approach. Through extensive experiments, the authors validate their theoretical propositions.

### Strengths
Originality:
It conducts a comprehensive analysis of existing data augmentation methods, initially based on the author's introduction of assumptions regarding uncertainty in reinforcement learning and existing image-based online Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) data augmentation techniques. The paper establishes an integrated AC framework incorporating data augmentation. Within this framework, the mainstream data augmentation methods are analyzed and categorized into explicit and implicit regularization techniques. Qualitative and quantitative analyses of these augmentation methods are performed. Building upon these two types of regularization, the paper introduces a novel regularization technique – tangent prop – providing theoretical support for addressing uncertainty in the Critic component.

Quality and Clarity:
I think the quality of the paper is very high. Each proposition and hypothesis presented in the paper is accompanied by corresponding formulas, and the appendix contains detailed derivations of these formulas. Additionally, I find the paper to be very logically structured.
First, the paper explains the process of the Data-Augmented Off-policy Actor-Critic Scheme and introduces the key hypotheses regarding the uncertainty in Q-values and policy π. The subsequent proofs and derivations are based on these definitions. The paper then elaborates on how explicit and implicit uncertainties are defined within the A-C framework and how they affect the Loss function of Actor and Critic. After providing the theoretical background, the paper proposes its own generic algorithm and provides detailed derivations and proofs.

Furthermore, the paper analyzes the effects of applying different image transformations when calculating target Q-values, as well as the empirical actor/critic losses estimated under data augmentation. In implicit regularization, the author, unlike the previous SVEA method, incorporates KL divergence into the training process for policy. The paper explains and proves that, under the premise of Critic invariance, introducing KL divergence helps the model better learn the invariance of the Actor. Finally, the paper introduces the innovative concept of Tangent Propagation to further demonstrate how this newly introduced additional regularization term promotes Critic invariance.

The logic throughout the main body of the paper is very clear. It systematically proves its hypotheses about uncertainty and effectively addresses the initial problems posed in the paper.

Significance:
The paper holds significant value for the DRL research community. By offering a theoretical framework and introducing a novel regularization approach, the paper addresses a key challenge in DRL, enhancing the understanding and application of data augmentation techniques. The experimental validation across various environments supports the significance of the proposed methods. The findings are likely to influence future research directions, providing valuable insights for researchers and practitioners in the field.

### Weaknesses
The theoretical derivation in the paper is very thorough. However, I believe the experimental section of the paper is somewhat lacking. It compares the performance with the previous statistically trained model, SVEA, providing detailed experimental data and theoretical analysis. Nevertheless, there is a lack of in-depth analysis of the shortcomings of the previous algorithms and the advantages of the proposed algorithm. Moreover, I think the algorithm should be further compared with more methods and applied in various domains to validate its generalizability.

The entire article is dedicated to theoretically proving the reliability of its algorithm, and it has obtained favorable experimental results. However, throughout the entire text, there is no discussion about the shortcomings and limitations of the algorithm, nor is there any mention of how to extend the algorithm or areas that need further exploration in the future.

The article discusses how different complex image augmentation techniques have varying impacts on the invariance of target Q-values. The paper proposes using cosine similarity measured from encoder outputs for this evaluation. It is mentioned in the article that techniques such as random addition or Gaussian blur easily achieve invariance through these transformations because they result in high cosine similarity. When using these types of image transformations in computing target values, it does not affect performance. In contrast, image transformations like random convolution or random rotation are relatively challenging to achieve invariance during the training process, as they result in lower cosine similarity. The solution proposed in the paper is to enforce this invariance by performing more updates at each training step. However, the paper does not address whether there might be potential overfitting issues under these specific conditions and how to handle them.

### Summary
This paper presents an analysis of various data augmentation techniques applied in image-based deep reinforcement learning.  
The authors classify these techniques into two primary categories: implicit and explicit data augmentation where implicit DA consists of directly applying transformations on the observations during training, oppositely to explicit DA where transformations are applied on samples used for an auxiliary regularization term.  
Following this classification, the authors then put forth a generalized formulation for integrating DA within actor-critic methods, covering both the previously mentioned implicit and explicit DA techniques. One of the paper's most salient contributions lies in the analysis of how DA impacts the variance associated with the actor and critic losses.  
The insights drawn from this analysis guide the authors towards designing a principled data augmentation strategy.  
A notable aspect of their proposed method is the integration of a computer vision regularization called tangent prop into the learning objective for the critic. This modification is suggested to potentially improve the stability and efficiency of the learning process.  
The experimental segment of the paper includes tests on the DeepMind control suite benchmark to evaluate the proposed data augmentation scheme. Additionally, the authors test the generalization capabilities of their method using the dmcontrol-generalization-benchmark.

### Strengths
**Unified Framework:** A significant strength of this paper is its development of a unified framework that facilitates the direct application of data augmentation in RL. This holistic approach serves to streamline various data augmentation techniques within the context of reinforcement learning.

 **Analysis on KL regularization direction:** The paper offers a commendable examination regarding the optimal direction for applying the KL regularization term. While the theoretical insights are appreciated, an empirical evaluation would have added further depth to this assessment.

 **Variance Analysis in SAC:** The comprehensive analysis of the variance associated with the different terms used in SAC when DA is applied is insightful and sparks intriguing questions that could guide future research in the domain.

**Tangent Prop regularization:** Although the tangent prop regularization has its roots in the computer vision world and might not be a groundbreaking addition to RL, its introduction in this context is promising. The authors successfully empirically demonstrate its potential benefits.

### Weaknesses
 **Oversimplified Unified Framework:** While the proposed unified framework is a step forward, it seems overly simplified. Specifically, the representation of implicit data augmentation as solely reliant on KL regularization seems limiting. Other methods like SODA and SGQN incorporate data augmentation using auxiliary objectives, drawing parallels with techniques in self-supervised learning. For instance, SODA uses a contrastive loss to learn invariant features, while SGQN employs a generative model to create augmented states. Such nuances should have been addressed for a more comprehensive overview. The current framework fails to capture the diversity of approaches used in the field.

**Excessive Reference to Appendix:** The frequent deference to the appendix, especially in sections 5.2 and 6, detracts from the paper's flow. Readers are forced into continuous back-and-forth toggling, making the narrative harder to follow. This constant need to refer to the appendix disrupts the reading experience and makes it difficult to grasp the core ideas presented in the main text. The authors should strive to integrate more of the essential information directly into the main body of the paper.

**Unverified Claims:** The assertion that introducing image transformations in the target doesn't lead to significant variance seems unsupported, particularly when considering table 5 in the appendix. The data in Table 5 shows a non-negligible increase in variance when complex transformations are applied to the target. Such claims should ideally be substantiated with empirical evidence, perhaps by showing that the increase in variance is small relative to the magnitude of the target values or by providing a theoretical justification.

**Comparison with RAD and SVEA:** In the original paper, SVEA, which does not employ data augmentation on the target, significantly outperforms RAD. A comment or analysis from the authors on this discrepancy would have been informative. The authors should explore why avoiding data augmentation on the target leads to better performance in SVEA, and how this relates to their analysis of variance.

**Unclear Table Presentation:** Table 4 in the appendix is a bit perplexing. The logic behind measuring variance in relation to augmentations not employed during SVEA training (such as overlay, randomconv, rotation, or blur) is unclear. Additionally, the specific "DA" used here is not explicitly mentioned, leading to further confusion. The authors need to provide a clear explanation of the experimental setup and the meaning of the reported values in Table 4.

**Novelty and Contribution:** A major point of contention is the actual novelty and impact of the paper's contributions. Its principal contribution seems to revolve around the unified framework and the introduction of tangent prop in RL. Yet, the proposed principled algorithm appears to be a minor extension of DrQ by merely incorporating a KL term. Based on figures 1 and 2, the tangible benefits seem largely attributed to the tangent prop, emphasizing its crucial role. While integrating this regularization in RL is commendable, its novelty in the broader context appears somewhat limited.

**Minor comments**
 Bolding in Tables: The rationale behind the use of bolding in tables (specifically tables 4 and 5) needs clarification. 
Limitations are located in the appendix these and should be explicitly referenced in the main body.
Missing legend in figure 7, what is the green line?

### Questions
* Based on the data from Table 2, RAD+ exhibits lower variance on the critic loss compared to DrQ. Yet, it underperforms DrQ in terms of overall results. Given that both methods utilize the SAC algorithm, this seems to counter the claim made by the authors that reducing critic loss variance leads to more stabilized training. Can the authors provide insights or explanations for this observation?

* My understanding is that the only discernible difference between the authors' method and DrQ+KL is the introduction of the tangent prop regularization. Drawing from Table 1, it appears that this regularization is the primary factor that reduces the critic loss variance, rather than the authors' generic algorithm. Could the authors comment on the role and impact of tangent prop in this context?

* The authors assert that employing random convolution in SVEA doesn't induce significant variance. However, the empirical results from Table 5 seem to suggest otherwise. Could the authors clarify?

* What drives the intuition that the KL term assists in reducing the variance of the target critic?

For a more comprehensive analysis, would it be feasible for the authors to include SVEA in the experiments of the initial experimental setup?
