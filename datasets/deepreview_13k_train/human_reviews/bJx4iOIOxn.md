# Facing the Elephant in the Room: Visual Prompt Tuning or Full finetuning?

- Decision: Accept
- Scores: 8, 6, 8, 8

## Abstract
As the scale of vision models continues to grow, the emergence of Visual Prompt Tuning (VPT) as a parameter-efficient transfer learning technique has gained attention due to its superior performance compared to traditional full-finetuning. However, the conditions favoring VPT (the ``when") and the underlying rationale (the ``why") remain unclear. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive analysis across 19 distinct datasets and tasks. To understand the ``when" aspect, we identify the scenarios where VPT proves favorable by two dimensions: task objectives and data distributions. We find that VPT is preferrable when there is 1) a substantial disparity between the original and the downstream task objectives (\eg, transitioning from classification to counting), or 2) a similarity in data distributions between the two tasks (\eg, both involve natural images). In exploring the ``why" dimension, our results indicate VPT's success cannot be attributed solely to overfitting and optimization considerations. The unique way VPT preserves original features and adds parameters appears to be a pivotal factor. Our study provides insights into VPT's mechanisms, and offers guidance for its optimal utilization.

### Summary
The paper provides a deep analysis of visual prompt tuning (VPT), a popular transfer learning method for vision tasks. Specifically, the paper  discusses when VPT is more favorable than fully fine-tuning and give some insights on why VPT has higher performance than fully fine-tuning. The paper finds that when the data disparity between pre-training and downstream tasks is small, or the task disparity is large, VPT normally has higher performance. The paper demonstrates that when task disparity is large, VPT is usually better because fully fine-tuning is more prone to over-fitting, and when data disparity is small, VPT is usually better because it preserves more information from pre-training by freezing the parameters. The paper provides insights and guidance on when and why to choose VPT over fully fine-tuning.

### Strengths
The paper discusses an interesting and important subject, and gives sensible and valuable insights on the topic. The whole analysis is thorough enough and the conclusions seem credible. The paper is overall well written and easy to follow.

### Weaknesses
1. In Section 5.4, the authors show that the GradCAM maps of VPT is more interpretable and more focused on task-relevant regions than fully fine-tuning. It seems the examples are all from natural image classification. It would be helpful to compare the attention on four quadrants of transfer learning to see the difference when data/task disparity varies and how it is connected to the conclusion in Section 4. 

2. The visualization of attention in Section 5.4 is based on GradCAM. Have the authors tried visualizing the attention from cls token to other tokens, as in previous work in the ViT literature (e.g., [1])? On the other hand, a previous paper [2] also discusses the relation between transfer learning and attention. They find that current transfer learning methods tend to have noisy attention and fixing the attention can boost the transfer learning performance. It would be helpful to add some discussion on the relation between this work and [2].

3. This paper is focused on VPT. Since other transfer learning methods such as LoRA [3] may have more favorable performances on various transfer learning tasks like VTAB-1k, readers may wonder if these methods also have similar properties. It would be helpful to see if the same conclusions also hold for other transfer learning methods.

### Summary
Visual prompt tuning (VPT) and full finetuning (FT) are two commonly-used techniques to adapt a pretrained vision transformer to downstream image recognition tasks. Through extensive experiments, this paper is aiming to investigate when (under which conditions) and why VPT would outperform FT:
1. For the when part, the authors find VPT is favored when: 
- there’s a disparity between pre-trained task and target downstream task; 
- target downstream task share similar data distribution with the pre-trained data; 
- when target labeled data is limited.
2. For the why part, the authors give several hypotheses and experiments aiming to verify them including: 
- both VPT and FT suffer from overfitting so VPT’s success cannot be solely attributed to less overfitting during finetuning;
- VPT’s special way of preserving original weights and adding new parameters might be the key.

### Strengths
1. The paper is well-written with clear high-level motivation/intuition/ideas, along with detailed subsections that introduce the low-level implementation details. It is easy to follow and understand for the general audience in the field of recognition, vision transformer or transfer learning.
2. Indeed as in the title, the problem that the paper is trying to tackle is quite important but also not fully explored yet, i.e., the elephant in the room. VPT is widely used in multiple areas as a common tool to adapt pre-trained models to downstream tasks, not only in recognition, but also in dense prediction, vision language model and even generation nowadays. However, there are very few works talking about this classic “when and why” problem such that people could understand VPT better and also use it in a better practice.
3. Some of the extensive experiments are quite convincing, especially the analysis on downstream data scale (Sec. 4.4) and hypothesis on overfitting (Sec. 5.1).
4. The hypothesis on (a) how data distribution and task similarity gonna affect VPT’s performance (Sec 4.3); (b) why VPT outperforms FT from an optimization perspective (Sec 5.2) are quite interesting. The experiments alongside are also very inspiring.

### Weaknesses
1. Although the hypotheses in Sec. 4.3 and Sec. 5.2 look very interesting and inspiring (as mentioned in the Strength point 4), I’m concerned the experiments are not convincing enough to support them:
- In Sec. 4.3, it’s a bit risky to draw the conclusion using only 19 data points. Adding more tasks including the detention or dense prediction ones could be better. 
- In Sec. 5.2, although Fig. 7 is very intriguing, the experiment results are not able to support it, i.e., Mixed and FT-then-PT still fall behind VPT with clear margins. This also leads to a very ambiguous conclusion in the last paragraph in Sec. 5.2.
2. The comparison of GradCAM visualization in Sec. 5.4 is not very informative (the distinction is not that huge, plus more like a calibration difference?) and it’s also hard to draw any convincing conclusion from it.
3. In Tab. 1, Mixed and FT-then-PT are included without any introduction in the Sec. 4.1 alongside, which could be very confusing to the audience. Maybe remove them from Tab. 1 and make another comparison table in Sec. 5.2, where these two methods are actually introduced?
4. The number of wins notation was introduced in Tab. 3 but has already appeared in Tab. 1 and 2 before, which could confuse the audience. Also, ‘[]’ was used for both this notation and also reference. Maybe change it to ‘()’ to avoid any confusion?
5. A similar observation on data scale (Sec. 4.4) is actually also covered in the original VPT paper/experiments (Page 8, Fig. 3).

### Summary
The authors attempt to answer the question: When and why VPT is effective. They conduct extensive experiments on 19 diverse datasets and tasks, wherein VPT outperformed FT in 16 instances (VTAB-1k [110] image classification benchmark). The model is ViT (and the authors observed the same tendency when they use Swin).

In exploring the “when” dimension, they find that VPT is preferrable when there is 1) a substantial disparity between the original and the downstream task objectives (e.g., transitioning from classification to counting), or 2) a similarity in data distributions between the two tasks (e.g., both involve natural images).
In exploring the “why” dimension, they find that VPT’s success cannot be attributed solely to overfitting and optimization considerations and that VPT preserves features and add parameters in a unique manner.

Specifically, 
- VPT reaches superior performance than FT in two different scenarios: (1) when the disparity between the task objectives of the original and downstream tasks is high, or (2) when the data distributions are similar.
- The performance gap between full finetuning and prompt tuning decreases as the amount of training data increases. 
- Although full finetuning generally achieves higher accuracy when rich data examples are available, the prompt tuning still reaches a competitive performance with much fewer parameters.
- In one-shot classification, prompt tuning outperforms full finetuning in many tasks and achieving substantially higher accuracy in some cases (i.e., 41.66% vs 56.94% in VTAB-1k Natural).
- Training and testing losses consistently decrease in scenarios where the task objectives are similar between the original and downstream tasks. In such cases, overfitting is not the cause of performance degradation of FT.
- The presence of additional dimensions does not significantly aid the optimization process.
- Preserving the original feature proves to be crucial for transferring to downstream tasks, as evidenced by the superior performance of VPT compared to FT-then-PT.
- Maintaining a fixed feature space in VPT may compel it to learn more valuable embeddings with the trainable prompts, as it significantly outperforms the Mixed method.
- Therefore, pretrained parameters play a pivotal role in capturing general features in transfer learning. That is, the preservation of initial
features is important for VPT’s success, but in a very sophisticated manner.

Overall, the authors find many characteristics of VPT in the context of "FT vs. VPT," although some of them might be an overstatement.

### Strengths
- Topic is timely, challenging, and important in machine learning community.

- The experiments are well-organized. The results are clearly shown and easy to follow.

- Error bars are provided when necessary.

- Full implementation will be publicly released for reproducibility.

- The present paper is well-written and easy to follow. Logic flow is smooth.

- Overall, the authors find many characteristics of VPT in the context of "FT vs. VPT," which contribute to the community.

### Weaknesses
 - [Minor] The experiment is limited to Transformer-based models.

- There may be some overstatements, e.g., in Figure 4 (see Questions).

- The reason why VPT outperforms FT in scenarios characterized by distinct data distributions and high task disparity is still unclear, although the authors make a hypothesis (Section 5.3).

- The reason why FT outperforms VPT in situations involving similar tasks with varying data distributions is still unclear, although the authors make a hypothesis (Section 5.3).

- [Comment (major)] In Figure 4,
> In general, with the dataset increasing in size, the performance gap between FT and VPT becomes narrow.

I would like to see more results before the conclusion because Figure 4 shows that some of curves are not monotonic, which is counterintuitive, and that the behaviors of the curves highly depends on the data and methods.

- [Question (major)] Figure 4: Does this result include the randomness introduced by the choice of the training set samples? The broken yellow curve in the left panel looks intensely fluctuating in the small set region, and I guess this fluctuation comes from that kind of randomness.

- [Question (major)] In one-shot classification experiment (Table 3), how did the authors choose the single training sample? The performance should highly correlate with the one-shot training sample.

- [Comment] At the end of Section 4,
> These results further support our assumption that prompt tuning is more effective than full finetuning when only limited finetuning examples are available.

Doesn't this statement conflict with the Patch Camelyon result (green curves) in Figure 4?

- [Comment] Figure 5 should use log scales. Also, all figures including Figure 5 should be vector images.

- [Comment] In Section 5.2,
> Another possible explanation for why prompt tuning can achieve superior performance is that it can escape from local minima or saddle points compared to full finetuning, due to the additional dimensions introduced by the prompts.

This is clearly an overstatement (or a misuse of words). Local minima and saddle points are rigorously defined in a mathematical way. I guess what the authors mean here is if we can observe performance gain or not. However, strictly speaking, escaping form local minima or saddle points is not  a necessary nor sufficient condition of generalization in general settings. Although I understand some papers use these words interchangeably, and my comment may be a bit nitpicking, I would like to recommend that the authors modify the statement here. By the way, it will be a dramatic research if one theoretically proves that VPT in fact makes the network escape from local minima or saddle points.

- [Comment] In Section 5.3, the authors make two hypotheses. Is there any idea to validate them in an objective and qualitative manner?

### Questions
- [Question] The experiment is limited to Transformer-based models. Do you think all the results are also valid when we use CNNs?

- [Comment (major)] In Figure 4,
> In general, with the dataset increasing in size, the performance gap between FT and VPT becomes narrow.

I would like to see more results before the conclusion because Figure 4 shows that some of curves are not monotonic, which is counterintuitive, and that the behaviors of the curves highly depends on the data and methods.

### Summary
This paper mainly focuses on visual prompt tuning. The authors conduct extensive empirical study to illustrate when and why VPT performs better than vanilla finetuning. The experiment results lead to interesting conclusion with regard to the discrepancy of task objectives and data distributions. The authors further inspect the role of solving overfitting and optimization in two kinds of methods.

### Strengths
1. The experiment results are sufficient.
2. The idea of explaining VPT with the different role of additional prompt parameters and original pretrained parameters is interesting.

### Weaknesses
1. I suggest the authors reorganize the experiment results. The current ones are confusing since the Mixed and FT-then-PT are introduced in the later part of the paper while the corresponding results are shown before. Specifically, the introduction of 'Mixed' and 'FT-then-PT' training strategies in the results section, before a clear explanation of these methods, disrupts the logical flow. This makes it difficult to understand the motivation and context behind these experiments when they are first presented. A more structured approach would be to first introduce and justify these methods, then present the corresponding empirical results.
2. I wonder if prompt size is one of the tuned hyper-parameters. If so, it would be better to present the exact number of prompts used for each setting since different prompt size indicates different learning capacity. The paper should explicitly state whether the prompt size is a hyperparameter that is tuned for each dataset or task. If it is tuned, the specific prompt sizes used for each experiment should be reported, as this directly impacts the learning capacity and performance of the method. Without this information, it is difficult to assess the true effectiveness of the proposed approach.
3. In fact the original VPT has two variants, i.e. VPT-shallow and VPT-deep. It seems VPT-deep is adopted in this paper. I wonder if the same pattern holds for VPT-shallow too. The paper should clarify why VPT-deep was chosen as the primary method, and whether the conclusions drawn are consistent with VPT-shallow. If the same experiments were not conducted with VPT-shallow, the authors should acknowledge this limitation and discuss the potential implications for the generalizability of their findings.
4. It is noteworthy that VPT only performs better in half of all datasets of VTAB-1k Structured in one-shot setting as shown in Tab.4, which is different from results of other two sub-categories. This should be highlighted and illustrated in Sec.4.4. The paper should emphasize the inconsistent performance of VPT in the one-shot setting for the VTAB-1k Structured datasets. The fact that VPT only outperforms fine-tuning in half of these cases is a significant observation that warrants further discussion and analysis. The authors should explore potential reasons for this discrepancy, such as the nature of the structured data or the specific task objectives.
5. The current scope of this paper is ok. But it would be much greater if the authors could expand the study to prompt tuning in language models. While the paper focuses on visual prompt tuning, the authors should acknowledge the relevance of prompt tuning in language models and discuss potential avenues for future research in this area. This would broaden the impact of the paper and highlight the broader applicability of the insights gained from this study.
