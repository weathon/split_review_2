# Object-level Data Augmentation for Visual 3D Object Detection in Autonomous Driving

- Decision: Reject
- Scores: 6, 5, 6

## Abstract
Data augmentation plays an important role in visual-based 3D object detection. Existing detectors typically employ image/BEV-level data augmentation techniques, failing to utilize flexible object-level augmentations because of 2D-3D inconsistencies. This limitation hinders us from increasing the diversity of training data.  To alleviate this issue, we propose an object-level data augmentation approach that incorporates scene reconstruction and neural scene rendering. Specifically, we reconstruct the scene and objects by extracting image features from sequences and aligning them with associated LiDAR point clouds. This approach is intended to conduct the editing process within a 3D space, allowing for flexible object manipulation. Additionally, we introduce a neural scene renderer to project the edited 3D scene onto a specified camera plane and render it onto a 2D image. Combining with the scene reconstruction, it overcomes the challenges stemming from 2D/3D inconsistencies, enabling the generation of object-level augmented images with corresponding labels for model training. To validate the proposed method, we apply our method to two popular multi-camera detectors: PETRv2 and BEVFormer, consistently boosting the performance. Codes will be public.

### Rating Number

### Confidence
3: You are fairly confident in your assessment. It is possible that you did not understand some parts of the submission or that you are unfamiliar with some pieces of related work. Math/other details were not carefully checked.

### Summary
The authors explore and analyze the existing data augmentation methods for 3D object detection, and propose to adopt scene reconstruction and neural scene rendering to scale up the dataset. The experimental results on nuScenes, show the effectiveness of the proposed method.

### Strengths
The task of data augmentation for 3D object detection is popular and interesting in the 3D community. The authors propose to use scene reconstruction and neural scene rendering to enlarge the dataset and make it work on nuScenes.

### Weaknesses
1. Comparison with data augmentation SOTAs. Although the authors compared the proposed method with the vanilla Cut & Paste in terms of the performance. However, since Cut & Paste doesn't use any point cloud raw data, so to have a fair comparison, it would be interesting if the authors could show the performance comparison with LiDAR-based data augmentation methods, i.e., Tongetal.(2023). Specifically, a comparison with methods that directly manipulate point clouds or use point clouds as an intermediate representation for augmentation would be more relevant. This would help to understand the advantages and disadvantages of the proposed scene reconstruction and rendering approach compared to existing techniques that are more directly applicable to the 3D domain.

2. It is unclear to me how large the augmented dataset is compared with the original one. The lack of clarity on the scale of the augmented data makes it difficult to assess the practical impact of the proposed method. Knowing the exact number of augmented scenes or the ratio of augmented data to original data is crucial for evaluating the method's effectiveness and efficiency.

3. It would be interesting if the authors could show the detailed detection performance of 10 classes on the nuScenes. From my understanding, the proposed method is kind of sensitive to different objects with different sizes. Since the small-scale objects, like pedestrians and cyclists might only take a couple of pixels. A breakdown of performance by class would reveal if the method is equally effective across all object categories or if it introduces biases towards certain types of objects. This is especially important given the potential sensitivity to object size and the varying pixel representation of different classes.

### Summary
Visual 3D object detection is an important task in the 3D perception system. However, labeling 3D data is extremely expensive and the diversity of training data plays an important role in deep learning. To this end, this work proposes a rendering-based instance-level data augmentation method for image-based 3D detection. In particular, this method extracts image features from sequences and aligns them with associated LiDAR point clouds, and augments the objects in the 3D space. After that, a neural scene renderer is adapted to generate the 2D images with the augmented objects. The experiments on the nuScenes with two base detectors show the effectiveness of the proposed data augmentation strategy.

### Strengths
- The work is well-motivated. The diversity of training data plays an important role in deep learning, and conducting data augmentation is really hard for 3D detection due to the geometric consistency. Therefore, exploring effective 3D data augmentation methods is a meaningful topic.
- The experiments on nuScenes dataset show the effectiveness of the proposed method.

### Weaknesses
 - The overall data-augmentation process is complex, involving multiple additional data, such as point cloud, sample sequences, external renders, etc. Considering this, performance improvement is limited, maybe evaluating a smaller dataset, such as KITTI,  can better show the effectiveness of this data augmentation method.

- Besides, the computation cost will be inevitably increased. The cost of generating the new training samples should be reported.

- The authors only report the results on the nuScenes validation set, and the test set should also be presented.

- ROI-10D [1] also provides an instance-level data augmentation method for image-based 3D detection. Discussion and comparison should be included.

### Summary
In this paper, the authors try to address insufficient scene diversity for visual 3D object detection in autonomous driving. They propose an object-level data augmentation workflow, by reconstruction and synthesis. To do this,  they split and accumulated the foreground and background of the global pointcloud first. Then, they train the learnable point descriptors and the neural renderer to recover the original scene image. In the synthesis step, they perform object-level transformations on accumulated point clouds and utilize the trained renderer to synthesize augmented images and their labels.

### Strengths
The authors challenge the core problem of machine learning, i.e., the insufficient diversity of data samples. They try to generate more data samples by reconstruction and synthesis. They propose a *cell-based z-buffer* algorithm to remove the occluded points and solve the *bleeding problem*.  I think the proposed solution is simple and straightforward. Thus, I think the proposed approach is easily reproducible.

### Weaknesses
I have some concerns about the proposed method and experiment result:
1. Is there any safeguard to guarantee the augmented data is located in reasonable regions?
2. How does the algorithm control the appearance style of the added object? Is there a way to generate an unseen appearance from the training data set?
3. The PSNR of the synthesis image is <30 dB, which means the human eye distinguishes the synthesis image from the original image. It raises a question in my mind: does the quality of the synthesis data affect downstream tasks? An experiment that compares the results trained within the original image and the synthesis data is appreciated.
