# Understanding Unfairness via Training Concept Influence

- Scores: 5, 5, 6

## Abstract
Knowing the causes of a model's unfairness helps practitioners better understand their data and algorithms. This is an important yet relatively unexplored task. We look into this problem through the lens of the training data - one of the major sources of unfairness. We ask the following questions: how a model's fairness performance would change if, in its training data, some samples (1) were collected from a different (e.g. demographic) group, (2) were labeled differently, or (3) some features were changed? In other words, we quantify the fairness influence of training samples by counterfactually changing samples based on predefined concepts, i.e. data attributes such as features,  labels, or sensitive attributes. To calculate a training sample's influence on the model's unfairness w.r.t a concept, we first generate counterfactual samples based on the concept, i.e. the counterfactual versions of the sample if the concept were changed. We then calculate the resulting impact on the unfairness, via influence function, if the counterfactual samples were used in training. Our framework not only helps practitioners understand the observed unfairness and repair their training data, but also leads to many other applications, e.g. detecting mislabeling, fixing imbalanced representations, and detecting poisoning attacks.

### Summary
This paper introduces CIF (concept influence for fairness) as a framework to identify potential fairness problems in training data when looking at 1) sensitive attributes 2) features and 3) labels by overriding concepts in each case. The authors provide details on how to change concepts, and then how to define the influence of those concept changes. The authors provide experimental results.

### Strengths
The paper provides a framework that is very flexible to changing technologies.

### Weaknesses
This paper seems incremental in its approach. For example, the authors state that the effectiveness of their solution depends on finding a proper transform() which is their work's focus. The then proposed transforms in "generating counterfactual samples" use techniques not novel to this paper and pulled from a number of different sources. Although this framework is generally useful, I don't believe it provides enough novelty for this conference. The core idea of using concept influence to analyze fairness is interesting, but the implementation relies heavily on existing methods such as influence functions and W-GANs, without significant modification or theoretical advancement. The paper lacks a clear demonstration of how these existing techniques are adapted in a non-trivial way to address the specific challenges of fairness analysis. The connection between the proposed framework and the observed fairness issues remains somewhat superficial, as the paper doesn't delve into the underlying mechanisms that cause fairness problems based on the concept influence scores. The experimental results, while present, do not convincingly show the superiority or unique advantages of this framework over simpler, existing methods.

### Questions
Could the authors provide more details on the "overriding X" experiment w.r.t each of the datasets used. What kind of features where chosen in these cases?

Could the authors please comment on novelty from above?

### Summary
This paper introduces tools from the influence function literature to quantify algorithmic fairness.

### Strengths
See below for contextual discussion of strengths.

### Weaknesses
This paper uses influence functions to quantify fairness. The topic is one of the paper's strengths; although influence functions and counterfactual fairness models are well-established, the connection between the two is (to my knowledge) less developed. At least for me, for a paper combining two well-worn topics, it is important that the paper does so in an exceptionally clear or general way. The paper has potential for doing so but may be somewhat lacking in its current framing (at least according to my current understanding of the paper and contextual literature). For example, much of the discussion seems to assume a relatively limited class of ML problems (e.g., binary classification). Also, the relationship between ''Concepts'' and ''Fairness'' could (in my view) use a clearer elaboration. ''Transforming the sample based on certain concepts of training data'' seems far more general (this could concern any number of modifications). This framing somewhat complicates (at least this readers') analysis of the paper. I would consider revisions that streamline some of this. The introduction of the override operator also wasn't particularly obvious to me (e.g., ''override() operator counterfactually sets the value of the concept variable to a different c0.'' sounds like the do() operation, although I see an attempt to distinguish).

Overall, I see promise in the paper, but (at least in my opinion), certain limitations exist in terms of clarity. Also, the methods don't seem to have a comparison benchmark (even a naive one) which would help readers understand the contribution over any existing approaches in this context. 

A few more focused comments. 

(1) The paper uses the term ''fairness'' throughout. It would be helpful to provide an explicit definition early on. At times, it seems like the term is more qualitative (e.g., ''Influence Functions for Fairness''; ''They can all contribute to unfairness''). At other times, the term seems to be in some sense quantitative (i.e., ''fairness can improve''; ''fairness becomes worse''). Although the meaning may be clear to readers embedded in the fair ML literature, I think it would help to fix ideas early on for readers. Having said that, what constitutes ''fair'' (in at least some of its meanings) is, of course, subject to social values. 

(2) It could help to discuss some of the challenges of computing the Hessian vector product (e.g., in high dimensions) and to emphasize why bypassing the Hessian calculation via the HVP can be useful. Would the influence function approach break down, e.g., when the parameter number ranges in the billions? More generally, based on the paper's existing framing, I had a hard time understanding some of its limitations, which are not particularly emphasized in the paper (the ''Conclusions and Limitations'' section is 10 lines long.)

### Questions
(1) Could the authors clarify what is meant by, ''we show that the influence function often identifies the data from the majority group and recommends them to be changed to the minority group''? Presumably, this refers to re-weighting of the training data, but it reads almost like the direct changing/manipulation of observed data values. 

(2) Do all of the performance metrics have definitions in the paper? (I don't see one, for example, for the ''Equality of Odds'' metric). If the metrics could be compiled into a table with equations, this reader may have a better understanding of them and the results.

### Summary
This paper aims to identify the causes of a model’s unfairness by leveraging the method of influence function. Instead of only detecting the training samples that induce unfairness directly and passively, the article takes a step further and tries actively to replace the “high-influence/biased” samples with new counterfactual samples generated by designing an algorithm. This solution is interesting and intuitive. In addition, the framework proposed in this paper is general and has the potential to be applied to various new scenarios.

### Strengths
1. this paper is well-written; 
2. the topic is both intriguing and of practical significance.
3. the main idea is intuitive and easy to understand; 
4. the algorithm design is reasonable.

### Weaknesses
1. There are no theoretical guarantees about the methods used to generate counterfactual samples.

### Questions
I do not have any major concerns about this work in technical details or presentation.
