# COLLIE: Systematic Construction of Constrained Text Generation Tasks

- Decision: Accept
- Scores: 1, 6, 8, 6

## Abstract
Text generation under constraints have seen increasing interests in natural language processing, especially with the rapidly improving capabilities of large language models. However, existing benchmarks for constrained generation usually focus on fixed constraint types (e.g.\,generate a sentence containing certain words) that have proved to be easy for state-of-the-art models like GPT-4. We present \frameworkname{}, a grammar-based framework that allows the specification of rich, compositional constraints with diverse generation levels (word, sentence, paragraph, passage) and modeling challenges (e.g.\,language understanding, logical reasoning, counting, semantic planning). We also develop tools for automatic extraction of task instances given a constraint structure and a raw text corpus. Using \frameworkname{}, we compile the \datasetname{} dataset with \datasetsize{} instances comprising 13 constraint structures. We perform systematic experiments across five state-of-the-art instruction-tuned language models and analyze their performances to reveal shortcomings. \frameworkname{} is designed to be extensible and lightweight, and we hope the community finds it useful to develop more complex constraints and evaluations in the future.

### Summary
This paper introduces a grammar based framework called COLLIE for constrained text generation at varying levels of specifications. Additionally it proposes a development tool for automated extraction of task instances given a constraint structure and text corpus. Furthermore, the paper constructs a dataset from three sources - Wikipedia, CCNews, and Project Gutenberg using the previously mentioned framework and calls it COLLIE-v1. The resultant dataset COLLIE-v1 is constructed using manually crafted constraints and is used to analyze LLM performances as well as highlight their shortcomings. The paper focuses on five of the most prominent LLMs, namely GPT-3.5,GPT-4,PaLM, Vicuna-7B and Alpaca-7B.

Interestingly, the COLLIE framework enables flexible, extensible and dynamic constraint construction that can co-evolve with the upcoming LLMs and help in understanding their shortcomings to better solve them.

COLLIE can thus help in not only evaluating and benchmarking LLMs but also help in constraint text generation independently.

### Strengths
1. Well written paper with evaluation on competitive LLM baselines.
    
2. Combination of rule based and neural based generation enables NLP grounded generations
    
3. Open-sourcing of code and the related dataset for promoting further research.
    
4. Comprehensive analysis to highlight the shortcoming of current LLMs that needs to be addressed.

### Weaknesses
1. Some important details for instruction rendering should be moved to the main paper.
    
2. The paper mentions that the technique can be used for constraining words, word blacklisting, however a qualitative analysis is missing for the same in the current version.

### Questions
Section 5: Performance enhancement through feedback - It might help to list down the details of how the feedback is being used.

### Confidence
3: You are fairly confident in your assessment. It is possible that you did not understand some parts of the submission or that you are unfamiliar with some pieces of related work. Math/other details were not carefully checked.

### Summary
The authors propose a framework to automatically extract samples from large unlabeled text corpora for constrained text generation. Specifically, they manually craft rules/constraints and find satisfying texts as references. For example, a constraint can be "the third last word being mankind". They then evaluate off-the-shelf LLMs on this extracted dataset.

### Strengths
1. The authors evaluated different off-the-shelf LLMs and showed that they don't fully solve this task.

### Weaknesses
1. The idea is not very novel, and similar ideas have already been explored. For example, [1] also constructed a dataset using similar constraints for instruction fine-tuning.
2. The dataset may not be very useful. Specifically, because the rules are too vague/arbitrary, the extracted ground truth is not useful for the evaluation process: the authors only use them for comparing fluency. In addition, since the rules can be arbitrarily designed, this compiled dataset does not hold much value, because many similar datasets can be compiled with different engineering details.

### Questions
In the limitations, the authors mentioned potential problems with filtering and processing functions. Could the authors elaborate on what issues might exist for the extraction process?

### Summary
This paper presents a framework, COLLIE, that allows researchers to build constrained text generation benchmark using different combinations of generation levels and modeling challenges (tasks), and a benchmark, COLLIE-v1, which is constructed using that framework and consists of 20,80 data instances comprising 13 structures.
The value of this paper lies in that it provides a method which allows future work to construct data of their interest in a scalable manner, and the analyses that the this paper conducts provide insights to researchers who are focusing on developing LLMs with better logical, reasoning, and compositional capacities.

### Strengths
1. This paper provides a method which allows future work to construct data of their interest in a scalable manner.
2. The analyses that the this paper conducts provide insights to researchers who are focusing on developing LLMs with better logical, reasoning, and compositional capacities.
3. This paper is generally well-written and easy to follow.

### Weaknesses
There is no great weaknesses that I can find - but there is a minor one:

Although I understand that the authors are focusing on more "basic" units, such as tokens, sentence, etc, so this paper can be more practical and useful for downstream applications, such as pretraining and evaluating LLMs, most of current work on constrained text generation seem to focus on text summarization, including controllable text summarization (e.g., MACSum Zhang et al, 2023). However this paper does not mention any of this, and does not discuss any potential that the proposed method can be applied to those constrained text generation (summarization) tasks. I personally suggest that the authors provide some discussion or explain on this issue.

### Summary
The authors propose COLLIE, a grammar-based framework for probing the performances of LLMs on constrained text generation tasks. COLLIE realizes the constraints on different levels (word, paragraph, passage) and imposes requirements on various aspects, e.g., character count, word count, and positions of a specific text. Experiments are conducted on instructions built from three sources and on various strong LLMs (GPTs, PaLMs, and etc.). The results suggest that GPT-4 generally outperforms other compared models but still performs poorly on a subset of the tasks. 

Overall, while the concept of this task is simple, the challenges posed to existing LLMs are non-trivial, clearly pointing out the incapabilities of these models. I believe COLLIE has the potential to drive further developments of existing models on more nuanced tasks.

### Strengths
* The paper is well-written and easy-to-understand.
* COLLIE is a conceptually simple but scientifically non-trivial method, and is beneficial to further development of LLMs.
* The experiments and analyses are comprehensive, including evaluations on current state-of-the-art models.
* The authors also provide complementary code which helps verify their approach.

### Weaknesses
I have one question regarding to the instructions obtained from different sources. Since the grammar is translated into natural language instruction to prompt the model, how do the instructions from different source datasets differ from one another?
