# MaSS: Multi-attribute Selective Suppression for Utility-preserving Data Transformation from an Information-theoretic Perspective

- Decision: Reject
- Scores: 3, 6, 6, 6

## Abstract
The growing richness of large-scale datasets has been crucial in driving 
the rapid advancement and wide adoption of machine learning technologies. 
The massive collection and usage of data, however,
pose an increasing risk for people's private and sensitive information
due to either inadvertent mishandling or malicious exploitation.
Besides legislative solutions,
many technical approaches have been proposed towards data privacy protection.
However, they bear various limitations such as leading to degraded data availability and utility, 
or relying on heuristics and lacking solid theoretical bases.
To overcome these limitations,
we propose a formal information-theoretic definition for this utility-preserving privacy protection problem,
and design a data-driven learnable data transformation framework
that is capable of selectively suppressing sensitive attributes from target datasets 
while preserving the other useful attributes,
regardless of whether or not they are known in advance or explicitly annotated for preservation.
We provide rigorous theoretical analyses on the operational bounds for our framework,
and carry out comprehensive experimental evaluations using datasets of a variety of modalities,
including facial images, voice audio clips, and human activity motion sensor signals.
Results demonstrate the effectiveness and generalizability of our method under various configurations on a multitude of tasks.

### Summary
The paper proposes a method for learning censored data transformations providing guarantees on the quantity of information about both annotated and unannotated features preserved by said transformations. The authors motivate the method using an information-theoretic calculus and establish operational bounds on the entailed objective. Practically, censoring of the designated sensitive attributes is achieved through a standard (margin-based) adversarial information-minimisation (infomin) procedure; useful annotated and unannotated information is preserved through the use of supervised and contrastive learning, respectively. The authors conduct experiments on datasets covering a range of modalities in AudioMNIST, Motion Sense, and Adience and demonstrate favourable performance of their method relative to the baseline suite.

### Strengths
- Figures and tables are well-put-together; Figures 1 and 2 illustrate the problem setup and methodological pipeline, respectively, in an easily digestible manner -- one can understand the essence of the method based on its illustration alone.
- Experiments cover a good range of datasets and configurations.
- Proofs and implications of the consequent theoretical statements are easy to follow.
- The problem under consideration is well-motivated and clearly formulated.
- Reasonable assortment of baseline methods and strong empirical performance of the proposed method relative to these. Experimental setups are described with clarity.
- Good contextualization w.r.t. prior work, with clear delineation of the subtle but differentiating qualities of the current work.

### Weaknesses
 - The paper is limited in terms of novelty. The main contribution of the paper seems to be in its proposal to preserve of *unannotated* features using a self-supervised-learning objective yet this idea of maximising $\mathcal{I}(X; \tilde{X})$, understanding $\tilde{X}$ to be some representation generally, is certainly not novel in and of itself (vide Madras et al., 2018 in the context of the adjacent field of fair-representation learning); the method chosen used to accomplish this maximisation seems, to me, largely incidental -- one can simply view the contrastive loss as an alternative reconstruction loss.
- The paper proposes learning a data transformation instead of a representation but the codomain of the transformation is another seemingly incidental factor given that interpretability does not appear to be a major concern, based on the narrative and analysis; indeed, in order to compute the contrastive learning objective in a space in which distances are meaningful, the transformed and original samples ultimately have to be embedded in such a representation anyway. The learning of a data transformation instead of a low-dimensional representation leads to a method that is more complicated than seemingly need be, and, moreover, is a design choice that comes at a steep computational cost -- computing all losses in representation space would be much more efficient though there may be some sound theoretical barrier to do doing so.
- The mathematical formalism is confusing and, at times, unrigorous. Random variables and their realisations are seemingly conflated without reference to the abuse: mutual information, $\mathcal{I}(\cdot; \cdot)$ is defined between pairs of random variables, not their empirical counterparts. While there is an argument to be made that such overloading is conventional and remedied by the context, I don't think that the latter is entirely satisifed here, especially with their being no express mention of this overloading being adopted throughout the paper.
- While their meaning, as analogues of $X_p$ and $X_n$, respectively, can be easily inferred, $F_p$ and $F_n$, appearing in Eq.17, seem to be missing explicit definitions. The explanation given in Sec. 4.4,both textually and notationally, is generally muddled considering that the method amounts to SimCLR with the original and transformed samples acting as anchors and positive pairs.
- Why compute cross-entropy terms w.r.t. the estimates of $P(U_i|X)$ and $P(S_i|X)$ as opposed to simply using the (degenerate ground-truth distribution (the annotations) used in the fitting of those estimates? There may be good reason for it but there should clear explanation given for why this choice is unprincipled, should that indeed be the case.
- The quality of the writing, in terms of clarity and structure, could generally do with improvement.
- Lack of ablation studies, such as those investigating the influence of the loss prefactor.
- No discussion of the practical challenges entailed by adversarial infomin (vide Song and Shmatikov, 2021, for instance).

### Summary
This paper proposes an information theorem based multi-attribute selective suppression (MaSS) to solve the problem of highlighting the utility attributes while suppressing the private attributes. The introduced problem is interesting and important, as privacy becomes a central concern for many applications. The paper presents a clear pipeline leveraging three effort stream lines: (1) sensitive attribute suppression, (2) annotated useful attribute preservation and (3) unannotated useful attribute preservation. The optimization are then jointly optimized.

### Strengths
1. The paper study into an interesting and practical problem by discussing the limitations and compare to the literature approaches, providing a sufficient background for the problem study.

2. The paper provides a theoretical analysis from the information theory perspective, showing the relationship between utility and sensitive attributes.

3. The paper presents a clear and tractable learning scheme to achieve the three stream lines.

4. There are extensive experimental comparison against the representative literature methods and some state-of-the-arts. Consistently advantageous results demonstrate the method’s effectiveness.

### Weaknesses
1. For the sensitive attribute suppression, the objective is to minimize the the expectation of the entropy between P(Si|x) and P_phi(Si|X’). Drawing connection to adversarial learning, it tries to push P_phi(Si|x’) close to P(Si|x) by pushing the discriminator cannot tell the difference between the two.

Firstly, the paper lacks the interpretation of their proposed method, and drawing the connection to the literature method, e.g., adversarial learning. It would be good the authors can conduct an in-depth analysis comparing the literature to the proposal in this paper, and further highlight the method’s novelty. Specifically, the current description does not clearly differentiate the proposed approach from a standard adversarial training setup. The paper should clarify how the use of entropy minimization differs from, for example, minimizing a cross-entropy loss in a discriminator network, and whether this choice offers any theoretical advantages or practical benefits in terms of convergence or performance. Furthermore, the connection to information theory needs to be more explicit. While the paper mentions information theory, it does not elaborate on how the specific choice of entropy minimization, as opposed to other information-theoretic measures, contributes to the overall goal of sensitive attribute suppression.

2. For unannotated useful attribute, depending on the definition of the problem, the setting will be different from the other method. In the paper of experiments, the authors mention “ALR, BDQ and PPDAR overlook the preservation of unannotated useful attributes”.

It could be that those methods, from their problem definition and setting, they do not consider so termed “unannotated useful attributes” into their framework. But one cannot say it is the limitation or fault of those methods. In the most fair way, because of setting difference, this paper should compare to only those considering “unannotated useful attributes”. Please carefully phrase the comparison to other methods.

3. Still, for those methods that are sharing exactly the same setting, e.g., GAP and MSDA, from technical frame design, what is the difference? I noticed there is some slight comparison, e.g., arguing that some of the methods lack theoretical analysis. This is the advantage of this paper. But other than that, if there is an empirical design that is exactly the same as this paper, this paper will only go for the theoretical contribution. The paper needs to provide a more detailed comparison of the technical differences, particularly in the objective functions and optimization procedures. A deeper dive into how the contrastive learning loss differs from the MSE reconstruction loss used in GAP and MSDA is needed. It is not enough to state that contrastive learning is more general; the authors must demonstrate why it is superior in this specific context. What are the potential failure modes of MSE reconstruction that contrastive learning avoids? What are the trade-offs between the two approaches, and how do these trade-offs manifest in practice?

### Summary
The paper presents a novel approach, referred to as MASS (Multi-Attribute Selective Suppression), which addresses the challenge of privacy protection in the context of large-scale datasets used for machine learning. It introduces a formal information-theoretic definition for utility-preserving privacy protection and offers a data-driven, learnable data transformation framework. This framework enables the selective suppression of sensitive attributes while preserving other useful attributes, regardless of whether they are known in advance or explicitly annotated. The paper includes rigorous theoretical analyses of the operational bounds of the proposed framework and conducts extensive experimental evaluations across diverse modalities, such as facial images, voice audio clips, and motion sensor signals. The results demonstrate the effectiveness and generalizability of MASS across different tasks and configurations.

### Strengths
1. One of the notable strengths of this paper is the introduction of a formal information-theoretic definition for utility-preserving privacy protection. This theoretical foundation provides a solid framework for addressing privacy concerns in large-scale datasets, contributing to the theoretical underpinning of data privacy solutions.

2. The proposal of a data-driven learnable data transformation framework is innovative. This approach allows for the selective suppression of sensitive attributes, enhancing privacy protection while preserving the utility of the data. 

3. The comprehensive experimental evaluations across various data modalities, including facial images, voice audio clips, and motion sensor signals, highlight the generalizability of the MASS framework. This breadth of experimentation underlines its versatility and applicability to a wide range of real-world scenarios.

### Weaknesses
1. The paper introduces an interesting concept in Theorem 3.1, highlighting the importance of mutual information constraints 'm' and 'n' in the context of privacy and utility trade-offs. However, it is essential to note that the experiments lack a corresponding exploration of these constraints. These constraints likely play a pivotal role in balancing sensitive attribute accuracy and useful attribute accuracy. The reported experimental results suggest that MaSS might not simultaneously achieve the best performance for both types of attributes. Therefore, it is recommended to conduct experiments with varying constraints to gain a deeper understanding of their impact, specifically examining how different values of 'm' affect the trade-off between sensitive attribute suppression and useful attribute preservation, and whether there exist optimal settings for different data modalities or tasks.

2. The theoretical argument presented in Theorem 3.2 may raise some questions. Specifically, the relevance of unannotated useful attributes to the tasks is highlighted, which could vary across different scenarios. The paper should address this issue and provide an ablation study of the contrastive learning module to support the claims made in Theorem 3.2. This would provide stronger evidence and clarity regarding the relationship between learned attributes and sensitive attributes. It is unclear how the contrastive loss ensures the preservation of useful unannotated attributes, and an ablation study would help to isolate the contribution of this component.

3. Clarification is needed on how the positive and negative samples for the InfoNCE loss are determined. Figure 3 suggests that both positive and negative samples come from the transformed data X', but the paper should explain how these samples are chosen, given that the anchor sample is the original data X. The specific mechanism for selecting negative samples, and how this selection impacts the learning of the transformation, needs to be elaborated.

4. Regarding the evaluation of sensitive attribute accuracy, it appears that the accuracy of the adversarial classifier is used. It is recommended to consider the approach of training a classifier from scratch on the transformed data, similar to the methodology employed for calculating useful attribute accuracy. This would provide a more direct measure of the information leakage about sensitive attributes in the transformed data.

5. To provide a more comprehensive assessment of the proposed method, the paper should include comparisons with recent baselines, such as SPAct (CVPR 2022 [1]). A direct comparison would help to contextualize the performance of the proposed method relative to existing state-of-the-art techniques.

6. The topic of concept removal for generative models, while not a central focus, could be related to this paper's context. It is suggested to discuss concept removal in the related works section to provide a broader perspective on the field and to highlight the paper's contributions in relation to existing research. The connection between the proposed method and existing techniques for concept removal in generative models should be clarified.

### Summary
This paper proposes a framework called MASS (Multi-Attribute Selective Suppression) for privacy-preserving data transformation that selectively suppresses sensitive attributes while preserving useful ones. The authors provide a formal definition of privacy protection and an information-theoretic perspective on the problem. They also present a data-driven approach that uses a combination of supervised and unsupervised learning to identify sensitive attributes and suppress them while preserving useful ones. The authors provide rigorous theoretical analyses and comprehensive experimental evaluations that demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach. The contributions of this paper include a formal definition of privacy protection, a data-driven framework for privacy-preserving data transformation, and a comprehensive evaluation of the proposed approach against several baseline methods using multiple datasets of varying modalities.

### Strengths
S1. In terms of originality, the paper introduces a novel approach for protecting unannotated attributes in datasets. While previous works have focused on protecting annotated attributes or using heuristics, the paper proposes a data-driven learnable data transformation framework called MaSS (Multi-Attribute Selective Suppression) that can selectively suppress sensitive attributes while preserving other useful attributes, regardless of whether they are known in advance or explicitly annotated. This approach is unique and addresses a gap in the existing literature.
S2. The quality of the paper is high, as it provides rigorous theoretical analyses of the operational bounds of the proposed framework. The authors derive mathematical formulations and provide proofs for the theorems presented in the paper [5, 7]. This demonstrates a strong understanding of the underlying principles and ensures the reliability of the proposed methods.
S3. The clarity of the paper is commendable. The authors provide clear explanations of the problem formulation, the proposed techniques, and the evaluation methodology. The paper is well-structured, making it easy for readers to follow the flow of ideas. Additionally, the authors provide visualizations and tables to support their findings.

### Weaknesses
W1. The dataset lacks a detailed description. It would also be good to have a table that describes the size of the dataset along with some other information that would give the reader a clearer picture of the dataset.
W2. All six methods of experimental comparison rely on adversarially training a sensitive attribute inference model and lack the ability to compare state-of-the-art dp-based methods (e.g. "Mingxuan Sun, Qing Wang, Zicheng Liu: Human Action Image Generation with Differential Privacy. ICME 2020: 1-6"). The reliance on adversarial training for evaluation makes it difficult to assess the true privacy guarantees of the proposed method, as it is only evaluated against a specific type of attack. Furthermore, the absence of comparisons with differential privacy methods, which offer provable privacy guarantees, is a significant limitation.
W3. Lack of comparison with a state-of-the-art method ("Li M, Xu X, Fan H, et al. STPrivacy: Spatio-Temporal Privacy-Preserving Action Recognition[C]//Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF International Conference on Computer Vision. 2023: 5106-5115.") which limits the assessment of the proposed method's performance against the current state-of-the-art in privacy-preserving data transformation.

### Questions
The authors need provide more detailed explanations and justifications for their proposed techniques. why contrastive learning is suitable for protecting unannotated attributes and how it ensures the predictability of annotated attributes? Additionally, the authors could consider providing more detailed explanations of the loss functions used in their method, such as the InfoNCE Contrastive Learning Loss.
