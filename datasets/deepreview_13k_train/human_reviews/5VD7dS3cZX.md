# Rethinking the Solution to Curse of Dimensionality on Randomized Smoothing

- Decision: Reject
- Scores: 5, 5, 8, 1

## Abstract
Randomized Smoothing (RS) is currently a scalable certified defense method providing robustness certification against adversarial examples. 
Although significant progress has been achieved in providing defenses against $\ell_p$ adversaries,
early investigations found that RS suffers from the curse of dimensionality, indicating that the robustness guarantee offered by RS decays significantly with increasing input data dimension.
Double Sampling Randomized Smoothing (DSRS) is the state-of-the-art method that provides a theoretical solution to the curse of dimensionality under concentration assumptions on the base classifier.
However, we speculate the solution to the curse of dimensionality can be deepened from the perspective of the smoothing distribution.
In this work, we further address the curse of dimensionality by theoretically showing that some Exponential General Gaussian (EGG) distributions with the exponent $\eta$ can provide $\Omega(\sqrt{d})$ lower bounds for the $\ell_2$ certified radius with tighter constant factors than DSRS.
Our theoretical analysis shows that the lower bound improves with monotonically decreasing $\eta \in (0,2)$. Intriguingly, we observe a contrary phenomenon that EGG provides greater certified radii at larger $\eta$, on real-world tasks. 
Further investigations show these discoveries are not contradictory, which are in essence dependent on whether the assumption in DSRS absolutely holds. 
Our experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that EGG distributions bring significant improvements for point-to-point certified accuracy, up to 4\%-6\% on ImageNet.
Furthermore, we also report the performance of Exponential Standard Gaussian (ESG) distributions on DSRS.

### Summary
This work extends double sampling randomized smoothing (DSRS) to smooth with exponential general Gaussian (EGG) and exponential standard Gaussian (ESG) distributions. The authors derive certified robust radii for their proposed methods, and experimentally show that the performance of their methods surpass that of standard DSRS on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet.

### Strengths
1. The Introduction is concise and motivates the problem well, and the contributions are clearly outlined.
2. The Experiments are thorough.
3. The Preliminaries section provides a nice concise introduction to the formalisms at hand.
4. The theoretical results (namely, Theorems 1 and 2) appear to be novel.
5. The proposed method's performance (in terms of certified radii) appears to meet/exceed prior state-of-the-art.

### Weaknesses
1. What do you mean by "point-to-point certified accuracy" in the Abstract? This terminology may be unclear to the reader, so I suggest replacing it or clarifying what it means.
2. "We let $\sigma_s$ and $\sigma_g$ be the substitution variances of EGG and ESG, respectively." I think you mean "...variances of ESG and EGG, respectfully."
3. "We let... be the probability density functions (PDFs) of EGG and ESG, respectively." I think you mean "... of ESG and EGG, respectfully."
4. "...our theoretical analysis shows EGG distributions can be prospective in providing much tighter lower bounds..." What do you mean by prospective? I think this sentence needs rewriting.
5. Why is $\eta$ restricted to be in a finite set in Theorem 1? Why is $d-2k$ restricted to be less than 30? I don't see where the number 30 appears in the proof of Lemma C.3 at all.
6. When introducing DSRS in Section 3, the values of $A,B$ are somewhat glossed over, leaving the reader to wonder what they are and where they come from. You mention that you can estimate them through Monte Carlo sampling, but no formulas are given to perform those estimates. How are $A$ and $B$ defined mathematically? Also, you state "In a nutshell, we find the maximum $\lVert\delta\rVert_2$ that makes the worst probability...". This is somewhat vague. Are you saying that you maximize over $\delta$ in an "outer-maximization" after solving the minimization (4)? In other words, it would be good to clarify how exactly the certified radius of DSRS is defined mathematically, and how that definition relates to (4).
7. It looks like your statement of Lemma C.3 should be "at labeled example $(x_0,y_0)$", not just "at input $x_0$".
8. The way Theorem 2 is stated, it does not appear that you are solving the dual problem (8), but rather giving specific formulas for the objective and constraints based on specific EGG density functions. If this is indeed the case, then you should re-word your descriptions to be more accurate (i.e., do not call your result a closed-form solution to the optimization problem). How are you actually solving the dual in practice (for the dual variables $\nu_1,\nu_2$)? This should be made more clear to the reader.
8. Overall, the paper is a bit hard to follow at times, as some of the language is cryptic or vague.

### Summary
This work conducted some theoretical study on the lower bound of $\ell_2$ certified radius with a tighter constant, compared to the previous work DSRS. The experiments results verified the theory in some cases.

### Strengths
1. This work contains some theoretical finding and the corresponding empirical experiments to verify these finding.
2. The paper is easy to follow.

### Weaknesses
1. As the title already suggested, the paper is mainly to study the certified radius in high dimensional space. Therefore, making the constant tighter is not of significant interest for research purposes because the dominate term is always the dimension $d$. Making the order of $d$ smaller is definitely of interest. While the authors claim to investigate the effect of the exponent $\eta$ on the constant factor, the core issue remains that the improvement is limited by the $\sqrt{d}$ term. The theoretical contribution, therefore, feels incremental rather than transformative for high-dimensional settings.
2. The author needs to include the variance for each experiments. By theory, EGG distribution should yield certified accuracy no smaller than DSRS. However, EGG has smaller certified accuracy in some cases in Table 2, which suggest there is a variance issue. So it's good to report variance. Specifically, the lack of reported variance makes it difficult to assess the statistical significance of the observed differences, particularly when the improvements are marginal. It is crucial to understand whether the observed differences are due to the method itself or simply due to random fluctuations in the experimental setup.
3. Marginal improvement: for most of the cases in Table 2, the improvement is no larger than 0.5%. This coincides with the intuition mentioned in weakness 1: making the constant tighter in high dimensional space will only yield incremental improvement.

### Questions
Minor:
1. It's better to write Neyman-Pearson Lemma instead of NP lemma, as NP can represent many terms.
2. In theorem 1, "let d be a sufficient(ly) large input dimension..."
3. In theorem 1, are the $\eta$ in P and Q the same? It also seems surprised to me that the lower bound doesn't depend on $k$ and $\eta$. This means any values of $k$ and $\eta$ will lead to the same lower bound.

### Summary
The paper extends the DSRS framework to a family of distributions called the Exponential General Gaussian (EGG) distributions. Assuming Li et al.'s concentration condition, the authors show that the proposed framework is capable of producing better certified radii (in the constant factor). Furthermore, the authors show that for stronger concentration assumptions, the proposed method can produce polynomially better certified radii. The authors also provide a truncated version of the distributions for the additional distribution in the DSRS framework and give an algorithm to solve the optimization problem to compute the certified radii under the extended framework. Finally, the authors show the empirical advantage of the proposed method on real-life datasets, CIFAR10 and Imagenet.

### Strengths
- The suggested framework extends the DSRS framework to a larger family of distributions that can provide theoretically better bounds (better in the constant multiplier) under Li et al.'s concentration assumption. The paper also proposes a more general concentration assumption under which the proposed distributions can polynomially better certified radii.
- The proposed method is able to provide better certified accuracy than the current state-of-the-art method on both CIFAR10 and Imagenet datasets. At larger radii, the certified accuracy on Imagenet beats the current SOTA by 4-6%.

### Weaknesses
 - The empirical performance on the CIFAR10 dataset is only marginally better than the current SOTA. It is not clear why this happens.



### Questions
Please check the weaknesses section.

Typos
- When introducing the PDFs, I think you wanna say "We let $S(\sigma, \eta)$ and $G(\sigma, \eta, k)$ be the probability density functions (PDFs) of ESG and EGG, respectively". Currently, the ordering is wrong.
- Similarly for substitution variances, "We let $\sigma_s$ and $\sigma_g$ be the substitution variances of ESG and EGG, respectively"

### Summary
This work is a follow-up work of Li et al., Double sampling randomized smoothing, in ICML 2022. Compared to the original randomized smoothing, DSRS leverages another random smoothing distribution $Q$, which could improve the certified radius of randomized smoothing. The main novelty of this work is using the "exponential general Gaussian" (EGG) distribution as $Q$, which compared to standard Gaussian changes the exponent from 2 to $\eta$. The authors claim that this can further improve the certified radius of DSRS.

### Strengths
N/A

### Weaknesses
I recommend rejecting this submission, because (a) this submission in a very large part is essentially the same as Li et al. (2022); (b) there are fundamental errors in the theoretical analysis as well as the experiments.

## (a) Comparing to Li et al. (2022)
Compared to Li et al. published in ICML 2022, the only novelty of this submission seems to be the EGG distribution and related theoretical analysis and empirical verification. The theoretical part, however, is almost the same as Li et al. (2022). Specifically, Theorem 1 focuses on the case where $\eta = 2$, and this statement is the exact same statement as Theorem 2 in Li et al. (2022). Note that the EGG distribution with $\eta = 2$ is equivalent to the generalized Gaussian distribution used in Table 1 of Li et al. (2022). Although this submission does cite Li et al. (2022), its writing seems to claim that Theorem 1 is a novel result, which is definitely false. In fact, the proof of Theorem 1 is essentially the same as Li et al. (2022), Theorem 2:
- Lemma C.1/C.2 (this work) = Proposition F.1 (Li et al.). The only difference is $\eta$, which in my opinion adds almost no additional difficulty to the proof. 
- Lemma C.3 (this work) = Lemma F.2 (Li et al.). Only difference is $\eta$.
- Lemma C.4 (this work) = Lemma F.3 (Li et al.). Only difference is $\eta$.
- And so on.

Moreover, Section 4.3 is almost the same as Section 5 in Li et al. (2022), except for $\eta$.

Overall, I don't see any significant difference between this submission before Section 5 and Li et al. (2022), except for $\eta$. The proofs and the algorithms are all essentially the same.

## (b) Does $\eta$ really work? No.
I have pointed out that the only novelty of this submission is $\eta$, so does $\eta$ really break the curse of dimensionality as the authors claim? I don't think so, and I think that there are two fundamental errors:

Theoretically, in Theorem 4 the authors proved an $\Omega(d^{1/\eta})$ lower bound of the certified radius, and claim that this bound gets larger as $\eta$ gets smaller. The problem is that when $\eta$ becomes smaller, then the premise of this result also becomes stronger. Specifically, with the same $\sigma$ and $p$, the $(\sigma, p, \eta)$-concentration assumption is stronger as $\eta$ becomes smaller. So of course with a stronger assumption, the certified radius will become larger. And it seems to me that the authors are aware that $\eta$ does not make the bound tighter, as they mentioned at the top of page 6 as well as in Eqn. (54) in Theorem 4. This even baffles me more why the authors would claim that EGG could lead to "much tighter constant factors" (in the first contributioin).

Empirically, Table 2, if it is correct, shows that EGG only with $\eta = 8.0$ has a very marginal improvement over DSRS. However, before Theorem 1, the authors wrote "all EGG with $\eta \in (0,2)$ have the potential to break the curse", which is not verified by Table 2, and seems to contradict with $\eta = 8.0$ in the experiments.

In conclusion, this work in a very large part is the same as a prior work, its claims are quite misleading, and it contains fundamental errors. Thus, I recommend rejection.

### Questions
The authors need to do a very detailed comparison between this submission and Li et al. (2022), including comparison of the methods, the theoretical results and their proofs, the experiment settings and results, and the conclusions.

Also, Theorem 1 is the same as Theorem 2 in Li et al. (2022), so there is no need to write the proof again. The extension of that theorem to $\eta \neq 2$ is very straightforward and only requires a brief explanation. Please also see my comments in the ethics review section.
