# Extracting Post-Treatment Covariates for Heterogeneous Treatment Effect Estimation

- Decision: Reject
- Scores: 6, 5, 6, 5

## Abstract
The exploration of causal relationships between treatments and outcomes, and the estimation of causal effects from observational data, have garnered considerable interest in the scientific community in recent years. However, traditional causal inference methods implicitly assume that all covariates are measured prior to treatment assignment, while in many real-world scenarios, some covariates are affected by the treatment and collected post-treatment. In this paper, we demonstrate how ignoring or mishandling post-treatment covariates can lead to biased estimates of heterogeneous treatment effects, referred to as the "post-treatment bias" problem. We discuss the possible cases in which post-treatment bias may appear and the negative impact it can have on causal effect estimation. Methodologically, we propose a novel variable decomposition approach to account for post-treatment covariates and eliminate post-treatment bias, based on a newly proposed causal graph for post-treatment causal inference analyses. Extensive experiments on synthetic, semi-synthetic, and real-world data demonstrate the superiority of our proposed method over state-of-the-art models for heterogeneous treatment effect estimation.

### Summary
In the article "Extracting Post-Treatment Covariates for Heterogeneous Treatment Effect Estimation", the authors propose to address the problem of post-treatment bias. Based on the literature that suggests to learn a relevant representation from observed variables to perform better adjustment in causal inference, this work introduces a new decomposition of the observed variables to distinguish three types of covariates: confounders, colliders and mediators, of which only confounders should be adjusted for. The authors provide a theoretical proof of the identifiability of the estimand under a new set of assumptions. Finally, the paper presents several experiments to illustrate the performances f the proposed approach, PoNet, on simulated and real data.

### Strengths
The article is well written, and quite clear. The problem is clearly exposed, and the proposed solution is quite elegant.

### Weaknesses
1. The figures and tables legends are not to be read on their own. It is a very nice feature to be able to understand the figures without reading the main text (at least for variables definitions, etc). Additionally, the text on figures is generally too small, in particular for Figure 2 which is barely readable.

2. the source code is not provided. The absence of a ready-to-use code for practitioners is a severe limit to the usefulness of this work by other researchers in the community, and mostly practitioners.

3. The theoretical part is a little limited, it could be enriched for instance with a bound on the reconstruction from the obtained representations.

### Questions
4. can you include the method proposed by Li et al. 2022 in the benchmark? as you mention it partially solves the problem of post-treatment bias you address.

5. it would be interesting to consider the error on the ATE, in addition to the CATE, as an evaluation metric.

6. regarding the experiment on real data, is it possible to also report the different CATE (and ATE) estimates? To have an idea of the impact of the different methods on the actual estimand of interest, even if we do not know the true value.

7. can you provide more guidance for the practitioner? It would be valuable to suggest if PoNet should be applied in all cases, including when post-treatment bias is not really an issue, i.e. extend the experiments to show the performance of PoNet compared to existing approaches in the absence of post-treatment bias. It would illustrate the performance of PoNet on the sole problem of confounder adjustment. Additionally, the performances of PoNet on other datasets used in the original publications of the other methods in the benchmark could be interesting to report (and a very nice contribution to the evaluation standards for the causal representation learning community), though the workload is important.

8. can you report some details regarding the applicability of PoNet? in particular running times, requirement of a GPU or a CPU? variation of the resource need depending on the number of observations and their dimension, as well as the variation of performances depending on those numbers, i.e. does one need a sizable dataset to use PoNet?

9. a detail, the first sentence of section 3.3 is incomplete

3: You are fairly confident in your assessment. It is possible that you did not understand some parts of the submission or that you are unfamiliar with some pieces of related work. Math/other details were not carefully checked.

### Summary
The paper discusses post-treatment bias in estimating Conditional Average Treatment Effects (CATEs). It provides a decomposition for this bias under linearity and also discuss identifiability. A neural model is then proposed for estimating the latent structure of the covariates and using this to adjust estimated CATEs.

### Strengths
See below for a contextual discussion of strengths and perceived weaknesses.

### Weaknesses
The paper is right to note that post-treatment bias can pose problems for causal identification. Conditioning on more information doesn't always improve ATE or CATE estimation. Distinguishing types of variables as pre- or post-treatment is a valuable, albeit difficult, goal. 

This discussion in mind, there are a few factors serving as perceived weaknesses. 

The paper as currently presented spends some time and effort on establishing the well-known problem of post-treatment basis as a problem (e.g., see Abstract and Section 2.2). Some of this is certainly useful to remind readers of the problem as motivation, but the issue is well-known so less emphasis on that would help highlight the contribution here more squarely. Then, Theorem 1 could be better connected to the post-treatment bias problem, with the key point seeming to be that, under a certain causal structure, knowledge of the conditional distribution of pure confounders and post-treatment variables given all the variables 

There are also some aspects to the paper that seem to distract from the main point. For example, the discussion of MIMR is framed as a contribution of the paper ("We propose a Mutual Information Minimization Regularizer (MIMR)"), although I think it could be somewhat further emphasized what problem the regularization is trying to solve (I appreciate the empirical results on the MIMR, however). 

Another thought concerns use of the proposed DAG. Post-treatment variables are presumably omnipresent, and it can be difficult to know how to proceed when they are around (motivating this paper). For applicability in practice, I do not know when or whether investigators would be willing to assume the proposed graph in Figure 1c. Knowing more about the limitations of the proposed approach would help (e.g., discussion of limitations [the paper does not seem to currently have a limitations section]). For example, if I just have a single covariate, and I don't know whether it is a pre- or post-treatment variable, the proposed method would not work (at least according to my understanding of the paper). How many covariates one "needs", and information like that, would be helpful to contextualize the strengths and limits of the contribution. 

Overall, the selected rating balances (a) the importance of the problem faced, but (b) perceived limitations with overall clarity of presentation, as well as perceived practical limitations regarding the method's use. 

A few detailed points: 

The text ''separation of confounders" should read "Separation of confounders" on p. 5.

### Questions
In the proposed DAG, I see that X -> C. If, for example, X is simply partitioned deterministically into the two Z and then the one C component, would this imply that p(C|X) is a degenerate distribution? In other words, if the "C" part of X is, say, age, then p(age | {age, Z}) would be either 0 or 1? If so, would this be a problem? Or am I thinking about this in the wrong way? (Theorem 1 uses p(C|X)

### Summary
This work proposes a new method for dealing with post-treatment covariates in treatment effect estimation. Briefly speaking, post-treatment covariates should not be included when estimating causal effects; however, due to the challenging in discerning post vs. pre-treatment covariates and satisfying the unconfoundedness assumption, post-treatment covariates are often present in observational causal inference. The method discuss post-treatment covariates in two scenarios: mediation and collider biases, and provided a solution using feed-forward neural networks. The network structure is inspired by the classic TARNet, which employs two branches for treated and untreated subjects. Experiments are conducted on a selection of synthetic, semi-synthetic, and real-world datasets.

### Strengths
1. The idea and motivation for addressing post-treatment covariate bias is novel and important.
2. The quality and clarity of writing is quite good. The paper is easy to follow and the logic is clearly articulated.
3. The selection of baselines is adequate in the experiments.

### Weaknesses
1. The technical contribution is somewhat limited. The proposed algorithm feels like a band-aid solution with a structure very similar to TARNet (in terms of using two branches to handle the post-treatment covariates). Based on the experimental results reported in the manuscript, it seems that a generative approach with variable decomposition (that accommodate post-treatment covariates and confounding) can further improve the performance significantly.

2. The paper does not sufficiently address the identifiability challenges inherent in separating post-treatment variables, particularly colliders, from confounders. While the method attempts to learn factors that do not affect the outcome, the theoretical justification for this separation and its robustness to violations of underlying assumptions are not thoroughly discussed. The reliance on neural networks, while flexible, can obscure the interpretability of how these factors are being disentangled, making it difficult to assess the validity of the causal assumptions.

3.  The experimental section, while including a variety of datasets, lacks a detailed analysis of the specific scenarios where PoNet excels or fails. The reported results do not provide a clear understanding of the conditions under which the proposed method is most effective, especially when compared to methods like TEDVAE, which also attempt to decompose latent factors. A more granular analysis, including ablation studies on the impact of different network components and hyperparameter choices, would be beneficial.

### Questions
1. What would be the performance of PoNet on datasets without post-treatment covariates? As in real-world scenarios practitioners may not be able to judge if all included covariates are all pre-treatment or not, it is useful if PoNet can be used in both scenarios and achieve state-of-the-art results.

2. In Figure 1(b), the collider case of post-treatment bias, would a variable decomposition CATE estimator (e.g., TEDVAE) be able to address this scenario? This also relates to the MIMIC-3 dataset and may explain why TEDVAE performs the best among all the other compared baselines. 

3. Would a generative approach that accommodates variable decomposition and post-treatment covariates have better performance? PoNet is essentially based on modified TARNet,which seems to have moderate performance.

### Summary
This paper studies the heterogeneous treatment effect estimation problem in the setting where post-treatment variables exist in addition to the commonly considered confounders, treatments, and outcomes. As the identity of post-treatment covariates is presumed unknown to the analyst, there could be a source of bias in estimating treatment effects. A deep balancing neural network, PoNet, was proposed to address this issue by incorporating a mutual information regularizer and a reconstruction loss to separate the covariates in latent spaces. Experiments on several datasets show that PoNet achieves better performance than common baselines.

### Strengths
1. This paper is clearly written and easy to follow.
2. The experiments are thorough and show a clear advantage over other baselines in the considered setting.

### Weaknesses
I have some concerns about the practicality of the considered problem, as well as the proposed method.
1. The assumption that the analyst is unaware of which covariates are confounders and which are post-treatment variables seems quite rare in real-world scenarios. Typically, domain knowledge or prior information can help identify confounders. Therefore, the practical applicability of this assumption in real-world problems may be limited. 
2. In cases where the analyst genuinely has no prior knowledge of the causal structure, there are established methods in the causal inference literature for discovering causal relationships from observational data. For example, conditional independence tests can be applied to recover the causal structure, especially since post-treatment variables induce v-structures. This approach may offer a more direct and interpretable solution compared to encouraging conditional independence in an embedding space using mutual information regularizers as in the proposed method. Also, testing conditional independence in the original space seems to be a simpler problem compared to requiring conditional independence in an embedding space.
3. The decoupling approach that combines the reconstruction loss and the mutual information regularizer seems to be a heuristic one since it does not really guarantee that the covariates are properly separated into pre-treatment and post-treatment ones, which could hurt the reliability of the proposed method.
