# Mixed-Type Tabular Data Synthesis with Score-based Diffusion in Latent Space

- Decision: Accept
- Scores: 5, 8, 6, 8

## Abstract
Recent advances in tabular data generation have greatly enhanced synthetic data quality. However, extending diffusion models to tabular data is challenging due to the intricately varied distributions and a blend of data types of tabular data. This paper introduces \modelname, a methodology that synthesizes tabular data by leveraging a diffusion model within a variational autoencoder (VAE) crafted latent space. The key advantages of the proposed \modelname include
(1) \generality: the ability to handle a broad spectrum of data types by converting them into a single unified space and explicitly capturing inter-column relations; 
(2) \quality: optimizing the distribution of latent embeddings to enhance the subsequent training of diffusion models, which helps generate high-quality synthetic data, 
(3) \speed: much fewer number of reverse steps and faster synthesis speed than existing diffusion-based methods. Extensive experiments on six datasets with five metrics demonstrate that \modelname outperforms existing methods. Specifically, it reduces the error rates by {\em 86\%} and {\em 67\%}  for column-wise distribution and pair-wise column correlation estimations compared with the most competitive baselines.

3: You are fairly confident in your assessment. It is possible that you did not understand some parts of the submission or that you are unfamiliar with some pieces of related work. Math/other details were not carefully checked.

### Summary
This work introduces a latent diffusion model for generating tabular data, and presents a benchmark consisting of six datasets and five quality metrics to evaluate the performance. The comparison in this unified testing environment demonstrates the superiority of the proposed method.

### Strengths
•	This paper presents a benchmark that is beneficial to the community.

•	The better performance over previous work across five quality metrics showcases its effectiveness in generating high-quality tabular data.

### Weaknesses
1.	The motivation behind using latent diffusion for tabular data generation is not thoroughly discussed in the paper, and the model design does not effectively exploit the characteristics of tabular data.

2.	The VAE decoder design is tailored specifically for either numerical or categorical features, which limits its applicability in a wider range of tabular data scenarios, such as datasets containing a mixture of both numerical and categorical features.

### Questions
1.	Are the results shown in Figure 3 derived from the training set or the validation set?

2.	Does replacing the MLP in the diffusion model with a more powerful architecture, such as a Transformer, have any impact on the performance?

### Summary
Extending diffusion models to handle tabular data presents challenges due to the complex distributions and diverse data types inherent to such data. To address this, the authors introduce the use of a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) to learn a regularized latent embedding representation of the data, which is subsequently processed by a diffusion network for synthesis. Notably, the study employs a comprehensive set of multi-dimensional evaluation metrics for the generated data, filling a gap often observed in previous research. The proposed method excels across these metrics, underscoring its efficacy in generating synthetic data that closely mirrors the original data distribution.

### Strengths
- The method effectively manages mixed-type data by transforming them into a single cohesive space to ensure capturing or inter-column relationships.

- Compared to existing diffusion-based methods, this method requires fewer reverse steps and offers faster data synthesis.

- The authors have provided a unified comparison environment for their proposed tabular data synthesis, as well as all the compared baseline methods, and made their code base publicly available.

- The study employs a diverse set of multi-dimensional evaluation metrics for a holistic assessment of the generated data, addressing a common shortcoming in previous research.

- The method has been rigorously tested on six datasets using five metrics, and it consistently outperforming other existing methods, indicating its prowess in generating synthetic data that closely reflects the original data distribution.

### Weaknesses
 - The method's efficacy is contingent upon a well-trained VAE. It would be beneficial to compare the outcomes between optimally and sub-optimally trained VAEs, providing insights into worst-case vs. best-case scenarios.

- Given the generative capability of VAEs, it would be insightful to see results from data generated solely by the VAE used in this study. The distinction between the paper's transformer-based VAE and TVAE warrants further exploration to determine the independent efficacy of the former.

- While adjusting default hyperparameters for a fair comparison is commendable, understanding performance under default settings across consistent training epochs would give a fuller picture. This would ascertain whether hyperparameter enlargement (as done for CTGAN and CoDi) equally benefits the models or favors the presented method disproportionately.

- The discrepancy observed where TabDDPM struggles with the News dataset (poor performance in Table 1), yet exhibits a low error rate in Table 2 seems unintuitive. Additionally, given TabDDPM's consistent second-place ranking, except for the News dataset, its fourth-place average rank seems unfair. An alternative could be per-dataset ranking or reporting modal / averaged ranks. 

- Given that the News dataset is primarily of numeric nature, it seems counterintuitive that TabDDPM, a diffusion based model would underperform on this dataset. It would be beneficial to understand the authors' rationale behind the model's inability to generate meaningful content for this dataset.

- The deployment of MLE as a metric for privacy is unconventional. Traditionally, MLE assesses the synthetic data's task-performance equivalence to real data, not privacy leakage. It would be enriching if the authors could shed light on this choice.

### Questions
Thank you for sharing your code with the community; it's a valuable resource. While exploring it, I encountered a few queries and points of feedback:

1. **Device Attribute Error**: When executing the command `python main.py —dataname adult —method vae —mode train`, I came across the “AttributeError: ’Namespace’ object has no attribute ‘device’”. I was able to address this by introducing an else statement post line 7 in `main.py` to default to 'cpu'. Consider incorporating this for broader compatibility.
   ```python
   if …:
       args.device = …
   else:
       args.device = 'cpu'
   ```

2. **Sample Size Limitation**: I attempted the VAE training phase with 40 samples and encountered an `IndexError: index out of range in self`. This wasn't an issue with the full sample size of 32561. Is the model designed to accommodate only larger samples, or is there a potential to adapt it to smaller sample sizes?

3. **Epoch Setting for VAE Model**: The default epoch for the VAE model in the code is set to 4000. Based on my prior experiences with the TVAE model using CTGAN's code, training for around 300 epochs usually suffices. Is the transformer architecture inherently more demanding in terms of training duration? Additionally, what criteria do you rely on to determine the termination of training? Introducing an early stopping mechanism might be beneficial, especially considering the subsequent training phase for the diffusion model. It's also noteworthy that a Train/Val accuracy of 100% seems achievable by the 1000th epoch.

4: You are confident in your assessment, but not absolutely certain. It is unlikely, but not impossible, that you did not understand some parts of the submission or that you are unfamiliar with some pieces of related work.

### Summary
Authors propose a generative model for mixed type tabular data. The proposed model first tokenizes the mixed type columns, feeds it to a one transformer layer, which then forms as the encoder in the VAE model. Finally the latent space is fixed by diffusion.

### Strengths
Very reasonable model for the mixed type tabular data. Definitely something that I would use in my day to day work. Results are also convincing.

### Weaknesses
 - Model itself seems to be pretty much the same as Vahdat 2021, except that in that paper authors used only images, whereas now tokenization is needed to use the same model. I would like authors to comment on this, and it would really help the paper to be very clear in the Introduction that where the technical novelty lies.



### Questions
- what would be the accuracy in the downstream task if latent code would be used directly (and no synthetic data). I understand that this is not possible for all models. But for the models that it is possible it would be interesting to see how much benefit there is (i.e. can you win real)
- Are all classification tasks in downstream binary tasks? If no, then AUC is not a correct metric.

### Summary
This paper present a new latent diffusion model/code for tabular data generation.
Transposing to tabular data the recent ideas of (Rombach et al. CVPR 2022 and Karras et al. NeuIPS 2022), their model architecture is two-folds:
- a transformer-based \beta-VAE to embedd tabular data into a latent space
- a score-based generator based on (Song et al. ICLR 2021)'s architecture

As a slight algorithmic contributions, the authors propose to use an "adaptive VAE loss weighing".

In the experiment section, the method is benchmarked against 6 state of the art tabular data generation models on 6 datasets. A few ablation tests are provided (one to justify the adaptive weighing).
This paper is only focused on unconditional generation, some experiments on missing-values imputation are also provided.

It is worth noting that both the code and a rich appendix are provided as supplementary material.
The code is clear and well commented.
The appendix provides a clear background on recent score-based generation best-practices and several supplementary experiments. Several implementation and methodology details allows the readers to retrieve what they needs to reproduce and understand this work.

### Strengths
I suggest acceptance:

- I really liked reading this paper. It is well written with several clear illustrations. 
- The contribution is mostly incremental but solid and well driven.
- The provided code is clear and will be useful for the community (if it is published)
- The supplementary material provides a detailed and clear background summary.
- The experiment section could be improved but seems solid: the method seems efficient and fast when compared against other SOTA methods.
- The model is tested with a single hyper-parameter configuration on all datasets

### Weaknesses
 - The scientific contribution is mostly incremental and expected
- The authors claim that no "unified and comprehensive evaluation" exists for tabular data synthesis. To my opinion, one weakness of this paper is indeed that it feeds this lack of a unified benchmark by proposing another new benchmark with new metrics that are not used in other papers. Sticking a bit more to previous paper's metrics and datasets could improve that point.
- given the size of the appendix, one is surprised to see that no simple baselines like Bayesian Networks or SMOTE are provided in the experiments. SMOTE is known to be a competitive baseline for "target-conditional" data generation.
- No privacy preservation metrics (like DCR) are provided. No detection test metric (like C2ST) is provided
- The absence of hyper-parameters tuning in the benchmark is both laudable and questionable as it may hinder some of the other models (a fair option could be to report the total training time with a fixed budget).

### Questions
- Could you use the "sdmetrics" library to provide some privacy (like DCR) and detection (like C2ST) metrics in your benchmark ?
- A few more datasets common with previous papers like (Kotelnikov et al. 2022, see Table 2) could improve the benchmark.
- Could you add SMOTE (with unconditional sampling) as a baseline in your results ?
- Are the confidence intervals on result tables computed through cross validation or only through multiple-sampling ?

- Will you publish your code ?
- Did you try your code on 2d synthetic sklearn examples ?
