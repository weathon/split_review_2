- Decision: Accept
- Scores: 6, 6, 5, 5

## Abstract
Label imbalance and homophily-heterophily mixture are the fundamental problems encountered when applying Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to Graph Fraud Detection (GFD) tasks. 
Existing GNN-based GFD models are designed to augment graph structure to accommodate the inductive bias of GNNs towards homophily, by excluding heterophilic neighbors during message passing. In our work, we argue that the key to applying GNNs for GFD is not to exclude but to {\em distinguish} neighbors with different labels. Grounded in this perspective, we introduce Partitioning Message Passing (PMP), an intuitive yet effective message passing paradigm expressly crafted for GFD. Specifically, in the neighbor aggregation stage of PMP, neighbors with different classes are aggregated with distinct node-specific aggregation functions. By this means, the center node can adaptively adjust the information aggregated from its heterophilic and homophilic neighbors, thus avoiding the model gradient being dominated by benign nodes which occupy the majority of the population. We theoretically establish a connection between the spatial formulation of PMP and spectral analysis to characterize that PMP operates an adaptive node-specific spectral graph filter, which demonstrates the capability of PMP to handle heterophily-homophily mixed graphs. Extensive experimental results show that PMP can significantly boost the performance on GFD tasks.

### Summary
This paper describes a variant of GNN trained for graph fraud detection tasks.
Apparently, previously existing GNN's efficacy suffer due to label imbalance (a common occurrence with fraud data). 
The authors' solution to this problem was in label-aware partitioning of aggregated contributions during message passing stage. Instead of aggregating contribution from all nodes from a given root node's neighborhood the proposed method would aggregate label-aware contributions separately which would include separate weight matrices for benign nodes and for fraud-related nodes.
The algorithm's theoretical examination shows that it independently learns an adaptive spectral filter for each node in the graph. The model also proved to outperform existing state-of-art solutions on publicly available datasets.

### Strengths
This paper is very well motivated and clearly written. The idea seems to be simple enough yet previous researchers' work focused on augmenting graph structure and label-augmented features and have not augmented message passing process only.

I found the visualization of the difference between the influence of fraud nodes in neighborhood of a given node and influence of benign nodes from the same neighborhoods to be very persuasive when using this metric for comparing minority class contribution with various GNN models.

### Weaknesses
I did not find any glaring weaknesses. I would just mention that it would be easier for a reader to follow if the same notation would not be used for different purposes.
h (page 15) - class homophili metric
h_{i}^{(l)} (page 3) - l-th layer hidden representation of v_i

Furthermore, on page 4, equation 4: Shouldn't a small \alpha^{(l)}_{i} indicate that the model should treat unlabeled neighbors more similarly to benign nodes (instead of fraud nodes as written in the paper)? The current description seems counterintuitive, as a smaller \alpha^{(l)}_{i} would imply a larger weight on \mathbf{W}_{be}^{(l)}, suggesting similarity to benign nodes.

On Figure 4 (page 8): Influence distribution: why GCN (and not R-GCN) was chosen as one of the methods for comparison? My understanding is that GCN cannot distinguish between diffenent relations and both Yelp and Amazon datasets include multiple relationship types. May be that is why GCN did better at T-Finance (with only one relation type)

### Summary
In this paper, the authors address fundamental challenges faced in applying Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to Graph Fraud Detection (GFD) tasks, namely, label imbalance and the mixture of homophily-heterophily. Existing GNN-based GFD models modify graph structures to accommodate GNNs' homophilic bias by excluding heterophilic neighbors during message passing. However, the authors propose a novel perspective: instead of excluding, they advocate for distinguishing neighbors with different labels. They introduce a method called Partitioning Message Passing (PMP), a message passing paradigm tailored for GFD. In PMP, neighbors with different classes are aggregated using distinct node-specific aggregation functions. This approach allows the central node to adaptively adjust the information gathered from both heterophilic and homophilic neighbors. By doing so, PMP prevents the model gradient from being dominated by benign nodes, which constitute the majority of the population. The authors establish a theoretical connection between the spatial formulation of PMP and spectral analysis, characterizing PMP as an adaptive node-specific spectral graph filter. This demonstrates PMP's ability to handle graphs with mixed heterophily and homophily. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of PMP, showing significant performance improvements in Graph Fraud Detection tasks. PMP's innovative approach of distinguishing rather than excluding neighbors with different labels showcases its potential in enhancing the capabilities of GNNs for fraud detection on graphs.

### Strengths
- The solution to adaptively learn from heterophilous and homophilous nodes for fraud detection is interesting and the theoretical analysis is sound.

- The paper is generally well-written and almost clear everywhere.

- Experiments conducted on datasets with different sizes show the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed method in graph fraud detection.

### Weaknesses
 - The relationships between heterophily and imbalance (which is specific in fraud detection) are not clear. This is important to understand the problem.

- The relationships between the proposed method and some previous spectral GNNs, e.g., [1], have not been discussed. A lack of discussions about differences may limit the novelty of the proposed method.

- A minor issue: repeated references 2nd and 3rd articles.

### Questions
- The strategy of partitioning message passing is very similar to GNNs with adaptive channel mixing used in [1] although [1] is from the spectral perspective. It will be interesting to discuss the differences and relationships between your proposed method and [1].

- The discussion on the relationships between heterophily and imbalance is not detailed. A detailed empirical and/or theoretical analysis of relationships between heterophily and imbalance on graphs should be conducted to better understand the problem.

### Summary
This work addresses the challenges of label imbalance and the complex interplay between homophily and heterophily in Graph Neural Networks for Graph Fraud Detection. It introduces a novel approach called Partitioning Message Passing (PMP). In this method, neighboring nodes of different classes are processed using distinct, node-specific aggregation functions. Furthermore, the central node has the ability to adaptively fine-tune the information it gathers from both its heterophilic and homophilic neighbors. Empirical results reveal that the PMP method outperforms other competitive algorithms across a range of datasets, including Yelp, Amazon, and T-Finance, while maintaining an optimal balance between performance and computational time.

### Strengths
1. The PMP method is well-designed, offering a straightforward solution that is easy to understand and implement.
2. The article employs a comprehensive analytical framework to validate the effectiveness of the PMP method, adding to its credibility.

### Weaknesses
1. The primary innovation in the PMP method lies in the use of different weighting matrices for aggregating nodes of various classes. While effective, this focus may be perceived as lacking in breadth in terms of overall innovativeness. The core mechanism of using distinct weight matrices for homophilic and heterophilic neighbors, while a reasonable approach, might be seen as an incremental step rather than a significant leap in methodology. The method's reliance on this specific mechanism could limit its applicability to scenarios where such clear class distinctions are not readily available or meaningful.
2. The article would benefit from a more meticulous attention to the use of symbols and language. Ensuring consistent and clear terminology and notation would contribute to the paper's readability and accessibility. For instance, the use of subscripts and superscripts could be made more consistent, and the definitions of certain terms could be clarified to avoid ambiguity. The current state of the writing sometimes makes it difficult to follow the technical arguments precisely.

### Questions
1. On Page 2, in the penultimate line of "where each node v_i is assigned a binary label y_i∈Y", please confirm whether it is "Y" or "fi"?
2. In the description of Eq.(4) on page 4, it is mentioned that "In other words, a small α_i^((l)) means that the model treats unlabeled neighbors more similarly to fraud nodes". In conjunction with Eq.(4), shouldn't it be the case that a smaller α_i^((l)) makes unlabeled neighbors more biased to benign nodes?
3. Throughout the paper, sections 2, 3, and 7 are more similar to one part of the content, related work, could they be synthesized into one section?
4. When introducing PMP, the article mentions the use of one layer of MLP in the generation of α_i^((l)). Still, it does not note how many layers of MLP are used in the subsequent "Root-specific weight matrices generation.
5. In the experimental results for the T-Social dataset, the AUC value is much higher than that of the comparative algorithm, close to 100%, is it possible to analyze the reason for this excellent result?
6. In the last sentence of Section 6.4, "wherein each of these designs brings more than a 1% improvement across most metrics", does that mean that each approach delivers at least a 1% improvement over GraphSAGE, or does it mean that it provides a 1% improvement over the previous pivotal components? Please be as precise as possible.

### Summary
This paper discusses the challenges in applying Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to Graph Fraud Detection (GFD) tasks, specifically the issues of label imbalance and the mixture of homophily and heterophily. While existing GNN-based GFD models typically exclude heterophilic neighbors during message passing, the authors argue for distinguishing neighbors with different labels instead of exclusion. They introduce a new approach called Partitioning Message Passing (PMP), which adapts the information aggregated from heterophilic and homophilic neighbors, preventing the model gradient from being dominated by benign nodes. Theoretical connections and extensive experiments demonstrate that PMP significantly enhances GFD task performance, effectively addressing these challenges.

### Strengths
1. This paper maintains a high level of self-containment and coherence, as the authors support the claims made within the manuscript through detailed explanations and experimental validation.
2. This paper addresses the issues of label imbalance and the mixture of homophily-heterophily by introducing a new approach that assigns distinct parameter matrices to neighbors from different classes.
3. The comparison algorithms used in experiments are state-of-the-art.

### Weaknesses
1. There are some reservations regarding the novelty of this paper for the following reasons:

     a) The issues of label imbalance and homophily-heterophily have been effectively addressed in the past. Notably, Tang et al. [1] offered a theoretical explanation for these concerns using spectral graph analysis.
     
     b) Building upon the findings of [1], this paper makes incremental enhancements in the field of fraud detection while questioning the complexity of earlier algorithms. Nonetheless, this paper does not provide comprehensive comparison of time and space complexities with previous works.

2. The approach of treating fraud detection as a binary classification problem has inherent limitations. Real-world scenarios often involve anomalies that cannot be neatly classified into a single class and that do not adhere to clustering assumptions. Given the multitude of existing papers that have already presented effective solutions to address the challenges of imbalance and homophily-heterophily by binary classification algorithms, it raises questions about the need for publishing similar articles at the cutting-edge conference ICLR.

3. An analysis about the labeled neighborhoods’ label distributions of central nodes in the training dataset is necessary. This is crucial as the proposed method relies heavily on the labels of neighboring nodes. Furthermore, it is important to emphasize the ratio of normal nodes to anomaly nodes in the training data.

4. Concerns have been raised about the correctness of equation (7).
