# Fast Inverse Rendering by Unified Voxelization of Scene Representation

- Decision: Reject
- Scores: 8, 5, 5, 5

## Abstract
Typical inverse rendering methods focus on learning implicit neural scene representations by modeling the geometry, materials and illumination separately, which entails significant computations for optimization. In this work we design a Unified Voxelization framework for explicit learning of scene representations, dubbed \emph{UniVoxel}, which allows for efficient modeling of the geometry, materials and illumination jointly, thereby accelerating the inverse rendering significantly. To be specific, we propose to encode a scene into a latent volumetric representation, based on which the geometry, materials and illumination can be readily learned via lightweight neural networks in a unified manner. Particularly, an essential design of \emph{UniVoxel} is that we leverage local Spherical Gaussians to represent the incident light radiance, which enables the seamless integration of modeling illumination into the unified voxelization framework. Such novel design enables our \emph{UniVoxel} to model the joint effects of direct lighting, indirect lighting and light visibility efficiently without expensive multi-bounce ray tracing. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks covering diverse scenes demonstrate that \emph{UniVoxel} boosts the optimization efficiency significantly compared to other methods, reducing the per-scene training time from hours to 18 minutes, while achieving favorable reconstruction quality.

### Summary
This paper proposes a unified voxel representation to allow efficient reconstruction of geometry, material and illumination from multi-view images captured around the object. Compared with previous work that requires expensive ray tracing to compute lighting and visibility, the proposed method shows that a local spherical Gaussian illumination representation can achieve similar or even better quality of inverse rendering while significantly reducing the optimization time. Experiments on widely used real and synthetic dataset shows the overall improvements of the proposed method against state-of-the-arts.

### Strengths
1. Clear novelties and improvements compared to previous work.
In my opinion, the major novelty of the proposed method is a local illumination model that bakes direct illumination, visibility and indirect illumination into a spherical Gaussian representation that can be efficiently predicted. This novel representation enable significant acceleration compared to previous environment map representation, as it can avoid expensive multi-bounce ray tracing. One may expect this new method will cause more baking issue as it is less constrained compared to a global environment map lighting representation. However, the experiments show that the BRDF reconstruction quality is comparable or even better than state-of-the-arts. 

2.  Comprehensive experiments
Author did comprehensive experiments on novel view synthesis, material estimation and relighting on widely-used real and synthetic datasets. Both the quantitative and qualitative results show clear improvements and the optimization time is much less compared to previous works. Authors also did ablation studies between different lighting representations, which makes the results reported in the paper more convincing.

3. Well-written paper, with all necessary implementation details included in the main paper and supplementary material. 
The paper is well-written and easy to follow. With the details provided in the supplementary material, it should not be too difficult to reimplement the paper.

### Weaknesses
1. More focused on novelty.
Several recent methods use feature volume plus MLP to jointly reconstruct materials and geometry, such as TensorIR and NeuralPBIR. The true difference of the proposed method and previous works is the local illumination model that can accelerate the optimization. Therefore, I feel authors can emphasize this more. For example, the introduction gives me the impression that this method is faster because it uses a voxel-based scene representation, which has adapted by many previous work, but instead it probably makes more sense to emphasize the illumination model. The current presentation obscures the core contribution, which is the efficient local spherical Gaussian illumination representation, and how it avoids expensive ray tracing.

2. Geometry reconstruction.
I feel one experiment that is missing is the geometry quality, especially compared to TensoIR. While it is mentioned in section 4.2, it is difficult to tell the differences. I am curious how will different lighting representations impact the geometry quality, especially for the highly specular surfaces and concave regions? The paper lacks a thorough analysis of how the choice of illumination model affects the accuracy of the reconstructed geometry, particularly in challenging areas like specular highlights and concavities. A more detailed investigation into this aspect is needed.

3. Reference.
One con-current work that can be discussed in the paper is the NeuralPBIR (Sun et al.), which accelerates the reconstruction process by precomputing visibility and GI from NeRF so that material reconstruction can be done through local optimization. The idea of avoiding expensive ray tracing is related, while I feel the local illumination model proposed here is more different from previous works.

4. Missing details.
One details I did not find in the paper is after predicting the SG parameters, how will you render the appearance? Are you going to sample rays uniformly, with importance sampling or just compute the integral analytically? Please remind me if I miss this part in the paper.

5. Extension of the method to handle volumetric object. 
One potential extension of this work is that instead of computing per-ray SG parameters and the render the appearances, we can also consider use per-point SG parameters to compute the radiance at every point through rendering equation. In this way, we might be able to reconstruct fury objects, with some modifications of the BRDF model. Does it make sense to authors?

### Questions
Most of my questions in the weakness section. I have two more questions. 

1. About limitation in Sec. F. When you say the proposed method needs more GPU memory, how much more GPU memory does it require?
2. In Figure 13, the color of the normal maps from different methods are very different. I wonder if that is caused by any visualization issue, like different way to turn normal into RGB image?

### Summary
The submission proposes a 3D scene representation based on voxel grid features and MLP decoders to achieve more efficient inverse rendering. Geometrical and scene properties are encoded separately in two grid-based volumes. For scene properties (e.g., material, illumination), the volume stores implicit features in the grids, and separate MLPs are trained to decode these features into the target property values. In the case of the geometrical volume, SDF values are directly stored in the grid structure. The experimental evaluation demonstrates that this representation leads to efficient inverse rendering and delivers performance comparable to state-of-the-art methods.

### Strengths
+This submission proposes a unified grid-based representation that incorporates geometry and material properties. The grid-based representation has shown to be more friendly for optimization.

+Optimization becomes more straightforward with shallower MLPs. The combination of grid-based volume representation and shallow MLPs leads to more efficient optimization. 

+Spherical Gaussian (SG) representation exhibits higher-order frequency characteristics for illumination compared to spherical harmonics (SH).

### Weaknesses
-My major concern is that the utilization of feature grids for more efficient training (the major claim) is not a novel insight. For instance, in InstantNGP, it has been demonstrated that the combination of dense hashable grids and shallower MLPs significantly enhances efficiency. Furthermore, the memory concerns highlighted in this submission can potentially be alleviated by adopting more efficient data structures for the grid, such as hashable grids as employed in InstantNGP.

-The observed performance improvement is incremental and does not surpass the performance achieved by previous methods in some cases. For instance, a notable limitation of the proposed method is that it often results in albedo estimates that include shading components as shown in Fig.5 first row, in contrast to TenSor RT.

-The assertion that SH cannot effectively model higher-frequency illumination may not be conclusive, as it is based on testing only up to order-3 SH. Increasing the order of SH could potentially address this limitation. To provide a more compelling evaluation, it is advisable to ensure an equal number of parameters when comparing SG and SH representations.

-Details missing: It is not mentioned clearly how the global illumination and self-occlusion are handled during relighting. Please see questions below for more detailed questions.

### Questions
1. For SG-based illumination representation, how many parameters are used for representing the Gaussians? Is it comparable to the SH counterpart? 

2. How are global illumination and self-occlusion handled during relighting? During scene reconstruction, those could be baked in the SG/SH-based per-point illumination. But during relighting, the per-point environment might should be different.

### Summary
The paper introduces a volumetric-based inverse rendering technique notable for its efficiency. It showcases impressive experimental outcomes; however, the paper's innovation is somewhat restrained. Core aspects of the methodology appear to be previously explored in established works like PhySG, Tensorir, and NeuS. The experimental scope could benefit from an extension to include tests on the challenging Shiny Nerf-synthetic dataset, which is known for its shiny object rendering complexity. Furthermore, the paper could enhance its technical credibility by scrutinizing and refining the accuracy of its claims.

### Strengths
1.	The manuscript is well-composed, displaying a clear and articulate writing style. 
2.	The inverse rendering outcomes presented are visually appealing and demonstrate good quality. 
3.	Additionally, the related work section is comprehensive, encompassing a broad spectrum of the existing research in this field, which underscores the authors' thorough understanding of the domain.

### Weaknesses
1. The paper's innovative contribution is nuanced, as it applies a latent volumetric representation to enhance efficiency in inverse rendering—a concept that has been extensively studied. Although it offers incremental advancements, the overall novelty is tempered by similarities to existing methods, such as those utilizing MLPs. Additionally, the application of Spherical Gaussians (SGs) in the context of lighting is previously detailed in works like PhySG, suggesting the paper's approach is not entirely unprecedented.

2. While the paper acknowledges PhySG, it does not sufficiently recognize the prior exploration of SGs for modeling incident light. A more explicit acknowledgment would strengthen the paper by correctly attributing the origins of this idea.

3. The utilization of environment map-based lighting is a well-trodden area in research, evidenced by efforts like Nvidia’s nvdiffrec-mc. The paper's critique of environment map-based lighting in favor of SGs may not be entirely justified, and the simplifications made in visibility reasoning warrant a closer examination. The unconventional modeling of the environment map using 128 Spherical Gaussians in this paper departs from traditional methods and calls into question the asserted superiority of SG over environment maps. Therefore, claims regarding the advantages of SG should be made with greater technical precision and careful comparison.

### Questions
1. The paper would benefit from an explanation of the observed floating noise in TensoIR's results, providing clarity on whether this is an artifact of the algorithm, a limitation of the model, or an issue with the dataset or experimental setup used.

2. The inclusion of experiments on the challenging shiny NeRF-synthetic dataset could significantly enhance the paper's empirical foundation. Successful results on this dataset would serve as a robust testament to the algorithm's capabilities.

3. It is important for the paper to detail the distinctions between the environment map used in this study and that employed by Nvdiffrec, particularly since the paper touts the superiority of Spherical Gaussians (SG) over environment maps. A clear comparison would illustrate the specific contributions and advantages of the proposed method.

4. For a more convincing demonstration of the algorithm’s performance in handling complex lighting scenarios, the paper should present an experiment visualizing the incident light maps reconstructed using the shiny NeRF-synthetic dataset. This would showcase the practical utility of the algorithm in a real-world application, particularly for scenes with challenging lighting conditions.

### Summary
This paper propose a unified voxelization framework for inverse rendering (UniVoxel). UniVoxel can achieve fast inverse rendering, In addition, in order to better integrate with explicit frameworks, Spherical Gaussians to learn the incident light field was proposed.

### Strengths
Compared with other inverse rendering methods, UniVoxel significantly improves optimization efficiency, reducing the training time for each scene from a few hours to **18 minutes**.

### Weaknesses
1. The explicit scene representation of UniVoxel is very similar to Voxurf, except that it additionally predicts various properties of object materials in space. It is difficult to evaluate if adapting the semantic field during model training is novel in this paper.   
2. UniVoxel cannot recover Envmap compared to other related works, which may limit its application scenarios.   
3. From the experimental results, as shown in Figure 3, there is no obvious advantage in predicting the effect of materials, and the results of relighting are not very prominent. As shown in Figure 5, it seems that albedo did not decompose successfully and retained the light and dark shadows of the scene itself.

### Questions
1. Can you provide a video comparing the training speed with other methods? As demonstrated by the author of Plenoxels (Plenoxels vs. NeRF)  ref: https://alexyu.net/plenoxels/   
2.  A question about the explicit voxelization of scene representation is that can the explicit voxelization of scene representation model reflective surfaces such as **metal or mirror** ? Will the proposed method work better on those objects than NeRF ?
