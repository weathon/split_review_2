## Abstract
Text-based delivery addresses, as the data foundation for logistics systems, contain abundant and crucial location information. How to effectively encode the delivery address is a core task to boost the performance of downstream tasks in the logistics system. Pre-trained Models (PTMs) designed for Natural Language Process (NLP) have emerged as the dominant tools for encoding semantic information in text. Though promising, those NLP-based PTMs fall short of encoding geographic knowledge in the delivery address, which considerably trims down the performance of delivery-related tasks in logistic systems such as Cainiao. To tackle the above problem, we propose a domain-specific pre-trained model, named G2PTL, a \textbf{G}eography-\textbf{G}raph \textbf{P}re-\textbf{t}rained model for delivery address in \textbf{L}ogistics field. G2PTL combines the semantic learning capabilities of text pre-training with the geographical-relationship encoding abilities of graph modeling. Specifically, we first utilize real-world logistics delivery data to construct a large-scale heterogeneous graph of delivery addresses, which contains abundant geographic knowledge and delivery information. Then, G2PTL is pre-trained with subgraphs sampled from the heterogeneous graph. Comprehensive experiments are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of G2PTL through four downstream tasks in logistics systems on real-world datasets. G2PTL has been deployed in production in Cainiao's logistics system, which significantly improves the performance of delivery-related tasks. The code of G2PTL is available at https://huggingface.co/Cainiao-AI/G2PTL.

4: You are confident in your assessment, but not absolutely certain. It is unlikely, but not impossible, that you did not understand some parts of the submission or that you are unfamiliar with some pieces of related work.

### Summary
This work introduces a novel pre-trained model designed specifically for delivery addresses in logistics tasks, named G2PTL. 
Central to G2PTL's innovation is its unique architecture that leverages graph-based representations of address data. 
This architecture supports the model's capability to efficiently learn geographic knowledge and delivery details through 
three distinct pre-training tasks: Masked Language Modeling (MLM), Geocoding, and hierarchical text classification. 
A distinguishing feature of G2PTL is its adeptness in modeling graph information inherent in the logistics domain.

### Strengths
* G2PTL's architecture adeptly captures diverse and complex real-world delivery information in the form of heterogeneous graph.
* The strategy of employing subgraphs sourced from a larger heterogeneous graph for training is innovative.
* G2PTL demonstrates strong performance across a suite of logistics-specific tasks, such as Geocoding, ETA for Pick-up, address entity prediction, and address entity tokenization.
* The work is complemented by a thorough analytical review.

### Weaknesses
 * The representation in Figure 1 lacks clarity. The relationship between the left and right sections of the figure is puzzling. 
For instance, the right side depicts an edge between node 1 and node 2 labeled "001", suggesting "no delivery route, no AOI co-location, and has Alias." However, the left side appears to contradict this, showing a delivery route between node 1 and node 2.

### Summary
This paper builds a pre-trained graph model G2PTL for the logistics domain and applies it to downstream tasks. The authors first process the delivery data and use it to construct a large-scale heterogeneous graph. To pre-train G2PTL, they propose three pre-training tasks: whole word mask, geocoding, and hierarchical text classification. Finally, the authors validate the effectiveness of G2PTL on four different types of downstream tasks. The main contribution of this paper is to propose a paradigm for constructing pre-trained models for the logistics domain.

### Strengths
1. The proposed graph construction method is novel, providing a good reference for pre-training methods in the logistics domain.

2. The paper is clearly written and easy to read and understand.

3. The ablation experiments and performance on downstream tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed G2PTL.

### Weaknesses
1. The proposed method is a combination of existing technologies, such as whole word mask, geocoding, and Graphormer. 

2. Missing discussions on necessary details, such as inference efficiency, data distribution of pre-training tasks, convergence analysis of pre-training, parameter selection, and optimizing strategies.

3. Missing statistical significance tests.

### Questions
1. Given that a fixed heterogeneous graph has already been predefined, how can the proposed method be scaled to new addresses?

2. How do you balance the significance of various tasks within the loss function? Based on the findings from the ablation experiments, it appears that HTC plays a more crucial role in pre-training.

3. What is the rationale behind choosing to sample from the entire graph as opposed to creating subgraph-level graph models? The former option demands significantly greater computational and storage resources.

### Summary
In this paper, the authors proposed to build a pre-trained language model for delivery addresses using both text information and geography-graph information. This pre-trained language model, named G2PTL, can improve the performance of downstream tasks such as address entity extraction, address normalization, as well as geolocation coding and pick-up estimation time of arrival. The contributions for this paper are as follows:
1. It pre-trained a large language model for addresses using delivery information. There were similar models in previous literature but this proposed model is optimized for tasks related to logistics and delivery. 
2. In pre-training phase, the authors proposed a novel method to use both graphical information as well as text information. In specific, the Graphormer is used to encode both the routing and pairwise distance between addresses, while the Transformer is used to encode the semantic information in address text as well as node degree and position information. Then a new transformer is used to merge two sides of information together. 
The authors have shown the performance improvement using this pre-trained language models and they also showed the importance of pre-training tasks such as graph learning and geocoding to the performance improvement of the pre-trained models.

### Strengths
The strength of this paper is as below:
1. The proposed pre-trained LM for delivery address is a domain specific language models. Unlike the generic LM, this model focuses on optimizing the performance of logistic and delivery related tasks. For that reason, it is not satisfactory of the semantic text information in the address but also requiring additional knowledge on the relationship between addresses in the geographical map. This information including the neighborhood information from both distance perspective and the routing perspective. Thus, it is natural to consider both of them during the pre-training. 
2. The proposed pre-training model for delivery address used multi-modal (text + graph) information in the pre-training phase. Allowing the learned embedding to capture both semantic similarity and the geographical similarity between addresses. This makes a lot of senses since in practice, many similar worded addresses are actually very far away from distance point of view thus is not optimized to be included in the delivery route. 
3. The design of heterogenous graph using delivery route as well as AOI Co-locate information is very interesting. It makes sense considering that the delivery system and courier would optimize their route to prioritize addresses in a closer neighborhood and to set the delivery priority accordingly. Building a graph using such information would naturally include geographical neighborhood information which is better than just geo-encoding since a closer direct distance of two addresses may take a long time to travel due to geographical barriers. 
4. This paper has well demonstrated the strength of specialized LM in domain specific tasks. In many special domains, pre-training LM is more useful than fine-tuning existing ones given enough resources. The experiments are well written and the result is significant.

### Weaknesses
The weakness is listed as below:
1. It is unclear given the graphical information encoded during the pre-training phase, if the proposed model G2PTL can be used to perform graph-related tasks such as link prediction and clustering. The proposed downstream tasks focus on text related tasks only. It is likely due to non-symmetric roles that the graph and the text plays for the design of the model. We would like to see the performance of the graph-related downstream tasks such as link-prediction, node classification based on fine-tuning of this model. 
2. This paper used less than 100K samples in the pre-training. It is unclear how the performance of the model scale with the sample size. Since both graph and text are used in the training, it is interesting to know if the model can still train with just text information
3. The inference for the model may need to have completed graph. This is a limitation for its widely use since most of applications do not have a complete graph at hands for inference.

### Questions
1. At inference time, do I need to have graph as input besides the text input for this model? From the model design, it seems that the graphomer is used in the model, thus I would expect edge and node input for the model? If the task is just address normalization without graph input, can we still use this model?
2. Do we need to have a correct geographical map before using the proposed model in real life? What if the map is incorrect? How robustness of this model when the graphical information in inference time is noisy? 
3. How large the graph do we need to prepare before using this model for address normalization? Do we need to have a global map or local map? If only local maps are used, is it possible that this method cannot learn the address similarity beyond a local region?
