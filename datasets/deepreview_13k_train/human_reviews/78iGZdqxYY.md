- Decision: Accept
- Scores: 6, 6, 6, 6

## Abstract
\vspace{-0.1in}
\gnns, like other deep learning models, are data and computation hungry. %Furthermore, they often find themselves in situations where they need to be repeatedly trained or operate under low-resource environments. Hence, 
There is a pressing need to scale training of \gnns on large datasets to enable their usage on low-resource environments. Graph distillation is an effort in that direction with the aim to construct a smaller synthetic training set from the original training data without significantly compromising model performance. While initial efforts are promising, this work is motivated by two key observations: (1) Existing graph distillation algorithms themselves rely on training with the full dataset, which undermines the very premise of graph distillation. (2) The distillation process is specific to the target \gnn architecture and hyper-parameters and thus not robust to changes in the modeling pipeline. We circumvent these limitations by designing a distillation algorithm called \name for graph classification. \name is built on the insight that a message-passing \gnn decomposes the input graph into a \textit{multiset} of \textit{computation trees}. Furthermore, the frequency distribution of computation trees is often skewed in nature, enabling us to condense this data into a concise distilled summary. By compressing the computation data itself, as opposed to emulating gradient flows on the original training set—a prevalent approach to date—\name transforms into an architecture-agnostic distillation algorithm. Extensive benchmarking on real-world datasets underscores \name's superiority, showcasing enhanced generalization accuracy, data compression, and distillation efficiency when compared to state-of-the-art baselines.

### Summary
This paper proposes MIRAGE, a model-agnostic graph distillation method for graph classification task. Specifically, the authors first observe that existing graph distillation methods still rely on training with the full dataset and specific to GNNs architectures and hyper-parameters. To this end, MIRAGE can tackle these two limitations via decomposing input graphs into computation trees. The long-tailed frequency distribution of the computation tree enables the graph distillation with a high compression ratio. Experiments demonstrate the superiority of MIRAGE in terms of its effectiveness, compression ratio, and distillation efficiency.

### Strengths
1.	This paper is well-organized and easy to follow.
2.	The idea of making graph distillation model-agnostic is interesting and meaningful in practice. 
3.	The proposed data-centric solution is a natural way to mitigate model hyperparameter dependency using the frequency distribution of the computation tree.

### Weaknesses
 1. Motivations: 
- (a) Problem Motivation: In the abstract, one of the identified limitations pertains to the reliance on training with the full dataset. To provide a clearer argument regarding the necessity of full dataset training for existing methods and the distinct advantages of MIRAGE, we should consider the following: What is the comparative performance of existing distillation methods (e.g., gradient matching) when applied to both randomly initialized and well-trained models? Is there a substantial performance gap between the two scenarios? Regarding computational costs in the distillation process, it's worth examining the resource requirements for calculating the computation tree frequency distribution, particularly in the context of deep GNNs. How does this computational overhead compare to training models on the full dataset?  
- (b) Technical Motivation: While the concept of the computation tree is inherent to GNNs, we should address the sufficiency of the frequency distribution for the computation tree. Key points to explore include: Why is maintaining a high computation tree frequency distribution sufficient for effective learning? What is the distribution pattern of the computation tree, and does it exhibit a long-tail distribution?

2. Objectives: Ideally, the distillate data should mirror the distribution of the full dataset, implying that the gradients of the distillate data should align with those of the full dataset for any model (random or well-trained). It's essential to clarify that while distillation can reduce computation costs, the primary objective remains data distillation. Additionally, considering the architecture transferability for existing graph distillation methods, the advantage of model-agnostic techniques is not significant.

3. Experiments: 
- (a) Comprehensive Model Comparison: In evaluating baselines, it would be beneficial to perform a comprehensive comparison across various model architectures. Specifically, assessing performance across different architecture pairs would enhance the evaluation's robustness and provide insights into transferability.

- (b) Baselines and Model Initialization: Investigate the significance of GNN model training prior to distillation for baselines. Explore performance outcomes for well-trained, randomly initialized, and warm-up trained models. Understanding the effectiveness of random initialization can help determine the necessity of training on the full data for baseline methods.

- (c) Hyperparameter Investigation: Explore the impact of different hyperparameters, such as threshold values and the number of hops, on various metrics, including accuracy, efficiency, compression ratio, and transferability.

- (d) Trade-off Analysis: Provide insights into the trade-off between accuracy, efficiency, and compression ratio. Understanding these trade-offs can offer valuable guidance for practical applications.

### Summary
This paper studies a new graph distillation approach called MIRAGE for graph classification, which addresses limitations in existing methods. MIRAGE leverages the idea that message-passing GNNs break down input graphs into computation trees with skewed frequency distributions, allowing for concise data summarization. Unlike traditional methods that emulate gradient flows, MIRAGE compresses the computation data itself, making it an unsupervised and architecture-agnostic distillation algorithm.

### Strengths
1. It is crucial to address the issue of existing costs in training large-scale graphs through graph distillation, as it remains an under-explored problem.
2. It is interesting to observe how the authors have proposed an unsupervised approach for graph distillation, eliminating the requirement for parameters and model architecture, and still achieving comparable performance to the original dataset.
3. The methodology is interesting, and the performances achieved by their approach are amazing.

### Weaknesses
1. In the results presented in Table 2, why there is a discrepancy compared to those from the original DosCond paper? Could the authors clarify why the authors deviated from the settings employed in the DosCond paper?

2. It would be beneficial if the authors could delve deeper into the sensitivity of their approach with respect to distillation parameters \theta_1 and \theta_2. Undertaking further experiments to report the performance across varied distillation parameters might offer greater insights, given that these parameters significantly influence the size of the distilled dataset. 

3. On the ogbg-molhiv dataset, could the authors provide an explanation for the better performance observed achieved by distilled data compared to the original dataset.

4. As we are removing the nodes that exist in the less-occurring computational trees, how can we be sure that we are not losing important information in the dataset (especially since this process does not consider the feature information)?  Can authors justify it theoretically or/and empirically by running some experiments?

### Questions
My major questions are on the experimental evaluation. It would tremendously strengthen this work by addressing the concerns listed in the Weakness section.

### Summary
This paper presents a model-agnostic graph distillation algorithm for graph classification, which aims to distill the original graph dataset into a small and compact synthetic dataset maintaining competitive model performance. It is pointed out that existing distillation methods typically rely on model-related information and need to train on the full dataset, resulting in poor generalization and efficiency issues, respectively. To address these weaknesses, MIRAGE directly compresses the computation trees to synthesize datasets by mining sets of frequently co-occurring items. This is inspired by the observation that the distribution of the computation trees, formed by decomposing graphs based message-passing GNN frameworks, always exhibits high skewness. Therefore, it is possible to approximate the true graph representation by aggregating the root representations of only the highly frequent trees. Extensive benchmarking demonstrates the superiority of MIRAGE.

### Strengths
1. This paper distills the original graph dataset into a novel form, namely the sets of computation trees, instead of traditional feature and structure information, i.e. X’ and A’.

2. This paper not only improves generalization by avoiding model-related computation but also addresses the limitation of the traditional distillation step that necessitates training on the entire dataset.

3. MIRAGE demonstrates superiority from various metrics, i.e. predictive accuracy, distillation efficiency, and data compression rates.

### Weaknesses
1. Unlike DOSCOND and KIDD, MIRAGE seems infeasible to be generalized to node classification tasks.

2. There is no theoretical analysis nor experimental proof to investigate the error when approximating the true graph representation by aggregating the root representations of only the highly frequent trees.

3. MIRAGE compresses the computation trees by mining the set of frequently co-occurring items. However, we can consider an extreme situation in which two computation trees are co-occurring in all graphs, but their frequencies in each graph are very low. So, these trees can’t approximate the true graph representation, which will destroy the synthetic dataset performance.

4. The synthetic dataset can solely be used to train GNNs based on the message-passing framework, but can’t used to train certain spectral GNNs, such as ChebyNet with multiple propagation steps.

### Questions
1. Original dataset labels are still used during the distillation procedure. So is it a strictly unsupervised algorithm from this perspective?

2. There is no clear statement about how Figure 1 is plotted. And I can't get what the x-axis and y-axis represent, respectively.

### Summary
This paper introduces a graph classification model called MIRAGE, which is a graph distillation method based on frequent pattern mining. MIRAGE takes advantage of the design features of the message passing framework, decomposes the graph into calculation trees, and uses the distribution characteristics of the calculation tree to compress calculation data. Compared with existing graph distillation algorithms, MIRAGE shows advantages in key indicators such as prediction accuracy, distillation efficiency, and data compression rate. Furthermore, MIRAGE only relies on CPU operations, providing a more environmentally friendly and energy-efficient graph distillation method.

### Strengths
1. It is a novel idea to transform the graph distillation problem into the problem of graph decomposition.
2. This paper clearly expresses the distillation problem in mathematical language and naturally transforms it into a graph decomposition problem.
3. The experimental configuration is described in detail, and the experimental results are good and reasonable.

### Weaknesses
1. The datasets used in the experiment is too small.

### Questions
1. Would MIRAGE still be as effective if used on a very large data set?
2. Why is MIRAGE, which only uses the CPU, so much faster than DOSCOND and KIDD, which can use the GPU?
3. If a datasets is large, but its global computation tree is very similar, will such a datasets affect the effect of MIRAGE?
4. How will MIRAGE perform in multi-classification tasks?
