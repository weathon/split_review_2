- Decision: Accept
- Scores: 6, 6, 6, 5

## Abstract
Proteins can be represented in various ways, including their sequences, 3D structures, and surfaces. While recent studies have successfully employed sequence- or structure-based representations to address multiple tasks in protein science, there has been significant oversight in incorporating protein surface information, a critical factor for protein function. In this paper, we present a pre-training strategy that incorporates information from protein sequences, 3D structures, and surfaces to improve protein representation learning. Specifically, we utilize Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) for learning surface characteristics, and name it ProteinINR. We confirm that ProteinINR successfully reconstructs protein surfaces, and integrate this surface learning into the existing pre-training strategy of sequences and structures. Our results demonstrate that our approach can enhance performance in various downstream tasks, thereby underscoring the importance of including surface attributes in protein representation learning. These findings underline the importance of understanding protein surfaces for generating effective protein representations.

### Summary
Proteins can be represented in many different ways (sequence, structure and surfaces). While the sequence and structure based representations have been explored a lot in the literature, surface based representations have not been explored. This paper proposes a pretraining strategy that incorporates all three modalities for protein representation learning. They propose Implicit Neural Representations to learn the surface characteristics of proteins.

### Strengths
- The proposed method is novel and is the first method to use surface based pretraining for proteins. This could open up further avenues of study.
- Incorporates several advances from computer vision (DeepSDF, DSPoint, KPConv, decoder by Lee et al., 2023 etc) into the protein domain.
- The evaluation is fair and is done against state of the art methods.
- Pretraining is done on a large number of structures
- The paper is well written and easy to follow.

### Weaknesses
 - Performance of the method is more or less in line with existing work (ESM-Gearnet-MC), with any improvements being marginal for some tasks.
- Some more abalations/baselines would clarify the contribution of the surface based features  (see questions section).

### Questions
1. Why do you think is the performance so much dependent on the pretraining order (Table 3). Please clarify this in the paper.
2. Does seq->surface->3d structure outperform seq->structure->surface for all tasks? Table 3 only shows EC.
3. It would be interesting to see if we can avoid the structure encoder altogether by just relying on sequence and surface features.
4. In Table 1, it would be nice to have the performance on just ESM.

### Summary
This paper introduced a protein multimodal representation learning by leveraging information from protein sequence, structure, and surfaces. Specifically, the authors proposed a model which uses INR to encode protein surface information by using point cloud representation and fused it into the structure embedding. Empirically the authors have shown the performance boost comparing to the original baseline methods which only use structure information.

### Strengths
1. This paper has shown that fusing protein surface data with protein structure data generates better protein representation that benefits various downstream tasks.
2. The proposed ProteinINR architecture is modularized and the encoders can be easily replaced by other implementations.
3. Various downstream tasks experiments are performed. 
4. Clear description of training procedures and descriptions of the training data usage.

### Weaknesses
1. Lack of in-depth analysis on the effect of pre-training order. In Table 3, it is shown that GearNet-INR-MC performs better than GearNet-MC-INR for both $F_{max}$ and AUPR, however, no further analysis is provided. Specifically, it is unclear why pre-training the structure encoder before the surface encoder leads to better performance. The authors should investigate the feature space learned by each encoder to understand this phenomenon. For instance, analyzing the similarity of the learned embeddings or visualizing the feature space could provide insights.
2. INR seems only work well when both structure and sequence information are present. In Table 2, both GearNet-INR-MC and GearNet-INR have similar performance as their counterparts. Only ESM-GearNet-INR-MC shows relatively bigger improvements comparing to ESM-GearNet-MC. This suggests that the surface information encoded by INR is not effectively utilized when sequence information is absent. The authors should explore if the INR module is learning redundant information with the structure encoder or if the surface information is only useful when combined with sequence embeddings. It is also important to investigate the individual contributions of each modality.

### Questions
1. Why does pre-training order impact the EC tasks? Does this observation apply to other downstream tasks as well?
2. How does batchsize in finetuning affect the overall downstream performance?
3. In section 4.1.4, how is the clamp value decided?

### Summary
While there are numerous works on pre-training protein representations, most studies have focused on sequences-only, structures-only, or a hybrid of sequences and structures. This work proposes to further incorporate protein surface information for the pre-training. It employed a series-fusion approach where a model is pre-trained in the order of sequences, surfaces, and structures. Another essential part of the work is in the surface encoder which learns Implicit Neural Representations. The surface encoder is based on a proposed ProteinINR framework which consists of a transformer encoder on top of a point encoder, a structure encoder, and spatial latent representations. The experiments demonstrate that ProteinINR can reconstruct protein surfaces pretty well and the pre-trained representations outperform previous SOTA on several downstream tasks.

### Strengths
According to the authors’ claim, this is the first work to propose a pre-training scheme for protein representation that incorporates sequence, structures, and especially surfaces. The authors adopted several ideas from previous works to develop ProteinINR which can effectively learn surface characteristics of proteins. I think they mostly explained the proposed method clearly with appropriate background information and without overstating their contributions. They demonstrate the proposed method is effective in learning better protein representations. The significance of the proposed method could vary, but I believe it can help a broad range of researchers with proper further actions.

### Weaknesses
- [Reproducibility] Although the authors provided implementation details, they didn’t have any statements regarding public availability. Since the point of pretrained representations is in using them for various downstream tasks, I think that their significance becomes quite small without making ways to obtain the pretrained representations publicly available.
- [Ablations] Would it be possible to develop a surface encoder without implicit neural representations? While the authors discussed the advantage of INR compared to previous methods to represent surfaces, current experiments do not show how important INR is compared to them. It's unclear if the performance gains are solely attributable to the INR or if other surface representation methods could achieve similar results with proper tuning.
- [Experiments] One of the clear weaknesses of the proposed approach is that it eventually relies on pretraining the structure encoder, GearNet. In other words, it's only applicable for downstream tasks where protein structures are known, which might be the most important in a real world. I'm curious whether authors have thought about downstream tasks where only sequences are available and structures are not. It would be interesting to see how the performance of pre-trained models changes with the usage of predicted protein structures (maybe from AlphaFold) instead of the true ones.

Minor comments
- [Introduction] It would be nice to have more explanation on protein surface characteristics, particularly regarding the relationship between structural features and molecular surfaces. Unfamiliar readers might think that surface information is already well-contained within 3D structures, such that cannot clearly understand the need for incorporating surface information for the pre-training.
- [Figure 2] xyz seems to indicate coordinates, but it's inconsistent with notations from the texts.
- [Sec 4.1.1.] Does the protein encoder mean point encoder? Due to the prevalent terminologies (point encoder, structure encoder, protein encoder, etc.), there seems to be a little confusing use of terminologies. The authors might want to take a look into the issue.
- [Experiments] Can you further provide the performance of ESM-GearNet-INR? It would help to show the effectiveness of INR with sequence pretraining but without structure pretraining.
- [Sec 5.3] It would be better to explain the Chamfer distance.

### Questions
- [Reproducibility] Do you have plans for making pre-trained representations and both training/evaluation codes publicly available?
- [Ablations] Can you show how INR is important in the pre-training framework compared to previous methods to represent 3D surfaces?
- [Experiments] Have the authors checked the possible inclusion of data from downstream tasks within the pre-training data? 
- [Experiments] Can the pre-trained representations be helpful for downstream tasks where only sequences are available and structures are not?

### Summary
This paper proposes to jointly pretrain protein surface and structure based on the pretrained ESM-1b. Consequently, the final protein representation includes three-kind information, which are protein sequence, surface, and structure. The pretrained protein representations are finetuned on three downstream tasks, which are enzyme classification, gene ontology term prediction and fold classification. The propose model performs best in most cases among all the ablation models.

### Strengths
As far as I know, this paper is the first one to involve surface information into protein pretraining, and then applied the pretrained protein representations for downstream protein understanding tasks.

### Weaknesses
1. **Many of the components used in the proposed method are not new.** For example, for surface preparation, the paper just followed the apporoach proposed in [1]. For surface dowmsampling, the paper use DSPoint method.  For latent representation learning, the paper follow Spatial Functa. It seems the proposed method combine several existing modules to get a new pipeline.

2. **The paper lacks some important baselines.** In the main results, the paper only compares to the ablation models, which seems not enough. At least, the paper should compare to [1], [2]. Besides, the paper seems lacks the baseline of directly finetuning ESM-1b (ESM-2). I don't know how much benefits  that adding the additional surface and structure pretraining will bring to directly finetuning ESM series.

3. **Some claims are not right.** In the first several lines of page 6, the paper mentioned "Incorporating these characteristics into the point cloud encoder leads to the formation of embeddings that encompass both the surface’s geometric structure and chemical attributes." On the surface, the author only used atom category and distance, which are chemical features. For geometric features, the author may need to calculate Gaussian curvature, mean curvature, heat kernel signature and something like that, which are geometric features. Besides, I think the calim "pre-training sequence, structure, and surface features" might be not true because there is no sequence pretraining stage involved. Instead, this paper used pretrained ESM-1b, and continued pretraining based on this model, which is continual learning.

4. **The paper missed some important details.**  For example, in SDF, we need the atom type for the current vertex and its neighbors. However, the author didn't mention what atoms they used. The four atoms on backbone? Or the full 44-kind atoms as in AlphaFold2?

5. **Function evaluation:** It's just a suggestion. One of the most important motivation of this paper is: surface encodes the function of proteins, so involving surface can get better protein representation. Therefore, it's very natural to apply the learned protein representations to prediction the protein functions. However, the paper didn't do such kind of experiments. I suggest the author add some protein function evaluation, such as protein fitness landscape.

### Questions
I also have the following questions:

1. In 4.1.1, N= 16384. What does N refers to? Residue number? R refers to this. Number of vertices on surface? But in 5.1, the author mentioned they sampled 500,000 points for each protein. Besides, Does 500,000 sample points refer to the point cloud after downsampling? According to my opinion, using MSMS, there would be 100-120 vertices around each residue, which means 500,000 points at least represents a protein with length 5,000. That is a very long sequence. I don't believe the average minimum length of the pretraining proteins is 5,000.

2. In Figure1, there is surface encoder and sequence encoder. In title 4.1.1, there is protein encoder. In title 4.1.3, there is Transformer encoder. It's kind of confusing. The author may need to unify the name and give an overall description.

3. Why the author used ESM-1b instead of ESM-2. ESM-2 performs better.

4. In Figure 3, is the reconstructed mesh obtained through the donwsampled vertices? And the original one is the one generated by MSMS?
