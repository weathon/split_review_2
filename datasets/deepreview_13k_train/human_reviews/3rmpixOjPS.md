## Abstract
Large-scale Vision Transformers have achieved promising performance on downstream tasks through feature pre-training. However, the performance of vanilla lightweight Vision Transformers (ViTs) is still far from satisfactory compared to that of recent lightweight CNNs or hybrid networks. In this paper, we aim to unlock the potential of vanilla lightweight ViTs by exploring the adaptation of the widely-used re-parameterization technology to ViTs for improving learning ability during training without increasing the inference cost. The main challenge comes from the fact that CNNs perfectly complement with re-parameterization over convolution and batch normalization, while vanilla Transformer architectures are mainly comprised of linear and layer normalization layers. We propose to incorporate the nonlinear ensemble into linear layers by expanding the depth of the linear layers with batch normalization and fusing multiple linear features with hierarchical representation ability through a pyramid structure. We also discover and solve a new transformer-specific distribution rectification problem caused by multi-branch re-parameterization. Finally, we propose our Two-Dimensional Re-parameterized Linear module (TDRL) for ViTs. Under the popular self-supervised pre-training and supervised fine-tuning strategy, our TDRL can be used in these two stages to enhance both generic and task-specific representation. Experiments demonstrate that our proposed method not only boosts the performance of vanilla Vit-Tiny on various vision tasks to new state-of-the-art (SOTA) but also shows promising generality ability on other networks. Code will be available.

### Summary
This paper aims to improve the potential of vanilla lightweight ViTs by exploring the adaptation of the re-parameterization technology to ViTs for improving learning ability during training without increasing the inference cost. The authors propose to incorporate the nonlinear  ensemble into linear layers. They increase the depth of the linear layers during the re-parameterization training stage. And they re-scale the features with $\sqrt(N)$ rather than normalize it in Scaled Dot-Product Attention to solve a transformer-specific distribution rectification.

### Strengths
-1- The motivation of this paper is clear.

-2- The pyramid multi-branch topology, i.e., n-th rep-branch with $L_n$ basic units is interesting.

### Weaknesses
-1- In the Sec 3.2 Main Architecture, authors use P-WNS to denote the architecture with Width of N rep-branch, what about the different $L_N$ in every rep-branch in the P-WNS? And there is only 1$\times$1 (without K$\times$K) in linear projection, the accuracy gaps in different configurations of "pyramid multi-branch topology" seems minor (Figure 2a).

-2- About the baseline performance. Table 1 reports the performance improvement on ViT-B, with the distillation phase in pre-training. Why the proposed TDRL should be combined with distillation? Why not use a stronger and simpler baseline such as DeiT-B (can obtain 81.8 top-1 accuracy on ImageNet)?

-3- The claim that "Linear stacking with batch normalization can be regarded as a non-linear operation in the training stage" is not mathematically accurate. Batch normalization, while adaptive, is inherently a linear operation. The combination of linear layers and batch normalization remains a linear transformation, and the non-linearity is introduced by the activation functions, which are not the focus of the re-parameterization in this work. This point needs further clarification and justification.

### Questions
In Sec 3.2, the authors claim that "The linear operation in transformers focuses more on intra-token semantic mining rather than inter-token spatial exploration. Linear stacking is inherently appropriate to transformer networks." I think the authors should explain this in more details. I am confused why Linear stacking is inherently appropriate to transformer networks.

### Summary
This paper addresses the problem when using re-parameterization to boost vanilla lightweight ViTs. The main problem is that vanilla Transformer architectures are mainly comprised of linear and layer normalization layers, which do not complement with re-parameterization. This paper incorporates the nonlinear ensemble into linear layers. It also discovers and solves a new transformer-specific distribution rectification problem. It performs lots of experiments in order to verify its effectiveness.

### Strengths
The paper is generally well-written, clearly structured, and quite easy to follow.
The target issues of the paper are meaningful and worth exploring. The motivation is clear.
This submission gives a valuable implementation of such an idea.

### Weaknesses
1. To some extent, this paper lacks novelty. The intra-branch fusion and inter-branch fusion are commonly seen techniques in the re-parameterization of CNN networks, as shown in Sec 3.1. This paper only applies this technique to ViTs. Although the targeted module is changed from convolutions to linear projections, this modification is straightforward. This paper uses an additional batch normalization to modulate Q^{'} and K^{'} and names this operation a distribution rectification operation. This operation is quite simple.

2. In Table 1, TDRL only outperforms D-MAE-Lite for 0.3 (78.7 vs. 78.4). The advantage does seem not significant.

### Summary
The paper introduced a new reparametrization approach for ViTs. Unlike standard reparametrization methods only considering convolution layers with kernel sizes larger than 1, this paper studied how to reparametrize the linear layer, the fundamental building block for Vision Transformers. By combining features from multiple branches with different depths, the proposed method exhibited improved performance for ViT-Ti and some other tiny ConvNet-based architectures on ImageNet classification and MSCOCO object detection benchmarks.

### Strengths
1. To the best of my knowledge, the proposed method, TDRL, is the first one tailoring for the reparametrization of the linear layer, and thus for ViTs. This is important, particularly for the tiny models, because pure ViTs lag behind the ConvNets and hybrid models due to the lack of inductive bias and inadequate capacity. Reparametrization, training with extra parameters but shrinking back at the inference stage, is a good way to fit more knowledge into the models without incurring extra inference costs.

2. TDRL seems to be a generic method and can be applied to many architectures, e.g., VanillaNet, and different tasks, e.g., DDPM, with linear layers.

3. With the help of varied-depth branches and feature rectification, TDRL achieves promising results on classification and dense prediction tasks, especially the latter.

### Weaknesses
1. All the experiments are conducted with tiny or small models and a few pre-training epochs. I am curious whether TDRL would still be beneficial for larger models and when using larger epochs, since reparametrization works for ConvNets with various capacities. This might further strengthen the paper.

2. I noticed that the gain from TDRL is considerably larger on dense prediction tasks. Do the authors have any explanation for it? Is it due to the use of BN in TDRL since some dense prediction tasks favor architectures with BN? If so, can the authors isolate the contributions of reparametrization and BN?

3. Certain parts of the presentation could be further improved. For example, Fig. 1c does not help grasp how to do intra/inter-branch merging.

### Summary
This paper proposes a reparameterization technique to improve performance of lightweight vanilla ViT. The reparameterization technique is used in CNNs but surprisingly unexplored in ViTs. The paper presents a linear-based re-parameterization for vanilla Vision Transformers, without any convolutional operations. The authors introduce a specific linear stack with batch normalization for added nonlinearity and a pyramid multi-branch structure for feature fusion. They also highlight the importance of distribution consistency in deep networks, especially for ViTs, and introduce a Two-Dimensional Re-parameterized Linear module (TDRL) to address this. To enhance re-parameterization, different depths of linear stacks are used to create a pyramid multi-branch structure. Since this multi-branch structure can lead to instability in training,  authors suggest 1) an additional batch normalization to modulate the distributions of Q and K in the attention mechanism to rectify the distribution changes. 2) For other components like Feed Forward Networks (FFN), where the variance change isn't as drastic as in attention calculation, features are re-scaled using the square root of N instead of being normalized.

### Strengths
1. The paper looks into reparameterization technique for ViTs performance improvement. The technique that is common in CNN but overlooked in ViTs
2. The proposed TDRL architecture seems to ensure diverse feature spaces among branches, enhancing the model's representation capabilities. TDRL seems to me a modular design that can replace any linear layer in ViTs

### Weaknesses
1. The authors experiment on the vanilla ViT-Tiny model. It is not clear what would be the impact of this TDRL module if applied in other tiny transformers such as Swin-tiny etc.
2. The introduction of multiple branches and added nonlinearity might lead to overfitting, especially on smaller datasets. I don't see the authors discussing anything around it

### Questions
1. Can you discuss on the computational complexity of the TDRL architecture?

5: You are absolutely certain about your assessment. You are very familiar with the related work and checked the math/other details carefully.

### Summary
The paper proposes a new re-parameterization technique for tiny vision transformers. They stack multiple branches with different numbers of linear layers with BN, and the whole branches can be merged into a single linear layer during inference. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

### Strengths
The paper is technically sound and easy to understand. The method of reparameterization on the linear layer is shown to be useful and easy to implement.

The experimental results are rich and show the effectiveness of the proposed method.

### Weaknesses
The way of merging a stack of linear layers with BN has already been studied by [1].

You mentioned several times that BN can be used in between layers for nonlinearity, and the proposed re-parameterization method is nonlinear. Why does BN have nonlinearity? Isn't the proposed method a linear ensemble re-parameterization structure?

Why is the experimental setting based on MIM? What is the performance of training ViT with the proposed method on ImageNet directly? What is the performance of training vanilla ViT with MIM?
