- Decision: Reject
- Scores: 6, 5, 6

## Abstract
Long-tail learning primarily focuses on mitigating the label distribution shift between long-tailed training data and uniformly distributed test data. However, in real-world applications, we often encounter a more intricate challenge where the test label distribution is agnostic. To address this problem, we first theoretically establish the substantial potential for reducing generalization error if we can precisely estimate the test label distribution. Motivated by the theoretical insight, we introduce a simple yet effective solution called label shift correction (LSC). LSC estimates the test label distribution within the proposed framework of generalized black box shift estimation, and adjusts the model predictions to align with the estimated distribution. Theoretical analyses confirm that accurate test label distribution estimates can effectively reduce the generalization error. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms previous state-of-the-art approaches, especially when confronted with non-uniform test label distribution. Notably, the proposed method is general and complements existing long-tail learning approaches, consistently improving their performance.

### Summary
Motivated by the observation that real-world test distributions are not uniform, the paper proposes label shift correction (LSC), a method for test-agnostic long-tail learning. LSC does not require access to the truth test label distribution, but instead estimates it through a generalization of Black Box Shift Estimation (BBSE) with logit clipping. LSC empirically achieves SOTA accuracy on long-tail image classification tasks under different test distributions, and works well with existing long-tail learning methods.

### Strengths
The method is motivated from a Bayesian perspective. LSC exhibits strong empirical performance over baselines assuming a uniform target label distribution. Furthermore, it synergizes with existing long-tail learning methods. Moreover, as shown in Table 4, it consistently improves the performance for any test distribution. Last but not least, the paper provides ample ablation study to dissect LSC.

### Weaknesses
BBSE is not the best performing in label-shift estimation. In particular, [1] points out that an MLE-based approach called MLLS dominates BBSE. The statistical inefficiency is confirmed by LSC's suboptimal performance on "Backward" test distributions (it should be as good as "Forward"), so the authors' choice of BBSE seems unjustified. Moreover, the GBBSE requires re-sampling multiple subsets, which might take non-trivial time to train. The paper does not adequately address the computational overhead of the GBBSE resampling process, especially with large datasets and a high number of resamples. The performance on "Backward" distributions, while improved, still lags behind "Forward" distributions, suggesting a fundamental limitation in the approach's ability to fully compensate for the data imbalance. The logit clipping, while empirically effective, lacks a strong theoretical justification and might be masking underlying issues with model calibration, potentially leading to suboptimal performance in scenarios where the base model is already well-calibrated.

### Questions
You employ logit clipping to address overconfident logits for tail classes. Is that related to the miscalibration of neural networks? While BBSE itself does not require well-calibrated logits, miscalibration might be an issue when you clip unnormalized logits to zero. I suggest looking into bias-corrected temperature scaling (BCTS), which is a component of the MLLS method discussed in [1]. My intuition is that you don't need logit clipping after calibration.

### Summary
This paper proposes a simple yet efficient method called label shift correction (LSC) to estimate a more accurate test label distribution for addressing the problem of test-agnostic long-trailed learning. The proposed method is motivated by the theoretical insight, which indicates that precise estimation of the true test label distribution can reduce the generalization error. Compared with BBSE, they propose a generalized version called GBBSE to align the predicted test label distribution with the true test label distribution via a family of parameterized label distribution estimation functions.

### Strengths
1. **[The question is important in practice.]** In the real world, the condition of the test label distribution is often infeasible to obtain. Thus, it is important to propose a general method for handling different distribution-shift scenarios.
2. **[The motivation of this paper is clear.]** The authors have theoretically certified that better alignment between the predicted test label distribution and the true test label distribution leads to lower generalization error. Therefore, readers can clearly understand the reasons why they focus on label shift correction.

### Weaknesses
1. **[Writting about the proposed method is confusing.]** In my view, there are several points in Section 3 making me confused. (1) Your proposed method is LSC, but I notice that you use a lot of space to introduce GBBSE. So what is the connection between LSC and GBBSE? Specifically, it's unclear if GBBSE is a theoretical framework, a more general method, or a specific implementation. The paper should clearly delineate the relationship between these two. (2) What does $g_{\theta}$ refer to in your experiments? Is $g_{\theta}$ equal to NeuralEstimator? The paper lacks a clear definition of $g_{\theta}$ and its role in the overall method. It's not clear how this function is parameterized and optimized. (3) Since the training dataset is imbalanced, how can you sample a subset of the training dataset when its smallest class should be the biggest class in the subset? The sampling strategy for creating subsets with different label distributions is not sufficiently explained, especially considering the original imbalance. It's unclear how the method avoids simply replicating the original imbalance in the subsets, and how the smallest classes are adequately represented when they should be the largest in the subset. 

2. **[The highlight of the proposed method is not clear.]** The goal of LSC is to find an estimator $g$ that aligns the predicted test label distribution with the true. But in Line 7 of the pseudo-code, $g_{\theta}$ aims to align subset label distribution with the prior global label distribution on the training dataset. So can you explain which step achieves this goal? It's not clear how aligning with the prior global distribution helps in estimating the true test label distribution, which is the stated goal of LSC. The connection between the training objective and the final goal is not clearly established.

3. **[Your theoretical analysis cannot explain why your proposed method can align the discrepancy between the predicted and the true test label distributions.]** You have mentioned two theorems in your paper. However, both of them only certify that a smaller gap between predicted and the true test label distributions leads to a lower generalization error. They do not explain why your proposed method can effectively estimate the true test label distribution. The theoretical analysis does not provide a mechanism for why the proposed method can accurately estimate the test label distribution. The theorems only show the benefit of having a good estimate, but not how the method achieves it. There is a lack of theoretical justification for the core claim of the paper.

### Questions
1. Please answer the questions mentioned in the first part of Weakness.
2. Can you explain which step achieves the alignment? 
3. Can you theoretically analyze why this method can align the predicted and the true test label distribution?
4. What is the effect of $\lambda$ on the final performance? Why do you choose the value of $\lambda$ as 1.5?
5. Does the number of sampling subsets of the training dataset affect the final performance?

### Summary
This paper considers test-agnostic long-tailed recognition, where the training distribution is long-tailed and the test distribution can be different from the training distribution, not necessarily uniform but unknown. Based on the theoretical results showing that if one can estimate the test label distribution, it can be possibly used to reduce generalization error even with the distribution shift during training and test time, this paper proposes a label shift correction (LSC) method. LSC estimates the test label distribution using the trained neural estimator and the predicted logits for test data using the pre-trained model. The neural estimator is trained to minimize the distance between the estimated distribution using the logit output of the pre-trained model and the true label distribution, for various label distributions generated by sampling training data while varying class priors. Also, the adaptive logit clipping is introduced to clipping spurious model outputs. The authors demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed method on CIFAR-10/100-LT and ImageNet-LT and also show that the proposed method can be combined with existing LT method to further boost the performance.

### Strengths
- Demonstrated that estimating the test label distribution and correcting prediction of the model using the estimated test label distribution is an effective way of boosting the classification performance in long-tail learning.
- Proposed a simple yet effective method to estimate the test label distribution by training a neural estimator using various label distributions generated by sampling training data while varying class priors. Proposed an adaptive logit clipping method that turns out to be important in adjusting the predictions and effectively choosing the promising $k$ in an adaptive fashion.

### Weaknesses
 - The proposed method was not evaluated on general test label distributions, but rather on three limited types, forward, uniform and backward. How does the performance of the proposed method change as encountering more general label distribution shift? Specifically, the evaluation should consider more complex shifts, such as those with multiple modes or non-linear changes in class probabilities, to assess the robustness of the approach.
- The effectiveness of neural estimator in correcting the label distribution shift may highly depend on how many ($Q$ in Alg. 1) and diverse class priors have been encountered during the neural estimator. The authors need to explain more about this and the corresponding overhead in training. For example, when the test distribution has imbalance ratio (backward with 200), can the proposed method, which only experienced the imbalance ratio of range [1/100,100], correctly estimate the test label distribution? It is unclear how the method would perform if the test distribution has a class prior outside the range seen during training of the neural estimator, and whether the neural estimator can extrapolate effectively to such unseen distributions.


### Questions
- More elaborations on Eq. (5) is needed. First, it is unclear how $\hat{Z}^h_{ij}$ and $\hat{Z}^t_{ij}$ are defined. The authors comment that $\hat{Z}^h$ and $\hat{Z}^t$ are the sum of head and tail parts in $\hat{Z}$. Then, what does index $j$ mean in $\hat{Z}^h$ and $\hat{Z}^t$? Can the authors elaborate why the optimal $k$ maximizing (5) results in a higher value for the backward case and lower for the forward case?
