- Decision: Accept
- Scores: 6, 6, 6, 8

## Abstract
Conventional causal discovery approaches, which seek to uncover causal relationships among measured variables, are typically fragile to the presence of latent variables. While various methods have been developed to address this confounding issue, they often rely on strong assumptions about the underlying causal structure. In this paper, we consider a general scenario where measured and latent variables collectively form a partially observed causally sufficient linear system and latent variables may be anywhere in the causal structure. We theoretically show that with the aid of high-order statistics, the causal graph is (almost) fully identifiable if, roughly speaking, each latent set has a sufficient number of pure children, which can be either latent or measured. Naturally, LiNGAM, a model without latent variables, is encompassed as a special case. Based on the identification theorem, we develop a principled algorithm to identify the causal graph by testing for statistical independence involving only measured variables in specific manners. Experimental results show that our method effectively recovers the causal structure, even when latent variables are influenced by measured variables.

### Summary
This paper addresses the challenging issue of causal discovery in the presence of latent variables. It considers a general scenario in which both measured and latent variables collectively form a partially observed causally sufficient linear system, allowing latent variables to be situated anywhere within the causal structure. The paper establishes a theoretical foundation, demonstrating that with the application of high-order statistics, the causal graph can be (almost) fully identified. This identification is achieved under the condition that each latent set contains a sufficient number of pure children, whether they are latent or measured variables. Importantly, this extends beyond LiNGAM, a model without latent variables.

Expanding on the identification theorem, the paper introduces a systematic algorithm for identifying the causal graph. This algorithm involves three iteratively executed phases that sequentially identify latent variables and infer causal relationships among both latent and measured variables. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of the proposed method in accurately recovering the causal structure, even when latent variables are influenced by measured variables.

### Strengths
They have introduced an algorithm that extends the LiNGAM algorithm to accommodate latent confounder conditions. Moreover, they do not impose any constraints on the presence or positioning of latent variables. Additionally, their algorithm has the capability to handle overlapping variables within the discovered latent sets.

Clarity: The paper is well-organized, with examples that effectively demonstrate how the algorithm functions.

### Weaknesses
The paper  appears to have no discernible weaknesses. It seems to be well-structured and comprehensive, with ample supporting materials in the appendix. The methodology and presentation seem robust.

Given that I am not an expert in this domain, I might leave the 'weaknesses' section blank for the time being and await feedback from other reviewers during the rebuttal phase.

### Questions
1. The decomposition of atomic units among latent variables is not unique, correct? If so, how can this be proven? If not, could this potentially impact the final results?

2. What is the computational time required for this algorithm?

### Summary
In the paper, the authors suggest a general version of LiNGAM, called PO-LiNGAM, where the existence of latent variables is permitted. While previous Linear non-Gaussian variants assume either no-latent variable, specific position or the number of latent variables , the proposed method relaxes such assumptions. When reconstructing a causal graph, the authors use a set of variables called the atomic unit, which represents the basic building block of casual structures. The PO-LiNGAM identification procedure consists of three step: (Phase 1) : Identify a leaf node and its parents; (Phase 2): Discover atomic units; and (Phase 3) : Refine the atomic units. Discovering relationships between atomic units is based on theorems under GIN (Generalized Independent Noise) condition which is an existing graphical condition for identifying a latent hierarchical structure.

### Strengths
In order to alleviate the strong assumptions of existing linear non-gaussian models, the authors cluster the variables into atomic units and obtain the information of latent variables from their measured descendants, called the measurement surrogate variable set. In other words, the authors establish the theorems, which view the existing GIN condition from the perspective of the atomic unit. This approach actively utilizes linear transitivity to infer latent variables. The author clearly describes the entire process of the method, and helps the reader's understanding by showing various examples. A sufficient amount of experiments demonstrates the validity of the paper.

### Weaknesses
The contribution of the model PO-LiNGAM is that it is free from assumptions about latent variables compared to existing models. However, for the algorithm to work properly, each atomic unit must have a sufficient number of pure atomic unit children. It is difficult to say that this is not a strong condition. The authors are aware of this issue and presented relaxing this as future work. One thing to add is that the only explanation of notations in the paper is provided through table 1 in figure 1. It is difficult to clearly understand the notations just from the table. For example, in definition 3, the term 'pure atomic unit child' is used for the first time. However, no clear explanation for this term is provided. It would be better if more specific notation explanations are added.

### Summary
The problem of causal structure learning with latent confounders is considered, with linearity and non-Gaussianity assumptions, and an additional assumption relating to notions of atomic units and their pure children in the graph. A completeness theorem is given showing structures can be learned up to atomic units and experiments on both generated and real data are done.

### Strengths
The work is well-situated within the causal structure learning literature, where various classes of assumptions are studied. In this context the additional graphical assumptions that they consider are novel and interesting. As far as I can tell, the results are sound and the experimental results are demonstrative.

### Weaknesses
The presentation is somewhat dense. See questions below.

The work introduces novel graphical assumptions related to atomic units and their pure children, but the practical implications and limitations of these assumptions are not fully explored. Specifically, the identifiability condition (PO-LiNGAM) relies on the existence of a sufficient number of 'pure children' for each latent variable, and it's unclear when this condition would realistically hold. The paper states the assumptions clearly, but lacks a discussion of the scenarios where these assumptions might be violated, which would be very helpful in understanding the scope of the proposed method. Without concrete examples, it's difficult to assess the practical relevance of the theoretical results.

### Questions
Can the authors give real examples of when the assumptions relating to atomic units (PO-LiNGAM identifiability condition, including part b) would be reasonable to assume, and when they wouldn't? This would help me get a better grasp of the significance. As it stands we have these assumptions that are clearly stated but I don't know when they can really be made.

### Summary
The paper proposed a new causal discovery method for partially observed linear non-Gaussian acyclic model where the structure of observed and latent variables can be quite general. Their algorithm is an iterative one with each iteration consisting of three phases: identifying leafs, identifying atomic units, and refining atomic units. They establish the identifiability of their method under two conditions: (a) any latent variable is in at least one atomic unit and (b) the non-overlapping parts of two overlapping atomic units do not influence each other.

### Strengths
1. The causal structure among latent and measured variables are quite general
2. Despite the generality, the causal graph can be identifiable when the two identifiable conditions are met.

### Weaknesses
The main weakness I find is the clarity of the writing, which hinders my ability to fully understand the method (hence the current rating). There are a number of places that need to be clarified. Please see my questions below.

One minor weaknesses: the authors used V, boldfaced V, and script V, which can be somewhat hard to read especially the latter two both denote sets. Use a different letter may help. It is particularly confusing in the first line of Definition 3 where script V and boldfaced V are used.

Q1: How to understand the second bullet point of Definition 3? Does "not partially or fully covered" simply mean intersection is empty?
Q2: Can the authors summarize how their identifiability conditions in relation to existing identifiable conditions for similar models?
Q3: How does condition (a) imply every latent variable must have measured variables as its descendants?
Q4: Definition 5 is a little hard to understand. What is the definition of surrogate variable? How to understand the terms "can be" and "can have" in the definitions? And is the last sentence an assumption? What do you mean by non-redundant set?
Q5: In the last sentence of the first paragraph in Section 3.3, "decomposable atomic units" are not atomic units by definition, right? How "decomposable atomic units" arise from Phases I and II?  
Q6: Section 3.4 assume oracle independence test I assume?
Q7: Corollary 3: what "parts" of Phase I&II need to be specified. Additionally, do the authors mean "no latent variables" instead of "no latent confounders" in the last sentence of the corollary?
