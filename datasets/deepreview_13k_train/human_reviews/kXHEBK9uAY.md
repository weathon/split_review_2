## Abstract
Diffusion-based generative methods have proven effective in modeling trajectories with offline datasets. However, they often face computational challenges and can falter in generalization, especially in capturing temporal abstractions for long-horizon tasks. To overcome this, we introduce the \emph{Hierarchical Diffuser}, a simple, fast, yet surprisingly effective planning method combining the advantages of hierarchical and diffusion-based planning. Our model adopts a ``jumpy'' planning strategy at the higher level, which allows it to have a larger receptive field but at a lower computational cost---a crucial factor for diffusion-based planning methods, as we have empirically verified. Additionally, the jumpy sub-goals guide our low-level planner, facilitating a fine-tuning stage and further improving our approach's effectiveness. We conducted empirical evaluations on standard offline reinforcement learning benchmarks, demonstrating our method's superior performance and efficiency in terms of training and planning speed compared to the non-hierarchical Diffuser as well as other hierarchical planning methods. Moreover, we explore our model's generalization capability, particularly on how our method improves generalization capabilities on compositional out-of-distribution tasks.

### Summary
This paper proposed a modified version of the diffuser called Hierarchical Diffuser.  The Hierarchical Diffuser incorporates a two-tiered approach: a high-level "jumpy" planning strategy that can quickly survey a broader scope of possibilities with reduced computational demands, and a low-level planner that refines these broader plans into specific, actionable steps. This hierarchy allows the method to operate more efficiently and effectively, with the higher level providing guidance that simplifies the task for the lower level. Empirical evaluations show that this method outperforms both traditional diffusion-based planners and other hierarchical approaches in speed and performance on standard offline reinforcement learning benchmarks.

### Strengths
- Using a hierarchical structure makes sense in long-horizon planning. 
- In replanning, a hierarchical structure is more efficient since it only needs to use low-level to 
- Show the relationship between kernel size and generalization.

### Weaknesses
 - Current SOTA diffusers seem to have a better performance. For example [1] have a 167 score on large maze2d.
- The Unet itself has a hierarchical structure. If an environment needs a hierarchical structure, a simple way is to increase the depth of the Unet. The authors might need to provide more results to show that they are better.
- The improvement in Mujoco is not enough for me.
- The paper said that they have evaluated generalization. However, the OOD task they test on is too simple. In other papers, harder OOD tasks are tested.  [1] add coins. [2] add obstacle. 
- For hierarchical structure, it is important to ensure it is smooth on the connection points. However, the paper didn’t talk about it.
- Since it can only improve one of third environments, it is not that clear if it is something that can improve the method consistently.

### Questions
I don’t understand the meaning of SD-DA. It seems like only improves the performance of walker2d. I feel like predicting so detailed actions loses the benefit of high-level planning.

### Summary
The paper proposes Hierarchical Diffuser (HD), a sub-goal based method for planning with diffusion models. In recent literature, Diffuser [1] was proposed to plan an optimal sequence of state and action between initial state and goal. Following diffuser, the authors design two diffusers. One diffuser plans for sub-goals between the start and the goal state. For each sub-goal segment, the second diffuser plans the optimal state-action sequence. Experiments are conducted on Maze, AntMaze, MuJoCo Gym and FrankKitchen benchmarks. The performance of HD is compared with relevant offline RL and hierarchical RL algorithms. Further, the experiments show improved receptibility, OOD generalization and less computation overhead as compared to diffuser. Relevant ablations are performed.

### Strengths
Discretizing planning into sub-goals with diffusion models is shown to be advantageous as more diverse scenarios can be solved. Low-level diffusion planning becomes task-agnostic.

Even the sparse diffuser or SD version is better than diffuser because of increased receptive field. The authors validate this by showing that increasing the kernel-size (hence the receptive field) of diffuser leads to better performance but weaker generalization.

SD with dense actions leads to better fitting of the sparse objective, a typical bottleneck in hierarchical RL.

HD takes lesser time than Diffuser due to shorter high-level sequence and parallelly solving low-level plans for all the segments.

### Weaknesses
The formulation has limited novelty. While a single diffuser is not sufficient for planning over long-horizons, the work introduces two diffusers: one sparse diffuser for planning sequence of sub-goals between initial state and goal, while a standard diffuser solves for individual sub-goal segments.

Given that there are also methods which perform state-only diffusion like Decision-diffuser [2], is it possible to perform relevant ablations to justify why states are not sufficient for having a good estimate of $J$? If you are following diffuser’s codebase, are you using the diffusion sampled actions or a separate controller for Maze2d tasks like diffuser?

Solving for sub-goals independently without the knowledge about the final goal might lead to non-optimal behavior. How do you ensure that the sampled path for one segment does not overlap with the paths for the other segment? How many trajectories do you sample for individual segments and for the sub-goal sequence?

Also, what happens when actions do not lead to the exact sub-goal (unless you use inverse dynamics actions) for the maze case? Because there is no-feedback from the low-level diffuser to high-level diffuser, it might become challenging.

Overall, I acknowledge that the presented method is a promising revision of Diffuser which performs better in all aspects. However, I believe that the contributions are not significant enough.

### Summary
The authors of this paper present Hierarchical Diffuser, a simple yet effective hierarchical planning approach using diffusion models to improve the performance and efficiency of diffusion-based planning for long-horizon tasks. By utilizing a two-pronged structure, the Hierarchical Diffuser combines a high-level planner, the Sparse Diffuser, to generate sub-goals, and a low-level planner to refine the plan. This approach significantly outperforms non-hierarchical planning methods, while also enhancing computational efficiency in training and planning speed. Furthermore, the method displays improved generalization capabilities on out-of-distribution tasks compared to non-hierarchical Diffusers.

### Strengths
- Originality: This work creatively combines the strengths of hierarchical planning and diffusion models, achieving significant improvements in performance and computational efficiency compared to existing methods.
- Quality: The contribution provides a thorough theoretical analysis of the method, backed by well-designed experiments and in-depth analyses. The authors emphasize the rationale behind the design decisions and the resultant benefits of their approach.
- Clarity: The paper is well-organized, clearly written, and explains the method along with its advantages and limitations in a coherent and accessible way.

### Weaknesses
 - Considering the existence of the HDMI algorithm, the contribution of this paper are limited. However, compared to HDMI, this paper has conducted extensive experiments on generalization and provided corresponding theoretical support. One suggestion I have is that the authors can emphasize the advantages of Hierarchical Diffuser from the perspective of generalization, and highlight the algorithm's generalization performance in the experimental design.
- In the hierarchical framework, the quality of the generated high-level goals is crucial to the effectiveness of the algorithm. The authors emphasize that the Hierarchical Diffuser is simpler compared to existing hierarchical methods but have only designed one goal selection method. In addition to the fixed time interval heuristic method used in this paper, HDMI also mentions two heuristic methods based on spatial intervals and reward scale, which are equally simple and have low implementation costs. If the authors could take these heuristic methods into consideration, I believe it would have a positive impact on the completeness of the paper's content. Furthermore, the demonstration of the quality of the generated goals is essential, and there is a gap in this aspect in the current paper.

### Questions
- I have noticed that both Diffuser and Decision Diffuser employ “inpainting” techniques for trajectory generation in goal-conditioned tasks and the lower-level planner of HDMI. However, this paper utilizes return-guided sampling. What were the considerations behind the authors' choice between the two methods?
- This paper proposes to get the sub-goals first with the planning-based subgoal extractor and then train HDMI with the sub-goals as supervision. Although this two-step process makes sense, the overall training process becomes ad hoc and less general. Is there any connection between the upper and lower layers of Hierarchical Diffuser's planner? Can it be trained end-to-end?

### Summary
The paper proposes an hierarchical variant of Diffuser. The algorithm involves using a high-level planner that plans trajectories in a sparser manner and a low-level planner that adds detailed states to the trajectories produces by the high-level planner. Experiment result demonstrate that hierarchical planning produces better performance in long-horizon planning tasks and offline RL tasks. The authers also study the impact of kernel size in Diffuser and the impact of the jumpy steps. An interesting observation is that Diffuser with a small receptive field can not cover the data distribution well.

### Strengths
1. The paper is well-written and easy to follow.
2. The method is straightforward and demonstrates strong results in long-horizon planning tasks, especially the AntMaze.
3. The study of relationship between receptive field of the diffusion model and the data coverage ratio is interesting and offers valuable insight for futher research on diffusion models for planning in more complex domains.

### Weaknesses
One minor weakness is that the baseline Decision Diffuser[1] is missing. Also the study presented in this paper focuses on using the CNN architecture as Diffuser does. A comparison between using CNN and transformer architecutre, such as Decision Diffuser, would be encouraged. The paper does not adequately address the potential limitations of using a PD controller for low-level action generation, especially in scenarios where precise control is needed. The reliance on a PD controller might introduce inaccuracies or oscillations in the executed trajectory, which could be a significant factor in the observed performance differences. Furthermore, the paper lacks a detailed analysis of the computational cost associated with the hierarchical approach, particularly in comparison to standard Diffuser models. This is important because the increased complexity of a hierarchical model could lead to higher computational demands, which might limit its applicability in resource-constrained environments.

### Questions
1. According to Fig 3., Diffuser with a small kernel size covers one mode of the data distribution during actual execution. Is it the case that the standard Diffuser is able to \textbf{cover} the full data distribution but just fails to achieve full data coverage during actual execution? If so, what might be the cause the such gap?
2. Still concerning Fig 3., although HD seems to cover most of the data distribution, HD fails to cover two short segments/branches. Why does such pheomena occur?
