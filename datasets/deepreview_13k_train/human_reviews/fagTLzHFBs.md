# LDINet: Latent Decomposition and Interpolation for Single Image FMO Deblatting

- Decision: Reject
- Scores: 3, 6, 8, 5

## Abstract
The image of fast-moving objects usually contains a blur stripe indicating the blurred object that is mixed with backgrounds. To deblur the stripe and separate the object from the background in this single image, in this work we propose a novel LDINet that introduces an efficient decomposition-interpolation module (DIB) to generate the appearances and shapes of the objects. In particular, under the assumption that motion blur is an accumulation of the appearance of the object over exposure time, in the latent space the feature maps of the long blur is decomposed into several shorter blur parts. Specifically, the blurry input is first encoded into latent feature maps. Then the DIB module breaks down the feature maps into discrete time indexed parts corresponding to different small blurs and further interpolates the target latent frames in accordance with the provided time indices. In addition, the feature maps are categorized into the scalar-like and gradient-like classes which help the affine transformations effectively capture the motion of feature warping in the interpolation. Finally, the sharp and clear images are rendered with a decoder. Extensive experiments are conducted and has shown that the proposed LDINet achieves superior performances compared to the existing competing methods.

### Summary
This paper introduces a network to interpolate deblurred images with respective object alpha matte for single image with fast moving object. In the proposed network, the features are affine transformed to generate the features in arbitrary time steps. Also, 'scalar fields' and 'gradient fields' are considered in the network. The provided experimental results show the proposed method performs better than other methods. This paper is poorly written and should not be accepted in its current form.

### Strengths
The provided experimental results show the proposed method performs better than other methods.

### Weaknesses
1. The novelty is quite limited.
2. The authors fail to provide evidence of why the proposed method works. Also, the presentation of this paper is too poor to be fully understood. For example:
(1) More details should be added to discuss the difference between the proposed network and the prior work DeFMO and describe why the proposed method is better.
(2) What are scalar-like and gradient-like feature maps? How does the network get them? Why are they so important? It also lacks an ablation study to validate it.
(3) The detailed process from eq. 3 to eq. 5 is not clear which makes it hard to understand. Also, how this process is presented in Fig. 2 is also not clear.

### Summary
This paper tackles the problem of FMO deblurring. The goal of this paper is to separate the object from the background and recover the appearance of the foreground object for each time stamp during the exposure time. In particular, the proposed method decomposes the latent space into a few latent segments. A pair of latents could be related by the predicted affine transformations from a pair of time stamps. And the latent at any time stamp could be interpolated from the disentangled latents and it could be decoded to reconstruct the mask and image at time t. The method is evaluated on FMO deblatting benchmark which shows promising results, outperforming existing methods on two out of three existing datasets.

### Strengths
+ The idea is promising in recovering the appearance of the FMO and has potential to reconstruct the sharp image of FMO at any time during the exposure time.
+ The decomposition of the latent into a set of latent segments which are responsible different latent frames. The interpolation network could lead to the reconstruction of the latent at any time within the exposure time.

### Weaknesses
1) Convolution is defined as a linear combination of the signals within a spatial window in an image. However, it is not clear to the reviewer why we need to further decompose the convolution as a linear combination of summation and series of directional derivatives. What is the benefit of this further decomposition? It seems that the Taylor expansion of the latent is applied at time t to approximate the latent at any time t? It was not clearly motivated in the paper. The paper does not explain why this specific decomposition is beneficial for the task of FMO deblurring, nor does it provide any ablation studies to justify this design choice. The connection between this decomposition and the subsequent affine transformation is also not well-established, leaving the reader to wonder if this is a necessary step or an arbitrary design choice.
2) Affine transformation. The paper mainly describes what has been implemented to approximate the affine transformation via prediction of two affine transformations (one is computed from I_t to I_t’ and the other one is computed from I_t’ to I_t). Would this be redundant as one transformation should be the inverse of the other? The paper does not discuss the potential for error accumulation when using two predicted transformations instead of enforcing a single transformation and its inverse. This approach also introduces additional parameters and computational overhead, which should be justified with clear performance gains. The lack of discussion about the potential for instability or ill-conditioning in the predicted affine transformations is also a concern.
3) Eq.10 is not correct. It should be the Frobenius Norm for computing the relative distance between two matrices not the standard MSE. 
4) There is no guarantee that the predicted affine transformation is invertible. While losses are introduced to guide the learning process, no hard constraint is enforced in the framework. The paper should provide a more rigorous analysis of the invertibility of the predicted affine transformations. Without a hard constraint, it is unclear how the model is prevented from learning degenerate transformations that would render the latent space interpolation meaningless. The paper should also discuss the implications of non-invertible transformations on the overall performance of the method.
5) All the equations should be written properly. D is referred to as the domain for the pixel coordinate. However, no index ever appears in the loss function for Eq. (5,6,7,8). The lack of proper indexing in the loss functions makes it difficult to understand how the losses are computed and applied. The paper should provide a clear definition of the domain D and ensure that all equations are consistent with this definition. The current notation is ambiguous and could lead to misinterpretations of the proposed method.
6) No supplementary is provided in the submission. Could the authors show the recovery of the appearance of the FMO in a video as the proposed method can reconstruct the image at any time within the exposure time? The qualitative results in Figure 6 in the appendix cannot demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. The masks recovered by the proposed method and DeFMO look the same.

### Questions
-Please addressed the concerns mentioned above in the weakness section. 
Overall, the idea is promising. The only concern from the reviewers is about the motivation of representing convolution as the scalar and directional derivative field. The equations could be improved. The quantitative results are not impressive. It would be great to show more qualitative results.

### Summary
This paper solves a temporal super-resolution task to deblur images of fast-moving rigid objects in static scenes. The method is heavily built on top of the DeFMO method, with several improvements that lead to better qualitative and quantitative scores. Most importantly, the authors encode the input and produce several latent feature maps, which correspond to different time stamps of the underlying motion. Then, these feature maps are interpolated using a new Decomposition-Interpolation Block. Finally, the object is then decoded and rendered at the required time index. The method is trained on a synthetic dataset, but it shows good generalization capabilities since it is evaluated on three real-world datasets. The design choices are evaluated in an extensive ablation study.

### Strengths
- The proposed method builds on top of DeFMO and combines in an elegant way this data-driven approach with an idea of piece-wise linear appearance changes from TbD-3D. 
- The whole decomposition-interpolation block seems to be well-designed and implemented. The idea of splitting the latent space into time-indexed pieces and then into scalar and gradient fields seems interesting, even though it requires more motivation and analysis.
- The method is extensively evaluated on three real-world datasets. Moreover, many ablation studies are performed, which highlight most of the design choices.
- The paper is mostly well-written and well-structured.

### Weaknesses
### **AffNet, scalar and gradient fields**
I do not fully understand why there is a need to split the latent space into scalar and gradient fields. I acknowledge that Table 4 shows that treating everything as scalar (the straightforward case) leads to slightly lower scores. However, I'd like to see an ablation where the feature maps are simply interpolated by linear interpolation. Wouldn't automatic backpropagation (e.g. in PyTorch) solve this? In this case, there is no need for AffNet. P_t's are simply interpolated and become Q_t, without any overhead from AffNet. This is a very important ablation. The current justification for the scalar and gradient split, relying on a connection to piece-wise linear appearance changes, is not sufficiently clear. The paper should provide a more thorough explanation of why this specific decomposition is beneficial, beyond the marginal improvement shown in Table 4. It's unclear if the improvement is due to the decomposition itself or if it's a result of the increased model complexity from AffNet.

On page 4, it says that P''(x) is equal to the gradient of the scalar field S_t, but the scalar field was already defined as P'(x). Is P'(x) = S(x)? The relationship between P'(x), P''(x), and S(x) needs to be clarified. The current explanation is confusing and potentially contradictory.

### **Changes w.r.t. DeFMO**
Many parts and loss functions are reused from the DeFMO method. However, some have been modified. For instance, the reconstruction loss compares generated images (I_t) concatenated with the background instead of comparing appearances (F_t), as in DeFMO. Is this change important? Does it bring improvement? It is not clear why this change was made and what the implications are for the training process and the final results. A more detailed explanation of the rationale behind this modification is needed.

### **Equation (6)**
The sum that denotes the number of pixels within the FMO blur should rather be written as $\sum_D \sum_{\tau} (M_{\tau} > 0)$. Otherwise, I don't understand how it can normalize the losses. Moreover, why is this normalization different for the first (without $>0$) and the second term (with $>0$)? The current explanation is unclear and needs to be more precise. The difference in normalization between the two terms is not well-justified, and the paper should provide a clearer explanation of the purpose of each term and why they are normalized differently.

### **Feature consistency loss**
Feature consistency loss (9) penalizes the differences between adjacent latent feature maps. It means that it's minimized when all latent maps are the same, which shouldn't be the case if the goal is to capture a moving object. This is similar to the time-consistency loss in DeFMO, which at least contains normalized cross-correlation that allows for some movement. In contrast, the feature consistency loss prefers only identical feature maps. The paper needs to justify why this loss is appropriate for capturing motion and how it avoids collapsing to a trivial solution where all feature maps are identical. The lack of any mechanism to encourage variation between feature maps is a significant concern.

### **Table 2 (arch)**
Arch. (bi-branched) ablation is not clear. The paper says that it provides improvement by separating the estimation of the appearance and the mask. Does it mean that otherwise, they are not separated? What does it even mean? This is very confusing. The description of the bi-branched architecture is vague and needs to be more precise. It's unclear how the appearance and mask are estimated in the single-branch case, and what the exact architectural differences are between the two configurations. A more detailed explanation of the network architecture is needed.

In general, I'd like to see more ablations on the architecture side, e.g. does it make sense to introduce AffNet at all? How is it dependent on pre-training?

### **Experimental results**
It's not clear how many times was each ablation/experiment run before reporting the results. Is it run only once? In general, it's always good to run many times and provide mean/std values of each score. For now, it's not clear how much the improvement is contributed by randomness. For example, in Table 3, when the number of parts is set to 20, the scores go down compared to 16. Is it expected?

### **Typos**
There are many typos in the paper:
- Abstract: with backgrounds -> with background
- Abstract: the feature maps of the long blur is -> are
- Abstract: experiments are conducted and has shown -> have shown
- Intro (p1): which is accordance -> is in accordance
- Conclusion: feature maps is -> feature maps are


### **Other comments**
- "Conventional methods mostly recover a clear image at the median of the motion": this is not true, I'd even say they recover a clear image at an arbitrary location of the motion.
- This method is not compared against SfB, which is fine since SfB is used more like a post-processing on top of DeFMO, meaning that the proposed method can actually be used to get better results from SfB. However, it would be really nice to see SfB results if this new method is used for silhouette estimation. I believe SfB would perform even better.

### Questions
- Are AffNet and separating gradient fields really necessary? 
- It would be helpful to add SfB results if sub-frame silhouettes are used from the proposed method as input.
- Please see the Weaknesses section.

### Summary
This paper proposes LDiNet, a novel network for FMO deblatting. The authors propose Decomposition-Interpolation Block (DIB) to break down feature maps into discrete time indexed parts and interpolate them accordingly to obtain the target frame. The authors identify the non-triviality of affine transformation in the latent space. To address this, they decompose each part of the latent representation into a scalar field and a gradient field and train an AffNet to estimate the affine transformation in the feature space. The authors also introduce several objectives to optimize the proposed network. The experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of LDiNet compared to existing methods.

### Strengths
1. The idea of interpolation by affine transformation in latent space to diversify the representations of different time indices is interesting.
2. The authors propose a novel technique to handle the non-linearity of affine transformation in the latent space. The observation that the convolution results can be decomposed into scalar fields and gradient fields is non-trivial.
3. The authors provide detailed training settings and comprehensive experimental results, including analysis of the effect of the parameters and some visualization results.

### Weaknesses
1. The contributions are somehow incremental. The encoder-decoder framework and most of the training losses mentioned in this article have already been proposed in DeFMO. 
2. Although interpolating in hidden space seems to have some intuitive benefits, and the proposed network achieve empirically improvements, the authors do not seem to provide ablation study to verify the improvement of DIB module. The authors should conduct further experiments to explore the impact of the DIB module and add some understanding experiments if possible to illustrate how DIB "exploits the intrinsic structure of the latent space" and thus benefiting the deblatting. Specifically, it's unclear if the performance gains are solely from the affine transformation or if the decomposition into scalar and gradient fields contributes significantly. An ablation study removing the decomposition and only using affine transformation would be beneficial. Furthermore, the lack of analysis on how the interpolation weights affect the final result makes it hard to understand the contribution of the DIB module.
3. I have some doubts about the performance of the proposed method. Though there are only three datasets evaluated in this paper, there are no improvements of PSNR and SSIM on TbD. The improvement of PSNR on TbD-3D also seems marginal. It might be more convincing if the authors ran multiple random seeds and provided the mean and standard deviation or provide results on more datasets.

### Questions
1. I'm puzzled as to why the weights in the formula at the bottom of page 4 (which has no formula label) are set this way and why they serve the purpose of "fully leverage the information from both the two neighboring parts."
2. I would like to know the training cost of the proposed method compared to DeFMO if possible.
3. Could you explain the motivation for choosing the direction with a smaller relative error rate when determining the trajectory direction?
