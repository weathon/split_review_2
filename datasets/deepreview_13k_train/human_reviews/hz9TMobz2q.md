# Push: Concurrent Probabilistic Programming for Bayesian Deep Learning

- Decision: Reject
- Scores: 8, 3, 3, 3

## Abstract
We introduce a library called \lang{} that takes a probabilistic programming approach to Bayesian deep learning (BDL). This library enables concurrent execution of BDL inference algorithms on multi-GPU hardware for neural network (NN) models. To accomplish this, \lang{} introduces an abstraction that represents an input NN as a particle. \lang{} enables easy creation of particles so that an input NN can be replicated and particles can communicate asynchronously so that a variety of parameter updates can be expressed, including common BDL algorithms. Our hope is that \lang{} lowers the barrier to experimenting with BDL by streamlining the scaling of particles across GPUs. We evaluate the scaling behavior of particles on single-node multi-GPU devices on vision and scientific machine learning (SciML) tasks.

### Summary
This paper describes a new probabilistic programming library called Push, for composing together
Bayesian neural networks. Through an actor-inspired concurrency model where neural networks
accept and send a collection of particles. This allows the system to readily encode scatter-gather
patterns that are very amendable to working on GPUs as well as scaling linearly with multiple
GPUs.

### Strengths
This is a very unique and original approach for representing Bayesian neural networks. The design
is well-thought out and the experiments are equally thoughtful. The paper is clearly written and
I can easily see others using and extending this work.

### Weaknesses
The paper says this architecture can support many BDL algorithms but only SWAG and SVGD are presented.
While I think it's too much to ask experiments to be done on more algorithms, it would be nice if
at a high-level it can be shown how many of the most popular BDL algorithms would be supported by
the Push library.

### Questions
What BDL algorithms could be represented in this library?
What BDL algorithms would be challenging to use with this library?

### Summary
This paper describes a Python library, "push", which can be used to orchestrate "particles" on a multi-GPU, single-host system, for experimentation in Bayesian deep learning. The paper provides timing results demonstrating that collective primitives such as all-reduce can provide speed benefits to SVGD relative to a baseline which does not replicate all-to-all. Extending to a multi-host distributed regime is left to future work.

### Strengths
*Originality*

The idea of a framework for orchestrating an ensemble of BNN samples is original. The particular realization here, with a Node Execution Loop and future-based async activity is perhaps novel (but I have questions)--although looked at through another lens, Java has had ThreadPoolExecutors and Futures, which facilitate async execution for quite a long time. Still, this might be new to the ML community, and the application to multi-accelerator, in Python, is much more relevant here than Java.

*Quality*

The experiments demonstrate reasonably well that push provides a low overhead approach to orchestrating various approaches to optimizing ensembles of NNs. User code is fairly readable (see appendix), though the async nature can make it a bit challenging to reason about what happens when.

*Clarity*

Exposition is clear, the work is well presented, the experiments are well explained. The basics of how the system is implemented are clearly explained, in particular noting "actor based" and "async-await" concurrency.


*Significance*

Having such a library available could be of interest to those in the Bayesian deep learning / BNN community. Arguably, a library that orchestrates asynchronous collective work across multiple accelerators is of interest to the community at large.

### Weaknesses
 *Originality*

See questions below, e.g. why not straight torch, why not JAX?

I'm not sure that treating a single realization of a torch.Module weights sample as a "particle" and calling that module functor a pushforward is particularly novel. NNs already claim to be "function approximators" -- the very fact that torch.Module implements `__call__` suggests this was self-evident to the implementors.

*Quality*

The work is more a presentation of a new async parallel collectives orchestration system embedded in Python, built around torch.Module, than a presentation of novel results achieved using the system. In the vein of "experiment quality", it would be more compelling to me to also see some experiments along the lines of "here's something we could do now, that we couldn't have done before". Could we get BNN samples of ViT which are competitive with or superior to those in uncertainty_baselines?

*Clarity*

I thought the work was presented clearly, don't have substantial concerns here.

*Significance*

I have some hesitation about venue. The work feels a bit more like something I'd read from MLSys or JStatSoft than from ICLR. Put another way, I am unsure how many ICLR attendees would be impacted by learning about such a system. On the one hand, I want this system to be of much more general interest (along the lines of "pytorch async orchestrator"); on the other hand, I believe systems already exist that provide such solutions, so perhaps specialization to the space of BDL/BNNs is helpful. But then, reading the user code required to implement such BDL solutions atop Push, it's not clear how specialized to Bayes the system really is.

### Questions
The most immediate question to my mind is, why is straight torch insufficient to the task? With primitives such as model.to(torch.device("cuda:0")), model.to(torch.device("cuda:1")), etc., we can control the GPU residence of torch models, and data transfers, without an intervening library.

The next question that comes to mind is, why not jax.pmap? https://github.com/google/jax#spmd-programming-with-pmap
All of the BDL proposals tested in this work can be implemented as pure functions of weights, and JAX provides collectives such as psum and all-gather https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/jax.lax.html#parallel-operators which seem to answer most of the useful parallel comms needs of push. Add to those a JIT compiler to manage memory and hide latency effectively.

Even if both of the above suggestions are for some reason deficient, it would be helpful to readers of the paper to elucidate reasons why.

### Summary
This paper presents Push, a Python library designed to ease the implementation of Bayesian deep learning (BDL) algorithms. A key feature of many BDL algorithms (e.g., Stein Variational Gradient Descent) is that during training, they evolve a *collection* of possible parameter settings for a neural network. Implementing this pattern efficiently can often require exploiting multiple GPUs to evolve particles concurrently. Push's key contribution is a new abstraction for concurrent programming across GPUs, based a centralized event loop that routes messages between concurrently executing particles. The paper provides a few demo implementations of BDL algorithms using the abstraction. In experiments, it demonstrates that Push's abstractions have only modest overhead (and can sometimes improve performance relative to naive baselines).

### Strengths
Overall, the authors appear to have created a useful library for an important task -- concurrent programming across many GPUs. I see several strengths of the work:

* This paper identifies a class of probabilistic models and inference algorithms that are underserved by current probabilistic programming languages. Both the algorithms (like SVGD) and the models (NNs with priors over extremely high-dimensional parameter spaces) are difficult to express in existing PPLs, and no PPLs (to my knowledge) provide explicit support for distributing inference computations across multiple devices.

* The Push library appears to address a real need: better programming models for concurrent programming across many GPUs. 

* The paper provides examples of several BDL algorithms implemented using the Push concurrent programming model, and experiments demonstrating that they can make effective use of additional available devices.

### Weaknesses
 **Relevance / value of the mathematical development.** Although it is described as a PPL for Bayesian deep learning, the actual technical content of Push does not appear to be specific to Bayesian deep learning (or any kind of probabilistic modeling and inference): it is a library for implementing algorithms that need to run various tasks concurrently across several GPUs, with some communication across tasks. The authors justify their BDL framing with a mathematical development (Sections 3.1, 3.3, 3.4; Appendix A) that treats the concurrent tasks as "particles" in a discrete approximation of a distribution. But the presentation (and why it matters) is somewhat unclear:
- Despite the insistence at several points that Push programs define *models* (e.g. in Sec. 3.3, or the top of Sec. 4), the code of a Push program appears to define neither a prior over the network weights nor a likelihood over the data. Rather, it directly implements an  algorithm, which may or may not be interpretable as a Bayesian inference algorithm in some model. The absence of a model makes it difficult to understand what the paper is saying at points. For example, the authors write, "The properties of the approximation (e.g., smoothness) depends on the interaction between particles encapsulated in a PD." What does smoothness mean here? What is being approximated? Or, in another spot, the authors write, "In general, a PD P(nn Θ) does not have a density... Assumptions that introduce densities open the possibility to apply more inference algorithms." But the term "PD" and the notation P(nn Θ) have previously been defined to refer to a discrete distribution of $n$ equally weighted particles, which can never have a (continuous) density function.
- Most practitioners of BDL will understand that inference is over the unknown parameters of a Bayesian network; the development of the "pushforward" view (inference is *really* over the random function implemented by the network) seems unnecessary. What is the value of this math for better understanding Push, or Push's design, or how to use the library effectively?

**Clarity of and motivation for the proposed technique.** The key automation that Push provides—managing the concurrent execution of multiple "particles" across GPUs—is not described with sufficient clarity. For example, the text says that "Each NEL contains a particle controller." But Figure 3 appears to show a single NEL with many particle controllers. As another example, there is no discussion of the order in which messages are processed or how the NEL decides which messages to process next. This seems consequential, because if the NEL is processing a message for which the receiving GPU is not available, it appears to "wait until the device is free" (instead of moving on to process more messages?). It is not clear whether the user can control (or whether the system attempts to optimize) placement of workers on different GPUs. More generally, I would like to see better motivation for the approach. What key challenges is Push addressing, and how is it addressing them? What space of designs was considered for the implementation, and what is good about the strategy you chose?

### Questions
1. Is there an intuition you can provide for what problem (if any) the program illustrated in Figs 1 and 2 is solving? (E.g., why has a user decided to write `_gather`?)

2. It seems somewhat unnatural to me that in your implementation of SVGD, the "leader" process needs to itself be a particle, rather than just a process that coordinates the other particles. At several points in the code you have to special-case the handling of the leader's parameters vs. everyone else's parameters. Why does Push require each "worker" in the concurrent algorithm to itself be a particle that is storing one set of weights for a neural network? Might it be more useful to present Push as a general-purpose library for concurrent programming on GPUs, with an application to BDL?

### Summary
The paper describes a library for distributed training of a particular form of Bayesian neural network. The library is based on PyTorch.

### Strengths
The paper describes a working library supporting Bayesian deep learning on multiple computing nodes. The paper is accompanied by the implementation's source code.

### Weaknesses
Despite the title and the abstract, it is not clear how the paper's contributions are related to either probabilistic programming or Bayesian inference. The library described in the paper implements a very basic communication protocol for distributed training, which is neither novel nor specific to Bayesian machine learning. The protocol is applied to a couple of training algorithms, for which distributed execution is either trivial (Ensemble, SWAG) or was explored and implemented in prior work (SVGD). 

The cited context of the paper is very broad, including general papers on probabilistic programming and  Bayesian statistical inference, however the paper does not  appropriately cite relevant work on Bayesian neural networks in probabilistic programming.  Contrary to what the paper states, Pyro, PyMC, and possibly other frameworks provide tools and tutorials for using BNNs in/as probabilistic programs, and training. Also, there is quite some work on describing inference and model on the same level in probabilistic programming, Gen being an example.  Publications accompany most of these innovations.  

Empirical evaluation: the library described in the paper was only applied to a couple training algorithms, and evaluated on rather trivial benchmark problems. There are little insights that can be drawn from such limited evaluation.
