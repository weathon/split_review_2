- Decision: Accept

## Abstract
Recent years have witnessed the rapid progress and broad application of diffusion probabilistic models (DPMs). Sampling from DPMs can be viewed as solving an ordinary differential equation (ODE). Despite the promising performance, the generation of DPMs usually consumes much time due to the large number of function evaluations (NFE). Though recent works have accelerated the sampling to around 20 steps with high-order solvers, the sample quality with less than 10 NFE can still be improved. In this paper, we propose a unified sampling framework (\frameworkshort{}) to study the optional strategies for solver. Under this framework, we further reveal that taking different solving strategies at different timesteps may help further decrease the truncation error, and a carefully designed \emph{solver schedule} has the potential to improve the sample quality by a large margin. Therefore, we propose a new sampling framework based on the exponential integral formulation that allows free choices of solver strategy at each step and design specific decisions for the framework. Moreover, we propose \nameshort{}, a predictor-based search method that automatically optimizes the solver schedule to get a better time-quality trade-off of sampling. We demonstrate that \nameshort{} can find outstanding solver schedules which outperform the state-of-the-art sampling methods on CIFAR-10, CelebA, ImageNet, and LSUN-Bedroom datasets. Specifically, we achieve 2.69 FID with 10 NFE and 6.86 FID with 5 NFE on CIFAR-10 dataset, outperforming the SOTA method significantly. We further apply \nameshort{} to Stable-Diffusion model and get an acceleration ratio of 2$\times$, showing the feasibility of sampling in very few steps without retraining the neural network.

### Summary
This paper proposes a framework to unify the existing Diffusion Probalisitc Model (DPM) solvers such as DPM-Solver, DPM-Solver++, UniPC and DESI. Under the framework, these methods can be represented with different options on some strategies and hyperparameters.
This paper shows the phenomenon that different solver strategies at different timesteps may yield different performances. This paper is inspired to design a schedule between different solving strategies during the sampling based on the unified framework. In this paper, the predicator-based method is proposed to schedule the solvers, which outperforms the SOTA solvers on several conditional datasets.

### Strengths
1. USF: This paper unifies the existing DPM solvers under a framework with detailed derivations and analysis, which provides a new perspective to review the DPM solvers and improve their performance in real applications.
2. $S^3$: This paper proposes the $S^3$ method which uses light predictors to search the solver schedule which demonstrates good performance on unconditional datasets with limited NEF.
3. Empirical Results: This paper has plentiful empirical studies. It demonstrates the situation that there is no single best solver under different timesteps. It also shows good performance compared with baselines and ablation studies on the consumption of generated images.

### Weaknesses
1. This paper illustrates the phenomenon that the suitable strategies vary among timesteps but has no further explanation on why this phenomenon happens. The proposed method paper may lack motivation.
2. This paper may lack novelty and contributions in the sense that it does not provide a further understanding of why suitable solvers are different on different timesteps. 
3. On empirical results, this paper may lack the results when the NFE is larger than 10. The gap between the baselines and the proposed method may decrease with larger NFE.

### Questions
1. Can you provide an intuitive explanation of the phenomenon observed in the paper? 
2. Can you add the experiment results on larger NFEs? Since the search method also has the time consumption, can you provide some experiment results on it?
3. Can you give a brief explanation of the meaning and effect of multi-stage in Algorithm 2?
4. Since the USF can include the method DEIS in the domain $t$, why do you not include this method as a baseline in experiments?

Here are some typos in App. D. In analyzing the current solvers, the index of $\tilde{x}_{i-1}$ may be incorrect.

They should be $t_{i-1}$ in DPM-Solver-2, DPM-Solver++(2S) and DPM-Solver++(2M). 

When using the Assumption in the Appendix, it may not be Thm A.1, A.2 etc.

### Summary
In this paper, the authors propose a sampling framework for diffusion models for the systematic study of solving strategies for diffusion models. Specifically, the authors explore the solver schedule in the following aspects: timestep discretization, prediction type, starting point, solver order, derivative estimation, and corrector usage. Experiment results show that the proposed method boosts the performance, especially in the regime of very few NFEs.

### Strengths
$\cdot$ This paper combines the AutoML methods into the diffusion sampling procedure. The authors explore the search space over timestep discretization, prediction type, starting point, solver order, derivative estimation, and corrector usage.

$\cdot$ The experiment results are appealing, especially in a few NFEs regime. The proposed method overperforms all baseline methods.

$\cdot$ The paper is overall well-written and the structure is clear.

### Weaknesses
$\cdot$ The experiment part seems to lack exact data on the computational cost of the overall pipeline of proposed methods. The overall pipeline needs iterative sampling images under a given sampling configuration, evaluating the performance and training of the proposed predictor models. Specifically, the authors should provide detailed data on the time required for each stage: sampling, evaluation, and predictor training. A table comparing the computational overhead of the proposed method against baseline methods would be highly beneficial for understanding the practical trade-offs involved.

$\cdot$ The content of section 4.2 is not well-organized and needs further explanation. The description of the predictor-based multi-stage search algorithm is difficult to follow. The authors should provide a more detailed step-by-step walkthrough of the algorithm, clarifying the role of the predictor in guiding the search process. A visual diagram illustrating the workflow would significantly improve the clarity of this section. Additionally, the authors should elaborate on how the initial population is constructed and how the predictor is trained and used to sample new solver schedules.

### Questions
Does the predictor model need to be trained separately on different NFEs?

### Summary
In this paper, the authors proposed a predictor-based search method that optimizes the solver schedule to get a better time-quality trade-off of sampling. It is based on a unified sampling framework (USF) to study the optimal strategies for solver. Therefore, it enables us to take different solving strategies at different time steps, and according to the authors' study, it has a considerable potential to improve the sample quality and model efficiency. Finally, the authors used extensive experiments to validate the method of a large number of datasets such as CelebA, Cifar-10, LSUN, ImageNet and so on. Also, the authors applied S^3 to Stable-Diffusion models, and achieve 2x acceleration without losing the performance on text-to-image generation task on MS-COCO 256x256 dataset.

### Strengths
1. The reference list of this paper is very complete and the authors introduced their differences and connections quite clearly.
2. The biggest strength of this paper is that, the experiments are really solid for me.

### Weaknesses
1. The only weakness for me is on the writing style:
(a) In Equation (1), dt and dw_t should be \mathrm{d} t and \mathrm{d}w_t. Similarly, in other parts of this paper, the authors sometimes use dt and sometimes use \mathrm{d} t. The notation should be unified. 
(b) In Equation (5), the \mathrm{d} t is missing in the right hand side of the equation. 
(c) For the Table 1, I suggest you using \bigstrut before each line to make the text shown in the middle.

### Questions
1. Can you briefly tell me the differences between this paper and Lu et al's DPM-solver++, since both of them seem to use different strategies as multi-step solver? What kind of improvements have you done in your paper compared with DPM Solver++?
2. If time is available for you, maybe you can follow my suggestions on writing in the previous section.

### Summary
To further improve the sample quality with less than 10 NFE, this paper proposed a unified sampling framework (USF) to study the optional strategies for solver. Specifically, USF splits the solving process of one step into independent decisions of several components, which also reveal that an appropriate solver schedules will benefit the quality and efficiency of diffusion models. Moreover, for each component, $\mathcal{S} ^{3}$ is proposed to search for optimal solver schedules in each time step automatically. Based on this framework, USF enables to achieve significant performance on various benchmark datasets when implemented to various diffusion models.

### Strengths
1.USF improves the sample quality with less than 10 NFE, which greatly benefits diffusion models in practical application. It unifies previous fast training-free samplers in every independent sampling process, which is very flexible and extensible.

2.The generated images are comparable to previous SOTA fast sampling method in various time step, which demonstrates the superior of USF.

3.In my humble opinion, the mathematical analysis is rigorous and can support the improvements on the experiment results.

### Weaknesses
1.The caption of Table 3 should be improved, it’s hard to figure our the meaning.

2.The search budget should be analysed more since it is very important to implement to previous diffusion models.

3.Why not demonstrated more categories of generated images when NFE is less? A fuller qualitative analysis would add strength on the USF.

4.How about the reproducibility of USF? Can you share the code? The open source code will help researchers continue to improve slow sampling speed since USF has great performance.

### Summary
The paper presents an AutoML-style experimental setup for searching optimal Diffusion Model sampler (solver). The authors, first noted the various “moving parts” of modern reverse process solver and then applied an evolution-based search technique to explore these while keeping track of FID under an NFE budget. Authors argued and validated that a non-uniform combination of these design choices in different timesteps is the key to reach optimal “solver schedule”. A lot of experiments are conducted to search through this space of solver schedules. In fact, they also proposes a special evolutionary search method S3 that does it more efficiently.

### Strengths
As far as I can tell, there hasn’t been such an effort to use AutoML setup for searching for better solver schedule — so it is indeed novel in some sense. Also, the large amount of experiments have been conducted, which can also be quite helpful for the community in general. The presentation/writing quality is also pretty good.

### Weaknesses
Here are some concerns I’d like to emphasize:

- The major weakness I see is that the paper can be called “just a search” without any solid conclusion. While I agree that figuring out good FID numbers for existing benchmarks is pretty good, it is not usually preffered to lock the contribution to very specific models/dataset/solver. If a new dataset/model/solver comes out in future, one need to perform the entire search again.
- The USF isn’t really something new. It is just a “dumb” aggregation of a bunch of design options. It is only based on empirical evidence — but I wonder if it can be theoretically justified.



### Questions
Here are some concrete questions I’d like the authors to answer.

- In high-level, it is not clear to me which part of the paper is being claimed to be the primary contribution — the search algorithm S3 itself, or the optimal solver schedules and corresponding FID numbers ? Is the paper supposed to be about the “search algorithm S3” or an empirical AutoML report ?
- If your focus is S3, there is surprisingly little written about it in the main paper. Almost all details are in supplementary. So that indicates it to be just an AutoML experimental report — is it ?
- Outright confession: I am not at all experienced in AutoML. So, is this S3 something novel or it is a usual practice in AutoML ? I don’t see any proper citation in case this has been adopted from existing literature/libraries.
- What exactly the paper “concludes” at the end the day — did you find any “pattern” in the optimal solver schedules that may motivate further work? I don’t see the exact configuration of the optimal solver schedules (found by S3) — are they written anywhere? You can certainly report the ones with low NFE. This is important for verifying them later on by others.

Couple of high-level points are unclear to me; so I am now going with a “below threshold” rating. I am open to increasing it depending on authors response, if satisfactory.
