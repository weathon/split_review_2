# HyperAttention: Long-context Attention in Near-Linear Time

- Decision: Accept
- Scores: 6, 8, 5

## Abstract
We present an approximate attention mechanism named ``HyperAttention'' to address the computational challenges posed by the growing complexity of long contexts used in Large Language Models (LLMs).
Recent work suggests that in the worst-case scenario, quadratic time is necessary unless the entries of the attention matrix are bounded or the matrix has low stable rank. 
We introduce two parameters which measure: (1) the max column norm in the normalized attention matrix, and (2) the ratio of row norms in the unnormalized attention matrix after detecting and removing large entries. We use these fine-grained parameters to capture the hardness of the problem. 
Despite previous lower bounds, we are able to achieve a linear time sampling algorithm even when the matrix has unbounded entries or a large stable rank, provided the above parameters are small. 
HyperAttention features a modular design that easily accommodates integration of other fast low-level implementations, particularly FlashAttention. 
Empirically, employing Locality Sensitive Hashing (LSH) to identify large entries, HyperAttention outperforms existing methods, giving significant speed improvements compared to state-of-the-art solutions like FlashAttention. We validate the empirical performance of HyperAttention on a variety of different long-context length datasets. For example, HyperAttention makes the inference time of ChatGLM2 50\% faster on 32k context length while perplexity increases from 5.6 to 6.3. On larger context length, e.g., 131k, with causal masking, HyperAttention offers 5-fold speedup on a single attention layer.

### Summary
The paper proposes a new approach of accelerating the computation of attention layer. The proposed method has near linear time (under plausible assumption on column norm) and demonstrates significant advantage in experiments.

The attention layer in Transformer requires $\Omega(n^2)$ computation given input sequence of length $n$, this costs is prohibitive for long sequence and there are many recent work on reducing this computation cost. The paper proposes a new approach that uses near linear time, when the column norm of the attention matrix (i.e., $\exp(KQ)$, where $K$ is the key matrix and $Q$ is the query matrix at attention layer) is small (or balance). This is a challenging task as one needs to take account into the softmax function. The algorithm first uses LSH to identify large entries, then apply fast approximate matrix multiplication by random sampling rows.

The paper also performs empirical study on real word dataset. When the sequence length is roungly 30k, the inference time decreases roughly 50% with a slight increase of perplexity (roughly 20% -- 50%, depend on the dataset and the number of layer replaced). The speedup is significant for longer sequence with one single transformer layer (up to 50x without causual masking and 5x with causual masking).

--------------------------------------------------------------------
I have read the author's response and I would keep my positive evaluation towards the paper. Personally I feel the paper could benefit from conducting more extensive experiments, but I feel the idea itself sounds interesting and it is worth publication.

### Strengths
The proposed approach has nearly linear runtime in theory (ableit with some assumptions) and has good performance in practice.

### Weaknesses
There is no major weakness.

The presentation is good overall, but the theory part could be improved.
For example, add in-line comments for algorithm description and give explanation on which steps the assumption are required.

### Summary
Authors propose a new LSH-based approximation algorithm for attention layer, called HyperAttention. Similar to KDEformer, authors aim to bound the operator norm of the error, and this is done by two-steps: approximating the normalization matrix, and the attention matrix. Both approximations are primarily based on sortLSH, as with KDEformer, although authors generalize the analysis to be applicable to other sketching algorithms. Subquadratic runtime is proved. For empirical experiments, authors evaluate with LongBench tasks, perplexity on LongBench. Wall-clock time of HyperAttention on 131k sequence is also measured.

### Strengths
Significance: This paper provides a new theoretically-grounded approximation algorithm for attention layers. The algorithm doesn't rely on kernel density estimation, and the analysis is more straightforward to associate the assumed properties of attention matrix with theoretical guarantees. Hence, future work will find it useful to build upon this work to adapt assumptions and derive new results. 

Originality: Although the algorithm is based on the same primitive sortLSH, as prior work KDEformer did, the actual algorithm is new. Also, authors generalize to other sketching algorithms as well, which makes a stronger connection to sketching literature.

Clarity: The overall proof strategy is clearly described. High-level intuition and interpretation of proof parameters are explained such that readers shall follow the main logic without having to read the proof. However, intuitive explanation of algorithms is mostly reserved to appendix, which is unfortunate but understandable given page constraints.

Quality: I wasn't able to closely verify proofs, but overall proof strategy of the work seems sound.

### Weaknesses
Empirical evaluations of this paper is not aligned well with prior work, which makes it difficult for readers to understand the practical usefulness of the proposed approach. For example, prior work KDEformer evaluates on BigGAN, ImageNet Classification, and Long Range Arena Benchmark, comparing against not only exact baseline but stronger baselines such as Reformer/Performer. While HyperAttention shared many similarity with KDEformer and claims to be more practical due to not using KDE, HyperAttention is not compared against KDEformer, making it difficult to see whether the difference between to actually make a practical difference. Also, end-to-end training experiment is lacking, and only forward/backward computation time was evaluated.

Although HyperAttention shares the overall proof strategy with KDEformer, they differ significantly in assumptions they make. I believe it is potentially a strength, as HyperAttention shall make more realistic assumptions and strengthen guarantees. However, it wasn't clear how HyperAttention's assumptions relate to KDEformer. A more detailed discussion of comparison between KDEformer and HyperAttention will clarify the theoretical contribution of this paper despite sharing the overall proof strategy.

### Questions
Eq (10) in Section 1.2 probably mean Eq(1).

In equation (5) in Appendix A, which result are authors using to prove this?

### Summary
The authors propose a method to reduce the computation complexity of transformers down from quadratic in squence length to near liner. The proposed idea proposes to perform sampling to approximate Attention. The authors claim that compared to prior works there proposed idea is practical and is able to outperform existing approaches.

The core idea is to perform sampling of the value matrix based on the norms and the \sigma(QK^T) matrix to come up with important entries.

### Strengths
1. I think this a resonably effective idea. The bounds provided are kind of standard and the paper is well structured.
2. The idea of separating into multiple matrix when performing causal masking is very interesting. I think this is a very nice contribution.

### Weaknesses
Before highlighting the weaknesses I would like to point out where my criticism's are coming from. More often then not in Machine Learning approximation results, I have personally observed that the approximation often takes more time than the actual operation, often due to hardware constraints, which makes the approach moot and impractical. Stating this most my questions are coming from a point of view to discern how realistic will these speedups be in real world. I hope the authors are not too bothered by my naive questions.

1. My first question is regarding evaluation. Are the speedups proposed end to end. As in the runtime reported in Figure 3(a) and 3(b) Figure 4 include the run time for generating the mask M_h . The reason I am a bit skeptical is that approximation using Algoirthm 1 does not look very GPU friendly to my naive understanding. And you have mentioned in your contributions (On Page 3) "We assume these procedures are fast, and that after removing the heavy entries, two parameters in the resulting attention matrix are small: (1) the max column l1-norm, and (2) the ratio of row norms in the un-normalized attention matrix." This makes me wonder if you include the runtime. I would ideally love to see a breakdown of the time spent in different procedures as that will help new and unfamiliar readers to understand how with your novel approach bottlenecks have shifted and where the new bottlenecks are.

2. For your proofs you assume the following - "To be more precise, we assume that for any i ∈ [n] there exists some α = no(1) such that D−1A · e(i) 2 ≤ αn ." Can you verify this assumption experimentally. I have generally found a proof to stand the test of time a bit more if the assumptions have some sort of experimental verification.

3. Do the authors have some understanding if there is better way of choosing the number of layers to use for their proposed "HyperAttention" mechansim. It currently feels arbitary to choose these layers. It would be interesting to understanding why it works in certain cases and where it doesn't.

4. The other thing I found missing is the "m" value (Algorithm 2). Can authors enumerate the "m" values used in their setup. Is it based on the bound or is it another hyper-parameter. Especially for long sequence results, since the accuracy can not be verified there it would be interesting to see the parameters which authors have used.
