# Grid Cell-Inspired Fragmentation and Recall for Efficient Map Building

- Decision: Reject
- Scores: 3, 3, 6

## Abstract
Animals and robots navigate through environments by building and refining maps of space. These maps enable functions including navigation back to home, planning, search and foraging. 
Here, we use observations from neuroscience, specifically the observed fragmentation of grid cell map in compartmentalized spaces, to propose and apply the concept of \emph{Fragmentation-and-Recall} ~(FARMap) in the mapping of large spaces. Agents solve the mapping problem by building local maps via a surprisal-based clustering of space, which they use to set subgoals for spatial exploration.
Agents build and use a local map to predict their observations; high surprisal leads to a ``fragmentation event'' that truncates the local map.
At these events, the recent local map is placed into long-term memory (LTM) and a different local map is initialized.
If observations at a fracture point match observations in one of the stored local maps, that map is recalled (and thus reused) from LTM. The fragmentation points induce a natural online clustering of the larger space, forming a set of intrinsic potential subgoals that are stored in LTM as a topological graph.
Agents choose their next subgoal from the set of near and far potential subgoals from within the current local map or LTM, respectively. Thus, local maps guide exploration locally, while LTM promotes global exploration.
We demonstrate that FARMap replicates the fragmentation points observed in animal studies.
We evaluate FARMap on complex procedurally-generated spatial environments and realistic simulations to demonstrate that this mapping strategy much more rapidly covers the environment (number of agent steps and wall clock time) and is more efficient in active memory usage, without loss of performance.\footnote{\url{https://jd730.io/projects/FARMap}}

### Summary
The paper proposes an exploration method that performs submapping using a surprise mechanic to decide when to create novel submaps. The resulting approach is compared in 2D on synthetic and simulated environments against a basic frontier exploration method.

### Strengths
The use of a non-uniform submap generation logic is interesting.

### Weaknesses
While the idea of surprise-based submap creation is interesting, many aspects of the overall method are unclear.

What does the map representation look like? The information provided appears to be contradicting itself. The C-th channel is said to contain confidence information, but over what? Additionally, the C-th channel in the observation contains visibility information. However, later on, there is talk of occupancy and colors. The actual representation used by the maps is never explained concretely.

Another aspect that lacks clarity is the surprisal mechanic. It mentions uncertainty estimation yet provides the prediction error as an example. How can an error be used as uncertainty estimation? Equation 2 is also highly confusing as M and o are matrices with different dimensionality yet are multiplied together. How does this work? Furthermore, based on the text, the multiplied quantities represent different properties, making things even more confusing. As it is never made clear what local maps look like and how they are formed, the entire surprisal aspect is challenging to evaluate.

The recall aspect, which is paramount to reusing existing local maps efficiently, lacks any information regarding how it works. Does the system assume perfect localization and thus can just use the submap graph, or is there a place recognition system that reidentifies these local submaps?

While there is crucial information about core aspects missing or relegated to the appendix, there is plenty of detail regarding aspects that one could argue are less critical. For example, the detailed view integration above Section 3.4 or the exact description of the synthetic environment description in Section 4.

The experiments are not very convincing for several reasons. A major one is that a very basic frontier method is used, of which the details are unclear. The proposed method utilizes several heuristics to avoid making bad choices, are similar heuristics employed in the baseline? Another aspect is that the metrics used are unclear and hard to interpret. As an example, Table 2 shows memory usage with a unit of (k), what does this mean? The paper provides statistical information which is good, though it might be better if either the standard deviation or quantile (likely the better choice) were used throughout rather than switching between the two. While the experiments section is quite long, there is little actual discussion of the results, which is usually the most exciting part of an experimental section.

From the description of the baseline method, it is unclear whether it also uses submaps. The results seem to imply so, as otherwise, the relative memory plots should show a value of 1 from my understanding. The paper also does not compare to contemporary exploration frameworks such as GBPlanner (referenced in the appendix) or work such as [1] that are evaluated on realistic robotic 3D setups and show impressive performance. In the absence of such baselines, it is impossible to evaluate the benefit of the proposed irregular submapping system.

While the idea of creating submaps in a more dynamic way than typical fixed-size grids is interesting, the amount of questions surrounding the proposed system and lack of comparison with recent methods makes it impossible to support the paper's publication in its current state.

### Questions
- Does the method assume perfect localization and if so how does it handle realistic uncertainty in pose?
- Is the baseline method utilizing a submapping approach as well, and if so how does it work?

### Summary
The paper proposes a method for mapping large spaces based on the concept of fragmentation and recall, where an agent builds local maps based on a clustering based on "surprise" and decides the next local map to explore. When a new local map is created, the previous local map is stored in a long-term memory and if the observation matches a previous local map, that local map is recalled. Experiments are performed in simulation, and compared with a classic frontier-based approach, as well as with a pre-trained neural SLAM.

### Strengths
- the paper overall presents a technically sound method that is able to achieve exploration of unknown environments.

- the paper provides an interesting grounding of the proposed method with neuroscience, in proposing fragmentation and recall.

- the paper is overall clear, with a logical structure in presenting the different components of the proposed method.

### Weaknesses
 - while it is interesting to see the grounding of the proposed method in neuroscience, some of the general ideas are already present in other methods for exploration, in particular, reasoning topologically is captured by methods that use the generalized Voronoi graph or semantic maps to guide the exploration, and the long-term storage through pose graphs in SLAM, where loop closure is applied (discussed in graph-based slam appendix section), or curiosity-driven exploration. The paper should discuss the proposed method with respect to such methods.

- the paper's comparison is limited in considering only the standard frontier-based exploration, when in fact there are a number of exploration methods showing better performance than the standard one, both in terms of exploration, as well as planning time. Some examples both classic and learning based include:

- the gain in memory appears to be a major component of the proposed method, however, overall, the trend seems to be fairly close to the frontier-based approach and somewhat surprising given the use of local maps. In fact, for the realistic experiments, in AWS office, memory appears better for Frontier. The size of each local map might depend on the complexity of the environment, but it is worth discussing what affects the determination of the local map in practice.

A couple of minor presentation comments: 
- to be more precise in assumptions and corresponding presentation of functions, it is worth mentioning that the robot is non-omnidirectional, as otherwise the indicator function for whether the frontier edge is spatially behind the agent wouldn't apply. In addition, for that function there would be a threshold to determine what "behind" means, with respect to the orientation of the robot.
- usually white pixels are used for free space, instead of black.
- "FRAGMENTAION" -> "FRAGMENTATION"
- "that work did not seriously explore" -> "that work did not explore in-depth"
- instead of calling "wall-clock time" it is better to characterize it with "planning time"

### Questions
- please comment on how the memory usage changes with the environment complexity.

### Summary
This submission proposed a new method to map large and complex environment based on inspirations from rodent neurophysiology. The basic idea is that the brain represents the maps as segmented components.
The authors develop algorithms based on this basic intuition and test the algorithms on simulated environments. 
The authors compared the performance of their method to a method called Frontier (Yamauchi, 1997) and its variants. They reported that theirs carry certain advantages in most scenarios tested here. 

Overall, I found this to be a nice paper. It is well written and the ideas were clearly explained. My main concern is about the benchmarking that is, I am not sure if the authors have performed the comparison with the state-of-the-art methods in the field that are relevant to this problem. The method in Yamauchi (1997), while popular, was proposed more than 25 years ago after all.

### Strengths
— the paper is well written.
— using neurophysiological knowledge of the rodent hippocampus to inform the design of spatial navigation system is interesting
— the results seem to be promising

### Weaknesses
— the improvement over the alternative methods seems to shrink in the more real-world-like applications. Can the authors comment on or provide an interpretation of this?

— Can the authors justify why the Frontier method by Yamauchi (1997) would be the most appropriate benchmark to have? It would be nice if it’s possible to include some other more recent methods.

— In addition, I am not sure if “grid cell-inspired” in the title is entirely appropriate given that the authors do not use grid cells in their model and the idea of representing space in segments seems to hold more generally for the hippocampal-parahipponcampal representation in rodents.

### Questions
- Please see the questions in the previous section. 

- In addition, I am not sure if “grid cell-inspired” in the title is entirely appropriate given that the authors do not use grid cells in their model and the idea of representing space in segments seems to hold more generally for the hippocampal-parahipponcampal representation in rodents.
