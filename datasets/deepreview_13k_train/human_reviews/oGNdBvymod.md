## Abstract
Bayesian deep learning counts on the quality of posterior distribution estimation. However, the posterior of deep neural networks is highly multi-modal in nature, with local modes exhibiting varying generalization performance. Given a practical budget, targeting at the original posterior can lead to suboptimal performance, as some samples may become trapped in ``bad" modes and suffer from overfitting. Leveraging the observation that ``good" modes with low generalization error often reside in flat basins of the energy landscape, we propose to bias sampling on the posterior toward these flat regions. Specifically, we introduce an auxiliary guiding variable, the stationary distribution of which resembles a smoothed posterior free from sharp modes, to lead the MCMC sampler to flat basins. By integrating this guiding variable with the model parameter, we create a simple joint distribution that enables efficient sampling with minimal computational overhead. We prove the convergence of our method and further show that it converges faster than several existing flatness-aware methods in the strongly convex setting. Empirical results demonstrate that our method can successfully sample from flat basins of the posterior, and outperforms all compared baselines on multiple benchmarks including classification, calibration, and out-of-distribution detection.

### Summary
The authors define the augmented model where they aim to perform the inference over variable $\theta_a$ in addition to model parameters.

The authors show the marginal posterior of the augmented model over model parameters give the "right" posterior distribution.

The authors provide several theoretical statements justifying the algorithm and the empirical evaluation of the algorithm.

### Strengths
I think the idea of the augmented model is interesting and the paper is a nice read.

These considerations are novel to the best of my knowledge.

The manuscript is mostly very clear.

The proposed method achieves good empirical performance.

### Weaknesses
I think the authors should clearly specify their model: prior distributions and likelihood and only after that move to the inference part to improve the clarity of the paper.

I understand that when priors are uniform, the RHS of Eqn 4 effectively defines the likelihood of the augmented model the authors want to consider.

The notation using $f(\theta)$ is confusing (e.g. because of no dependence on data) and should be replaced by substituting the definition above the Eq 3.

No line numbers in the manuscript.

Is the variance $\eta$ a free variable? Why does $\eta$  in Eqn 21 disappear during integration?

It is not clear how data augmentation influences the empirical performance of the method.

It would be nice if the authors provided some arguments why the introduced concepts are mathematically well-defined, e.g. (4) integrates to a finite quantity (seems straightforward but the finiteness of all quantities should be ensured).

Why do authors consider the assumption 1? I.e. it's fair to say that authors what to perform the inference in the augmented model, specify the prior/likelihood and there's no need to introduce the assumption 1 (make it a remark).

It's difficult to judge the practical utility of theoretical statements.

### Summary
This paper studies the flatness aware optimization using MCMC with an entropy-adjusted loss function. The overall goal is to adapt SGD with information about the local flatness of the optimization landscape in order to find local minima in flatter regions of the loss landscape, which are widely believed to have better generalization properties compared to sharp local minima. The key technical insight is that the computational difficulties encountered applying local entropy optimization in previous works can be avoided by performing joint MCMC on the energy term inside the local entropy integral, whose marginal distributions correspond to the original Bayesian posterior distribution and the local entropy posterior distribution respectively. Joint sampling allows the local entropy weight path to facilitate movement of the original weight path. A theoretical analysis shows the proposed method has more favorable convergence rates than prior local entropy optimization methods in the strongly convex setting. Experiments show that the proposed method finds local minimum which exhibit greater flatness according to the eigenspectrum and interpolation/extrapolation experiments, and that the proposed method boosts validation accuracy compared to SGD and related entropy-based optimization methods on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet.

### Strengths
* The paper is easy to understand and well written.
* The method resolves a key computational limitation in the local entropy approach from Chaudhari et. al 2019 and allows local entropy optimization with no inner loop, and essentially the same computational cost as SGD. This could make local entropy optimization much more appealing to practitioners than current methods.
* Synthetic dataset experiments and measurement of flatness metrics corroborate the claims of the method's ability to focus its trajectory on flat minima.
* Experiments on classifier training show improved performance relative to SGD and existing local entropy optimization methods.

### Weaknesses
 * The theoretical results focus on a very restricted case of strong convexity. Although analysis of this situation provides interesting context for the relative abilities of the proposed method and existing methods, nothing can be firmly concluded in realistic settings. Specifically, the strong convexity assumption is unlikely to hold for the high-dimensional, non-convex loss landscapes typically encountered in deep learning. This limits the practical implications of the theoretical analysis, as it does not address the behavior of the method in the settings where it is most likely to be applied.
* The SGD baselines for the classification experiments are somewhat weak. It would be interesting to see if the proposed method can push the performance of models with state of the art scores, or at least much closer to state of the art. Maybe fine-tuning rather than full training could help alleviate costs. The reported performance of the SGD baselines seems to be significantly below what is achievable with standard training procedures, raising questions about the fairness of the comparison. It is unclear if the hyperparameters for the SGD baselines were tuned to their optimal values, or if the training procedure was suboptimal in some way. This makes it difficult to assess the true improvement offered by the proposed method.
* The degree of novelty is not especially high, as the method is a straightforward change to the approach from Chaudhary et. al 2019 and the experimental settings are fairly commonplace. On the other hand, the simplicity of the proposed method is part of its appeal. While the method does address a computational limitation of the prior work, the core idea of using an auxiliary variable to guide the optimization process is not entirely novel, and the experimental evaluation is limited to standard datasets and model architectures. This raises questions about the generalizability of the method to more complex problems.

### Questions
Many works find that flat minima lead to better generalization, but some works such as Dinh et al. 2017 (cited in the paper) claim that flatness is not necessarily for good generalization. Can the authors elaborate on the reasons for believing that flatness leads to better generalization and discuss whether generalization can be (or cannot be) achieved without flatness?

### Summary
The paper describes an "augmentation" technique for Bayesian neural networks. 
There is ample experimental evidence and some theoretical support that neural networks 
(pointwise estimations) obtained as local minimizers of the training loss which belong to flat 
basins generalize better than minimizers in sharp minima.
Therefore, in an approximate Bayesian setting where full posterior exploration is prohibitive,
they introduce an auxiliary replica, so that the two replicas measure has as marginals the original
posterior and the local entropy weight (from Baldassi et al. PRL '15). 
The argument is that while the marginal distribution is still the same, the MCMC dynamics
of the replicated system allows early exploration of the wider modes of the posterior, thus obtaining
better generalization performance.

### Strengths
- The paper is well organized, well written, and presents some advances in the field. 

- The 2 replicas framework, although very similar (actually a specific instance with y=1 replicas) of the Robust Ensemble (RE)
  introduced in Baldassi et al. PNAS '16, has the advantage over the generic RE of preserving an unbiased marginal measure,
  while in the RE with y>1 replicas the resulting marginals are tilted. 

- There is good experimental coverage showing consistent (although small) improvements over competing techniques.

- They provide a favorable convergence bound for log-concave target distribution.

### Weaknesses
 - There is a lack of novelty with respect to Baldassi et al. PNAS '16, only partly justified by the focus on the Bayesian setting.

- All experiments seem to be performed using a temperature of T=1e-4, instead of the T=1 of the purely Bayesian setting. This
  makes the Entropy-MCM framework even more similar to the optimization setting of Baldassi et al. PNAS '16 and Pittorino et al ICLR '21.
  Since table 4 shows only minimal performance decrease when setting the temperature to 1, I suggest to present all results 
  with T=1 only. As an alternative, they could follow the protocol of Zhang et al. ICLR 2020b setting T=0 in the burn-in phase and T=1 in
  the sample collection phase.

- There is some hyper-parameter tuning, e.g. eta and T, carried on the test set instead of a validation set. This is not great practice.

- Fig. 6 shows a quite irregular dependence on eta of the test error, in particular the presence of very sharp peaks.
  Do the authors have any intuition of why there is this peak?

### Questions
- Can the author comment on the possibility of enhancing the effect of attraction toward flat minima. 
  E.g. in the framework of Baldassi et al. PNAS '16 this would mean increasing the number of replicas used. 
  Can more replicas be used by also having one of the marginal equal to the origin measure?

- In some of the experiments (or maybe all) experiments the author collect samples of both theta and theta_a. 
  Since the spirit of the paper is to perform Bayesian sampling, shouldn't the collect only theta samples?

- Maybe mores remands to the appendices, e.g. to appendix B for proofs, are needed in the main text.

- Fig. 6 shows a quite irregular dependence on eta of the test error, in particular the presence of very sharp peaks.
  Do the authors have any intuition of why there is this peak?

- Related to the previous question, did the author consider some adaptive tuning scheme for eta, such as the one proposed in the
 "Focusing" section of Pittorino et al ICLR '21?

- A correction for the "Related Work" section: The concept of Local Entropy has been introduced in https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.115.128101. 
  Entropy-SGD (Chaudhari et al., 2019) is an algorithmic implementation. (Baldassi et al., 2016) use the Local Entropy framework to derive "replicated" algorithmic approaches. 
  Both Entropy-SGD and Replicated-SGD algorithms have been further investigated in https://openreview.net/forum?id=xjXg0bnoDmS

- typo in eq. 16, there should be a +

- I wonder if after the burn-in the samples are collected at each iteration.

### Summary
This paper proposes entropy-MCMC (EMCMC), a method to bias posterior sampling from Bayesian neural networks towards flat basins to improve generalization performance. EMCMC works by introducing an auxiliary guiding variable with a smoothed posterior that favors flat basins. The paper presents some theoretical analysis on convergence rates, and demonstrates the effectiveness with experiments on multiple benchmarks.

### Strengths
* The paper tackles an important problem, naming find modes in flat basins to improve generalization. 
* The paper is clearly written, and easy to follow.
* The core idea of the paper is quite simple: instead of relying on an inner loop to estimate the gradients of the local entropy as done in Entropy-SGD, this paper proposes to remove the integral and introduce an auxiliary variable, and sample from the new joint distribution which has a simple form and can be done in a computationally efficient way. Despite its simplicity, the idea is interesting and quite natural. Theoretical analysis and empirical results both demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.
* The theoretical results look interesting but I did not carefully check the math.

### Weaknesses
This paper presents the method as a sampling/MCMC approach, which seems a bit confusing to me. When we talk about sampling we usually aim to sample from the true underlying distribution, including both the flat basins and the sharp nodes. However, it seems in the context of this paper, it is perfectly fine to be stuck at a good flat basin without ever exploring around the sharp nodes. Moreover, Theorem 1 presents a convergence result, implying that the marginal distribution of \theta should eventually converge to the true posterior distribution, but this means it would have to eventually visit the sharp modes. Moreover, if the initial samples are concentrated in the flat basins as claimed, doesn't that mean later there would be a period where the sampler stays around the sharp nodes? Is this because of the strongly convex assumption for Theorem 1? If this assumption is violated, to what extent does the sampler still converge to the true posterior distribution? Should I take the theoretical results as establishing the local convergence rates once we are near a mode?

It would be helpful if the authors can clarify the above issue. I am also curious to see a simple new experiment where we run EMCMC on a distribution like the one shown in Figure 2 for a really long time to see whether EMCMC would come back to the sharp mode and stay there for a while.

In Table 1(a), while EMCMC performs better, it seems entropy-SGLD is almost consistently worse than SGLD. Why is that? For comparison Entropy-SGD seems to consistently outperform SGD.

### Summary
The paper introduces innovative sampling schemes tailored for Bayesian deep learning, aiming to bias the obtained samples during the training process towards flat basins, which helps to obtain better generalization. Rather than focusing on the original posterior, the authors augment it with an auxiliary variable.This augmentation results in a joint distribution with marginals corresponding to the original posterior and a smoothed version of it, achieved through convolution with a Gaussian kernel. The joint distribution's particular structure facilitates straightforward sampling using the stochastic gradient Langevin algorithm. Experimental results demonstrate that acquiring samples from both marginals during the test phase leads to a diverse set of samples that effectively capture the characteristics of flat basins.

### Strengths
- The connection between the  proposed posterior augmentation and flatness-aware optimization is quite novel.
- The proposed methodology is very simple, yet effectively improves the performance of BNN.
- The theoretical comparison between EMCMC and entropy-SGD and entropy-SGLD is insightful. 
- The reviewer appreciate the extensive set of experiments demonstrating the effectiveness of the method.

### Weaknesses
The major weakness of this work is the lack of a rigorous/theoretical justification why the proposed sampling scheme encourages the sampler to explore flat basins. Towards the end of section 4.1, the authors mention that "$\theta_a$ provides additional paths for $\theta$ to traverse, allowing $\theta$ to reach flat modes more efficiently."  However, this argument is not rigorously reasoned in the paper. The only support for this claim seems to be the synthetic examples in section 6.1, which is purely empirical and can have some issues (see Questions section). In my opinion, this claim needs careful theoretical reasoning (even though it can be challenging due to the need to understand the mixing speed of the MCMC chain in non-log-concave settings). This is crucial since it is a key motivation for the methodology. A possible direction to look into is the generalization bound of SGLD, as mentioned in reference [1].

In section 6.1, the definition of the ridge between the two modes of the mixture needs clarification. It is also important to explain why choosing an initial point on this ridge does not favor one mode over the other.

Regarding the MCMC algorithm used in the synthetic example, details about variance parameter $\eta$, number of MCMC iterations, and step sizes are necessary.  Results from Figure 2, 7, and 8 seem to suggest that both SGLD and EMCMC does not mix-well. 

And it would be better to elaborate why the result is independent to the choice of $\eta$? (To my understanding, if $\eta \to 0$, the smoothed target will be identical to the exact target, so no effect on "biasing towards the flat region", and with excessively large $\eta$, the convergence of the MCMC will be very slow.) It will also be helpful to visualize the slice of the target density and smoothed target density (with various choice of $\eta$) on the slice of (x, x).

This could be due to my limited understanding to Bayesian NN: For the image classification experiement, how do you compare the results obtained from sampling-based and optimization-based algorithm? Specifically, do you obtain certain point estimates of NN's weights from MCMC samples, and compute metrics on test dataset using NN with the estimated weights?   

Is there a systematic way of choosing the variance parameter $\eta$?
