## Abstract
Air quality prediction and modelling plays a pivotal role in public health and environment management, for individuals and authorities to make informed decisions. Although traditional data-driven models have shown promise in this domain, their long-term prediction accuracy can be limited, especially in scenarios with sparse or incomplete data and they often rely on \textit{black-box} deep learning structures that lack solid physical foundation leading to reduced transparency and interpretability in predictions. To address these limitations, this paper presents a novel approach named Physics guided Neural Network for Air Quality Prediction (AirPhyNet). Specifically, we leverage two well-established physics principles of air particle movement (diffusion and advection) by representing them as differential equation networks. Then, we utilize a graph structure to integrate physics knowledge into a neural network architecture and exploit latent representations to capture spatio-temporal relationships within the air quality data. Experiments on two real-world benchmark datasets demonstrate that AirPhyNet outperforms state-of-the-art models for different testing scenarios including different lead time (24h, 48h, 72h), sparse data and sudden change prediction, achieving reduction in prediction errors up to 10\%. Moreover, a case study further validates that our model captures underlying physical processes of particle movement and generates accurate predictions with real physical meaning.

### Confidence
3: You are fairly confident in your assessment. It is possible that you did not understand some parts of the submission or that you are unfamiliar with some pieces of related work. Math/other details were not carefully checked.

### Summary
The study introduces AirPhyNet, a physics-guided neural network designed for enhanced air quality prediction. This method incorporates fundamental physics principles into the network architecture, improving predictive performance and interpretability. For this, it draws from existing literature in physics guided ML and neural ODEs. Tests on real-world data showcase its potential to improve over existing methods.

### Strengths
- Putting together multiple complex concepts and methods is indeed a difficult task and requires a thorough understanding of physical dynamics and deep learning.

- The paper addresses a significant and timely problem.

- The narrative is clear and accessible.

- The case study illustrates some of the physics that the model captures.

### Weaknesses
 - My main concern with this work is the lack of contributions to hybrid AI or AI in general. Authors did not identify any technical gaps in our current hybrid AI methods. Instead, authors take what other researchers have developed for physics-guided ML in a variety of domains (e.g., physics) and use them for air quality prediction. Therefore, the method appears to be a combination of multiple well known methods with some developments in how to incorporate the specific physics priors for air quality priors. The air quality priors are just new equations and do not pose a significant technical challenge. Therefore, I do not think this is not a significant contribution for ICLR's research track. Perhaps the paper's contribution is better suited to a domain journal or the applied track of an AI conference.

- Liang et al. 2023 (cited by authors in experimental setup) performed experiments in 342 cities in China and data appears publicly available. However, authors of this paper performed experiments only in 2 cities.

- The case study's interpretability claims are not strongly supported. The diffusion magnitude visualization in Figure 4 could be produced by any standard Graph Neural Network (GNN). The method does not inherently provide a unique mechanism for interpretability beyond what a black-box GNN could offer, therefore, the claims of enhanced interpretability via physics-informed feature representations are not clearly demonstrated.

### Questions
- What is the reason for selecting so few cities?

### Summary
In the presented study, the authors address the limitations of traditional data-driven models for air quality prediction, which often lack long-term accuracy and transparency due to their black-box deep learning nature. They introduce a novel approach called AirPhyNet, which integrates well-known physics principles of air particle movement (diffusion and advection) into a neural network using differential equation networks and a graph structure. This method not only enhances the model's interpretability by tying it to real-world physics but also shows superior performance on real-world datasets, outperforming state-of-the-art models in various test scenarios and reducing prediction errors by up to 10%. The model's ability to accurately capture the underlying physical processes of particle movement is further validated through a case study.

### Summary
This paper introduces AirPhyNet, a physics-informed graph neural network for air quality forecasting. Specifically, a diffusion-advection differential equation is first established to represent the physical process of air particle movement. Then, a physics-guided model is proposed to capture air pollution dynamics and generate physically consistent forecasting results by seamlessly integrating the predefined differential equation into a graph neural network. Experimental results on two real-world benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of AirPhyNet over several state-of-the-art baseline models in various forecasting scenarios. Moreover, a case study is also included to show the potential interpretability of the proposed model.

### Strengths
1. As far as I know, this is the first few attempts to combine physical modeling and deep learning for air quality forecasting.
2. It is reasonable to take the advection and diffusion of air pollutants into consideration when building forecasting models.
3. The paper is well-organized and easy to follow. There are also enough experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness and interpretability of the proposed method.

### Weaknesses
1. The difference between diffusion and advection is unclear. From my understanding, they all describe the transport of air pollutants over space and time. Although the authors briefly explained the difference in Section 2.2, the details are not clearly stated. More discussions would be better. Specifically, the mathematical formulations of diffusion and advection should be explicitly stated, showing how they are modeled differently within the proposed framework. The current explanation lacks the necessary detail to understand how these two processes are distinctly captured in the model.
2. In Equation 9, the authors claim they adopt a reparametrization trick to derive the hidden representation z_{t_0}. The rationale behind this choice is not fully explained. Why not directly use the final hidden state of GRU as z_{t_0}? The paper should elaborate on why a stochastic latent variable is necessary here, and what advantages it provides over a deterministic representation derived directly from the GRU. The connection to a variational autoencoder (VAE) framework should be made explicit if that is the motivation.
3. In Section 2.4, the authors mentioned they leverage a decoder to generate the prediction results, but it lacks sufficient explanations. For example, the instantiation of the decoder should be illustrated in the paper. Moreover, the loss function should be formally defined. The architecture of the decoder, including the layers and activation functions used, should be clearly specified. Furthermore, the exact mathematical form of the loss function, including all terms and parameters, should be provided.
4. Some existing forecasting methods, such as DCRNN and AirFormer used in this paper, can also model the diffusion and advection process to some extent. So, what’s the major advantage of injecting physical principles into machine learning models? More discussions are appreciated. The paper needs to clearly articulate how the physics-informed approach provides a significant advantage over purely data-driven methods in terms of accuracy, robustness, or interpretability. A more detailed comparison of the model's performance under different conditions compared to DCRNN and AirFormer is needed to justify the added complexity of the physics-informed approach.
5. There are some typos. For example, in Section 3.1, “Shanghai” should be “Shenzhen”.

### Summary
This paper considers the task of air quality prediction (PM2.5) simultaneously over a network of weather monitoring stations, using wind direction and speed as covariates. This is achieved with the help of an enoder-decoder architecture which can represent past values of the target variables and covariates, including the spatial correlations between the different stations. The encoded structure is used to solve ODEs based on advection and diffusion through a suitably designed Graph Neural Network, which can represent the spatial relations between the different stations. Instead of using computationally expensive Chemical Transport Models (CTM), this physics-based NN model can predict the state at the end of the prediction period (24/48/72 hours) and this is used to generate the final predictions of PM2.5 using decoder. It is shown that the proposed model can perform better than existing NN-based models and traditional statistical models for air quality prediction, including in situations where there is abrupt air quality changes. Some intuition is also provided through a case study, where the pollution hot-spots are found to shift in the direction of winds.

### Strengths
The paper proposes an architecture that achieves two things: i) solves differential equations for advection and diffusion over a network using a GNN with Neural ODE solver, and ii) uses this to make spatio-temporal predictions of air quality using wind direction+speed as covariates. 

The strengths of the paper lies in the facts that:
i) the proposed framework is quite novel 
ii) the reported results are very strong

### Weaknesses
 The weak points of the work are mostly in the experimental part:

i) The station sizes are relatively small (35 and 11). It is not clear how the method will scale to bigger networks
ii) The comparisons provided are mostly against other neural network based methods. The work is motivated by stating that CTMs are very expensive. Yet, no comparison with CTM in term of either computational cost or accuracy is provided. Two "traditional methods" are mentioned (HA and VAR), but no details of those are provided. 
iii) There is no analysis of the nature of the data that is being dealt with.

Apart from these, the analysis leaves a few loose ends, mentioned in the next section.

### Questions
1) What was the architecture of the "decoder"? I did not find this anywhere.
2) What is the significance of the encoded state "z" ? Is it possible to visualize it? Is it possible to run the Neural ODE on the original data itself, without the encoding?
3) What is the impact of the lookback window size T? 
4) The model seems to have been trained separately for the two cities in question. Is it possible to train it on one city and use it on the other? Which parameters will need fine-tuning in that case?
5) Is the data periodic in nature? How strong is the spatial correlation between the different stations?
6) Two covariates are considered- wind direction and wind speed. Do the competitor methods also use these? How will the proposed model perform if these covariates are not considered? Or if more covariates are considered?
7) How are the two "traditional" methods - HA and VAR implemented? Specifically, are they done specific to each station separately? If so, it may not be a fair comparison.
8) How does the proposed approach compare with CTM?
