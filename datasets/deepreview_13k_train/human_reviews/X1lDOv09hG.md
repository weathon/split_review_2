# High variance score function estimates help diffusion models generalize

- Decision: Reject

## Abstract
How do diffusion-based generative models generalize beyond their training set? In particular, do they perform something similar to kernel density estimation? If so, what is the kernel, and which aspects of training and sampling determine its form? We argue that a key contributor to generalization is the fact that the denoising score matching objective usually used to train diffusion models tends to obtain high variance score function estimates at early times. We investigate this claim by mathematically studying (unconditional) diffusion models in a variety of analytically tractable settings (e.g., when the training distribution is a Gaussian mixture), and are able to compute various exact and asymptotic expressions for quantities like the variance of score function parameter estimates. We show that the effect of this high variance is mathematically equivalent to running reverse diffusion using the "optimal" score, and then convolving the result with a data-dependent kernel function.

### Summary
This paper investigates the following problem: How do diffusion-based generative modesl generalize beyond the training set? The authors claim that this phenomenon is at least partially explained by the fact that score function estimates have a large varaince. To support this claim, they consider a linear score estimator, where $\hat{s}_{\theta}(x_t, t) = W_0(t) + W(t) \phi(x_t). $ Here, $\phi$ is a fixed feature map, and $\theta(t) = (W_0(t), W(t))$ are the parameters to be estimated. To train the estimator, they consider the limit of large number of samples $N \to \infty$ and small times bins $\Delta t \to 0$. They also assume a specific time sampling distribution $\lambda(t)$. To learn $\theta(t_i)$, they use $N \lambda(t_i) \Delta t$ samples. They propose to estimate the kernel functions using a sample mean estimator. They show that the learned distribution will not be $q_{\ast}$, which is derived from the optimal linear estimator. Instead, they prove that the learned distribution will be $q_{\ast}$ convolved with a specific Gaussian kernel. They apply their results to several machine learning tasks.

### Strengths
This paper attempts to explain the generalization of diffusion models from a novel perspective: The high variance of the score function. Using a linear score function estimator, and assume an appropriate asymptotic regime for the training, they are able to explicitly characterize the distribution that is learned from data. This distribution is obtained with optimal score function convolved with a specific kernel. Their results find applications in many machine learning tasks and contribute to explain the generalization of diffusion models.

### Weaknesses
 I have some doubts on the asymptotic regime considered in this paper. I feel it is not very efficient to use only data in a small time window to train the score function at that time point. As far as I am concerned, $\lambda(t)$ in the past papers was introduced to impose weights on the loss function instead of sample splitting. I think the authors should elaborate more on why the sample splitting scheme is a reasonable one. I feel in the main result they are getting variation because they do not have enough sample to train each single score function. 

In addition, I feel using only linear score estimator is a bit restricted, as score function is defined as the gradient of the log density, I would expect that it is in general non-linear. Perhaps the authors can make their results more persuasive by giving several examples that have linear score functions?

### Questions
1. Is there a way to estimate the feature maps $\phi$ when they are not known a priori? 
2. How accurately can a linear estimator learn the score function in typical situations? Maybe the authors can comment a little bit on that. 
3. If we use a better estimator than taking the sample average to estimate the score function, do we get a better result? Will it hurt or imporve the generalization ability? 
4. If a different sampling distribution is employed, how does the results change? 
5. In practice, the number of samples used for training will be very large, hence $c$ would also be large. In this case, the variance according to the theorem will be small. Do we even expect generalization to happen in such a large-sample situation?

### Summary
This paper proposes to study the generalization ability of diffusion models: why diffusion models do not simply remember the training set but can generate new samples. The paper argues that a key factor is the high variance score function estimates at small $t$. The paper studies the behavior of diffusion models with a specific setting where they are parametrized as a linear function of features, and shows that they learn a distribution that is mathematically equivalent to convolving the optimal distribution with a particular kernel function.

### Strengths
The issue the paper tries to study is an important one. While diffusion models are being deployed quite literally everywhere, it is paramount that we understand what makes them generalize.

### Weaknesses
1. My biggest complaint about the paper is that I am not convinced by the paper's argument of the high variance score function estimates at small $t$, which also serves as the paper's motivation.
    - I am not sure why in Eq.6, we are looking at the covariance over $x_t$, since the network is current-position-aware (the network has $x_t$ and $t$ as input). The network prediction targets are often regularized to have a unit norm [1], so the network predicted scale stays the same across $t$, which is not considered in the paper. This regularization would stabilize the prediction targets, and the paper does not address how this impacts their analysis. Also, people have tried to directly predict $x$ through a different parameterization, which will make the prediction targets very stable at small $t$. This would invalidate the paper's analysis, and we still do not see perfect memorization happen. The paper needs to address these common parameterizations and explain why their analysis still holds.
    - It makes more sense to consider the variance explored in [2], which is over $p_{x_0|x_t}$. It is also observed there that the variance of score function estimates is actually small with small $t$. In fact, in [2], it is observed that explicitly minimizing the variance of the score function estimation often leads to better results. The paper needs to reconcile their claims with these findings, and explain why their analysis is still relevant in light of these observations.
    - The denoised score matching objective is always trying to fit the injected random noise. The ground truth score (marginalized over all samples) is very different only with moderate t. I agree that fitting small $t$ score functions is difficult as mentioned in prior works, but that is a different issue. The paper does not clearly distinguish between the difficulty of fitting the score function at small $t$ and the variance of the score function estimates, which are two separate issues.
2. The paper's analysis heavily relies on a particular parameterization (not used in practice), which in my opinion, is the cause of the observed phenomenon, instead of the denoising score matching loss as the authors suggest. What if the model can actually learn the distribution perfectly? Will the analysis in this paper still hold? Equivalently, if the network is trained with the "naive" approach, does the model actually learn the distribution perfectly? (with all the training details corrected, like sampling distribution of $\sigma$ and network prediction target normalization) If not, then I am not sure how much of a contribution this paper is to the field, as the particular setting considered in this paper is impractical, and does not translate very well to the real usage of diffusion models. The paper needs to explore the behavior of more realistic parameterizations and justify why their analysis is still relevant.
3. In the introduction, the paper rules out many candidates for generalization, purely based on prior works, intuitions, and observations. In order to make these claims, careful study is required. For example, the authors mention that modern architectures are flexible enough to in principle learn the optimal score. The authors need to back up the claims carefully, because that implies that you can perfectly reconstruct the dataset with these networks, which does not happen. The paper needs to provide more rigorous justification for these claims, and address the discrepancy between the theoretical capacity of modern architectures and their practical behavior.
4. Since the issue considered in this paper is really an empirical one (because the optimal solution to diffusion model training is memorizing all training samples), I highly suggest the authors do some experiments. Related issue: the presentation can be significantly improved with figures. The authors should have more than enough space in the current version.

### Questions
1. Where is Eq.8 used in practice? Or, equivalently, which diffusion models used in practice actually underweight small $t$ during training? I see the authors also cite [1], which used a log-normal distribution, and they basically train with more samples at small $t$ compared to large $t$. This fact directly counters one of the assumptions listed in the last paragraph in Sec.3: “the choice of a time sampling distribution that underweights small times…”

### Summary
This paper studies the effect of high variance of of score function estimates at early times. The key idea is to identify the score estimates by running the backward diffusion with the optimal score and convolving with some kernel function -- in other words diffusion models are similar to some kernel density estimation.

### Strengths
This paper tries to explain mathematically the effect of high variance of score estimation at early times in diffusion models -- which was observed empirically. The key takeaway is to identify the diffusion training by kernel density problems. This connection appears to be novel and insightful. The paper is generally well written, and I mostly enjoyed reading it. I have checked most computations, and they seem to be correct.

### Weaknesses
The main concern is that the paper uses some simple diffusion models (1)-(2), as well as the Gaussian mixture training distribution. This limits the applicability of the results. For instance, there are more advanced diffusion models, e.g. VE, VP, sub-VP... What happens in these cases? Is it possible to identify all theses diffusion models by a suitable kernel density problem? The authors may want to comment or explain.

Also it is not clear whether the "theoretical" computations can carry over to other distributions than Gaussian mixture (or a mixture of delta mass). The authors may want to comment on this.

### Summary
The papers attempts the answer the question why diffusion models generalize well beyond the training dataset. To address this question, the paper studies linear score estimator and derives the optimal solution. Furthermore, the authors study the covariance of the optimal parameters. Some examples are given to illustrate this idea.

### Strengths
1. The authors study the linear score estimator class. The closed-form optimal solution to DSM is obtained.
2. The paper further investigates the covariance of the parameters in the score estimator. The authors find that the phenomenon of high variance.

### Weaknesses
1. The mathematical derivation in the paper looks like heuristics instead of rigorous proof. It is hard to tell the correctness of the arguments. 
2. No experiments are provided to justify the high variance arguments.
3. Although the starting point of the paper is on the generalization of diffusion models, it is unclear how the high variance of the score estimators helps model generalization.
4. The writing can be improved.

### Questions
1. The paper only considers the linear score estimator and derives the optimal closed-form solution. How do you know the ground truth score function is linear? For a general score function, can we still have high variance parameters?
2. The most important issue with this paper is that I cannot tell how the high variance is connected to the generalization of diffusion models. 
3. Can you provide some numerical experiments to support your claims in the paper?
