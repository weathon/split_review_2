# Language Models Linearly Represent Sentiment

- Decision: Reject
- Scores: 6, 3, 6

## Abstract
Sentiment is a pervasive feature in natural language text, yet it is an open question how sentiment is represented within Large Language Models (LLMs). In this study, we reveal that across a range of models, sentiment is represented linearly: a single direction in activation space mostly captures the feature across a range of tasks with one extreme for positive and the other for negative. Through causal interventions, we isolate this direction and show it is causally relevant in both toy tasks and real world datasets such as Stanford Sentiment Treebank. 

We further uncover the mechanisms that involve this direction, highlighting the roles of a small subset of attention heads and neurons. Finally, we discover a phenomenon which we term the summarization motif: sentiment is not solely represented on emotionally charged words, but is additionally summarised at intermediate positions without inherent sentiment, such as punctuation and names. We show that in Stanford Sentiment Treebank zero-shot classification, 76\% of above-chance classification accuracy is lost when ablating the sentiment direction, nearly half of which (36\%) is due to ablating the summarized sentiment direction exclusively at comma positions.

### Summary
Large language models (LLM) can perform zero-shot classification, such as sentiment analysis with a simple discrete prompt. This paper studied how large language models represented their sentiments. The authors argued that the sentiment is represented linearly, i.e., there is a vector pointing in the direction of positive (or negative) sentiment. In addition, the authors proposed the summarization motif -- a phenomenon in an LLM that aggregates information (about sentiment) at indiscriminative tokens (e.g., commas). 

To prove the linear sentiment representation, the authors applied several approaches to extract the sentiment direction from a small toy dataset and performed directional activation patching. In the experiment on a subset of SST, the results showed that the direction was significant to the logits -- enough to flip the prediction up to 53.5% of the time.  

To prove the summarization motif, the authors applied a similar patching method to the commas (or periods?) and compared it with patching all tokens. The results showed that only patching commas contributed to more than half of the drop in accuracy (38% to 18%) on a subset of SST. Additional analysis of another dataset showed that the further the relevant phrase in a prompt, the more apparent the summarization motif was.

### Strengths
The paper presented original findings on LLM behavior and sentiments. The paper applied existing tools to prob the LLM using a new format of experiments. The linear representation of sentiment in GPT was an interesting finding and added insights to the disentangled representations of unsupervised models. The summarization motif of the sentiment was also original. While we know that some heads LLMs (or smaller ones) tend to attend delimiters, we still do not understand why (Clark et al., 2019). The experiment result shown in Table 1b revealed an insight into this behavior.

### Weaknesses
Although the paper presented original findings, I found a few issues in the experiment to support the claims and some inconsistent results.

1. Models. The authors claimed that the results were consistent across a range of models. However, I found mostly GPT2-small or Pythia in the experiment results -- one model for each, not repeated. While this is already an interesting finding, it has weak support for the claim. The author should either clarify this or lower the claim. It would be more convincing if the core experiments, such as the directional patching on SST, were repeated across several model sizes and architectures to demonstrate the universality of the findings. The current presentation leaves the reader wondering if the observed effects are specific to the models tested or a more general phenomenon.

2. Linearity. The authors claimed that the sentiment was linearly represented. Still, the evidence was rather weak on the real dataset (SST), especially the vectors discovered by simple linear methods like PCA or logistic regression. The effect was more prominent than the random directions, but it did not support the linearity claim. While the authors explained that the direction was discovered from a small dataset, we could also explain that there was more than one direction or simply nonlinear sentiment space. The fact that simple linear methods only achieve a modest effect on SST suggests the sentiment representation might be more complex than a single linear direction. The authors should explore the possibility of multiple sentiment directions or non-linear representations.

3. Distance. While the author experimented with a toy dataset and injected irrelevant content, I found the relationship between the "summarization" and the context length interesting. However, this could be made stronger -- the authors could find sentences in SST with varied lengths and commas to support the relationship. The current evidence relies heavily on a synthetic dataset, and it is unclear if the same effect would be observed in real-world text. A more robust analysis would involve examining the summarization effect across varying lengths and comma densities within the SST dataset itself.

4. Inconsistency. In the abstract, the authors wrote 76% and 36%, but these were not consistent with the text in Section 4.3.

### Questions
1. Can you clarify why the results were consistent across different models?

2. Can you explain why the logit flip in the abstract is doubled from the text?

### Summary
This paper proposes that pre-trained models have already learnt the notion of sentiment up to linear transformations in their intermediate layers. THe linear representation hypothesis suggests that large language models learn representations of text that are linearly related to meaning or related notions. In this work, the authors evaluate this idea for certain large language models (GPT-2 and Pythia) on several datasets, including toy datasets, SST and OpenWebTet, for the notion of sentiment.

To find the directions among intermediate layers of the language model, the authors propose to use simple techniques such as mean of the activation vectors, linear probing, PCA and DAS. They discover such directions for the toy datasets and evaluate it via correlation analysis. Similar analysis on the other datasets, including activation patching leads them to discover that sentiment is being aggregated on various punctuation tokens in the text, which they call summarization motif.

While containing potentially interesting ideas, I find the writing poor and hard to understand. A lot of terms are left undefined, the diagrams are essentially the only quantitative part of the work and the reader is left to decipher or understand a lot of the references by themselves. Please see weaknesses below.

### Strengths
- It's widely believed that large models learn activations that linearly capture conceptual latent variables. This work proposes that the sentiment notion is also captured linearly among the activations of intermediate layers.

- The idea of summarization motif that information aggregates at certain tokens, is also interesting.

### Weaknesses
 - The writing seems extremely sloppy. For an experimental paper, many of the plots/discussions are not clear, especially for a broad ICLR audience. For example, what are the x- and y-axes of figure 2b?

- What are "sentiment activations" in GPT2-small, are these related to sentiment directions that are learnt via the 5 methods?

- I feel like the authors are using the term "causal" loosely, do they mean that the sentiment is sensitive to activation addition, and hence they deem it causal? Usually the term causal representations are reserved for representations that generate the data, not the other way around.

- As the authors note, attention heads are used for the analysis and a more thorough analysis should include activations at MLP layers too.

### Questions
Some questions were raised above.

- Figure 2 should probably be moved towards where it is discussed, instead of at the introduction.

- Consistency: Both "k-means" and "K-means" are used.

- In reproducibility statement, the words "Appendix Section" are both used for A.3.

### Summary
In this work, the authors delve into the representation of sentiment in Language Models (LLMs) and summarize two pivotal discoveries: the existence of a linear sentiment representation and the utilization of summarization for storing sentiment information. Regarding the first finding, this paper isolates the activation direction and demonstrates its causal relevance in both toy tasks and real-world datasets. As for the second discovery, this study uncovers the underlying mechanisms associated with the aforementioned direction, emphasizing the roles of a select group of attention heads and neurons. To investigate and corroborate these conclusions, the paper conducts experiments using four datasets, as well as GPT-2 and Pythia models.

### Strengths
1. The content explored in this paper is intriguing, as it delves into the representation of sentiment in LLMs, a variable in the data generation process that pertains to various language tasks. This research direction contributes to identifying potential risks in language models, including deception and the concealment of model knowledge, thereby mitigating potential harm caused by LLMs.

2. The paper exhibits a well-structured format with lucid expression, comprehensive experimental exploration, and a thorough examination of limitations, implications, and future work in the concluding section.

### Weaknesses
1. The statements in the abstract and introduction indicate that this paper investigates the representation of sentiment in LLMs. However, the experiments employ GPT2-small for movie review continuation, Pythia-1.4b for classification, and Pythia-2.8b for multi-subject tasks. GPT and Pythia, while useful for research, may not fully capture the nuances of the broader spectrum of LLMs, particularly those with different architectures or training datasets. This raises concerns about the generalizability of the conclusions drawn from the study, as the observed sentiment representations might be specific to these model families and not universally applicable to all LLMs.

2. There is no caption provided for Table 1 in the paper. Furthermore, Figure 2 is predominantly featured in Section 3, but there exists a substantial gap between its initial reference and the section in which it is discussed. This lack of immediate context for the figure and table makes it difficult to follow the narrative and understand the experimental setup and results as they are initially introduced.

3. The proposed ToyMovieReview format, "I thought this movie was ADJECTIVE, I VERBed it. Conclusion: This movie is," appears to be more suitable for sentence-level sentiment analysis, potentially limiting its applicability to more complex sentiment analysis tasks. It may not be as effective for other sentiment analysis tasks, such as document-level sentiment analysis or fine-grained sentiment analysis, where context and nuances across longer text spans are crucial. Furthermore, the rationale for emphasizing adjectives and verbs in this specific prompt design remains unclear, as it has not been adequately explained in previous sections of the paper, leaving the reader to question the validity of this design choice.

4. In Section 4.1, the authors find that the model employs a simple and interpretable algorithm to perform the task. However, this algorithm has not been supported by corresponding experiments, thus failing to demonstrate and illustrate the use of summarization for retaining sentiment information. The claim lacks concrete evidence, making it difficult to assess the validity of this finding.
