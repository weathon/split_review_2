## Abstract
\label{sec:sec-abstract}
Graph-level anomaly detection has gained significant attention as it finds applications in various domains, such as cancer diagnosis and enzyme prediction. However, existing methods fail to capture the spectral properties of graph anomalies, resulting in unexplainable framework design and unsatisfying performance. In this paper, we re-investigate the spectral differences between anomalous and normal graphs. Our main observation shows a significant disparity in the accumulated spectral energy between these two classes. Moreover, we prove that the accumulated spectral energy of the graph signal can be represented by its Rayleigh Quotient, indicating that the Rayleigh Quotient is a driving factor behind the anomalous properties of graphs. Motivated by this, we propose {\em Rayleigh Quotient Graph Neural Network (RQGNN)}, the first spectral GNN that explores the inherent spectral features of anomalous graphs for graph-level anomaly detection. Specifically, we introduce a novel framework with two components: the Rayleigh Quotient learning component (RQL) and Chebyshev Wavelet GNN with RQ-pooling (CWGNN-RQ). RQL explicitly captures the Rayleigh Quotient of graphs and CWGNN-RQ implicitly explores the spectral space of graphs. Extensive experiments on 10 real-world datasets show that RQGNN outperforms the best rival by 6.74\% in Macro-F1 score and 1.44\% in AUC, demonstrating the effectiveness of our framework.

### Summary
This paper considers the problem of detecting anomalies in graphs.  Related work in GNNs is reviewed, and it is argued that the Rayleigh quotient (RQ) supplies feature information that is useful and hasn’t been adequately explored.  This is based on some data exploration of a chemical dataset.  The authors set up a learning problem that incorporates the RQ, and incorporates several pieces including graph wavelets and using the RQ as an attention mechanism.  Experiments compare baseline GNNs, including GNN classifiers and GNN anomaly detectors, and show the benefits of the proposed approach for the datasets studied.

### Strengths
The paper is well written and provides a good statement of the problem, prior GNN related work, and the motivation for the approach.   Exploring the Rayleigh quotient in this context is well motivated and interesting.

The paper has some nice innovation, incorporating RQ pooling for example, and the use of RQ as a means of attention in the context of the graph wavelet.  The use of wavelets seems well motivated for this “step change” problem, when the change is an anomaly.

The comparisons with other GNN-based methods are well documented and show the benefit of the proposed method for the datasets considered.  The hyperparameter choices are well described, and the ablation studies are useful indicators.

### Weaknesses
The relation between Rayleigh quotient and perturbation is well known and studied, for example, in physics.  For example:  Pierre, C. (December 1, 1988). "Comments on Rayleigh’s Quotient and Perturbation Theory for the Eigenvalue Problem." ASME. J. Appl. Mech. December 1988; 55(4): 986–988. When the vector is close to an eigenvector, then the RQ has a value that is close to the corresponding eigenvector.  There is also the Rayleigh-Schrödinger procedure that yields approximations to the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a perturbed matrix by a sequence of successively higher order corrections to the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the unperturbed matrix.

The paper explores an important application and datasets, and experimentally shows that the RQ provides a useful feature for detecting change.  However, it isn’t clear how general this is beyond the application considered.  

The anomaly here is a change detector between the baseline distribution (the normal graph class), and some deviation from this graph.  Apparently for this data there is no clear class after change (so it isn’t surprising that the graph classifiers don’t work well).

### Questions
Given the large literature on RQ’s it seems likely that eqn (1) is well known?

Lemma 1 and leading to eqn (4), using L – I_n to compute is from Rivlin or some other reference?

Section 4.5 (and throughout the paper).  “Rayleigh Quotient is an intrinsic characteristic of the graph-level anomaly detection task.”  Should this be altered to say “for the application studied”?  How general is the claim?

Isn’t the anomaly for this application the same as an “out of distribution” test?  

It seems this area of study would benefit from good baseline data sets.  For example, for what random classes of graphs is the RQ approach well founded?  This could be studied through simulation and theory.  

Section 4.1: Perhaps you could say a little more about “various chemical compounds and their reactions to different cancer cells”, and how a chemical leads to a graph?

### Summary
In this paper, the authors introduce spectral analysis and identify significant differences in the spectral energy distributions between anomalous and normal graphs, leading to the development of the Rayleigh Quotient Graph Neural Network (RQGNN). This approach combines the explicit capture of the Rayleigh Quotient and implicit spectral exploration, outperforming existing methods in comprehensive experiments.

### Strengths
1. This paper is well-organized and easy to follow.
2. Investigate Rayleigh Quotient Learning to graph anomaly detection is promising.
3. The experiment demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed method.

### Weaknesses
1. The reviewer thinks that the motivation and rationale of Rayleigh Quotient Learning should emphasized. It is a quite general problem that “existing methods fail to capture the underlying properties of graph anomalies”. 
2. An algorithm describing the training process is required.
3. From the objective function in Section 3, the method proposed in this paper is a supervised method. This implies that some of the comparisons in the experiments are unfair because many graph-level anomaly detection methods are fully unsupervised to my knowledge, e.g., OCGIN, OCGTL, GlocalKD, etc.
4. The authors only test on chemical datasets in this paper, while there are other data types that are constructed as graphs, such as social networks.
5. It seems that the proposed RQGNN fluctuates a lot with the change of hyperparameters and shows instability. The authors should explain the reasons for this observation.
6. The impact of hyperparameters on loss function is encouraged to be explored.
7. From the ablation study results, the performance of RQGNN does not consistently outperform the other degradation models, and their performance is quite close in many cases. It seems the improvement from the several proposed components is somewhat limited.

### Questions
1. Can the Rayleigh Quotient Learning be used to detect node anomalies?
2. The authors should show the ratio between normal and anomalous graphs. Are they balanced or not?

### Summary
This paper proposes the first spectral GNN-based graph-level anomaly detection method named RQGNN. Considering the disparity in the accumulated spectral energy between the anomalies and normal graphs, RQGNN leverages the Rayleigh Quotient learning component to capture the accumulated spectral energy of graphs. In addition, RQGNN also proposes the Chebyshev Wavelet GNN to represent nodes. RQ-pooling that regards the Rayleigh Quotient coefficient as the node importance score will be employed to obtain graph representation. The final graph representation is the concatenation of the Rayleigh Quotient learning component and the Chebyshev Wavelet GNN. Finally, class-balanced focal loss is introduced to optimize RQGNN and obtain graphs’ binary labels.

### Strengths
1.	The topic of graph-level anomaly detection focused by this paper is an interesting but under-explored research area.
2.	This paper is the first to consider solving the problem of graph-level anomaly detection from the perspective of spectral graph. Before this, leveraging graph wavelet to identify anomalous nodes within a single graph has achieved empirical successes [1].
3.	This paper proposes a sufficient survey on graph anomaly detection.

### Weaknesses
1.	The insight of this paper seems to be on shaky ground. Figures 1 and 4-12 do not clearly show the statistical difference between anomalous graphs and normal graphs with respect to Rayleigh Quotient. Detailed text description about the ''significant disparity" between two classes is necessary but not found on the current version. (This is the main reason why I currently tend to reject this paper.)
2.	I recommend briefly introducing Rayleigh Quotient in the introduction or preliminaries section.
3.	In page 4,  authors wrote  "If the graph Laplacian $\mathbf L$ and graph signal $\mathbf x$ of two graphs are close, then their Rayleigh Quotients will be close to each other and these two graphs will highly likely belong to the same class." I tend to think this statement is correct, but it seems not applicable for anomalies. Anything that is different from normal can be regarded as an anomaly, but we actually cannot get training data that can represent the full picture of anomalies. In addition, two anomalous graphs can also be very different. This paper uses two-class datasets for experiments, but what will be the result if we regard the third class that has never appeared in the training set as anomalies to test the proposed model?
4.	In page 5, authors wrote "However, as analyzed in Section 3.1, to capture the spectral properties of anomalous graphs, it is necessary to consider the spectral energy with respect to each eigenvalue." But, the reason for using graph wavelet convolution is still unclear.

### Questions
1. How about the graph-level anomaly detection performance of ChebyNet, BernNet, GMT, Gmixup, and TVGNN if the loss function is replaced by the class-balanced focal loss?
2. What is the ratio between the normal and anomalous graphs utilized during model training?
