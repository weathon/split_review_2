## Abstract
For object re-identification (re-ID), learning from synthetic data has become a promising strategy to cheaply acquire large-scale annotated datasets and effective models, with few privacy concerns. Many interesting research problems arise from this strategy, \emph{e.g.,} how to reduce the domain gap between synthetic source and real-world target. To facilitate developing more new approaches in learning from synthetic data, we introduce the Alice benchmarks, large-scale datasets providing benchmarks as well as evaluation protocols to the research community. Within the Alice benchmarks, two re-ID tasks are offered: person and vehicle re-ID. We collected and annotated two challenging real-world target datasets: AlicePerson and AliceVehicle, captured under various illuminations, image resolutions, \textit{etc.} As an important feature of our real target, the clusterability of its training set is not manually guaranteed to make it closer to the real domain adaptation test scenario. Correspondingly, we reuse existing PersonX and VehicleX as synthetic source domains. The primary goal is to train models from synthetic data that can work effectively in the real world. In this paper, we detail the settings of Alice benchmarks, provide an analysis of existing commonly-used domain adaptation methods, and discuss some interesting future directions.

### Summary
This paper presents the Alice benchmarks, a resource designed for advancing research in "synthetic to real" domain adaptation, particularly in the context of person/vehicle re-identification (re-ID). The primary aim is to train models from synthetic data that perform effectively in real-world scenarios. The paper outlines the benchmark settings, analyzes common domain adaptation methods, and sets up an online server for convenient and fair method evaluation. The Alice project is a long-term effort with plans to expand to cover more objects in the visual world through open-source collaboration.

### Strengths
1)	This paper offers a good benchmark for "synthetic to real" domain adaptation in the domains of person and vehicle re-identification, significantly enhancing progress in these areas.
2)	Lots of experiments have been constructed, and many interesting findings have been obtained.

### Weaknesses
1) The authors should consider the impact of different synthetic data generation strategies on domain adaptation effects, such as using different graphics engines, different attribute distributions, different noise levels, etc. Specifically, the paper lacks a thorough investigation into how the choice of rendering engine (e.g., Unity vs. Unreal) and the specific parameters used within these engines affect the realism and, consequently, the transferability of the synthetic data. The impact of varying lighting conditions, texture resolutions, and camera parameters during rendering should also be explored. Furthermore, the paper should analyze how different methods of attribute generation (e.g., using GANs or procedural methods) affect the domain gap.
2) The quality of the generated data and labels is not clearly discussed. I recommend measuring the quality of the generated data and the impact of improving quality on the results. Specifically, there's no clear metric used to assess the realism of the generated images beyond FID, which is a high-level measure. The authors should consider metrics that evaluate specific aspects of image quality, such as sharpness, contrast, and the presence of artifacts. Furthermore, while the labels are claimed to be accurate, there is no discussion of the potential for subtle errors in the 3D model alignment or the annotation process that could affect the training process. The impact of these potential errors on the final performance should be evaluated.
3) The title of this paper is biased. It focuses on the person/vehicle re-identification, while the title uses object re-identification. The scope of the title is too large. Although the authors claim that more objects will be added later, for the purposes of this article, it is limited to the field of person/vehicle re-identification.

### Summary
In this work authors present a new benchmark, namely Alice for well-known re-identification of people and Vehicles. Specifically, the dataset is constructed with the domain adaptation in mind. This provides a great opportunity for DA research and more consistent basis for comparison. In the dataset authors tried to ensure that the collected real-world dataset resembles the unconstrained data in the wild. Additionally, the benchmark comes with an online evaluation system for a fair comparison.

### Strengths
The paper is well-written, and the motivation is quite clear. The paper has a very nice structure and flow. A unified evaluation framework is gathered to ensure fairness across results. Additionally, authors provided baseline results based on well-knows domain adaptation works and techniques. This provides unique opportunity to enhance domain adaptation research. Moreover, authors showed how established techniques such as unsupervised clustering of images that result in reasonable performance gains in existing benchmarks does not translate to their dataset highlighting the undesired biases that sometime are over-looked.

### Weaknesses
Despite not being quite clear at this point, it would be nice if authors could provide some discussion on the potential limit that synthetic data can benefit the learning and inference on real-world data. Specifically whether there are some inherent barriers.

### Summary
This paper proposes a new benchmark for synthetic-to-real object reid. The new benchmark involves two real-world data, i.e., AlicePerson and AliceVehicle, and provides some analysis on them.

### Strengths
The strong clusterability in current data actually brings a risk to build a robust UDA reid method, which deserves atttention.

### Weaknesses
1. The synthetic data in benchmark are from existing datasets, i.e., PersonX and VehicleX, while the real-world data (AlicePerson and Alice Vehicle) in benchmark shows less advantage compared to current off-the-shelf reid datasets. The strong clusterability issue is the only difference in my opinion. However, for AlicePerson, I do NOT think adding distractor and junk is a good way to solve the strong clusterability issue compared. For AliceVehicle, in Table.4, I do NOT find much difference between AliceVehicle and VeRi776 on the strong clusterability issue.
2. The UDA methods compared in this benchmark (Fig.3&Tab.3&Tab.4) are out of fashion, new methods should be involved.

### Questions
Beside the introduce of the strong clusterability issue, I can not find any new things in this benchmark. Please see the weakness for details.

### Summary
The paper focuses on the research of synthetic data for object re-identification. Although using the name of object re-identification, it only focuses on persons and vehicles. The main contribution of the paper is the proposed Alice benchmarks, which include both synthetic and real-world data. Specifically, an application is training a model with fully-labeled synthetic data and then tuning it on the unlabeled real-world data. A significance of the paper is its real-world data do not have pre-define “cluster” architecture, which is more practical. The authors try to regard it as a successor 
 of the famous Market benchmark.

### Strengths
1. Focusing on synthetic data is good; which does not invade privacy;
2. Good writing and easy to follow;
3. Some insightful discussions in DISCUSSION AND FUTURE WORK

### Weaknesses
Although with these strengths, I think the paper is still far away from the acceptance of ICLR 2024.
1. The contribution is not enough. I fully understand the importance of the benchmark. But as far as I am concerned, the paper’s biggest significance is the “un-clustered” data architecture. Some other contributions as benchmarking existing works and discussion. They cannot be considered as significance due to (1) no significance contribution beyond other works. (2) no novel method is proposed to customize the new-labeled synthetic to real dataset.
2. The domain adaptation seems not suitable for synthetic to real datasets. The gain of synthetic data is easy and straightforward. Therefore, we should generate more diversed synthetic data to achieve domain generalization rather than domain adaptation. Please refer to ClonePerson and RandPerson for this kind of research;
3. The authors discuss the legitimate in data-labeling, however, the main step that incurs the privacy problem is capturing data. How can your data captured in Figure 2 protects the privacy of persons and vehicles. As far as I concern, the passerbys cannot know their cars or themselves are trained for AI models. A license from local government is not enough, it seems to be the human right matters;
4. The authors try to provide some understanding, however, these understandings are not well-defined by mathematics. Instead, they are some intuitive ones without proof. Some understanding in theory is expected.
