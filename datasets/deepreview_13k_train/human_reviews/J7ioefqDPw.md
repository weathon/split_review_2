# Rethinking Label Poisoning for GNNs: Pitfalls and Attacks

- Decision: Accept
- Scores: 8, 5, 8, 6

## Abstract
Node labels for graphs are usually generated using an automated process or crowd-sourced from human users. This opens up avenues for malicious users to compromise the training labels, making it unwise to blindly rely on them. While robustness against noisy labels is an active area of research, there are only a handful of papers in the literature that address this for graph-based data. Even more so, the effects of adversarial label perturbations is sparsely studied. More critically, we reveal that the entire literature on label poisoning for GNNs is plagued by serious evaluation pitfalls. Thus making it hard to conclude how robust GNNs are against label perturbations. After course correcting the state of label poisoning attacks with our faithful evaluation, we identify a discrepancy in attack efficiency of $\sim9\%$ on average. Additionally, we introduce two new simple yet effective attacks that are significantly stronger (up to $\sim8\%$) than the previous strongest attack. Our strongest proposed attack can be efficiently computed and is theoretically backed.

### Summary
The paper focus on adversarial attacks in the context of graph learning algorithms. In particular it considers label poisoning (a specific case of data poisoning) for GNN algorithms. This work highlights the vulnerability of models to these attacks and the methodological problems of previous studies in evaluating this vulnerability. It also presents new attacks and provides some new insights on adversarial attacks “overfitting”.

### Strengths
* The paper is well written and well structured
* Pushing for higher standards in adversarial attacks is important for the research community
* The discussion on binary attacks overfitting is interesting (and would worth being investigated more)

### Weaknesses
 * It is not super clear if the newly proposed approach are using insights coming from the different pitfalls. Especially the HP tuning one.
* Paragraph 3 mentions the pitfalls of undefended models but defers it to paragraph  ; as a result we cannot get a complete picture of the impact on the performance (and we expect this pitfall to have a large impact as well)

### Questions
* In Eq. (1) could we replace the argmax on L by an argmax on another metric (error rate) without loss of generality ? What would be the impact of having a more general formulation here ? (aka adversary trying to maximize error rate and not necessarily maximize loss ; would it change the design typically of the Meta attack ?)
* As mentioned above, paragraph 3 do not adress the defense-awareness pitfall ; would it be feasible to have a Figure like Fig 2 that takes this pitfall into account ? (if you have the experiments ready)
* I would suggest to add a number (P1, ..., P6) to refer to each of the pitfalls, which would make the paper easier to read (+ it would also improve the readability of some figures)
* You are introducing two new attacks. Did you leverage some insights coming from the 6 pitfalls to define these attacks ?

### Summary
The paper first analyze the exiting problems in the current evaluation on the label-poisoning attack in the graph data. Through the analysis, the paper finds that the current evaluation has validation/test data unbalanced problem and is only tested in a single hyperparameter setting. The evaluation also keeps the labels in the validation/test data is clean. Then the paper proposes a new attack that formalize the label poisoning attack problem into a mixed-integer linear program. The paper also proposes to try  an orthogonal approach where it directly optimize the poisoned label through gradient descent and use the gumbel-softmax loss to enforce the discrete property. Extensive experiments have been conducted to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method.

### Strengths
1. The paper is well-written and not hard to follow.
2. The analysis of current problem in the evaluation does help the future study in the label poisoning community.

### Weaknesses
1. The paper is not well-organized. The analysis on current evaluation doesn't help to understand why the new method is proposed. The paper does want to include a lot of discussion on different parts of the label-poisoning attack. However, I find they are not well-connected and I fail to find a coherent logic flow in the paper.
2. Since I am not from this community, the proposed method seems a very natural formulation to conduct the label flip idea. Therefore, I am not sure whether the paper has enough novelty. Also, the formulation is also heavily based on the previous study and the proposed method is like a multi-label extension to me.
3. Some pitfalls proposed are weird to me. I am not sure why the split between training, validation and test should be equal. As a semi-supervised learning task, it is usually to let them differ in my opinion and I am also not sure why the validation set should be poisoned as well since the validation set should be used to select model and do cross-validation.

### Summary
This paper investigates label poisoning attacks against graph neural networks (GNNs). The paper first argues that major flaws exist in the evaluation of existing attacks against GNNs that needs to be resolved. These issues, such as the distribution of training/validation nodes and hyper-parameter selection, are related to faithfully considering the capabilities of defenders against such label poisoning attacks. The paper provides a critical evaluation of these pitfalls and demonstrate that they can have a significant effect on the performance of existing attacks. In the second part of the paper, two novel label poisoning attacks are introduced. The first one, called linear surrogate attack, uses a linear model as a surrogate for the models that one aims to attack. Then, a novel mixed-integer linear program is proposed to find the optimal solution for this attack. The second attack, dubbed meta attack, is motivated through the use of meta-learning for solving the bi-level optimization problem used for generating the label poisoning attack. Finally, the paper investigates the reasons behind superior performance of label poisoning attacks that only consider two classes to perform their flipping. Empirical and theoretical results for all the contributions are provided. Interestingly, the proposed linear surrogate attacks outperform all existing label poisoning attack baselines on both vanilla and defended GNNs.

### Strengths
- This paper pins down vital cracks in evaluation of label poisoning attacks and show that they can play a crucial role on the model performance. The authors present these pitfalls and argue around the unrealistic nature of each one. These arguments are supported by extensive experimental results, validating the authors' claims.

- The presented linear surrogate and meta attacks are novel and effective. The paper presents these two new methods and introduces new theory to support such attacks. Experimental results also demonstrate that these two attacks can outperform state-of-the-art baselines by a large margin.

- The most important part of this submission, in my view, is its writing and presentation. Instead of presuming that the reader is familiar with this topic, the authors present their ideas in detail and explain the intuition behind each step, making it extremely easy for the reader to navigate through the paper. Given the abundance of contributions in the paper, it could have been easy to drown the reader with a flow of information, but the authors present all these ideas in a coherent manner, making the paper a pleasure to read.

### Weaknesses
 - Perhaps the most problematic issue with the current submission for me is the lack of direct relationship between the proposed methods and the discussions of the first half of the paper. It would have been nicer if the authors could make the connection of these two parts more clear. In other words, was the design of the proposed attacks in any form motivated by the flaws in evaluating label poisoning attacks in GNNs, or these two parts of the paper shall be seen as two disjoint contributions?

- Besides, providing some explanation/intuition about the first pitfall of baseline evaluation would be nice. At the moment, the paper just states that existing methods use considerably larger validation sets than training ones, but it doesn't go into the details of why this is a pitfall. Elaborating on the during the second paragraph of Section 3 is much appreciated.

### Questions
Besides the above-mentioned questions, here are some additional questions/suggestions:

- Could you please explain how the final poisoned label is computed via $\hat{\boldsymbol{Y}}\_{l} = \mathrm{diag}(\boldsymbol{b}) \odot \boldsymbol{H} + \mathrm{diag}(\mathbf{1}\_{L} - \boldsymbol{b}) \odot \boldsymbol{Y}\_{l}$?

- Using larger legends and axis labels for the plots is highly encouraged.

### Summary
This paper evaluates the current state of research on label poisoning in Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). The authors point out that while noisy labels in machine learning have been extensively studied, the same cannot be said for graph-based data, especially in the context of adversarial label perturbations. The paper identifies evaluation pitfalls in existing literature, questioning the conclusions drawn about the robustness of GNNs against label poisoning. To address this, the authors delve into various attack strategies, explore the intricacies of loss functions, and aim to provide a more accurate understanding of GNN vulnerabilities.

### Strengths
1. Formalisation: This paper provides a formalisation for the research questions.
2. Focus on Nuances: A lot of part of this paper focuses on discriminating the nuances of existing methods, which contributes to building trustworthy GNNs from an accountability view. The authors don't just critique existing literature but also provide a summarisation of pitfalls in existing works.

### Weaknesses
1. Unconvincing arguments, presentation ambiguity and self-contradiction: (1) Lot of arguments in this paper are not convincing. For example, it says “The first pitfall arises since all previous attacks evaluate on data splits with validation set size much larger than that of the training set (e.g. 500 validation vs 140 train nodes on Cora-ML in the default setting).” Actually, this kind of data partitioning is practical in graph learning as model developers focus on training and validating datasets in the training phase. It is hard to say this is a pitfall. (2) A lot of the statements are ambiguous. For example, it says “We observe that fine-tuning with only 20 configurations can significantly deteriorate the attack performance, as evidenced by an increase in test accuracy.” The configurations are not explained clearly here. (3) Self-contradictive statement. In the beginning, it says that one drawback of related works is they focus on the binary task, however, they can be generalised to multiclass tasks, as shown in the evaluation part of this paper.
2. Limited novelty. Although the research problem has been formulated, the proposed solutions have limited contribution. First, the method in section 4.1, only focuses on the liner GCN model, which ignores the non-linear property of most GNN models. The second method introduces a learning-based method to select nodes for flipping, however, the effectiveness will be limited by the expression ability of the surrogate model in the inner optimisation. Considering these limitations, existing methods can be adapted to the current setting, and unhighlighted research challenges in this paper, the novelty of the proposed methods is weak.
3. Objective Presentations. Broad claims, especially critiques of an entire domain of literature, require comprehensive evidence and careful presentation to avoid potential overgeneralization. For example, the statement that the "entire literature on label poisoning for GNNs is plagued by serious evaluation pitfalls" is a strong assertion. From the segments I reviewed, there wasn't exhaustive and convincing evidence presented to substantiate such a broad critique. While the paper might delve deeper into this in sections I haven't extracted, from the available content, this claim appears to lack detailed supporting examples.
