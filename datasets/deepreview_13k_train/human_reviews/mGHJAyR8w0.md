# Rethinking the Benefits of Steerable Features in 3D Equivariant Graph Neural Networks

- Decision: Accept
- Scores: 8, 6, 6, 6

## Abstract
Theoretical and empirical comparisons have been made to assess the expressive power and performance of invariant and equivariant GNNs. However, there is currently no theoretical result comparing the expressive power of $k$-hop invariant GNNs and equivariant GNNs. Additionally, little is understood about whether the performance of equivariant GNNs, employing steerable features up to type-$L$, increases as $L$ grows -- especially when the feature dimension is held constant. In this study, we introduce a key lemma that allows us to analyze steerable features by examining their corresponding invariant features. The lemma facilitates us in understanding the limitations of $k$-hop invariant GNNs, which fail to capture the global geometric structure due to the loss of geometric information between local structures. Furthermore, we investigate the invariant features associated with different types of steerable features and demonstrate that the expressiveness of steerable features is primarily determined by their dimension -- independent of their irreducible decomposition. This suggests that when the feature dimension is constant, increasing $L$ does not lead to essentially improved performance in equivariant GNNs employing steerable features up to type-$L$. We substantiate our theoretical insights with numerical evidence.

### Summary
This paper studies the expressivity of geometric graph networks which are “multi-hop”, or aggregate information at each message passing step based on all nodes at most some number of steps from each node. They use the notion of equivariant moving frames to connect invariant features with equivariant features, illustrating that any equivariant activation space can be converted to an invariant activation space of equal dimension, so long as the frame is tracked (via an input-dependent group element). With this perspective, they show that k-hop invariant GNNs lose some geometric information relative to equivariant GNNs, but that the particular representations internal to equivariant GNNs matter less (in some sense) than the dimensions of the representations.

### Strengths
The problem studied in this paper is topical and practically meaningful, as geometric GNNs are quite widespread in application. Moreover, the insights presented in the paper are prescriptive, and give a rule of thumb for selecting hyper parameters such as the highest “L” (indexing the irrupts of O(3) or SO(3)) to include, and how many channels to use. The use of equivariant moving frames to convert to invariants is uncommon elsewhere in the literature, and its application to expressivity considerations is creative. The paper is generally clear and well-written. The authors’ theoretical claims, and even some less rigorous intuitions, are backed up with large-scale experiments on cutting edge architectures for the OpenCatalyst dataset.

### Weaknesses
1. My main qualm is with Corollary 3 and similar statements. In this Corollary, the authors note that given an equivariant function on a k-dimensional input representation space, it can be converted to an equivariant function on any other k-dimensional input representation space. As a result, they claim that the choice of representation to which the internal activations of a neural network transform is irrelevant (modulo its dimension). However, the conversion mapping from one equivariant vector space to a different (equal-dimensional) equivariant vector space may be arbitrarily complex or difficult to compute, and indeed, it may or may not be computable with a given architecture. In the case of rotations, one needs to recover g from a faithful representation (e.g. l=1), and then evaluate another representation at g — but computing a Wigner D matrix of high L may take many layers/parameters in the GNN. This is in the same spirit as universality results, which e.g. require increasing numbers of layers to approximate polynomials of increasing degree (see e.g. the appendix of Bogatskiy et al 2022, Lorentz Group Equivariant Neural Network for Particle Physics). In other words, there is a critical distinction between whether the **information** to compute a particular mapping is available, and whether a given architecture can actually **efficiently compute** that mapping. The authors of this work seem to focus more on the former perspective; namely, whether or not there is information loss from a certain architecture, which precludes one from ever computing a particular function (by any means). This has been a fruitful perspective for existing impossibility results on invariant GNNs — since these results roughly establish that, by only working with invariants, some neighborhoods are indistinguishable, and so **no** architecture can distinguish between them. This is a strong notion, but the converse does not hold: when the information is **not** lost, this does not imply that any architecture can actually compute the mapping. All of this is to say that, in my opinion, Corollary 3 does not sufficiently imply that the choice of equivariant representation is irrelevant up to dimension. I suspect even that the choice of representation may affect the universality of a fixed architecture family.
2. On a related note, many of the paper’s claims are informal — e.g. “there is no fundamental distinction in message-passing mechanisms arising from different values of L” in Remark 3, or “analyzing the message passing using the corresponding invariant features is a reasonable approach” on page 4. It would be very helpful and important to make these precise. 
3. There are a few very related lines of work which aren’t cited, but probably should be. For example, the paper’s reasoning relies heavily on the concept of “equivariant moving frames,” which are a classical notion (dating back to Elie Cartan); yet this term does not appear in the paper, nor does a citation to e.g. Puny et al’s frame averaging paper, which is a more recent machine learning paper that harnesses the concept of frames. A small section (the start of Section 3.2 on page 6) in this paper also notes that the output symmetry of an equivariant function must be at least the input symmetry; this is a well-established fact about equivariant functions, e.g. see Smidt et al 2021. Finally, and perhaps most significantly, related ideas were discussed in ClofNet (Du et al 2022) and its follow-up LeftNet (Du et al 2023), both of which use the precise idea of moving frames and invariantization to obtain equivariants from invariants. The latter work in particular includes an expressivity result for two-hop geometric GNNs. 


Here are a few minor typos and writing notes:
* On page 3, in the definition of geometric graphs, in the last two sentences: g inconsistently has a subscript $g_i$. Also, the last equality should presumably be an inequality (k-hop distinct if for all isomorphism, there is a node I, such that for any g, that equation does NOT hold).
* Page 3, k-hop geometry GNNs: “Given a geometric graph G=(V,E,F,X).” is not a full sentence; perhaps “Given” should have been “Consider”.
* In Lemma 1, was $V_0$ defined somewhere?
* As a very minor nitpick, the calligraphic g the authors have chosen for the group element is used almost universally to refer to an element of a Lie algebra, not of a Lie group. I would recommend sticking to regular $g$.

### Questions
1. Intuitively, where is the multi-hop aspect used in this work? The intuition about invariant features and moving frames seems true for 1-hop networks too. What is the takeaway regarding “multi-hop” architectures from this work, in contrast to 1-hop networks?
2. eSCN is an architecture evaluated in the experiments section. But is this a multi-hop architecture? 
3. Could the authors comment further on Corollary 3, regarding point (1) from the Weaknesses section? For example, doesn’t the choice of internal representation affect the universality a given architecture (beyond just the dimension)?

### Summary
In recent years there has been growing interest in various forms of `geometric graph neural networks', where the input are graphs whose node have attributes in R^3, and the tasks discussed are equivariant to both relabeling of the nodes and applying a global rigid motion to all node coordinates. 

There is a zoo of different methods for these problems, which differ among others in the use of invariant vs equivariant features and in the type of GNN used as a backbone. This paper attempts to understand the importance  of these various different choices. It  discusses k-hop GNNs with invariant/equivariant features. Its main claims are:
(a) Invariant features are less expressive than equivariant features.
(b) equivariant features of order 1 are as expressive as higher order features- the main issue is the dimension of the features and not the equivariant order

### Strengths
The paper has some observations I believe are novel and interesting:
(a) an interesting correspondence between equivariant functions and invariant functions, and between equivariant functions spaces of different order. 
(b) the conjecture that high dimensional representations do not matter, once the number of features is evened out, is interesting and recieves some empirical and theoretical evidence in the paper.

### Weaknesses
 * Regarding (a): This correspondence has an important limitation which I believe the authors should mention:  Update and Aggregation functions which are actually useful for learning are reasonably `nice': for example, differentiable almost everywhere, continuous, etc. The correspondence suggested by lemma 1 uses a mapping of every orbit to a canonical element which indeed exists, but is not in general continuous or very well behaved. As a result an equivariant `nice' aggregation function will correspond to a `wild' invariant aggregation function.

* The paper's stand on invariant vs equivariant features seems inconsistent. On the one hand the paper maintains that there is a one-to-one correspondence between invariant and equivariant features, and that "propagation of steerable features can be effectively understood as propagation of invariant features, therefore analyzing the message passing using the corresponding invariant features is a reasonable approach (page 4)" on the other hand once this analysis is carried out the paper maintains that it points to an advantage of equivariant over invariant. This is not clearly explained, and the analysis seems to suggest that invariant and equivariant features are equivalent, yet the conclusion is that equivariant features are superior.

*I have some issues with the writing, which could be addressed in a revision towards a camera ready version.

* Page 4: Steerable features: It would make more sense to me to define f to be the steerable features. What does it mean to say that a vector is a steerable feature? Say you have a vector x=[1,2,5] in R^3. Is it a steerable feature or not?
* Page 5: "without loss of generality we may assume the group reps are all the same" why?
* Remark 3 is vague and out of context. Corollary 3 seems related, is much more formal and accurate, but does not require the action to be faithful. Can you formally explain why faithfulness is important? This could be the criitical missing link explaining why in terms of the irreducible order $\ell$ we claim to have 0<1=2=3=4=... which is the message you are trying to convey but I don't think the theory currently supports.
* Page 6: "This question is essentially asking whether the space of all type-ell features has a dimension of 2\ell +1" This is well defined once f is fixed I believe and X is free? Perhaps clarifying this will also help me understand how you define steerable features in general.
* Page 6: Could you specify v=f(x_1,x_2) or whatever the relation between v and x_1,x_2 is?
* Also I think a similar observation appears in [Villar, Lemma 3] I suggest you cite them
* Table 1: what are the significance of the specific three values of (L,c) chosen in Table 1? Presumably you can run eSCN with any choice of the c-s?
* In Table 2 the invariant equiformerV2 actually does reasonably well, seemingly contradicting your theorem?

small comments that should not be addressed in rebuttal:
* Page 2: the stabilizer is not only a set but also a group, perhaps you would prefer to say 'group' 
* Page 3: I didn't understand the definition of k-hop distinct. Possibly a typo somewhere there?  
* in Lemma 1 and elsewhere: in the formula f(X)=... the output of lambda is in $V_0^{d}$ and then you apply $\rho(g)$ and get something in $V$. I understand what you mean but technically the group action should go from V to V.
* Page 4: "for simplicity we represent g as g_X" I believe here and a line or two above you accidently swapped between g and g_X
* In theorem 2 has V_l,aug been previouisly defined? Couldn't easily find the definition.

### Summary
This paper introduces a theoretical analysis of the expressive power of steerable equivariant GNNs. In particular, the authors show that every type-$L$ steerable feature can be analyzed through its corresponding invariant features. The authors use this lemma to study $k$-hop invariant GNNs and show limited expressive power. Then, the authors argue that any type-$L$ steerable feature is as expressive as its dimension. Specifically, there is a one-to-one correspondence between steerable features and $d $ invariants. Hence, increasing $L$, when accounting for the increase of feature dimension, does not improve the GNN's performance. The authors test their findings on several numerical experiments.

### Strengths
The writing is of high quality and clarity. Recent works have started analyzing the expressive power of steerable graph NNs, but little consensus has been reached. Hence I'd say this is a timely and significant work.

### Weaknesses
See Questions for clarifications.

- I think a highly related work is Villar et al. (2022) ("Scalars are universal...") with several related and perhaps even identical results: please include this in your related work section.
- The notations sometimes could be clarified a bit further.
  - For example, the logic above Lemma 1 could be laid out a bit clearer.
  - It's not clear to me how $\rho(g_X)$ acts on $\lambda(X) \in V_0^{\oplus d}$. First off, what is the action of $\rho(g_X)$? Further, $\lambda(X)$ is a tuple of scalars, so are they all left-invariant? Or are you considering them as a vector in $V$? This is also how you define $f$ in Lemma 1.
  - In general, how can an *equivariant* function be described by *invariants*? I guess I'm not following some notations here.
- I find it slightly confusing what the exact message is that the paper is trying to convey, especially towards the end of the paper.
  - It is claimed that one needs more than invariants to capture the global symmetries, yet Lemma 1 states that one can use invariants to represent equivariant functions (see also my previous comments).
  - I find it slightly confusing that according to the paper, one doesn't need more than $ L=1 $, but many experiments (Table 1, 2, 3) use $ L=2$ and higher.
  - In the conclusion, it is claimed that $L \geq 1$ captures local structures, but one doesn't need more than type $L$. Why don't the authors claim that $L=1$ is enough?

### Questions
- Can you contrast your results with Villar et al. (2022)? How do your results differ/improve upon theirs?
Let's take a basis vector $e_1 \in \mathbb{R}^{3 \times 1}$ and $f: \mathbb{R}^{3 \times 1} \to \mathbb{R}^3$ with $e_1 \mapsto \alpha_1 e_1, \alpha \in \mathbb{R}$. This is clearly an equivariant function. What would the corresponding invariant function be such that Lemma 1 holds?
- Let's take three basis vectors $e_1, e_2, e_3 \in \mathbb{R}^{3\times3}$ and $f: \mathbb{R}^{3 \times 3} \to \mathbb{R}^3$ with $e_1, e_2, e_3 \mapsto \alpha_1 e_1 + \alpha_2 e_2 + \alpha_3 e_3, \alpha \in \mathbb{R}$. 
  - Isn't the set stabilizer now only the trivial rotation?
  - What would, in this case, be the corresponding unique $\lambda$?
- Why did you use $L=2$ and higher in your experiments in Tables 1, 2, and 3?
- Could you elaborate on my last comments in the previous (weaknesses) section?
- Do you know if your results were somehow already known in (geometric) invariant theory?

### Summary
This paper compares the expressive power of invariant and equivariant GNNs, from a theoretical perspective, backed by a couple of experiments (1 toy experiment and 2 real datasets).
It is an extension of what was recently done in [16] to the case of k-hop GNNs.
The main theoretical contribution is Lemma 1, which states that there is a unique invariant feature corresponding to any equiavariant one. It is made more concrete by theorem 2 and corrolary 1.
The experiments investigate the interplay between type order L (order of the Spherical Harmonics expansion, e.g. L=1 is vectors, L=0 scalars, L>1 are high order tensors), depth, and channel number, in the context of fixed feature dimension. This allows the authors to formulate the cautious claim "preserving the feature dimension, the expressiveness of equivariant GNNs employing steerable features up to type-L may not increase as L grows."

I update my rating to 6, marginally above acceptance threshold.

### Strengths
The idea of studying equivariant GNNs in the context of k-hop aggregation is new.
The formalism the authors use to formulate proofs is general and does not rely on Spherical Harmonics explictly (this is also a weakness though).
The idea of working at fixed budget to compare models, albeit probably not new, is to be saluted.

### Weaknesses
The idea of studying equivariant GNNs in the context of k-hop aggregation is new.
The formalism the authors use to formulate proofs is general and does not rely on Spherical Harmonics explictly (this is also a weakness though).
The idea of working at fixed budget to compare models, albeit probably not new, is to be saluted.

See my questions below for details. The main Weaknesses are:

Lack of novelty compared to what was done in [16]. See my points 2d., 4., 7a., 8.

Overall clarity: although wording is clear, some definitions are not given (as k-hop, see questions below) and the fact that theorems prove existence but do not provide an example of such function (like lambda, in some concrete example) make it hard to follow. See questions.

Also, it is not clear whether all claims are correct (or, some of them may be correct but trivial if properly re-phrased -- but I may be wrong !).

I may be misunderstood in my assessment, hence my numerous questions.

1. In the definition of k-hop geometric GNNs, k is not defined (its role is not defined).
Actually, the definition of k-hop GNN is a bit overlooked (although it's rather intuitive what the meaning of k-hop is), and more importantly, it is not clear to me how these are not essentially equivalent to regular GNNs with more layers (since a single layer of a 2-hop GNN aggregates information with a similar receptive field as a 1-hop GNN with 2 layers).
Probably authors should elaborate on that or cite appropriate references.

2a. About Lemma 1, page 4. When you define the function c, why can't it simply be always the identity? One could always choose the neutral element from the group G.
I do understand why the set {g ∈ G | g · c(G · X) = X} is not empty.
I do not understand what is non trivial about c(G · X)

2b. Also, V_0^{⊕d} is not explicitly defined early enough. What is d ? Does it relate to the maximal rotation order L ?

2c. You proove that the decomposition of Lemma 1 is unique. But, concretely, what is lambda ? Isn't it almost always simply the norm of the irrep ? Like, for a vector, its norm, or for a higher-order tensor, also its norm ? And then \rho(g_X) is just the usual (matrix) representation of g_X.
Can it be otherwise ? Or is it more complicated ? Am I missing the point ?
If in practice things are simple, in most of the usual settings, saying so is helpful to the reader.
OR, maybe g_X simply encodes the orientation of X (say if it's a vector)?

2d. In ref [16], page 3, it says:
|At initial-
|isation, we assign to each node i ∈ V a scalar node colour
|c i ∈ C ′ and an auxiliary object g i containing the geometric
|information associated to it
|i.e. they already separate (factorize) the scalar (feature only) contributions from the geometric ones (vectorial one v + previous color).
In this respect it is not obvious how contribution (1) (your lemma 1) is new.
Furthermore, I lack an intuitive view of what may concretely go into your scalar function lambda(X).

3. gothic{g} appears in the r.h.s. of Eq (4) or in the last line of the previous est of equations (let me call this last line Eq. 3bis) (actually the gothic-style has been forgotten in Eq. (4), this is a typo I believe).
How can we identify the right term in the r.h.s. of Eq. 3bis as a lambda (invariant), when g^-1 appears in it ? I don't see why g^-1\cdot x_ij should be invariant, on the contrary, it seems to me like an equivariant feature.


In Eq. 7, first line, why isn't it 2l+2 instead of 2l+1 (in the r.h.s.) ? I understood that representing O(3) required one additional component ? Could you provide an intuitive explanation?

4. You write, in page 6:
|Does any (2l + 1)-dimensional invariant feature λ(X) correspond to a type-l steerable feature f (X)?
Which sounds like an interesting question (although ideally I'd like to know the mapping, not just know about its existence)
|Note that this question is essentially asking whether the space of all type-l steerable features f (X) has a dimension of 2l + 1 since D l (g X ) is invertible.
But that sounds like a known fact: using Spherical Harmonics, it is known that  type-l steerable features  need components $h_m$ with  $m\in[-l,+l]$ to be represented. That is, they need 2l+1 numbers (dimensions)

5. The remark below corrolary 3 is a very strong, original conclusion.
I think I understand corrolary 3 (altohough I feel like in practice lambda is the norm of the representation, and in that case it's kind of trivial..).
In any case I do not see how the remark  "the expressiveness of learning steerable features is primarily characterized by the feature dimension – independent of the highest type utilized"  follows from corrolary 3.

6. In table I, I can do the maths for line 1 and 2, but not line 3.
(5+3+1)*256 = 2304
(5+3+1)*824 = 7416
but then,
(1+3+5+7+9+11+13)*256 =12544 , not 7424


7. experiments are a bit disappointing.
7a. First, Table 2 shows a number of red (intersting) cases, but they turn out to be related to eSCN being SO(3)-eqivariant, when the task is O(3). This is not making the point of the paper, and instead is rather confusing, at first sight.
Most importantly, it's not clear to me in which sense table 2 is different from the table 1 of ref [16] (which by the way seemed more readable and dense).
Please clarify this.

7b. IS2RE. Table 3.
Here I enjoyed a lot the idea of comparing models with comparable feature dimension.
However, several points:
- why not report also the total number of parameters ? They do not grow as fast as feature dimension since weights are shared for a given L (type order)
- although I understand it's somewhat hardware dependent, please also report the training time for these models. Maybe even the memory footprint (on GPU).
- Figure 3 gives an idea of how things perform over a reasonable number of epochs (and I salute the attempt to not go to an exceedingly large number of epochs), but it seems that a more thorough study of variations with L and c, reporting only the epoch=12 validation performances, would be useful to the reader (I did not have time to look at the content of ref [5])

7c. S2EF. Table 4 is commented, but no conclusion stands out. What is the point of that table ?


8. Conclusion. Two key findings are claimed:
| (1) Propagating steerable features of type ≥ 1
| equips geometric GNNs with the inherent ability to automatically capture the geometry between local
| structures. (2) When the feature dimension remains constant, increasing the use of steerable features
| up to type-L cannot essentially improve the performance of equivariant GNNs
But I think that  (1) is vague and already known. For instance from (16), which clearly distinguishes invariant (L=0) from equivariant L>=1
networks.
And that (2) is known as oversquashing and was known before.
I note that the term oversquashing is absent from the manuscript, although it is mentionned several times in [16].
I think the term should appear. If it sounds too buzzwordy to the authors, they should mention it at least once, and explain why they don't like it.

5. The remark below corrolary 3 is a very strong, original conclusion.
I think I understand corrolary 3 (altohough I feel like in practice lambda is the norm of the representation, and in that case it's kind of trivial..).
In any case I do not see how the remark  "the expressiveness of learning steerable features is primarily characterized by the feature dimension – independent of the highest type utilized"  follows from corrolary 3.


6. In table I, I can do the maths for line 1 and 2, but not line 3.
(5+3+1)*256 = 2304
(5+3+1)*824 = 7416
but then,
(1+3+5+7+9+11+13)*256 =12544 , not 7424


7. experiments are a bit disappointing.
7a. First, Table 2 shows a number of red (intersting) cases, but they turn out to be related to eSCN being SO(3)-eqivariant, when the task is O(3). This is not making the point of the paper, and instead is rather confusing, at first sight.
Most importantly, it's not clear to me in which sense table 2 is different from the table 1 of ref [16] (which by the way seemed more readable and dense).
Please clarify this.

7b. IS2RE. Table 3.
Here I enjoyed a lot the idea of comparing models with comparable feature dimension.
However, several points:
- why not report also the total number of parameters ? They do not grow as fast as feature dimension since weights are shared for a given L (type order)
- although I understand it's somewhat hardware dependent, please also report the training time for these models. Maybe even the memory footprint (on GPU).
- Figure 3 gives an idea of how things perform over a reasonable number of epochs (and I salute the attempt to not go to an exceedingly large number of epochs), but it seems that a more thorough study of variations with L and c, reporting only the epoch=12 validation performances, would be useful to the reader (I did not have time to look at the content of ref [5])

7c. S2EF. Table 4 is commented, but no conclusion stands out. What is the point of that table ?


8. Conclusion. Two key findings are claimed:
| (1) Propagating steerable features of type ≥ 1
| equips geometric GNNs with the inherent ability to automatically capture the geometry between local
| structures. (2) When the feature dimension remains constant, increasing the use of steerable features
| up to type-L cannot essentially improve the performance of equivariant GNNs
But I think that  (1) is vague and already known. For instance from (16), which clearly distinguishes invariant (L=0) from equivariant L>=1
networks.
And that (2) is known as oversquashing and was known before.
I note that the term oversquashing is absent from the manuscript, although it is mentionned several times in [16].
I think the term should appear. If it sounds too buzzwordy to the authors, they should mention it at least once, and explain why they don't like it.
