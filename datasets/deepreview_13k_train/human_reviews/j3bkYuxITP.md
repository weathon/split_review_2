# Refined Partitioning Boosts MGDA: Introducing RP-MGDA for Multi-Objective Learning

- Decision: Reject
- Scores: 3, 5, 3, 5

## Abstract
Multi-objective optimization is a critical topic in the field of machine learning, with applications in multi-task learning, federated learning, reinforcement learning, and more. In this paper, to elevate the performance of the widely used Multiple Gradient Descent Algorithm (MGDA) in multi-objective optimization tasks, we introduce a novel version of MGDA through Refined Partitioning (RP-MGDA). RP-MGDA leverages the concept of `refined partitioning', where variables are strategically partitioned and grouped in order to improve the optimization process, in contrast to vanilla MGDA which ignores potential variable structure and, as a result, treats all parameters as one variable. Our examples and experiments showcase the effectiveness of RP-MGDA compared to MGDA under various scenarios. We provide insights into the underlying mechanisms of RP-MGDA and demonstrate its potential applications. Specifically, the concept of refined variable partitioning in RP-MGDA is not limited solely to MGDA and holds promise for enhancing other multi-objective gradient methods (e.g., PCGrad, CAGrad).

### Rating

### Rating Number

### Confidence
2: You are willing to defend your assessment, but it is quite likely that you did not understand the central parts of the submission or that you are unfamiliar with some pieces of related work. Math/other details were not carefully checked.

### Summary
This paper studied the performance of the widely used multi-gradient descent algorithm (MGDA) for multi-objective optimization (MOO). The authors constructed pedagogical examples to illustrate the sub-optimal performance of MGDA in terms of Pareto-optimality when the objective functions are convex. To address this problem and motivated by the examples, the authors proposed a refined partitioning MGDA (RP-MGDA) approach. The authors empirically showed that RP-MGDA achieves better solutions compared to the basic MGDA approach.

### Strengths
1. MOO is a timely topic in the learning community but remains relatively under-explored. This paper provides interesting insights and improves the understanding of the basic MGDA approach.

2. The proposed RP-MGDA approach is interesting and overcomes some limitations of MGDA.

### Weaknesses
1. This paper lacks theoretical depth and is mostly an empirical paper.

2. Some of the claims are questionable. 

Please see the questions below.

### Questions
1. The constructed examples in this paper are mostly pedagogical toy examples or synthetic problems. Many of the examples are for convex objective functions. In practice, however, most problems are with non-convex objective functions. Thus, it remains clear whether the advantage of RP-MGDA over MGDA continues to hold under non-convex cases. Could the authors provide more examples for non-convex cases?

2. Theorem 2 seems odd and not very meaningful. It says that "there exists a convex multi-objective optimization problem where the solution of RM-MGDA are provably Pareto optimal where MGDA is not." However, based on simple logic, one cannot draw the conclusion that RP-MGDA is better than MGDA (even for the convex case), right?

### Summary
The authors found  the drawback of MGDA algorithm applied to problems with specific variable dependency structures. Motivated from this finding, they propose RP-MGDA to improve the performance of MGDA by considering the variable structure and do refined partitioning instead of naive MGDA. Theoretically, it was demonstrated that RP-MGDA is at least as good as MGDA. Empirically, they demonstrate the effectiveness of RP-MGDA through two toy examples.

### Strengths
1. I like it very much that the authors illustrate their ideas with toy examples throughout the paper. It really helps the understanding of the paper a lot.

2. To the best of my knowledge, the problem setting of MOO problems with general variable dependency structures is rarely (probably none) studied. Thus, I think it is quite interesting to see the analysis the authors show in this paper the impact of the findings.

### Weaknesses
I think the paper can be improved in the following ways:

1. More discussions about more related works of MGDA variants, such as on ICML paper https://proceedings.mlr.press/v162/momma22a/momma22a.pdf

Also,  for applications like federated MOO, the authors could also discuss about https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.09866.pdf

2. The experiments studied in this paper is too small: one bi-objective non-convex optimization problem, and one RANDOM DEPENDENCY MATRIX (5-BY-5). In fact, based on my experience, algorithms that worked well in toy examples might not work at all or that well in real world examples. For example, https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3580305.3599870 reported that one really has too modified the proposed MGDA-based algorithms a bit to make it work.

Besides, it is virtually impossible to apply the proposed Refined Partitioning rules to real world ML datasets, such as those vision or language datasets.

### Questions
Although I like it very much about the refined partitioning ideas, can the authors help me understand how to apply the proposed Refined Partitioning rules to real world ML datasets, such as those vision or language datasets?

### Summary
This paper proposed a refined partition based multiple gradient descent algorithm (RP-MGDA) for multi-objective optimization. It first identifies and analyzes a potential drawback for the widely-used MGDA, where MGDA might only find Pareto stationary but not Pareto optimal solution when all the objective functions are only strictly convex for partial variables but not for all variables. Based on this observation, this work proposes a refined partition approach that divides the variables $x$ into different groups based on the variable structure, and then separately optimizes them with MGDA during the optimization process. The experiment shows that RP-MGDA can find Pareto optimal solutions for some synthetic toy problems while the original MGDA cannot.

### Strengths
+ This work is well-organized and easy to follow.

+ Multi-objective optimization can be found in many real-world applications, where the multiple gradient descent algorithm (MGDA) is a widely-used algorithm. The proposed method can potentially address a drawback for MGDA but with several major concerns (see weaknesses).

### Weaknesses
**1. Assumption on Completely Known Variable Structure**

The original MGDA only depends on the standard first-order oracle for multi-objective optimization, where it can query a variable $x$ and then receive $(f_i(x), \nabla f_i(x))$ pairs for all objective functions. The variable structure is a black-box for MGDA. In contrast, the proposed method has a much stronger assumption that all the variable relations among $x$ for all objective functions are completely known. This important difference is not properly discussed in the paper.

**2. Novelty over the Current Practice**

Although the original MGDA works on the whole variables, a simple **separately optimizing the variables specific to each objective, and then tackling the rest variables shared by more than one objective with MGDA** approach is already widely used in practice. For example, see the seminal work [1] and many follow-ups in the recent years.

The proposed RP-MGDA has two rules to merge the variables, namely, the 'dense block' merge and the 'loop' merge. However, it seems that all the toy examples (section 5.1 and section 5.2) as well as the personalized federated learning example (section A.2) all just simply optimize the objective-specific variable separately, and then optimize the rest variables together.

What is the novelty and advantage of the proposed RP approach over the current practical approach? Can you give an example that how the RP-MGDA will lead to a different grouping? Is there any real-world application to demonstrate and support this setting?

**3. Experiments on Real-World Applications**

This work only conducts experiments on a few toy problems, and the personalized federated learning example (in the Appendix) is an illustrative prototype without experiment.

As a methodology paper, I expect it should have comprehensive experiments on real-world applications that the audience of the ICLR community will be interested in, like those in [1-5]. The current theoretical papers usually also have experiments on large-scale real-world applications like deep multi-task learning [6, 7].

### Questions
- Please address the concerns raised in the above weaknesses.

- The illustrative example (equation 8 on page 4) is not appropriate. Once the variable structure is known, it immediately reduces to two independent and unconflicted single-objective problems. 

- Please make sure the citation (\citet, \citep) is properly used in the paper.

######################## Post-Rebuttal Comment #########################

I've read other reviewers' comments and the general response from authors, and decide to keep my current score.

The variable structure is an important research issue for multi-objective optimization. I encourage the author to further investigate and improve the proposed Refined Partitioning method for developing an efficient multi-objective optimization algorithm.

### Summary
This paper studies the weak optimality issue of MGDA in multi-objective optimization and proposes a new algorithm based on the refined partitioning technique to escape the weakly Pareto optimal points. Specifically, this paper first provides a concrete example, showing that the optimization process of vanilla MGDA may stuck in weakly Pareto points. Enlightened by this observation, this paper proposes to partition the model parameters into different groups according to three partitioning rules, which are then fed to the min-norm solver separately. A case study on personalized federated learning shows the effectiveness of the RP-MGDA's achieving strict Pareto solutions, which is also supported by empirical results.

### Strengths
1. The analysis on weakly Pareto optimal issue for MGDA and the algorithm partitioning all parameters is interesting. The proposed three partitioning rules sound non-trivial.

2. The case study on personalized federated learning verifies the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm in specific scenarios.

3. This paper is generally well written and easy to follow.

### Weaknesses
1. Beyond the specific showcases, it would be better to provide more explanations on the weak optimality issue for MGDA and partitioning everything in principle. Moreover, the intuition of the proposed partitioning rules is not properly discussed. It is not clear whether there is any design principle for partitioning, and more specifically, how do these rules help the MOO algorithm escape the weak Pareto optimal points. 

2. Although the case study on personalized federated learning is interesting, a discussion on the effectiveness of RP-MGDA in more general scenarios will make this paper more significant and technically sound.

### Questions
1. It was claimed that the proposed partitioning technique can also be applied to other multi-objective gradient methods such as PCGrad and CAGrad. Can you justify this point?

2. I would recommend the author to give a more thorough literature review on the related work section.
