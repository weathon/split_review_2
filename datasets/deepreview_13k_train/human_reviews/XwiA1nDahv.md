# Smooth ECE: Principled Reliability Diagrams via Kernel Smoothing

- Decision: Accept
- Scores: 8, 6, 6, 6

## Abstract
Calibration measures
and reliability diagrams
are two fundamental tools for measuring and interpreting
the calibration of probabilistic predictors.
Calibration measures quantify
the degree of miscalibration,
and reliability diagrams visualize the
structure of this miscalibration.
However, the most common constructions of reliability diagrams
and calibration measures --- binning and ECE ---
both suffer from well-known flaws
(e.g. discontinuity).
We show that a simple modification fixes both constructions:
first smooth the observations using an RBF kernel,
then compute the Expected Calibration Error (ECE) of this smoothed function.
We prove that with a careful choice of bandwidth,
this method yields a calibration measure that is
well-behaved in the sense of \citet*{UTC1}
--- a \emph{consistent calibration measure}.
We call this measure the \emph{SmoothECE}.
Moreover, the reliability diagram obtained 
from this smoothed function visually encodes
the SmoothECE, just as binned reliability diagrams encode
the BinnedECE.

We also provide a Python package with simple, hyperparameter-free
methods for measuring and plotting calibration:
\texttt{\`{}pip install relplot\`{}}.

### Confidence
3: You are fairly confident in your assessment. It is possible that you did not understand some parts of the submission or that you are unfamiliar with some pieces of related work. Math/other details were not carefully checked.

### Summary
This paper proposed the smooth ECE, which uses kernel smoothing to compute the Expected Calibration Error(ECE) estimator. The proposed estimator is naturally related to a smoothed reliability diagram. The estimator is shown to be consistent and computationally efficient and sample-efficient.

### Strengths
The paper is well-written and easy to follow. It provides a nice alternative to the commonly used binned ECE estimator, which has the potential to be widely used in the model calibration literature. The theoretical property of the proposed estimator is carefully studied and the computational complexity is also addressed.

### Weaknesses
1. The major contribution of the paper is the new smooth ECE estimator over the commonly used Binned ECE. The paper discussed several disadvantages or flaws of the binned ECE in the introduction, but I think these flaws are not well demonstrated in the experiments, e.g. "changing the predictor by an infinitesimally small amount may change its ECE drastically", "overly sensitive to the choice of bin widths." I think it is beneficial to include some synthetic experiments to demonstrate these problems of the Binned ECE estimator and show how the proposed estimator overcomes them.

2. One property of the proposed estimator is consistent in the sense of (Blasiok 2023). It is different from statistical consistency, I think a bit more discussion on why this property is desirable is helpful.

### Questions
1. The authors emphasize at the end of section 2 that ”consistent calibration measure does not refer to the concept of statistical consistency“. Can the authors comment a bit on the statistical consistency properties of the proposed estimator? e.g. convergence to the ECE as sample size increases?
 
2. On top of page 6, the reflected Gaussian kernel uses sum over $\pi_{R}^{-1}(y)$, is this an infinite sum by the definition of $\pi_{R}^{-1}(y)$? How is it computed in practice?

Minor question

3. In Deep Network paragraph of Section 4, it says "ResNet32", but it is "ResNet34" in Figure 2.

### Summary
The paper proposes a novel calibration metric called SmoothECE based on the use of kernels.
Compared with the commonly used ECE, which is also referred as BinnedECE, it does not suffer from discontinuity.
More importantly, it is a consistent calibration measure and comes with a reliability diagram for visualization (unlike some other proposed metrics).
Even though SmoothECE relies on the use of Gaussian kernels, it has a procedure to choose the kernel bandwidth, which makes it hyper-parameter free.
Calibration of classifiers trained on common benchmarks are assessed by SmoothECE and compared with BinnedECE, showing that it performs similar to BinnedECE and is easy to visualize.
A Python package is developed for this method to use.

### Strengths
**originality** The proposed SmoothECE is novel so do the theoretical results.

**quality** The proposed method is sound. It's consistency is proved as a result of the combination of the use of reflected Gaussian kernels and the way to set $\sigma$, which is very neat.

**clarity** The paper is well-written and easy to follow.

**significance** SmoothECE is a drop-in replacement of BinnedECE and can be potentially widely used by the community. Apart from this, as SmoothECE also alleviates the discontinuity problem of BinnedECE (to be confirmed in Questions), it can enable more work that rely on differentiating through calibration metrics, which is very prohibited by BinnedECE.

### Weaknesses
The experiment section is weak.
If the proposed method alleviates the discontinuity problem of BinnedECE (to be confirmed in Questions), some experiments showing how it can be beneficial (e.g. optimizing a loss involving the calibration metric) should be included.

The code is not provided.
Perhaps the author(s) can use https://anonymous.4open.science to share it anonymously.

### Questions
Can you clarify if SmECE is differentiable?
If so, can we include it in the loss while training classifiers?

In figure 2, what are the shaded areas for the smooth reliability diagrams?
I thought they are kernel density estimates of the predictions but I don't understand why for (d), the red line is surrounded by that area.

### Summary
The paper proposes a way to replace the usual reliability diagram with a smoothed reliability diagram, thus resolving some known issues with using binning schemes. The ECE implied by the proposed smoothed reliability diagram is a consistent calibration measure.

### Strengths
While a number of miscalibration measures that use kernels have been proposed, they are not "human-interpretable" like an l1-ECE is. In particular, they cannot be plotted on a reliability diagram. This paper thus fills an important gap. The proposed reliability diagram is also principled in that it leads to a consistent calibration measure, in the sense of Błasiok et al. (2023). 

The paper is easy-to-follow, clearly describes the issue that is being targeted, and the proposed solution is well-contextualized with the latest literature.

### Weaknesses
In my opinion, the quality of the paper can be improved with more detailed research and better presentation. I have a number of questions, and I feel at least some of them should be answered before publication. (Thus I have given a contribution rating of 2 since I believe more evidence needs to be provided to show the proposed method indeed solves the problem satisfactorily.) 

## Theory/method questions: 
- Page 3 bottom (initial proposal for smECE): I feel that the actual smECE defined in eq. (4) makes more sense than \widetilde{smECE} de facto, so the \widetilde{smECE} is slightly distracting. Is there a reason for not just introducing the actual smECE earlier?  
- What is the reason for picking the fixed point \sigma*? 
- The discussion of Błasiok et al.'s work should be more detailed for someone unfamiliar with it. After Definition 5, I would expect some comments on why consistent calibration measures are a useful notion.  
- Theorem 6: is this a good, bad, or ok "rate"? (perhaps in terms of the \alpha_1 and \alpha_2?) What does it mean in practice? Does the rate show up in experiments? 
- Could you share intuition for Lemma 7 and Lemma 8? 
 
## Experiment questions: 
- The experimental analysis focuses on producing some reliability diagrams. These look nice, but is there a way to show the benefits of the consistency property that is highlighted? 
- Can you show further evidence that the smECE is close to the true ECE in finite samples (on synthetic data)? Fig 1d is one simple setup. 
- Is smECE as useful, less useful, more useful than the usual ECE for comparing the calibration of models? 


## Minor comments: 
- Page 3 top. "Thus we have a situation ... consistent calibration measures." I agree, and would further add that reliability diagrams are nice because they are interpretable by humans. Thus Widmann et al.'s kernel-ECE is very useful for comparison but its adoption has been limited due to the interpretability (aka, lack of reliability diagram) problem. 
- Page 3 bottom \tilde{K} is used before being defined
- Page 5 (center): the methods would in fact apply to any of the binary-reduction-based calibration notions discussed in the paper "Top-label calibration and multiclass-to-binary reductions"

### Summary
The paper studies the limitations of well-known expected calibration error (ECE) and the associated reliability diagram used for quantifying the miscalibration of a machine learning model. Among the core limitations of ECE, the fundamental ones are: discontinuous functional and impossible to estimate efficiently from samples. The paper proposes smoothECE and a regression method, which is ECE of the smoothed version of the original distribution and so the associated reliability diagram reflects a smoothed estimate of the calibration function. It claims that kernel smoothing allows realizing a consistent calibration measure and it provides a way of choosing the kernel bandwidth. The paper shows that SmoothECE has desirable mathematical properties, including consistent calibration measure and being sample and runtime efficient. Experiments have been performed on Deep Networks, Solar Flares, meteorological data, and synthetic data to showcase the comparison between ECE and proposed SmoothECE.

### Strengths
- Calibration is an important aspect of probabilistic predictors as they allow building a certain level of trust in the model’s predictions, therefore studying the limitations of prevalent miscalibration measures i.e. ECE is an important and relevant research direction. 

- The idea of applying kernel smoothing with automatic selection kernel bandwidth to the original distribution is simple. It has been shown that the resulting smoothECE has desirable mathematical properties. 

- Experimental results have been shown on different scenarios, including deep networks, rain forecasts, and solar flares forecasts.

### Weaknesses
 - It would be interesting to see the results of SmoothECE on imbalanced (image) datasets such as SVHN.

- The overall contributions of the paper seem a bit limited as it boils down to applying (Gaussian) kernel to the original distribution for obtaining a smoothed estimate of it (which is already done in the prior work) and a technique to determine the kernel bandwidth. 

- The empirical results are missing experiments on more image datasets, especially that cover out-of-distribution scenarios, and different types of networks.

- It is a bit difficult to understand that, how the smooth reliability is visually more interpretable than the binned reliability. 

- To what extent, this smoothECE can be trusted as a standalone miscalibration measure?
