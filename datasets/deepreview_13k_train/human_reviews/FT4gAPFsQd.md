- Decision: Reject
- Scores: 5, 8, 5, 6

## Abstract
Network pruning constitutes an effective measure to alleviate the storage and computational burden of deep neural networks which arises from its overparameterization. A fundamental question is: How sparse can we prune a deep network without sacrifice on the performance?  To address this problem, in this work we take a first principles approach, specifically, by directly enforcing the sparsity constraint on the original loss function and exploiting the universal \textit{concentration} effect in the high-dimensional world, 
we're able to characterize the sharp phase transition point of pruning ratio, which turns out to equal one minus the normalized squared Gaussian width of a convex set determined by the $l_1$-regularized loss function. Meanwhile, we provide efficient countermeasures to address the challenges in computing the involved Gaussian width, including the spectrum estimation of a large-scale Hessian matrix and dealing with the non-definite positiveness of a Hessian matrix. Moreover, through the lens of the pruning ratio threshold, we're able to identify the key factors that impact the pruning performance, thus providing intuitive explanations on many phenomena of existing pruning algorithms. 
Extensive experiments are performed which demonstrate that the theoretical pruning ratio threshold coincides very well with the experimental one. All codes are available at: \url{https://anonymous.4open.science/r/Global-One-shot-Pruning-BC7B/}

### Summary
This paper offers a theoretical exploration of the fundamental limit of network pruning and demonstrates that the derived sparsity level bounds align effectively with empirical observations. They also proposed an improved spectrum estimation algorithm When computing the Gaussian widths of a high-dim and none-convex set. The theoretical analysis provides plenty of insights about previous observations in network pruning, such as the comparison between magnitude and random pruning, one-shot pruning, and the iterative one.

### Strengths
- The theoretical analysis presented in the paper aligns seamlessly with experimental results and offers valuable insights for the pruning community.
- The experiments cover a broad spectrum of datasets and model architectures, enhancing the paper's comprehensiveness.
- The notations are clearly defined, and the paper exhibits a logical organization, making it accessible and well-structured.

### Weaknesses
 - Section 5.3 appears to be somewhat disconnected from the primary focus of the work. Given the widespread use of regularization-based pruning algorithms in the literature (e.g., [1,2]), it might be worth considering how this section better aligns with the core contributions of the paper.

- In Table 3, the numbers in the "Sparsity" column should be subtracted by 100.

- It would enhance the clarity of Figure 3 to employ a log-scale x-axis, which would allow for a more effective visualization of the sharp drop-off region.

### Questions
In the era of Large Language Models(LLM), how do the theoretical results align with LLM pruning results[3]?

### Summary
This paper delves into the fundamental limit of pruning ratios in deep networks by employing a high-dimensional geometry framework. By adopting this geometric perspective, the paper leverages  tools such as statistical dimension and the Approximate Kinematic Formula to precisely pinpoint the sharp phase transition point of network pruning. The authors bound the maximal portion of weights that can be removed in a network without negatively affecting its performance. They also improve the  spectrum estimation algorithm for very large Hessian matrices when computing the Gaussian width. This work provides some insights into the factors impacting pruning performance and validates findings through experiments. The experiments align well with theoretical results.

### Strengths
- The authors investigate the maximum achievable reduction in the number of parameters through network pruning without sacrificing performance, using the perspective of high-dimensional geometry. They study an interesting question and the methodology is inspiring.
- Extensive experiments conducted by the authors demonstrate alignment with their theoretical analyses.
- Their analysis also lends support to commonly observed phenomena, such as the effectiveness of iterative magnitude pruning and the use of regularization.

### Weaknesses
The paper is well structured but providing more intuitive descriptions could enhance the article's clarity and help readers follow its logic. Besides, it's not clear whether there are implicit assumptions in the analysis, such as whether it is limited to specific network architectures or loss functions.

The reviewer did not identify significant technical flaws. However, the reviewer is not familiar with the techniques employed in this paper, and the proofs in the supplementary materials have not been thoroughly verified.

### Summary
The paper proposed to directly enforce the sparsity constraint on the original loss function to find a s parse sub-network. It also introduced methods to find the pruning rate by using 'Network Pruning Approximate Kinematic' which is driven from Approximate Kinematics Formula in high-dimensional geometry.

### Strengths
1. It provides theoretical justification of the pruning rates, i.e. lower bound or upper bound of the pruning rates.
2. It utilizes several tools for improving the computational efficiency when handling the Hessian matrix like employing Hessian matrix sampling.
3. Experimental results on several tasks and settings are provided.

### Weaknesses
1. In Eq.3, the proposed method uses task loss + $L_1$ regularization as the pruning objective. In Eq.13 of section 3.3, the authors considered a well-trained deep neural network with weights $w^*$. The setting in Eq.13 seems not related to the pruning objective considered in Eq.3. If this is the case, then the theoretical justification of the pruning rates is only for a deep neural network trained normally instead of trained under the pruning objective given in Eq.3.

2. Following the first point, the pruning objective provided in Eq.3 introduces a hyperparameter $\lambda$, which controls the regularization strength, and thus the sparsity of the model. A very straightforward way to determine the pruning rate under this setting is to count number of zeros in the original weight matrix, which will be much more efficient than using Hessian matrix to calculate the theoretical pruning rate. I understand that the theoretical pruning rate may also make values with small magnitude to be pruned, however, you can achieve the similar results by simply increasing $\lambda$ in Eq.3. If you think $L_1$ regularization cannot accurately control the pruning rate, then $L_0$ regularization [1] can achieve this, which is also differentiable.  As a result, I doubt the practical usage of the proposed method.

3. Since the theoretical analysis did not include $\lambda$ in Eq.3, it brings some additional problems. For example, modern deep neural network training could be very expensive, assume we trained a model, and we calculate the theoretical pruning rate. But this pruning rate does not meet our expectation, then the only thing we can do is to adjust the $\lambda$ and retrain the model. We never know the theoretical pruning rate before the model is fully trained. As a result, the theoretical pruning rate does not give a better guidance when we want to train a model given an expected pruning rate. 

4. The pruning method itself is not novel, it is simply $L_1$ regularized training + magnitude pruning.

### Questions
1. Can the proposed method be used for dense models to predict its pruning rates? If it can be used, could you provide some results?
2. Do you try your methods on large-scale datasets like ImageNet? Does the computation of the Hessian Matrix become a bottleneck for large-scale datasets?
3. This is an open question just for discussion. Is it possible for your current theoretical framework to incorporate $\lambda$ to predict the final theoretical pruning rate? Is it possible for your current framework to use the theoretical pruning rate of an early trained model to predict the pruning rate of the fully trained model?

### Summary
This paper proposes the question that how sparse can we prune the neural network without sacrifice the performance and attempt to use Approximate Kinematics Formula and statistical dimension to find the limit of pruning. In detail, the authors attempt to find the lower and upper bound of the limit sparsity and use both theoretical and experimental results to illustrate that the lower and upper bound are close. In addition, the influence of the loss function and the magnitude of weights are discussed based on the principle proposed by the authors. Many phenomena accompanied with existing pruning such as magnitude pruning is better than random pruning and iterative pruning is better than one shot pruning are also explained with the proposed principle.

### Strengths
The perspective of this paper is very interesting and helpful. Firstly the authors alter the original theorem from[1] to show that the dimension of the loss sub level set and the sparse level should fill the whole space to ensure a pruning without sacrificing the performance. It is in accordance with intuition. Then the estimation of the sub level set is transformed into the form of quadratic form of the hessian matrix which is then approximated by the term including the eigen value. In this way the authors transform the original problem into the study of eigen value of the hessian matrix. It makes the problem much clear. 
The limit derived by induction is also verified by extensive experiments.  
In addition, the authors also use several concept plots to illustrate their key idea.

### Weaknesses
For Table 3, I am confused by the margin of improvement. Could the author give a detailed illustration of your GOP. From my point of view, you use the magnitude pruning and the magnitude is determined by l1 norm. In addition you prune the network globally. However, for pruning using magnitude, using l1 or l2 norm will not alter the rank of these weights which means the remaining weights after pruning is the same. Then why your GOP can improve significantly against LTH. In addition, could the authors further validate the theory on large scale dataset such ImageNet or Place365?

For LTH, the key point is to keep the same initialization when doing  training. Could the theory provide an explanation for this phenomenon?

For the upper bound and lower bound part, the lower bound means the pruning limit of the network. However, I am confused by the upper bound here. It seems that the authors mean to illustrate firstly the limit we can not find a sparser one without sacrificing the performance, then for some sparsity we can find one sparse network satisfy the requirement. I am not sure whether call it upper bound is suitable. 

For the part of Approximate Kinematics Formula from [1], a concrete introduction could be given in the paper for better understanding, for this part is the key component of this paper.
