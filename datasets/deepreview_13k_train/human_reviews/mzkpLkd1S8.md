- Decision: Reject
- Scores: 5, 5, 8, 3

## Abstract
Enhancing the robustness of deep learning models, particularly in the realm of vision transformers (ViTs), is crucial for their real-world deployment. In this work, we explore the robustness of vision transformer models through the lens of nullspace, a fundamental concept in linear algebra, to propose a fine-tuning method that improves model robustness under various input perturbations. Our investigation centers on whether a vision transformer can exhibit resilience to input variations akin to the nullspace property in linear mappings, implying that perturbations sampled from this nullspace do not influence the model's output when added to the input. We confirm this by demonstrating the existence of a non-trivial nullspace in vision transformers, primarily attributed to the patch embedding layer. Moreover, we extend this idea beyond the linear layers, showcasing the feasibility of learning a non-linear counterpart (approximate nullspace) to the traditional nullspace for vision transformers through optimization techniques. Based on these insights, we propose a fine-tuning approach employing approximate nullspace noise to bolster the robustness of ViT models. Remarkably, within just a single epoch of fine-tuning, our method effectively mitigates the adverse effects of distribution shifts and adversarial perturbations across a wide spectrum of scenarios.

### Summary
This paper propose to investigate adverial robustness of vision transformer by analyzing nullspace. Nullspace is found by optimization and further leveraged as data augmentation for training. The method is validated on various dataset  under both white and black box attacks.

### Strengths
1. The idea of using nullspace is quite interesting.
2. The paper is clearly organized and well written.
3. The derivation of existence of encoder-level nullspace is nice.

### Weaknesses
1. Why using nullspace as augmentation method could boost adversarial robustnes is unclear. As paper said, "We hypothesize that the model’s tolerance to approximate nullspace noise is indicative of its robustness under a variety of distribution shifts."  It's quite confusing, as the method is trying to find vectors that does not change model output, then regularize model to show no output change when adding such vector to input. Meanwhile, adversarial training finds perturbs that changes ouput most significantly and optmize the model to tolerate such perturb. The idea is somhow opppsite. Please justify why your method could work.
2. The approach could direclty applied on CNNs, though it is derived on ViT. Please check the performance on CNNs.
3. The experiments are weak. For white-box robustness, please use Auto-attack, CW attack, etc to evaluate. For black-box attack, please evaluate transferability from other models, using more well-known approaches such as MIM series attacks.

### Summary
The paper connects the concept of nullspace with the robustness of vision transformers. In this paper the authors aims to identify the approximate nullspace for the ViTs at encoder level and then further proposes a fine-tuning method in which the ViTs would be trained with the synthetic patch embedding by adding the original patch embedding with the noise sampled from the nullspace. The experimental results show that ViTs trained by the proposed method can experience the better performance under adversarial attacks and distribution shift.

### Strengths
1. The papaer is well organized and written. The idea is easy to follow.

2. The idea that addresses the adversarial robustness of ViTs from perspective of nullspace is novel and interesting.

3. The paper provides sound theoretical foundation for the proposed method.

4. The proposed method achieves good performance under adversarial attacks and distribution shift.

### Weaknesses
1.For adversarial attacks, the authors only adopt FGSM and DamageNet. However, FGSM is a light-weight adversarial attack. Stronger attacks like PGD should also be considered. The performance of the model under stronger adversarial attack is a better measurement of the robustness of the model.

2.The baseline methods listed in the paper are insufficient. The author should also incoporate some other important baselines[1-5].

3.The paper claims that the proposed method can significantly improve robustness against adversarial and out-of-distribution scenarios. Though the improvement on distribution shift is prominent, the performance under the adversarial attack is not promising.

### Questions
1.The proposed method seems independent on the model architecture. Would CNNs also experience improved robustness for the proposed method?

2.The patch-level attack [1.2] proves to be effective in attacking the ViT models. Is the proposed method also effective in defending these attacks?

2: You are willing to defend your assessment, but it is quite likely that you did not understand the central parts of the submission or that you are unfamiliar with some pieces of related work. Math/other details were not carefully checked.

### Summary
The paper presents a novel concept of "nullspace" in the context of Vision Transformers (ViTs) and explores its potential applications in improving ViT robustness. The paper shows that ViTs possess a non-trivial nullspace and demonstrates how learning "nullspace noise" can enhance robustness. Experimental results indicate that fine-tuning ViTs with learned nullspace noise leads to significant improvements in robustness against various benchmarks.

### Strengths
- The paper introduces an innovative concept, "nullspace," in ViTs, expanding our understanding of these models.
- The methodology used to identify nullspace and the experiments conducted to demonstrate its impact are comprehensive.
- The paper highlights the practical applications of nullspace, such as model patenting and image watermarking.

### Weaknesses
 - The paper's discussion on societal impact and practical applications could benefit from further elaboration and real-world examples to strengthen the argument.
- While the nullspace concept is intriguing, the limitations of its applicability due to non-linearity in ViTs should be addressed more explicitly.

### Questions
- Can the authors provide specific real-world examples and use cases where the concept of nullspace and nullspace noise can be applied in practice?
- The paper mentions the non-linearity in ViTs as a limitation to the exact calculation of nullspace. Could the authors discuss potential methods or approaches to address this limitation or provide more insights into the nature of this non-linearity?

### Confidence
3: You are fairly confident in your assessment. It is possible that you did not understand some parts of the submission or that you are unfamiliar with some pieces of related work. Math/other details were not carefully checked.

### Summary
In this paper, the authors show that transformers are invariant to certain input perturbation. This property, which they attribute to the nullspace property of the patch embedding layer, allows the authors to improve the robustness of vision transformers to adversarial input. In particular, the authors show that the output of the vision transformer may remain unchanged even under perturbations with large norms.

### Strengths
- The proposed approach is quite original. In particular, studying the nullspace of the patch embedding layer is novel and interesting.

### Weaknesses
 - The mathematical contributions are minor and the paper contains some approximations (e.g., "closeness" instead of "closedness", last sentence of A1...). 
- Despite being locally well written (i.e. taking sentences out of context, they are nicely written), the overall writing is confusing. It is difficult to keep what the authors are aiming to do in sight. For instance, Section 3 is cahotic and unfinished.
- As a consequence, it is difficult to evaluate the experimental contributions of this work.
- Some sentences convey an inapropriate tone, either overconfident or unscientific ("we offer a fresh narrative on...", "finding its nullspace is known art", "This observation leads to a provocative question", "Our work marks an important stride in the understanding of ...").

### Questions
I acknowledge the effort of the authors in this work, but I am afraid it suffers from serious drawbacks making it unpublishable in its current form.

**Major comments**
1. As underlined by the authors, the nullspace is a concept from linear algebra. When moving to the nonlinear world, its counterpart is the zero set. This is a common tool in convex optimization [1] which the authors may want to investigate. It seems however that rather than looking for a set of zeros, the authors are more interested in looking for invariance of the ViT wrt some additive subspaces (this is equation (5)). It may be interesting to change a bit the narrative to motivate it by invariant properties instead of null space properties?
2. Similarly, the authors state in the conclusion that "Our findings demonstrate that a non-trivial nullspace indeed exists" but I am not sure that the paper shows that. The authors show that a nullspace exists for the patch embedding layer, but then the full study resolves more around invariance properties of the ViT than its nullspace.
3. The authors write: "We ascertain that employing noise sampled from this approximate nullspace for data augmentation significantly enhances model robustness ...". This formulation suggests that the training of the ViT performance can improve when trained on data from its nullspace; however if the data shown to the network belong to its nullspace, how can it have an influence on its output?
4. I have an issue with loss (6). Unless I misunderstood, it is not lower bounded because no constraint is added. Thus, the minimum of (6) is reached by any vector of infinite norm. Why not add any constraint in the norm of $\tilde{v}$? I suspect this is why early stopping is needed (page 18)?
5. More generally, I find it interesting to look for vectors of relatively large norms, showing that very different inputs can provide the same output. However, a problem is that the resulting vector $u+\tilde{v}$, where $u$ is a natural image, is not a natural image. What are the potential applications in this context? Is it better for a model to be robust to nullspace variations than to common adversarial attacks?
6. Section 3 is very clearly unfinished, with unrelated sentences and equations. What is the narrative from (7) to (10)?
7. In section 3, the authors state that "we demonstrated that there may exist a non-isotropic space". Was it really shown that it is non isotropic?
8. Section 4.4 is very difficult to follow. What is the aim of the experiment presented there? For instance, the authors claim "the noise was always able to enter the $\epsilon$ region". But how can we be sure? Does any metric check that? This is not what Fig. 3 is showing, or I misunderstand?
9. The writing style is often inapropriate. I would suggest the authors adopt a more neutral tone. Here are few examples and why I think these are not appropriate:
     - "Our work marks an important stride in the understanding of [something]..." : this sounds presomptuous, readers will judge if this is "an important stride". Instead, the authors could say "Our work provides an explanation of [something] by ...". Similarly, "we offer a fresh narrative" sounds weird.
     - "This observation leads to a provocative question: Can the inherent properties of ViTs be harnessed to bolster their robustness?" First of all, I think the question is not provocative at all, it is typically the kind of questions that are asked in this conference. Secondly, the question could be reformulated in a less theatrical way. For instance: "This observation raises the following question: Can we leverage the inherent properties of ViTs to enhance their robustness?"

**Minor comments**

1. Some notations are unclear. For example, $f(u)[0]$ mixes mathematical and informatics notations. Why not use $f_0(u)$? 
2. "This implies that 0 is always a solution to the said equation. As the number of solutions to a system of linear equations can vary, the nullspace for a mapping can be trivial, non-trivial, or does not exist." You just showed above that a trivial nullspace always exists for a linear mapping. How can the nullspace not exist?
3. "In terms of solving for $\mathcal{N}$?": why this question? I think that the footnote does not need to be introduced by a question.
4. For the remark after Proposition 1: there is no need to explain the proposition in the remark. I would suggest to only keep the informative example, and detail more on this example. Is this a condition that is met experimentally? Is this realistic?
5. Maybe the authors could change the NeurIPS watermark to an ICLR watermark?
