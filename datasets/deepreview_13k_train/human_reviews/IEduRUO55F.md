- Decision: Accept
- Scores: 6, 6, 5, 8

## Abstract
Large Language Models (LLMs) have excelled as high-level semantic planners for sequential decision-making tasks. However, harnessing them to learn complex low-level manipulation tasks, such as dexterous pen spinning, remains an open problem. We bridge this fundamental gap and present \ourmethod, a human-level reward design algorithm powered by LLMs. \ourmethod exploits the remarkable zero-shot generation, code-writing, and in-context improvement capabilities of state-of-the-art LLMs, such as GPT-4, to perform evolutionary optimization over reward code. The resulting rewards can then be used to acquire complex skills via reinforcement learning. Without any task-specific prompting or pre-defined reward templates, \ourmethod generates reward functions that outperform expert human-engineered rewards. In a diverse suite of 29 open-source RL environments that include 10 distinct robot morphologies, \ourmethod outperforms human experts on \textbf{83\%} of the tasks, leading to an average normalized improvement of \textbf{52\%}. The generality of \ourmethod also enables a new gradient-free in-context learning approach to reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), readily incorporating human inputs to improve the quality and the safety of the generated rewards without model updating. Finally, using \ourmethod rewards in a curriculum learning setting, we demonstrate for the first time, a simulated Shadow Hand capable of performing pen spinning tricks, adeptly manipulating a pen in circles at rapid speed.

### Summary
The paper presents a novel approach to leverage LLMs to plan/control complex low-level manipulation tasks in the form of an LLM-powered reward function generator. Its generation algorithm performs iterative improvements over an initially designed reward function without task-specific prompting nor a few short examples, by automatically calculating the fine-grained fitness of a policy in text over a sequence of executions on a target RL environment and using the LLM to improve the code. The presented approach is evaluated in varied RL environments and experimental results show it outperforms RL-expert humans on the majority of tasks. Moreover, the authors provide a case study of how the proposed approach enables higher complexity tasks where manual reward policy design is challenging.

### Strengths
The submitted manuscript is very well written and presents a novel and interesting approach to automatically generate reward functions for simulated RL environments, which seemingly could be applied to different scenarios.

It presents a clever approach to leveraging recent LLMs' zero-shot code generation ability to both understand a simulation environment and to iteratively improve generated reward functions that would be hard to manually author and tune.

Moreover, the described evolutionary search and reward relection components or the approach, while not groundbreaking, provide interesting insights into the problem and on better interacting with LLMs for code generation.

### Weaknesses
One of the main weaknesses of the submitted paper is the lack of a Limitations section/discussion, or such discussion throughout the text. While the authors claim the generality of Eureka, the proposed approach has only been evaluated on a single base simulator (Isaac Gym) and with a fixed RL algorithm. In other words, the claim seems to be overstated. 

Another weakness is the experiment part, while the submitted text showcases different (and relevant) comparisons with human results, the human rewards are zero-shot and not tuned for many RL trials to further improve the performance. Therefore, I believe the comparison may be unfair. If you tune the human rewards in this baseline (e.g. search the weights for different reward terms) and train RL for many trials (same as the cost of the evolutionary search in Eureka ), some claims may not hold.

A specific discussion I missed was about how the proposed approach handles the difference between optimizing for the internals of the simulation vs its sensing/acting interface. The former should be avoided in any general approach. The authors claim to use an "automatic script to extract just the observation portion of the environment source code", but this doesn't necessarily guarantee no leaks or that such observation code abstraction level leaks details.

Moreover, as the proposed approach depends on feeding the environment code to the LLM, besides just claiming the "the observation portion of the environment", I believe a more in-depth discussion is needed on how Eureka could be adapted to a) more complex environments, which may be too large for the model context windows; and b) scenarios of interaction with the real world (actual robot control).

Particularly for a), this is a critically important discussion. E.g., What would be the impact on the pen spinning demo with more detailed material characteristics and physics (friction, inertia, actuator latencies, etc.)?

The authors also claim only a "handful" of LLM output is enough. However, 16 is hardly a handful (<5). Intuitively the number of samples to obtain one fully executable policy will grow in proportion to simulator and environment complexity. However, again there is no discussion of such limitations of the approach.

### Questions
In view of the claim of generality, how to qualify/quantify the impact of different simulation platforms (and level of physics detail) or RL algorithms? Please also comment on the scenario of interfacing with the real world.

### Summary
The main idea of the paper is to have a LLM provide the reward function for RL problems.
To achieve this, the LLM gets to see the code of the environment along with the plain text description of the task. The task for the LLM is to provide sample code for reward functions, which are in turn improved using an evolutionary search. The experiments section of the paper goes through a number of environments, where performance is shown to be better than performance using human-designed reward functions. For the examples provided, Eureka does not use task-specific prompts.

### Strengths
I love the idea of using an LLM to provide initial versions of the reward functions, and to then improve it using evolutionary search. Moreover, the evaluation shows that the approach can deal with challenging environments, leading to good solutions or solutions for problems that have not been solved before. The work is also well motivated, and potentially lead to interesting advances in RL itself; it would be quite interesting to see this published and available for further research.

The work already contains inputs/outputs of the approach in the appendix, and code and prompts are expected to be released.

### Weaknesses
While the paper does do a great job in selling the idea, there's a frustrating lack of technical detail in the main part of the paper. One example to illustrate this problem: The subsection on evolutionary search provides no detail on what is the exact input, outputs, or about the specific method being used. This is one core aspect of the proposed approach, and would require more details to be understandable. I understand some parts of this appear in the appendix or will be clear from code release, but the main part should make the core parts of the approach more clear.

In the Eureka algorithm description, it is a bit unclear to me what the reward reflection part does; for example the algorithm specifies the reward functions and their evaluations are provided as inputs, but the text also talks about the choices of RL method that are important for this part. There's only little information in the text that tells me how it works.

Similarly, I like the idea of "environment as context", but it would be good to know what is considered here as environment (what does it mean), for example to what level of detail does the environment need to be described / down to what level do you have to go. The appendix describes that, due to limited context length, the only the observation context will be used, but for simulators different from Isaac, what information do you expect you need to provide for this to work.

This could be connected with a missing discussion of limitations of the approach, for example do you expect this approach to be useful when you do not have full access to the code of the environment but maybe just some API, or if the environment is the real world.

Maybe more philosophically but I am also not quite sure about the classification of the generation as "zero-shot" as it is unclear what the LLM has actually seen during training, and it would be interesting to see further investigations of this (not necessarily in this work) and capabilities of transferring domain knowledge - the release of benchmarks after the cut-off doesn't necessarily mean there was no environment like this before.

Most of the above weaknesses impact the presentation of the work; while formal presentation of the work is good overall, Figure 2 and Figure 3 could be improved for contrast and font sizes.

### Questions
My main questions are around limitations as mentioned above, and the types of problems this is expected to work well for (and where do you see this not working). 
To what extent the approach makes use of information available at training time (eg about the simulator or environments). More directly about the approach I would find it interesting to hear about approximate run times from beginning to end, for some of the examples.

### Summary
The paper introduces EUREKA, an LLM-powered method for reward design for reinforcement learning tasks. The proposed method utilizes the zero-shot generation and in-context improvement of LLM, enabling evolutionary optimization over reward code without task-specific prompting or pre-defined reward templates. The paper showcases EUREKA's performance against human-engineered rewards in a diverse range of robot tasks. Furthermore, the algorithm is able to integrate with human feedback for further reward improvement, enhancing the quality and safety of generated rewards without the need for model updating.

### Strengths
While the idea of this paper is rather simple, it yields a surprisingly good performance, which reflects a well-structured system. Being able to bring an easy idea to such a complete and well-considered system is commendable.

Moreover, this work brings insight to the reward design community by removing the dependency on collecting expert demonstration data. The study suggests that Large Language Models (LLMs) can serve as an cheap alternative to human expert demonstrations for acquiring domain-specific task knowledge.

The paper's presentation is clear; the authors make the content easily comprehensible. Their responsible practice of providing all relevant prompts and code offers an added advantage.

### Weaknesses
1. Unrealistic assumption of access to the environment source codes:

The reward code generation in this paper critically depends on having access to the source code of the MDP specification as context for the initial reward proposal. The authors have presented this as a benefit, allowing the LLM to exploit code structure to understand task environments. However, it makes an unrealistic assumption, as most reinforcement learning setups only require access to a black-box simulation. Specifically, the method requires access to the environment's state and action variables in code form, which is not a standard assumption in many RL scenarios, especially those involving real-world systems or complex simulators where only a compiled interface is available. This limits the applicability of the approach to environments where the full source code is accessible and modifiable, which is not always the case.

A significant limitation of this approach is that it may be infeasible for real-world robotic tasks where the transition function may either be unavailable or in different analytical forms. Given the heavy dependence on source code for task environment understanding, this method could be essentially restricted to simulated RL environments only.

2. Strong assumption on the fitness function F(.)

Another weak point is the strong assumption on the fitness function F(.). The evolutionary search for the LLM generated reward function requires a fitness function capable of assessing the quality of each proposed reward function. In this work, the fitness function F(.) is implicitly assumed to have access to the ground truth reward function to evaluate the induced policies of the proposed reward functions. This is a significant limitation because it requires a pre-existing notion of task success, which is often the very thing that reward design aims to define. This limitation implies that the method is applicable only to tasks that come with known ground-truth reward functions, which are often sparse and may not fully capture the desired behavior. This weakens the method's practical applicability, restricting it mainly to idealized or known environments, hindering its usefulness for real-world, less predictable reinforcement learning tasks.

### Questions
While the pen spinning demonstration is impressive, it remains uncertain what is driving the task's success. Is it due to an effective reward design, which is the paper's main focus, or is it a byproduct of unspecified engineering efforts? Section 4.3 is not very clear and leaves room for several pertinent questions:

1. The paper does not detail how the pre-trained policy was obtained. The statement, "Specifically, we first instruct EUREKA to generate a reward for ... Then, using this pre-trained policy," leaves the readers wondering what exactly "this" references to. 

The application of curriculum learning here appears to break the policy training into two main stages - an initial 'pre-training' stage and a 'fine-tuning' stage with the pre-trained policy. If this interpretation is accurate, clarity around the following is crucial:

2. Is the training process – both pre-training and fine-tuning stages – guided by the reward functions derived using the LLM-powered reward design method proposed in this paper? Are these reward functions identical?

 -  If they are, there needs to be a detailed explanation of the distinctiveness of 'pre-training' and 'fine-tuning' when it comes to the optimization of policies under the same reward function. The reason how a dual-stage policy optimization can notably enhance policy performance remains under-explained. Additionally, if this is the case, it appears that the success of the task may be due to the dual-stage policy optimization rather than the reward design, casting doubts about the central argument of the paper.

 -  If they're not, clarity is needed on how these varying reward functions are generated, and what differences exist between them. Furthermore, how does this dual-stage reward function model vary from the primary algorithm proposed? How to ascertain the number of reward functions sufficient for a given task?

### Summary
This paper purpose a novel pipeline to harness the LLM to design reward for using reinforcement learning to do diverse tasks without any task-specific template. The pipeline use environment code and reward feedback as input to LLM, and let LLM to continously update the reward function. The comprehensive experiments demonstrate the generalization ability of the LLM for reward design and the effectiveness of the reward designed by LLM(comparable to human).

### Strengths
1. This paper purpose a general pipline for reward designing of RL, which is indeed a long standing problem for RL researches, this kind of pipeline may save a lot of time for human to shape the reward.
2. The pipeline requires no task-specifiction template for LLM, which shows a great generalization to different tasks.
3. This paper demonstrate the LLM with evolutionary is a effective approach for using LLM, has potential for other area.

### Weaknesses
Time cost and compute resource cost: Since each iteration, LLM will sample tens of reward sample, and we need to test all this reward function and get feedback, we need to simultanously run multiple experiments for each reward sample, it seems there will be a lot compute resource needed? And for each sampled reward, how many environments do you create to train? How do you decide when to terminate each running expertiment? Will it be possible that because the environment not create enough or did not train for a long time than miss a effective reward sample? What will be the total time of finding a good reward based on what kind of device?

1. Can this method used for task that object is diverse?
2. If the task require image as input, it hard to run many environments simutenously, can this method still work?
3. Will only give success reward as inital reward, can make the LLM to find more optimal reward?
