- Decision: Reject
- Scores: 5, 6, 5, 3

## Abstract
Training a machine learning model with data following a meaningful order, i.e., from easy to hard, has been proven to be effective in accelerating the training process and achieving better model performance. The key enabling technique is curriculum learning (CL), which has seen great success and has been deployed in areas like image and text classification. Yet, how CL affects the privacy of machine learning is unclear. Given that CL changes the way a model memorizes the training data, its influence on data privacy needs to be thoroughly evaluated. To fill this knowledge gap, we perform the first study and leverage membership inference attack (MIA) and attribute inference attack (AIA) as two vectors to quantify the privacy leakage caused by CL.

Our evaluation of 9 real-world datasets with attack methods (NN-based, metric-based, label-only MIA, and NN-based AIA) revealed new insights about CL. First, MIA becomes slightly more effective when CL is applied, but the impact is much more prominent to a subset of training samples ranked as difficult. 
Second, a model trained under CL is less vulnerable under AIA, compared to MIA.
Third, the existing defense techniques like \dpsgd{}, \memguard{} and \mixupMMD{} are still effective under CL, though \dpsgd{} has a significant impact on target model accuracy. 
Finally, based on our insights into CL, we propose a new MIA, termed \attack{}, which exploits the difficulty scores for result calibration and is demonstrated to be effective against all CL methods and the normal training method. With this study, we hope to draw the community's attention to the unintended privacy risks of emerging machine-learning techniques and develop new attack benchmarks and defense solutions.

### Confidence
4: You are confident in your assessment, but not absolutely certain. It is unlikely, but not impossible, that you did not understand some parts of the submission or that you are unfamiliar with some pieces of related work.

### Summary
The paper studies the privacy leakage of CL through a comprehensive evaluation of CL using different membership inference attack and attribute inference attacks using nine benchmarks.

### Strengths
1. The paper are well written and the problem is well-motivated.
2. The experiment are comprehensive and some empirical findings are insightful (e.g., CL cause disparate impact to members and non-members is useful)

### Weaknesses
1. The paper misses an important SOTA NN-based MIA attack LiRA (from the paper “Membership Inference Attacks From First Principles” in IEEE S&P 2022), making the evaluation of NN-based less convincing. The absence of LiRA, which leverages multiple shadow models, is a significant gap in the evaluation. The paper should acknowledge that the current NN-based attacks may not fully capture the vulnerability landscape, especially when compared to more sophisticated approaches like LiRA. The use of a single shadow model for the NN-based attacks may underestimate the true risk of membership inference. 
2. Difficulty Calibrated MIA is an incremental improvement over Watson et al. 2022 via adaptatively changing $\theta$ based on the difficulty level. The core mechanism of adaptively adjusting the threshold $\theta$ based on the difficulty of samples, while effective, is not a fundamentally novel approach. The paper could be strengthened by exploring more substantial modifications or combining this calibration with other attack strategies to demonstrate a more significant advancement. 
3. The author does not justify the threat model clearly. For example, the Difficulty Calibrated MIA implicitly assumes the target model training is using CL. However, such type of information is not usually available to the attack. In this case, the author might also want to evaluate the proposed attack under a non-CL setting and compare its performance with other MIA attacks. The assumption that the attacker knows the target model is trained with curriculum learning is unrealistic. A more robust evaluation would include scenarios where the attacker is unaware of the training methodology, thus testing the attack's effectiveness in more general situations.

### Questions
1. In the defense part, it is natural to extend the idea of allocating privacy budget accordingly based on the difficulty level of the training examples. Have you tried this in the defense evaluation?

### Summary
This paper explores the privacy risks associated with Curriculum Learning (CL). The paper examines Membership Inference Attacks (MIAs) and Attribute Inference Attacks (AIAs). Under the CL setting, the paper reveals a slight increase in vulnerability to MIA, a vulnerability not observed with AIA. This paper also proposes a new MIA method, termed Diff-Cali, by investigating the attack performance of MIA on varying samples. The paper also evaluates several defense mechanisms for their efficacy in mitigating these risks.

### Strengths
1. This paper is the first work to study the privacy risks introduced by CL and does a comprehensive comparison of different settings including different attack types, target models, and datasets.
2. This paper also studies the performance of different defense methods to reduce the success rate of privacy attacks under curriculum learning.

### Weaknesses
1. This paper limits the datasets to image and tabular datasets. It will be interesting to study other data types like text and graphs, to make this study more comprehensive. Specifically, the lack of experiments on sequential data, such as text or time series data, limits the generalizability of the findings. The privacy risks in these domains might manifest differently due to the inherent structure and dependencies within the data.
2. While the paper evaluates various defense methods, it does not have a deeper investigation into why certain defenses underperform and how they could be potentially improved. For instance, it would be valuable to analyze the specific characteristics of the model or data that make some defenses less effective. A more granular analysis of failure cases for each defense mechanism is needed to provide actionable insights.

### Questions
1. Could the proposed Diff-Cali method be combined with existing defense mechanisms to create a more robust defense against privacy attacks in Curriculum Learning?
2. How would the introduction of federated learning or decentralized training scenarios affect the privacy risks and defense mechanisms evaluated in this study?

4: You are confident in your assessment, but not absolutely certain. It is unlikely, but not impossible, that you did not understand some parts of the submission or that you are unfamiliar with some pieces of related work.

### Summary
This paper empirically study the privacy risks introduced by CL, by launching a series of privacy attacks in the forms of MIA and AIA, and privacy defenses. The authors also invented a new MIA method.

### Strengths
The paper is easy-to-read and comprehensive from an empirical point of view. It tackles an important topic with some convincing results. I specifically like the discussion of model forgetting below Figure 2 (more discussion on this please).

### Weaknesses
This paper leverages existing CL, MIA/AIA methods and defenses, thus falling short on the novelty. This choice of tools also make the results less exciting. While some novelty is indeed introduced by the new MIA method, its performance is similar to NN-based MIA (I quote "...Diff-Cali achieves slightly lower (less than 1.44%) accuracy compared to NN-based attack"), i.e. the difference is not significant even if the difficult samples are made more vulnerable.

Minor: Table 1 & 2 inconsistent values on CIFAR100.
Figure 6 is not a Figure at all.

### Summary
This paper studies the privacy risks in curriculum learning (CL). The authors perform membership inference attacks and attribute inference attacks against four curricula designs and normal training on 9 datasets. They draw several conclusions on the privacy risks induced by CL as well as the disproportional vulnerability of different samples. A new MIA is proposed based on calibrating the difficulty scores.

### Strengths
- Comprehensive and thorough evaluation of privacy risks in a concrete learning setting
- The proposed MIA seems promising

### Weaknesses
My general complaint is that this paper feels too much of a technical report rather than a research paper that I would expect to see at a top ML conference. I will elaborate:

- **The motivation is not well-established**. The authors mentioned "it’s crucial to investigate how training techniques affect privacy" -- I generally agree with this point, but this is not sufficient to convince me that studying the privacy risk in curriculum learning is important. 1) From a practical perspective, curriculum learning is a relatively niche subject, and is very different from self-supervised learning or unsupervised learning which have attracted extensive interest in the ML community. I'm not aware of any of its real-world applications and am not sure whether privacy is indeed a valid issue within. 2) From a research perspective, the author briefly mentioned "data ordering could have negative impacts on privacy" -- this is a valid hypothesis, and could be a good starting point to perform some thought experiments to obtain a more fine-grained argument (e.g., what kind of data ordering, what is the connection to curriculum learning, what data points will be affected the most). Directly jumping to large-scale evaluations based on an unmature hypothesis seems too hasty to me. 

- **The structure is weird**. 1) Sec 3 (dataset and model) should be placed right before Sec 5 (the evaluations results), and I feel a paragraph (rather than a section) should be sufficient; 2) the proposed MIA (Diff-Cali) is mixed with other background knowledge on MIAs and AIAs in Sec 4, which is super strange; 3) there are no defense results in the main text yet the defense strategies are mentioned in the abstract, intro and conclusion. Overall this leaves me a strong feeling that the paper contains too many contents and is not well-compiled for reading. 

- **Many technical details are missing**. The authors put too many technical details to the appendix, for instance, the MIAs, the defense strategies, and TPR at low FPR. Even the details of curriculum learning is not clearly explained. This will significantly hinder understanding even for people working on the intersection of ML and privacy. Combined with the previous point, I think this paper is more suited for a security conference. 

- **The analyses are not sufficiently in-depth**.  Most of the conclusions can be directly drawn from the experimental results, and there are few insights or discussions beyond. For instance, I did not learn much from the AIA experiments beyond knowing that the attack success rate does not increase, and the hypothesis "sensitive attribute to be inferred is not influenced by data ordering and repeating" is not backed up by any further evidence. In a few places where the authors tried to offer more principled analysis, I observed a few reasoning gaps. For instance, the authors attempted to use memorization to explain the impact of curricula. However, there is a significant gap between the experimental setting in Sec 5.2 and the actual curriculum learning. More specifically, for curriculum learning as described in algorithm 1, hard samples appear later than easy samples *only in a single epoch*; they do appear in every epochs (and particularly, early epochs) of training.

### Questions
- In algorithm 1, it seems that for later iterations in a given epoch (i.e., large $i$), $X_i'$ will still contain easy samples. This suggest that easy samples will still appear in later iterations of training (since $B_i$ is sampled from $X_i'$), meaning that they will have high occurrence compared to hard samples. 1) I'm not familiar with curriculum learning, but I feel a more natural way is to segment the ordered samples (based on difficulty scores) into *disjoint* batches, and then progressively train on them in a single epoch; 2) If you indeed used algorithm 1, then the number of occurrence will be another factor (other than difficulty) that will impact the vulnerability of each sample, and this is not taken into account when designing experiments or drawing conclusions.  

- In Fig 1a and 2a, the harder samples actually have lower attack accuracy and confidence scores (for all curricula and normal training). This is very counter-intuitive and not explained. Particularly, I don't buy the results that harder samples will have low attack success rate for normal training. This makes me doubt that the difficult scores used in this paper is problematic. Also, I think it is misleading to claim that "harder samples are more vulnerable". Instead, what you can actually infer from the results is that "CL will introduce stronger effects to harder samples compared to normal training" (i.e., the *gap* is large).
