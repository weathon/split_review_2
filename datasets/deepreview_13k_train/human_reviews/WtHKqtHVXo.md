# Generating Robot Policy Code for High-Precision and Contact-Rich Manipulation Tasks

- Decision: Reject
- Scores: 1, 5, 5, 5

## Abstract
Large Language Models (LLMs) have been successful at generating robot policy code, but so far these results have been limited to high-level tasks that do not require precise movement.
It is an open question how well such approaches work for tasks that require reasoning over contact forces and working within tight success tolerances.
We find that, with the right action space, LLMs are capable of successfully generating policies for a variety of contact-rich and high-precision  manipulation  tasks,  even under noisy conditions, such as perceptual errors or grasping inaccuracies.
Specifically, we reparameterize the action space to include compliance with constraints on the interaction forces and stiffnesses involved in reaching a target pose.
We validate this approach on subtasks derived from the Functional Manipulation Benchmark (FMB) and NIST Task Board Benchmarks.
Exposing this action space alongside methods for estimating object poses improves policy generation with an LLM by greater than 3x and 4x when compared to non-compliant action spaces.

### Rating Number

### Confidence
4: You are confident in your assessment, but not absolutely certain. It is unlikely, but not impossible, that you did not understand some parts of the submission or that you are unfamiliar with some pieces of related work.

### Summary
This paper presents a zero-shot way to perform contact-rich planning for robotic manipulation tasks using LLMs. Overall, I find the paper to be weak and not fit for publication at ICLR.

### Strengths
The paper attempts to look at an important problem which can simplify training of robots for a lot of contact-rich tasks.

### Weaknesses
The authors need to improve several things:
1. Overall, I feel that the authors fail to capture a principled approach to present the key elements for the contact-rich task. The authors propose to replace the search-based methods for contact-rich tasks by replacing the search with LLM by providing some rules to LLM for decision making. While this might replace the search-based methods, but the proposed method is not general enough to work.
2. Most of contact-rich manipulation tasks end up to be partially observable due to contact formations and unobservability of the contact states. This aspect of the problem can not be handled in the proposed method. This makes the proposed method a rather ad-hoc attempt at solving the problem than a principled way of incorporating LLM for decision making during contact-rich tasks.
3. From a presentation point of view, the authors need to clarify what their decision variables are which are exposed to the LLM. Having that specified will help with understanding about the reasoning performed by LLMs.
4. In the current presentation, the paper appears as a poor, ad-hoc attempt at incorporating LLM for contact-rich tasks.

### Questions
The following points are not clear to me:
1.  From a presentation point of view, the authors need to clarify what their decision variables are which are exposed to the LLM. Having that specified will help with understanding about the reasoning performed by LLMs.
2. Is the impedance the only parameter exposed to the LLM?
3. How is the LLM tuning the impedance parameter? Are you allowing LLM to interact with the current system? or its just done using a rule that LLM comes up with?

### Summary
This paper investigates whether the GPT-4 large language model (LLM) can generate scripted policies for contact-rich manipulation tasks. A robot motion API with compliant motions and stop conditions is available to the LLM. The LLM is also given a description of the API, a description of the task state, and optionally a few examples of API usage.

The paper first demonstrates the use of LLMs for floating point input/output with tokenization enforced by putting a space between each digit. Then it demonstrates the success rates of policies suggested by the LLM for insertion and cable unrouting on a real robot.

In general, the paper focuses on convincing the reader that LLMs _are_ capable of generating reasonable instructions for contact-rich tasks in mathematical / code format. It does _not_ focus on convincing that such policies are better than other alternatives like policies learnt by imitation learning, reinforcement learning, heuristic design, etc.

### Strengths
- Thoughtful design of the action space (conditional compliant moves) to enable successful completion of contact-rich manipulation tasks by policies generated by LLMs.
- Validation on a real robot setup.
- Clearly articulating the research question "demonstrate that LLMs, without any specialized training, have the ability to perform contact-rich tasks when given the appropriate action space", and conducting experiments to answer it.

### Weaknesses
 - The paper does not demonstrate LLM policies are better than other policies, because it does not compare against those baselines. In this context, the paper lacks discussion about _why_ LLM policies might be preferable.
  - Section 1 mentions "scaling". Does this refer to scaling in terms of the variety of tasks? Maybe the LLM provides zero-shot generalization abilities to many different tasks. In that case, the experimental validation presented here is quite weak, it only presents two kinds of tasks. Experiments for other contact-rich tasks from previous works, like inserting plates into dishwasher racks [1], loading bookshelves, opening door handles [4], screwing nuts on bolts [5], USB insertion [2], plug insertion [2] etc. would have helped demonstrate the unique scaling ability provided by LLMs.
  - If some other reasons make LLM policies more attractive, please discuss those reasons.
- The impact of hint inputs (Section 4.1(3)) is not experimentally validated. This is important, because from the text it seems like the hints provide strong policy guidance like "do a grid pattern search".
- Impact of noise in state description provided to the LLM (e.g. imperfectly sensed spatial pattern of the board in Fig. 3(d), or noisy robot starting pose) is not examined experimentally.
- Is the scripted policy for the insertion task unfairly weak compared to the LLM? It is tuned to the easiest object `circle` and expected to generalize to `star` and `half-pipe`. On the other hand, the LLM policy is provided with a hint about which object it is planning the policy for.

### Questions
- Please provide the policies generated by the expert scripter and the LLM for insertion task. This will allow readers to compare the LLM output to the human-designed scripted policy. And also allow the reader to know which hints were required by the LLM.
- Please clarify the evaluation protocol, because the language is unclear. Especially the last sentence of Section 5.2.3.
- Please explain how the potential generalization advantages of LLM policies are shown in the current experiments.

### Summary
Authors tackled contact-rich robotic control tasks by taking advantage of LLMs. As opposed to most previous efforts that operated on higher level abstraction, this paper focuses on lower-level control. Additionally, authors allowed the LLM to also generate constraints to enable closed-loop control. Empirical results on peg-in-the-whole and (un)route cable domains showed up to 20% and 70% success rate improvement compared to best baseline techniques respectively.

### Strengths
+ Simplicity: The approach is easy to adopt, as the main planning component is the readily available GPT4. The trick to enter decimal points through a sequence of space separated tokens was intriguing.
+ Empirical Results: the improvement in task success rate looks promising
+ Writing: the paper was easy to follow

### Weaknesses
 - Claims: the 3x and 4x improvement was a bit oversold. I recommend authors to focus on the improvement over the best alternative approach rather than the point to point.
- Novelty: The paper introduces limited novelty compared to the previous work. The main contribution is to allow LLMs to also generate constraints for their manipulation functions.
- Generalizability: given the few-shot learning example in the appendix, the prompt holds key sections for solving the task (e.g. move up unless snag is detected). It would have been great if authors included only examples not exactly needed to solve the task for the second domain. We see with no examples, LLM did not do great specially on the harder task of routing the cable.
- Lack of details: some key details of the experimentations were missing (see questions)

Minor comments:
the Transformers => Transformers

### Questions
- Figure 6 a,b: For each point generated by LLM, is the input true history, or is it based on previous points generated by LLM. My understanding if the former, but would be great to clear this out in the paper.
- "every command is an unseen command.", I think you meant unseen in the sense of not seeing examples of it but the command is defined as an input through the prompt and hence seen.
- "We also tune the following properties independently for each model". How did you optimize them?
- Figure 8: While the type of errors made by LLM changed as more hints were introduced the total number of errors seemed to remain constant. This means the hint type did not change the success rate of the agent. Is that true? If so, please make it explicit it in the paper.
- Can you provide details on the number of shots used for few-shot experiments?

### Summary
This paper is about using LLMs for contact rich manipulation tasks. Prior methods use LLMs to come up with a series of function calls in the position space. This paper rightfully uses impedance control for contact rich tasks. The actions are represented by a combination of target position and also the stiffness vector along each axis. In my opinion using admittance control is extremely important for this contact rich task. Without admittance control, none of the prompting matters. The prompt has a task description in plain English, list of functions along with their params, hints, spatial patterns (which I have not seen to be used in the example prompts), and some examples to show how to use particular functions specially the admittance control functions. In general, I think this paper is a step in the right direction but has its limitations.

### Strengths
- Contact rich manipulation is a very important area in robotics.
- Using LLM for contact rich task is an important area and I think this paper is the first to do it.
- The paper is well-written and easy to follow.
- I like the ablation studies that show the importance of impedance control, position control, and impedance control (fixed) which shows the importance of predicting the values for impedance control.

### Weaknesses
 - On one hand, the paper is very similar to code-as-policy and other variants. On the other hand, it is known that impedance control is crucial for contact-rich tasks.
- Even though the paper emphasizes on continuous aspect of the prediction, there is not much continuous quantities going on in the predicted codes. The values of floats in the generated code does not have much variation. The paper gives the impression that it can predict full range of continuous values but in the examples the continuous values can be looked at as a value drawn from a very small set such as `{0, 0.01, 0.02, 0.04, 0.001}`. 
- The part that really needs continuous value is abstracted away as `pose(1)` and the model just apply relative transforms to that. If `pose(1)` is chosen close to the final poses, the LLM does not need to do much to accomplish the task. It would help if the paper reports the distribution of `pose(1)` distance to the final target poses.
- Not all the prompt categories are used in the example prompt. I am particularly interested to see a prompt that uses Spatial Patterns. I also believe that this is a simplistic prompt. The resolution of patterns can make a big difference in success or failure of tasks. In addition, how are the continuous orientation of parts represented by characters?
- Section 5.1 is interesting but not sure how it connects to the rest of the paper. I don’t see the use of spacing between digits in the example prompts. In addition, none of the prompts have numbers beyond just double floating point precision. They don't even utilize all the possibilities in the double digit floating points (referring to my earlier point about floating numbers are coming from a set of few floating number which can be represented 
- The paper assumes that perception is a solved problem and it does not deal with uncertainties in the perception.
- What is total number of trials for Table 1 and 2?
