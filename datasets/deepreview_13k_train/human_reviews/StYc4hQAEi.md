- Decision: Accept
- Scores: 8, 6, 6, 6

## Abstract
The sliced Wasserstein (SW) distances between two probability measures are defined as the expectation of the Wasserstein distance between two one-dimensional projections of the two measures. The randomness comes from a projecting direction that is used to project the two input measures to one dimension. Due to the intractability of the expectation, Monte Carlo integration is performed to estimate the value of the SW distance. Despite having various variants, there has been no prior work that improves the Monte Carlo estimation scheme for the SW distance in terms of controlling its variance. To bridge the literature on variance reduction and the literature on the SW distance, we propose computationally efficient control variates to reduce the variance of the empirical estimation of the SW distance. The key idea is to first find Gaussian approximations of projected one-dimensional measures, then we utilize the closed-form of the Wasserstein-2 distance between two Gaussian distributions to design the control variates. In particular, we propose using a lower bound and an upper bound of the Wasserstein-2 distance between two fitted Gaussians as two computationally efficient control variates. We empirically show that the proposed control variate estimators can help to reduce the variance considerably when comparing measures over images and point-clouds.}.

### Summary
Developing efficient algorithms to compute slided Wasserstein distance is an important problem in OT. The authors proposed to use control variates, a special variance reduction algorithm, to compute the distance reliably. Compared with standard Monte Carlo sampling, it has a much smaller variance, as observed empirically. The authors carefully designed the control variates, which plays a crucial role in the performance of variance reduction. The computational complexity is also analyzed, and a comprehensive numerical study is performed to show the superior performance of their proposed algorithm.

### Strengths
- Although the idea of control Variate is simple and straightforward, the construction of the control variate estimator is highly non-trivial. The authors find a good estimator based on the closed-form expression of the OT distance between two fitted Gaussians. This idea is useful. 
- I agree that it is intractable to evaluate $\mathbb{E}[W_2^2(\mathcal{N}(m_1(\theta;\mu), \sigma_1^2(\theta;\mu)), \mathcal{N}(m_2(\theta;\mu), \sigma_2^2(\theta;\mu)))]$, and the authors proposed lower and upper bounds on this unknown quantity around Proposition 3, which is valid.
- The computational complexity for two control variate-based sliced Wasserstein distance is analyzed, which showcases their computational efficiency. 
- It is good to see how to apply the authors' algorithm to other variants of sliced Wasserstien distance, as pointed at the end of Section 3.
- It is also interesting to see how to apply the control variate to compute the gradient of sliced Wasserstein distance, as pointed at the end of Section 3.
- Numerical study on three different applications is solid.

### Weaknesses
While I appreciate and understand the authors' main idea, some parts of writing can be improved:
- It is good that the authors provided strong motivations for using control covariates in Section 3.1, paragraph 2, the wiring in this part is poor. I suggest the authors follow the writing of [A. Shapiro 2021, Section 5.5.2] to re-write this part. 

Ref: Shapiro A, Dentcheva D, Ruszczynski A. Lectures on stochastic programming: modeling and theory[M]. Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics, 2021.

- For the paragraph "Constructing Control Variates" in Section 3.2, the authors should omit the detailed deviation of the closed-form solution of $W_2^2(\mathcal{N}(m_1(\theta;\mu), \sigma_1^2(\theta;\mu)), \mathcal{N}(m_2(\theta;\mu), \sigma_2^2(\theta;\mu)))$. It is fine to present only the final simplified expression.
- For the paragraph below Proposition 1, the description for computing the sliced Wasserstein between continuous distributions is brief and confusing. The authors may consider describe the algorithms in detail and present this part in an extra Appendix instead. 
- I feel the theoretical analysis of the variance-reduced estimator is not enough. But when I look at related literature, there is little theoretical guarantees on this part. So I think it is fine regarding the theoretical contribution part.

### Questions
I think the authors also miss an important application on computing sliced Wasserstein (SW) distance. Since the SW distance can be used to quantify the difference between distributions, it can be used for non-parametric two-sample testing, i.e., given samples from two distributions $\mu$ and $\nu$, to determine either $H_0: \mu=\nu$ or $H_1: \mu\ne\nu$. Related literature [Wang et al. 2021] used the projected Wasserstein distance (seeks the one-dimensional projector that maximizes OT distance, instead of finding the averaged OT distance among all one-dimensional projectors) for two-sample testing, but it can be naturally extended for SW distance. The authors can use their variance reduction technique to finish this task with superior computational efficiency.

### Summary
The paper proposes novel Monte Carlo estimators for the sliced Wasserstein distance (SW) using the control variates principle. The proposed estimators have reduced variance, and the computation costs remain the same. In addition, the paper provides various experiments and applications, which illustrate that in practice the estimators do outperform naive SW estimator, and can be applied to various tasks including gradient flow and generative modeling.

### Strengths
The paper is overall clear and well presented, and the results are original and novel to the knowledge of the reviewer. The strengths of the paper includes:

1. The statistical aspects of estimator of the SW is mostly studied from the perspective of the marginal populations, and this paper sheds new light on the MC side of estimation of the SW, from a variance reduction point of view. This can be of practical interests.
2. The construction of the estimators makes extensive use of properties of Wasserstein distance, especially in the 1 dimensional case. The balance of computational tractability and statistical relevance seems an interesting aspect, especially for SW as it utilizes external randomness.
3. The paper provides extensive experiments, which seem sufficient for justifying the practicality of the proposed estimators.

### Weaknesses
Some weaknesses:

1. A major confusion is proposition 1, in which the paper claims to minimize KL divergence between discrete distribution and a Gaussian distribution. However, to the best of the reviewer's knowledge, there's no way to obtain finite value for KL between discrete distribution and continuous distribution, even under the most generalized setting with Radon–Nikodym derivative. The reviewer acknowledge that this potential flaw does not defeat the purpose of identifying the Gaussian proxy using information of $\mu,\nu$ (e.g. as an alternative, through moment matching), but urge the authors to revise this part accordingly.
2. The usage of 'upper/lower bounds' seems to lack justification, as they are quite different from the Gaussian approach the paper proposes, in terms of how much correlation is changed/lost. In addition, though $\mathbb{E}[\sigma_1(\theta;\mu)\sigma_2(\theta;\nu)]$ does not have a closed form, it's unclear why it can't be estimated by MC, as is done throughout the paper. (A personal thought: from a statistical perspective, in order to introduce correlation it might be possible to use $\sigma_1^2(\theta;\mu)\sigma_2^2(\theta;\nu)$, if it is at all possible to address.)
3. The treatment of the resulting estimator from control variates is rough. In particular, the following items need proper discussion: unbiasedness (the biasedness after taking p-root does not justify the biasedness of proposed estimator which is without a root), actual variance of the proposed estimators (which is not the control variate estimator but a further estimator of it), and how good the proposed estimators of coefficients are (e.g. $\hat{\gamma^*}$).

### Questions
Please see above (section Weaknesses) for details. The reviewer is confident that these can be clarified.

To make the paper stronger, the reviewer suggest investigating the balance between the computational tractability (e.g. using $m_1,\sigma_1$) and statistical relevance, as it seems that the easier control variate is to be computed, the less information it provides. Theoretical or empirical evidence would be illuminating.

### Summary
Wasserstein (W) distance plays an increasingly preponderant role in many machine learning pipelines, since its ability to capture geometric features of the objects at hand. However, it suffers from a heavy computational cost, $O(n^3\log(n))$ where $n$ is the number of supports of the probability measures. To overcome this computational bottleneck, sliced Wasserstein distance (SWD) stands as an alternative to Wasserstein distance. SWD is based on slicing the origin measures  $\mu$ and $\nu$ by projecting them on a direction $\theta$ of the unit-hypersphere and then calculating an expectation (average) of the 1-dimensional Wasserstein distances between the projected measures $\mu_\theta$ and $\nu_\theta$. This expectation is calculated using Monte Carlo (MC) integration to estimate SWD distance. It is known that the error of the MC approximation is $O\big({L}^{-1/2} \times \text{Variance}[W_p^p(\mu_\theta, \nu_\theta)\big]\big)$. 

This paper proposes a computationally efficient control of the term $\text{Variance}[W_p^p(\mu_\theta, \nu_\theta)\big]$ based on the control variates from the literature on variance reduction. The idea behind this is to find left and right control variates estimators, which are Gaussian control approximations of $\mu_\theta$ and  \nu_\theta$ with a low variance of their Wasserstein distances.  These estimators share the same computational complexity and memory complexity as the conventional estimator of SWD (vanilla MC estimator).

### Strengths
- Proposing a novel control of the variance term in the projection complexity of SWD that leads to a computationally efficient estimation of SWD.
- The estimators are based on the control variate from the literature of reduction variance, which seems interesting to bridge the OT metrics with reduction variance. 
- Extensive experiments on comparing probability measures over images and point-clouds, point clouds gradient flows, and generative modeling. The left and right estimators have computational and performance gains over the conventional MC approximation of SWD.
- The presentation of the paper is easy to follow. I checked the proofs and they sound good to me. 
- The code is attached and the experimental protocols are well explained (in the main + supplementary), which guarantees the reproducibility of the experiments.

### Weaknesses
 - In Definition 1, the expectation of the controlled projected one-dimensional Wasserstein distance is non-nonegative (unbiased estimator of SWD). But what about the variable itself, $Z(\theta, \mu, \nu)$, is it also non-negative? It's crucial to understand the properties of the random variable itself, not just its expectation, as negative values could impact the variance reduction strategy and the interpretation of the results.
- I'm wondering about the utility of Proposition 4, which states the left control estimator is equivalent to considering a control variate with respect to the 2-Wasserstein distance between a projection of Gaussian approximations of the origin measures. I'm thinking about the following scheme: we first calculate these Gaussian approximations of the origin probability measures then an SWD between these approximations and the controlled SWD is given by: $|\hat{SWD}(\text{origin measures}) - \hat {SWD}(\text{Gaussian Approximation of the origin measures})|$ without adding the factor $\gamma$. It's not clear why the factor $\gamma$ is necessary and how it contributes to a tighter control variate. The intuition behind this design choice should be clarified. Specifically, what is the benefit of using the regression estimator with $\gamma$ versus a simple difference estimator with $\gamma=1$?
- The most related previous work is the Gaussian approximation for the SWD_2 (Nadjahi et al; n NeurIPS'21). Can we expect a fast rate of convergence of the controlled variate estimator, e.g. LCV-SWD to the true Sliced Wasserstein distance? (In Nadjahi et al; n NeurIPS'21, the rate is $O(d^{-1/8})$, see Corollary 1 therein, which is too slow for $d \gg1$.) The paper should discuss the convergence rate of their proposed estimator, especially in comparison to the existing Gaussian approximation for SWD. The practical implications of a slow convergence rate, especially in high-dimensional settings, need to be addressed.

### Summary
The paper focuses on improving the Monte Carlo estimation scheme used in computing Sliced Wasserstein (SW). While several works in the literature have concentrated on enhancing the sampling scheme, such as max-SW [1], projected W [2], and distributional SW [3], the paper's originality lies in its approach to controlling the variance of the estimation using control variates. The solution can be computed in linear time, similar to SW, and experiments demonstrate that, with a fixed number of lines L, the estimation is improved when compared to SW.

### Strengths
The paper addresses an important problem: how to provide a proxy for the Wasserstein distance using a fast algorithm. It aims to take a step forward in SW estimation (which has a complexity of $O(n \log(n))$) by carefully selecting the projection lines. For a given number of directions $L$, the algorithms provide improved performance over SW, as evaluated in several experimental setups.
The originality of the approach is that it relies on the control variates method, which reduces variance in Monte Carlo methods. The paper is clear, and its claims are supported by empirical and/or theoretical evidence.

Main strengths:
- Fairly well motivated and original solution
- Theory and experiments seem sounded

### Weaknesses
The paper lacks positioning with respect to competitors whose goal is also to improve the sampling scheme of SW, or more generally, other SW variants. Evaluating the proposed methods among numerous competitors can be challenging. However, CV-SW is benchmarked only against SW, whereas algorithms such as max-SW [1] (which considers only the 'max' direction), distributional SW [3] (which searches for an 'optimal' direction), or even projected Wasserstein [2] (which uses orthogonal directions) are closely related to the proposed method in spirit. Theoretical and experimental comparisons are missing.



Minor comments:
- $W(	heta)$ (two lines after eq. 7) has not been defined
- Could you check the value of $f'(\gamma)$ tow lines after eq. 8 ?

### Questions
- how does the method compares with max-sliced SW, distributional SW and projected SW?
- Is there any results that compare the value provided by CV-SW with SW or Wasserstein ? Do you have any results regarding the sample complexity?
