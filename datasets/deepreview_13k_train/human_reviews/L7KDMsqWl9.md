- Decision: Reject
- Scores: 5, 5, 3, 3

## Abstract
This paper introduces HHD-Ethiopic, a new OCR dataset for historical handwritten Ethiopic script, characterized by a unique syllabic writing system, low resource availability, and complex orthographic diacritics. The dataset consists of roughly 80,000 annotated text-line images from 1700 pages of $18^{th}$ to $20^{th}$ century documents, including a training set with text-line images from the $19^{th}$ to $20^{th}$ century and two test sets. One is distributed similarly to the training set with nearly 6,000 text-line images, and the other contains only images from the $18^{th}$ century manuscripts, with around 16,000 images. The former test set allows us to check baseline performance in the classical IID setting (Independently and Identically Distributed), while the latter addresses a more realistic setting in which the test set is drawn from a different distribution than the training set (Out-Of-Distribution or OOD). Multiple annotators labeled all text-line images for the HHD-Ethiopic dataset, and an expert supervisor double-checked them. We assessed human-level recognition performance and compared it with state-of-the-art (SOTA) OCR models using the Character Error Rate (CER) and Normalized Edit Distance (NED) metrics. Our results show that the model performed comparably to human-level recognition on the $18^{th}$ century test set and outperformed humans on the IID test set. However, the unique challenges posed by the Ethiopic script, such as detecting complex diacritics, still present difficulties for the models. Our baseline evaluation and HHD-Ethiopic dataset will encourage further research on Ethiopic script recognition. The dataset and source code can be accessed at https://github.com/ethopic/hhd-ethiopic-I.

### Summary
This paper presents a new dataset for historical handwritten Ethiopic script. The dataset contains approximately 80k text lines extracted from scanned document from the 18th to the 20th century. The paper describes the challenges of Ethiopic script, and the data collection and annotation process. Baseline recognition results are reported as character error rates, evaluating a number of state-of-the-art techniques in handwriting recognition, as well as the human error rate on the proposed test splits.

### Strengths
First, the paper presents a new dataset for an under-resourced script, made of historical documents: this is quite valuable for a more general inclusion of all languages and eventually allow to process more archives. 
This seems to be even more valuable given the high error rate of human readers for these documents, even when they are familiar with Ethiopic characters. Systems derived from that dataset could therefore be a good help for archivists. 
Finally, the paper provides some baselines with existing handwriting recognition methods.
The paper is globally well written and easy to follow.

### Weaknesses
There are maybe sometimes too many details in the text, or repeated statements, which could be shortened in favor of either more analysis of the data, a more detailed description of the challenges of Ethiopic scripts (e.g. some parts of App. A are very interesting and could fit in the main part of the paper).
The fact that some datasets exist for Ethiopic script (described in App. B) should appear in Section 2, where the reader is let to think that no such dataset exist. Moreover, it would be interesting to see how the models presented in the experiment section would perform on these other datasets, or to include the models used in these other papers in the baseline, as they might address the challenges of Ethiopic script. (for example, Abdurhaman et al. report a CER of less than 2% on their dataset)
In a paper proposing a new dataset, I would expect more statistical analysis or the proposal of a method to address the specific challenges of the new dataset. In particular, the human error rate seems quite high, which at the same time makes the dataset interesting but begs the question of the quality of the ground-truth. How would the human performance be with access to reference material? Do the annotator make the same errors or different ones? Do the model make the same mistakes as the human evaluation? For the training set labeling, is there a measure of, for example, inter-annotator agreement?
The paper is interesting and the proposal of a new dataset valuable, but it could be more suited to other venues like DAS, ICFHR, ICDAR or maybe ICML

### Questions
Why are CRNN, ASTER, SVTR, etc. models worse than the CTC ones despite being larger? In appendix C we learn that they were not trained to the end due to the lack of resources, but that makes the result confusing, if not misleading if they are understood as baselines.

In the first test set, did you make sure that the same writer or document do not appear in the training and test set?

Minor remarks:
  - the format of citations needs to be fixed
  - the "remark" column in Table I is not necessary
  - Sec. 3.1: "we have generate" -> generated
  - p5. CTC, attention and transformers are put in parallel when they correspond to different things (loss, mechanism, model)

### Summary
This paper works on historical handwritten Ethiopic script recognition. It provides introduction to the character system contained in the Ethiopic and lists some major challenges in this task at first. Then, it introduces a new OCR dataset for historical handwritten Ethiopic script HHD-Ethiopic, which consists of roughly 80,000 annotated text-line images and compares the human-level recognition performance with some state-of-the-art OCR models on the proposed dataset. The main contributions of this paper are as follow:
•	This new dataset is the first sizable dataset for handwritten Ethiopic text-image recognition and it can encourage further research on Ethiopic script recognition.
•	The author assessed the human-level performance of multiple participants in HHD-Ethiopic dataset to establish a baseline for comparison with machine learning models.
•	The author evaluate several state-of-the-art OCR methods on the HHD-Ethiopic dataset.

### Strengths
1.	This paper collects and analyzes a new historical handwritten Ethiopic dataset, which is benefit to future research.
2.	This paper compare several popular OCR methods on the proposed new dataset. And it tries performing a fair comparison between human and machine performance on historical handwritten Ethiopic scripts recognition task.

### Weaknesses
1.	The structure of Table 2 and its description in the bottom of page 6 is not match: According to the Table, the Test-set-I is the IID data, which should be Annot-V with 26.56% CER and 24.56% NED; the Test-set-II is the Annot-VI. And it is better to add a row displaying the average performance. 
2.	Because of the error in Section 4.1, the Figure 5 and the conclusion inferred from it are also wrong (i.e. HPopt-Attn-CTC cannot surpass human performance on Test-set-II).
3.	According to the previous two reasons, I think the experiments of the paper are insufficient. 
4.	This work did not propose a new approach to recognize with the specific Historical handwritten Ethiopic script.

### Questions
Researchers often compare the performance of recognition methods for other languages using the recognition accuracy. Why not include this metric?

### Summary
The article presents a new database of lines of handwritten text from historical documents written in Ethiopian script. This database consists of more than 80,000 lines of text from 1,700 pages. Two test sets were defined, one set with the same distribution as the training set (IID test) and another derived from completely disjoint manuscripts (OOD test). The performance of human transcribers was evaluated. Several handwriting recognition models were trained and evaluated on the test sets. One model outperformed humans on the IID set. The database and training codes are available online.

### Strengths
- a large new database available for the Ethiopian script
- the code is available to reproduce the experiments
- an interesting proposal for an IID and OOD test sets

### Weaknesses
 - full pages are not provides, which prevents the evaluation of full page models, which are currently the best performing models, compared with cascade models (line detection + HTR), which accumulate errors
- no reference to https://journals.openedition.org/jtei/4109 
- no reference or comparison to the models available in Transkribus https://readcoop.eu/model/ethiopic-classical-ethiopic-scripts-from-ethiopia-and-eritrea/
- tesseract supports Ethiopic but is neither mentioned nor tested. As the script is not cursive, a test of tesseract would be possible.
- the models tested have never been evaluated on standard handwriting recognition bases. How do they compare with standard libraries such as Transkribus, pylaia and trOCR?

In conclusion, the article presents an interesting resource for HTR, but makes no new contribution either experimentally or methodologically.



### Questions
- no measure of inter-annotator agreement: it seems that annotation is difficult, judging by the poor performance of humans. How correct is the annotation? What is the variance of the annotation?
- no details are given about the manuscripts: where do they come from, how were they chosen, how many are there?

### Summary
This paper introduces a new dataset and baseline models for historical handwritten Ethiopic OCR. The contributions of this paper are as follows:
(1) A new dataset that contains about 80,000 text-line images from 18th to 20th century manuscripts, with multiple annotations and human-level performance benchmarks.
(2) Three types of classical text recognition methods, including transformer-based methods, attention-based methods, and CTC-based methods, are tested on the new dataset.
(3) The authors compare the baseline methods with human-level performance, showing their superiorities and weaknesses.

### Strengths
1. This paper introduces a new dataset for historical handwritten Ethiopic OCR. 
2. Some baseline methods are evaluated on this dataset.

### Weaknesses
The contributions of this paper are limited. The reasons are:
1. This paper is a dataset paper, without new technical methods.
2. The academic challenges of this dataset are not representative. The impact of this new benchmark seems limited.

### Questions
I suggest the authors provide a new solution for this new dataset.
