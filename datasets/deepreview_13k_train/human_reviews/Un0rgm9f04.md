- Decision: Accept
- Scores: 6, 6, 6

## Abstract
This work introduces Video Diffusion Transformer (\model), which pioneers the use of transformers in diffusion-based video generation.
It features transformer blocks with modularized temporal and spatial attention modules to leverage the rich spatial-temporal representation inherited in transformers.
Additionally, we propose a unified spatial-temporal mask modeling mechanism, seamlessly integrated with the model, to cater to diverse video generation scenarios.

\model offers several appealing benefits.
\textbf{1)} It excels at capturing temporal dependencies to produce temporally consistent video frames and even simulate the physics and dynamics of 3D objects over time.
\textbf{2)} It facilitates flexible conditioning information, \eg, simple concatenation in the token space, effectively unifying different token lengths and modalities.
\textbf{3)} Pairing with our proposed spatial-temporal mask modeling mechanism, it becomes a general-purpose video diffuser for harnessing a range of tasks, including unconditional generation, video prediction, interpolation, animation, and completion, etc.
Extensive experiments on these tasks spanning various scenarios, including autonomous driving, natural weather, human action, and physics-based simulation, demonstrate the effectiveness of \model.
Additionally, we present comprehensive studies on how \model handles conditioning information with the mask modeling mechanism, which we believe will benefit future research and advance the field.

### Summary
The authors introduce a new method called VDT for generating videos. In this approach, transformer architecture replaces U-net as the backbone for the diffusion model. The method employs a unified spatial-temporal mask for diverse tasks and yields state-of-the-art results. The authors also provide an explanation of the mechanism behind VDT for better understanding.

### Strengths
(1) The method is pretty novel and compelling. 
(2) Different tasks are designed to clarify the superiorities.
(3) The analysis of the training strategy is technically sound.

### Weaknesses
(1) According to Table 4, the FVD values of the diffusion model pre-trained with U-Net are significantly better than VDT. However, the authors mention GPU resource limitations as a potential issue. I suggest that the authors compare the results of relevant tasks to provide further clarification. Specifically, a more detailed analysis of the trade-offs between pre-training and the proposed transformer-based approach is needed. The current discussion lacks a thorough examination of how the architectural differences contribute to the observed performance gap in FVD.
(2) It is unclear why MCVD-concat performs better than VDT in FVD. The explanation should delve deeper into the specific mechanisms of MCVD-concat that lead to its superior FVD scores, particularly in the context of video prediction tasks. A more detailed comparison of how each model handles temporal dependencies and spatial coherence would be beneficial.
(3) Due to the resolution, it is difficult to distinguish the differences between Videofusion and VDT in the TaiChi-HD section. The visual comparison is not sufficiently clear to support the claims of VDT's superior performance. The authors should provide higher resolution examples or alternative visualizations to highlight the differences more effectively.

### Questions
--The presentation was found to be easy to follow by the reviewer. However, there were some typos in the paper that caused misunderstandings. For example, in one instance, the paper mentioned that "the input can either be pure noise latent features or a concatenation of conditional and noise latent features." The word "conditional" should have been replaced with "conditions". Also, the paper stated that "the results of convergence speed and sample quality are presented in Figure 3 and Table 2, respectively." However, the actual result was shown in Figure 7.

--Although the current quantitative analysis indicates that VDT performs better, the experimental results may not support this fact. Can you provide further analysis and results with improved quality?

### Summary
This paper introduces Video Diffusion Transformer (VDT), a video generation model with pure transformer architecture.
The core idea is to replace the unet structure of the existing video generation model with a pure transformer structure.
The authors claimed that it's the first successful model in transformer-based video diffusion.
They propose a unified spatial-temporal mask modeling mechanism for VDT, enabling it to unify a diverse array of general-purpose tasks.
They show the effectiveness of VDT on several video-related tasks.

### Strengths
1. Compared with the current U-net-based network with demonic attention structures, VDT is a pure transformer network. If it is indeed the first Transformer-only video diffusion network, it would be a good baseline for this area.
2. This paper further proposes the spatiotemporal mask mechanism, which can make VDT adapt to various video tasks, including video generation, video prediction, image-to-video generation, video completion, etc.
3. This paper verifies the effectiveness of VDT on multiple video generation tasks.
4. The code in this article is open source and will help others replicate this work.

### Weaknesses
1. The core idea of this paper is simple and reasonable. Replacing the original CNN with transformer is an effective method that has been widely verified in the whole field. In addition, this paper adopts the basic attention mechanism, and the mask strategy proposed is also commonly used in video tasks. So, from this perspective, the contribution is slightly less obvious.
2. I feel that the work in this paper can be a good benchmark in this field. However, this paper only verifies that it can be effective on multiple video tasks. As a good benchmark, this paper should give more detailed experimental analysis of ablation. For example, why does space-time pay attention to time before space? In this paper, the influence of each module on the video generation effect, the comparison experiment of hyperparameter and so on.
3. Tab.5, 142.3 (blacken) is not the best one.

### Summary
This work introduces a video diffusion model based on the Transformer architecture, a departure from the commonly used U-Net structure in previous Video Diffusion Models (VDM). The utilization of the Transformer model for this task is a significant contribution, especially given its novelty in the field. Additionally, the incorporation of a mask-based modeling mechanism extends the applicability of the model to a wider range of tasks.

### Strengths
- Pioneering exploration of the Transformer architecture for video diffusion models, marking a valuable starting point.
- Validation of the effectiveness of the proposed architecture and methods across multiple task datasets.
- Achieving state-of-the-art results on several mainstream benchmarks.

### Weaknesses
 - While the authors conducted validations on various tasks, the ablation experiments in Table 2 are insufficient. Verification in unconditional video generation tasks would enhance the persuasiveness of the study.
- The method is limited to lower resolutions, diminishing its practical applicability. Specifically, the patch-based approach, while novel, appears to restrict the model's ability to process higher-resolution video data, which is a significant limitation for real-world applications.
- I believe it would be valuable to compare training and inference times. Understanding the computational costs associated with both training and real-time usage is crucial for assessing the feasibility of the approach in real-world scenarios. It would enhance the completeness of the evaluation and provide readers with a comprehensive understanding of the method's efficiency. Therefore, I recommend including a comparison of training and inference times in the manuscript to strengthen the overall analysis.

### Questions
- I previously reviewed an earlier version of this manuscript, and there have been notable improvements, particularly in clarifying the significance of the Transformer in the introduction, which I find valuable. 
- I am still curious about why the patch-based method is limited to such low resolutions. Even at 256 resolution, the token length is not excessively long, and it could potentially be experimented with. Is this limitation due to computational constraints?
- Additionally, it would be beneficial to compare the proposed method with more recent publications. A comparison with the results summarized in [a] could be enlightening.
- In conclusion, I find the innovation in this paper substantial, and it presents a compelling argument. For now, I am inclined to recommend acceptance.
