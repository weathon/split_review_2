# GeRA: Label-Efficient Geometrically Regularized Alignment

- Decision: Reject
- Scores: 5, 5, 5, 8

## Abstract
Pretrained unimodal encoders incorporate rich semantic information into embedding space structures. 
To be similarly informative, multi-modal encoders typically require massive amounts of paired data for alignment and training.
We introduce a semi-supervised \textbf{Ge}ometrically \textbf{R}egularized \textbf{A}lignment (GeRA) method to align the embedding spaces of pretrained unimodal encoders in a label-efficient way. 
Our method leverages the manifold geometry of unpaired (unlabeled) data to improve alignment performance. 
To prevent distortions to local geometry during the alignment process —potentially disrupting semantic neighborhood structures and causing misalignment of unobserved pairs — we introduce a geometric loss term. This term is built upon a diffusion operator that captures the local manifold geometry of the unimodal pretrained encoders.
GeRA is modality-agnostic and thus can be used to align pretrained encoders from any data modalities. 
We provide empirical evidence to the effectiveness of our method in the domains of speech-text and image-text alignment. 
Our experiments demonstrate significant improvement in alignment quality compared to a variaty of leading baselines, especially with a small amount of paired data, using our proposed geometric regularization.

### Summary
This paper proposes a new semi-supervised method for cross-modality alignment, named Geometrically Regularized Alignment (GeRA). Compared with regular aligning loss, GeRA includes Geometric Regularization, which force to preserve the neighborhood structure of nearby unpaired points.

### Strengths
- The whole paper is well written and easy to follow.
- To effeciently align embedding spaces of unimodal encoders by preserving the locality of unparied points is convincing.
- The figures and charts are well-presented. Both Fig1 and Fig2 illustrates GeRA clearly.

### Weaknesses
 - This paper has limited novelty. Adding a geometrically regularization term is too conventional in manifold learning.
- The motivation of this paper needs further discussion. There are millions or even billions of paired  speech-text and image-text  data, why do we need a label-efficient semi-supervised method?

### Questions
- Please explain my questions mentioned in Weakness.
- How long does it take to get the nearest neighbor information?

### Summary
The paper presents a method for addressing the challenge of multi-modal alignment with a focus on preserving local geometric structure and efficiently utilizing unlabeled data. The paper makes several contributions to the field, including geometry-preserving alignment, label efficiency, and modality-agnostic formulation. The authors demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed GeRA method in various settings

### Strengths
The proposed method stands out by focusing on preserving local geometric structures, which are critical for retaining the rich semantic information within the manifold structure.

The method can capture additional information from pretrained unimodal encoders, making it highly valuable in scenarios where paired data is limited.

does not rely on domain-specific knowledge or augmentation and can be applied across various encoders and data modalities, as long as pretrained models are available.

### Weaknesses
The author proposed the kernel based encoding methods for capturing the local geometric information of each sample. There are several existing works proposed in a while for capturing the local geometric in RKHS in semi-supervised settings, through either constructing neighbor data dependent norms or leveraging the Laplacian graphs in manifold regularization, list a few below:

V. Sindhwani, et al.   Beyond the point cloud: from transductive to semi-supervised learning 

X. Zhu, et al.   Semi-supervised learning using gaussian fields and harmonic functions

From this point of view, the employment of the heat kernel seems to be the main contribution of this work, thus slightly weakening the novelty. The use of a heat kernel, while effective, is not entirely novel in the context of manifold learning or semi-supervised learning. The paper does not sufficiently differentiate its approach from existing methods that use similar kernel-based techniques for capturing local geometry. Specifically, the paper lacks a detailed comparison of the computational complexity and performance trade-offs between the proposed heat kernel and other common kernels used in similar settings, such as Gaussian or polynomial kernels. A more thorough analysis of why the heat kernel is superior in this specific multi-modal alignment problem is needed.
As the author mentioned, there is a clear limitation related to the batch size and computational cost of this method, have the author conducted any analysis based on what could be the trade off due to this limitation? What could be the scenario in which this method may not work well due to this?

### Summary
This paper aims to improve the training of multi-modal models from pretrained unimodal models. The paper proposes the method GeRA that adds a regularization loss to the multi-modal contrastive loss such that the local geometry of the original embedding spaces of each modality is preserved (Eq. 3: geometric regularization). The regularization term is based on a kernel function of the locality around each point that encourages the nearest neighbors to stay in their relative positions. The experiments section evaluates the effectiveness of the geometric regularization compared with various baselines on the CC12m and concludes that the method is effective in a low data regime.

### Strengths
- Results in Figure 3 and Figure 6 show that the proposed method is better than training with contrastive loss and two other baselines when training on fewer than 10^5 paired data points on both image-text and speech-text alignment tasks.
- GeRA has been shown to be effective for two alignment learning tasks, image-text and speech-text alignment, in the low-data regime.

### Weaknesses
 - One of the major motivations in the introduction for the method is to use unpaired data for training. However, I cannot find any experiment in section 5 that trains on a mixture of unpaired and paired data where paired data is small. If so, please name the dataset used in section 5. Is unpaired data referring to the data used for pretraining the models? If no experiments are done that use unpaired data during the alignment, at least the following sentence in the abstract should be corrected: “Our method leverages the manifold geometry of unpaired (unlabeled) data to improve alignment performance.” and the following sentence in Section 3: “...we propose to leverage unlabeled (unpaired) points from each modality to preserve the rich geometric structure of their original embedding spaces.”
- The effectiveness of the method is limited to the low-data regime with paired data fewer than 10^5 samples and the performance is significantly lower than a model trained with just one order of magnitude more paired samples. So at least for image-text and speech-text modalities where available paired data is significantly more than 10^5, it is not clear how the proposed method can be helpful. In other words, when would it be useful to use GeRA instead of ASIF or the standard contrastive loss? Would it be for training other multi-modal models where the paired data is few? If so, do authors believe that the two examples of image-text and speech-text can be extrapolated to other multi-modal models?
- Figure 1: This figure is interesting and shows that the nearest neighbors remain relatively the same. Is there a standard evaluation metric that is improved because the geometry of modalities remains almost the same? Most of section 5 considers evaluation metrics specific to multi-modal models. Can we also evaluate these models for unimodal metrics such as unimodal retrieval such as image-image text-text retrieval?
- Is Figure 1 related to any model trained and evaluated in Section 5? Can we confirm that the model trained with GeRA is also a strong model according to zero-shot metrics?
- Eq. 3: What is the dimensionality of W? Is it MxM or N_k x N_k? Is the loss meaningful even if the nearest neighbors in the original and the new space are different? In that case, the geometric loss depends on the embeddings of data points that don’t exist in a mini-batch if we randomly sample training data. Is there a lookup table that stores all the embeddings of NNs for all points? Does one need to include all the original NNs for all points in a mini-batch? This leads me to a new question and potential concern: What is the cost of computing the geometric regularization?

### Summary
The manuscript presents a novel semi-supervised method termed as Geometrically Regularized Alignment (GeRA) to effectively align the embedding spaces of pretrained encoders. This approach is characterized by its alignment of two distinct latent spaces into a unified space, leveraging a dual penalty system. The first penalty is a contrastive loss that ensures corresponding points in these spaces are brought close together, while the second, a geometric loss, preserves the inherent local geometry of spaces as learned by the pretrained encoders. A distinguishing feature of this work is the introduction of the geometric loss, which constructs a kernel matrix over neighbors for each sample, aiming to minimize potential distortions when projecting each space in the shared one.

### Strengths
- The manuscript stands out for its clarity and coherent flow, providing readers with a well-motivated and well-structured presentation.
- The GeRA method's modality-agnostic nature makes it broadly applicable wherever pretrained models are utilized.
- The introduction of geometric regularization in this context is both original and intuitive, to the best of the reviewer knowledge. The simplicity of the idea that neighboring points in the source spaces should remain neighbors in the aligned space, thus preserving the semantic structures, is a strength of this work.
- The ablation studies presented in the paper are  comprehensive and convincing, enhancing  the presented results.
- The benchmark against ASIF, and subsequently extending this comparison to other pretrained models, is a strong selling point.  
- A well-thought hyperparameter search has been executed. Notably, also the competitor ASIF has gone through an hyperparameter search.

### Weaknesses
 - While the paper reports performance improvements, it lacks clarity on their statistical significance. For instance, when a 3% improvement in performance is highlighted, it becomes crucial to understand the variance arising from different initialization seeds. Reporting standard deviations would have offered a clearer picture of the model's robustness and reliability.
- The manuscript introduces additional hyperparameters, yet it does not provide sufficient insight into their impact on downstream performance. Without guiding intuition, the only approach seems to be extensive hyperparameter tuning, which might be computationally expensive and time-consuming.
- The discussion regarding inference time, particularly in relation to ASIF that performs vector search (i.e. retrieval) using cosine similarity, may be misleading. Existing libraries, such as faiss [1], offer methodologies for more efficient vector searches (e.g., approximate or hierarchical techniques). As such, the paper's emphasis on superior performance compared to a naive ASIF implementation could potentially be misleading to the reader.
- There is no publicly available code to reproduce the work.

### Questions
- The manuscript does not discuss the interplay between the density of the latent space and the preservation of its geometry. In particular for spaces where the points density changes in different regions, it may be problematic to use the same neighbors selection strategy for the whole space
 - The paper presents notably low performance figures for ASIF in the domain of speech-text alignment. How do these figures relate to the findings of [2] when using ASIF? An explanation or a comparative insight would help in contextualizing the reported results better and understanding potential disparities or improvements.
