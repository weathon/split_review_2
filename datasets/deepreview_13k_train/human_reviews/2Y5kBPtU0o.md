# MEND: Meta Demonstration Distillation for Efficient and Effective In-Context Learning

- Decision: Accept
- Scores: 6, 5, 8, 6

## Abstract
Large Language models (\texttt{LLMs}) have demonstrated impressive in-context learning (\texttt{ICL}) capabilities, 
where a \texttt{LLM} makes predictions for a given test input together with a few input-output pairs (demonstrations).
Nevertheless, the inclusion of demonstrations leads to a quadratic increase in the computational overhead of the self-attention mechanism.
Existing solutions attempt to distill lengthy demonstrations into compact vectors. 
However, they often require task-specific retraining or compromise \texttt{LLM}'s in-context learning performance. 
To mitigate these challenges, we present \underline{\textbf{M}}eta d\underline{\textbf{E}}monstratio\underline{\textbf{N}} \underline{\textbf{D}}istillation ({\model}), where a language model learns to distill any lengthy demonstrations into vectors without retraining for a new downstream task. 
We exploit the knowledge distillation to enhance alignment between {\model} and \texttt{LLM}, achieving both efficiency and effectiveness simultaneously. 
{\model} is endowed with the meta-knowledge of distilling demonstrations through a two-stage training process, which includes meta-distillation pretraining and fine-tuning.
Comprehensive evaluations across seven diverse \texttt{ICL} task partitions using decoder-only (\texttt{GPT-2}) and encoder-decoder (\texttt{T5}) attest to {\model}'s prowess.
It not only matches but often outperforms the \texttt{Vanilla ICL} as well as other state-of-the-art distillation models, while significantly reducing the computational demands. }.

### Summary
This work proposes a new method for efficient in-context learning via direct prediction of demonstration context vectors. The proposed method, called MEND, combines hypernetwork training with distillation of regular in-context learning behavior to achieve high-quality "prompt vector" synthesis capabilities. Authors validate MEND on the MetaICL dataset using GPT2 and T5 models, showing performance gains and accuracy improvements compared to other in-context learning baselines.

Post-rebuttal update: I thank the authors for their response and clarifications, and I am keeping my current score.

### Strengths
* The proposed approach is well-motivated and achieves significant improvements in each of the studied setups.
* The paper contains a detailed analysis section along with the ablation study for MEND, justifying the necessity of each component of the method.

### Weaknesses
 * My primary concern regarding the evaluation is that the models studied in the paper (GPT2-XL, T5-large) are relatively small and not representative of models that actually benefit from in-context learning. In fact, authors acknowledge this limitation in the appendix; I simply believe that having experiments on larger models (for example, training only one distillation model and applying it to larger LMs) would increase the impact of the work.
* The inference efficiency measurement protocol could likely be improved. First, it is unclear whether key/value caching is used for generation: this should make the impact of additional demonstrations less severe. Also, I think it would be helpful to have a more detailed memory/time breakdown for MEND: measuring only the inference with obtained meta-demonstrations is not sufficient, as the distillation model needs to process input demonstrations into prompts.
* At times, it was a bit difficult to understand the reasoning of the paper due to grammar errors/typos and word choice. Consider, for examplem, "the evident an misalignment" and "between teacher student's" on page 2, "into a condensed vectors", "distill the supervisional from demonstrations", and "cannot leveraging" on page 5.

### Questions
* In Table 2, what were the standard deviations across runs?
* How did you format 16 demonstration examples into a single input string for each dataset? For example, there are different ways of joining several demonstrations (space, linebreak etc.). Have you studied the robustness of models/methods to that formatting?

### Summary
This paper proposes MEND: meta-demonstration distillation. The authors design a distillation method to compress a long text demonstration into a short vector. MEND is designed as a meta-distillation method, such that the distillation model can be applied to unseen tasks. Experiments are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

### Strengths
* The proposed distillation method for prompt-tuning is well-motivated. The presentation is very clear. The proposed distillation method is effective and easy to understand.

* The authors investigate several flavors of models to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Specifically, the authors use GPT-2 with different sizes and T5 to show that MEND outperforms existing in context learning approaches.

### Weaknesses
My main concern is about experimental settings.

* Could the authors explain why GPT-2 and T5 are used? These models are usually considered outdated and more recent models should be used.
  * For the GPT family, GPT-J, GPT-Neo, OPT are all open-sourced. And the LLaMa models are instruction fine-tuned such that they may show different behavior when facing vectorized demonstrations.
  * For the T5 model, I suggest using Flan-T5, which shows much stronger performance than T5.

* The authors should consider more baselines. For example, Chain-of-Thought (CoT) can demonstrate stronger performance than vanilla ICL. The authors need to at least compare with the vanilla CoT. I also suggest distilling CoT prompts (demonstrations) and see whether this can further improve the performance of MEND.

### Summary
This paper focuses on making in-context learning (ICL) with LLMs more efficient and effective. Vanilla ICL requires one to provide a collection of demonstrations, i.e., task-specific example-label pairs, as context to the LLM while running an inference for a test example. However, this leads to long input sequences, increasing the cost of inference with LLMs where the self-attention cost scales quadratically with input sequence length. This paper proposes to utilize a **demonstration distillation model** to compress the long demonstration sequence into a small number of vectors which can be fed into the LLM as a prompt vector (akin to prompt tuning) during inference. There are existing approaches that adopt such an approach to make ICL efficient. However, those approaches often result in performance degradation. This paper proposes a knowledge distillation-based approach to train the demonstration distillation model. Through extensive empirical evaluations, the paper shows that the resulting demonstration distillation model not only realizes efficient inference by reducing the context length for LLM but often also improves the performance compared to vanilla ICL.

### Strengths
1) The paper proposes a novel solution to improve the demonstration distillation approach to make ICL efficient. The solution utilizes knowledge distillation in two stages -- pre-training and task-specific finetuning -- to improve the demonstration distillation model.
2) The paper provides thorough empirical evidence that the proposed approach makes the ICL efficient while also being on par with/improving vanilla ICL. 
3) The paper presents a detailed ablation study to highlight the utility of various components of the proposed approach.

### Weaknesses
There are no major weaknesses in the paper that the reviewer could find. Please see the questions section below for some clarifying questions.

Some minor comments about improving the quality of presentation are as follows:

1) Consider paraphrasing some sentences to make them clearer:

* On page 2, "Considering the evident a misalignment where the LLM trains on natural language tokens but infers using distillation vectors..."
* In Appendix D, "This will not only lose the information from the discarded tokens and cannot distill demonstration with large $K$ (e.g. $K > 1000$ (Hao et al., 2022))."

2) On page 2, "...we embarked on a in-depth..." --> "...we embarked on **an** in-depth..."
3) In Table 2, "0-shot" --> "zero-shot"
4) In Appendix D, "...are shading insights for future work." -->  "...shedding insights for future work."?


### Questions
1) After Eq. (1), the paper states "...where $\mathcal{C}$ is the unique set of $\{y\_i\}\_i=1^K$...". Isn't this a restrictive assumption? There could be tasks where test examples may have a label not present in any of the $K$ demonstrations, e.g., factual QA.
2) In Section 3.2, during the pre-training phase, does one begin with a pre-trained or randomly initialized demonstration distillation model?
3) Do bars in Figure 3 include the cost of generating $S_D$ (distillate vectors) during inference?
4) Why is prompt tuning performance missing from Figure 4a? Similarly, why is vanilla ICL (with truncated demonstration) missing from Figure 4b?
5) On page 8, the paper states ``Moreover, it is noteworthy that performance improves in most cases when the No Input perturbation is applied. This not only **underscores the significance of labels**...`` Could authors expand on this? Why does having only labels in the context help?

### Summary
This paper proposes a demonstration compression framework to save retraining LLMs for unseen tasks under in-context scenarios. To be specific, a two-stage training process including knowledge distillation from pre-trained LLMs and fine-tuning on specific tasks endows the framework with both efficiency and effectiveness. Empirical results of decoder-only and encoder-decoder architectures validate the proposed method.

### Strengths
- The authors proposed an efficient demonstration distillation for in-context learning. 
- The paper is well-organized and easy to follow.

### Weaknesses
 - More insightful explanations about why the proposed method does not compromise the in-context learning ability of LLMs could make the paper stronger. 
- self-contained notations may help the readers to understand the results better. 
- Figure 5 can be displayed using more contrasting colors

- The distillation loss occurs both in the pretraining and fine-tuning stages where a lambda controller balances the influence of distillation. What’s the influence of the lambda? A clear explanation about connecting the training mechanism(two-stage process) and each loss term to the “require task-specific retraining or compromise in-context learning” would help the reviewers better understand the advantage of the method.   

- In Figure 3, is the size of the distillation vectors of MEND the same size as PromptTuning? 
What’s the model size of MEND and FLOPs it introduced?  


Several questions for Table 4:
- In the ablation of pre-training,  even if the row is labeled as “No pretraining”, the fine-tuning term still contains the distillation loss. So what’s the lamda for this row? 
- What does L_hidn mean in Table 4? Is it L_distill ?
  If it is L_distll, then the second to the last row is the result of pretraining loss for both stages. The performance looks far from comparable to CLM. Can the authors clearly explain this?
