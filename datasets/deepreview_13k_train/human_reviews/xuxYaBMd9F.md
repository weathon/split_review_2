- Decision: Reject
- Scores: 6, 5, 8, 5, 3

## Abstract
Transformer models have achieved superior performance in various natural language processing tasks. However, the quadratic computational cost of the attention mechanism limits its practicality for long sequences. There are existing attention variants that improve the computational efficiency, but they have limited ability to effectively compute global information. In parallel to Transformer models, state space models (SSMs) are tailored for long sequences, but they are not flexible enough to capture complicated local information. We propose {\ours}, short for \underline{\textbf{S}}tate s\underline{\textbf{P}}ace \underline{\textbf{A}}ugmente\underline{\textbf{D}} Transform\underline{\textbf{E}}r. Specifically, we augment a SSM into the bottom layer of {\ours}, and we employ efficient local attention methods for the other layers. The SSM augments global information, which complements the lack of long-range dependency issue in local attention methods.
Experimental results on the Long Range Arena benchmark and language modeling tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. To further demonstrate the scalability of {\ours}, we pre-train large encoder-decoder models and present fine-tuning results on natural language understanding and natural language generation tasks.

2: You are willing to defend your assessment, but it is quite likely that you did not understand the central parts of the submission or that you are unfamiliar with some pieces of related work. Math/other details were not carefully checked.

### Summary
The paper proposes the SPADE (State sPace AugmenteD TransformEr) model, which augments a State Space Model (SSM) to a transformer model to effectively capture global information from long sequences. It also leverages local attention modules to capture local information. Both SSN and local attention can be computed efficiently compared with full attention mechanisms. The paper presents extensive experimental results and conducts ablation studies to show the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

### Strengths
- The paper is well written and easy to understand.
- The proposed architecture strikes a balance between simplicity and complexity, demonstrating strong performance on sequences of varying lengths while incurring lower computational expenses compared to full attention.
- Extensive experiment results across diverse datasets and tasks, along with ablation studies are provided.

### Weaknesses
 - The paper primarily consolidates existing concepts, such as SSM and local attention, and offers limited novelty in terms of new methodologies.
- Aside from the experimental results, it falls short in providing a comprehensive understanding of why this architecture is effective, and more crucially, in identifying scenarios where this approach may not be as effective.

### Questions
- In Figure 3, you simply concatenate SSM and local attention output, and apply a weight $\bf W$, did you try any other method to fuse them?
- It would be beneficial to include a relatively rigorous complexity analysis of SPADE comparing with various other methods, potentially in the appendix.

### Summary
This paper presents a novel model architecture designed to handle the complexities of both long-sequence processing. This is achieved by integrating S4 global attention with local attention mechanisms to form a hierarchical structure. The S4 layer is utilized at the bottom to capture long dependencies, while the local attention layers above aim to simplify attention complexity and expedite computation. The model outperforms the S4 alone and traditional Transformers in specific tasks.

### Strengths
Strengths:
1. This paper describes a novel model that integrates S4 global attention and local (window-based or chunk-based) attention to address both long-range dependencies in language modeling. The hierarchical structure, with S4 at the bottom and local attention on top, aims to balance complexity and computation speed. 
2. The model has shown improvements over S4 and traditional Transformers in long-range and text generation tasks.

### Weaknesses
Weaknesses:
1. S4 and Transformer are widely-used models, combining them together brings somehow incremental novelty contributions. 
2. The comparisons with alternative methods for capturing global context, such as RNN-like mechanisms or other efficient attention mechanisms, are incomplete and lack essential details. Only S4 is compared in table 1.  Some recent long-sequence modeling studies:
  a. LongNet: Scaling Transformers to 1,000,000,000 Tokens
  b. Long Range Language Modeling via Gated State Spaces

### Questions
Questions:
1. T5-base is not implemented with the same setting with the proposed model. It would be more convincing to report apple-to-apple comparisons with the same setting, like the same pre-trained datasets.

### Summary
The paper introduces State sPace AugmenteD TransformEr (SPADE) which combines S4 with local attention to achieve and transformer model that avoids the quadratic sequence length scaling.

The authors note that local attention usually hurts the model's ability to attend to long-range dependencies and state-space models (SSM) usually do poorly in tasks where local information is important like language modeling. By having the bottom layer be a SSM and the rest of the layers perform local attention, they get the best of both worlds.

This is evidenced by performance in Long Range Arena (LRA), language modeling, and GLUE.

### Strengths
The empirical results are both thorough and impressive. The authors did many ablations and on many different tasks and the model performs well on all of them.

The paper is clear, and the idea is simple and intuitive. The paper is timed well to capture interest in large language models and context length.

Section 6.3 regrading the location and number of global layers anticipates many questions about the justification for the experiment setup.

### Weaknesses
Perhaps one ablation that wasn't done is length generalization. The authors claim that "our pre-trained model can extrapolate to any sequence length", and theoretical justification is sound, but it would be good to see empirical evidence.

Perhaps more configurations could be tried like different attention mechanisms for different heads or alternating layers.

### Questions
Does the method scale further? Is it easy to parallelize on multiple devices or even longer sequence lengths?

Were there any investigations into what type of global information is being propagated. Perhaps by looking at attention scores?

### Summary
Summary:

The paper proposes SPADE (State sPace AugmenteD TransformEr), a novel approach for efficient long sequence modeling. SPADE integrates a state space model (SSM) into the bottom layer of a Transformer architecture, which enhances global information processing. This is complemented by local attention methods in the upper layers to handle local dependencies. The proposed method addresses the limitations of existing attention variants that struggle with long-range dependencies and computational inefficiency. SPADE demonstrates improved performance on the Long Range Arena benchmark and various language modeling tasks. The architecture allows SPADE to scale efficiently and outperform baselines in both natural language understanding and generation tasks, with the additional benefit of being able to handle longer sequences than it was trained on due to the SSM's extrapolation capabilities.

### Strengths
Advantages:

 - Integration of State Space Models: SPADE incorporates a state space model into the bottom layer of the architecture, providing a strong structural bias for augmenting global information and addressing long-range dependency issues present in local attention methods​.

 - Performance on Benchmarks: SPADE outperforms existing approaches (arguably marginally) on the Long Range Arena benchmark, specifically designed to assess models' ability to handle long sequences​.

 - Efficiency and Speed: In autoregressive language modeling tasks, SPADE is significantly faster and more performant than the vanilla Transformer model​.

### Weaknesses
Disadvantages:

 - Incremental Performance Gain: In the experiments, the performance gain compared to previous (truncated) transformer approaches are quite limited. I view the proposed method as a novel position encoding mechanism, expecting to see the comparison of it against vanilla/truncated Transformers with more advanced position encodings, such as Rotary embeddings, ALiBi and/or Transformer-XL.


### Questions
I feel more confused than amazed about the fact that while SSM alone cannot build a successful language model, using it (as a replacement of the position encoding) along with truncated (windowed/chunked) Transformer will simply result in an efficient long-term dependency capturing mechanism. I would appreciate it if the authors can conduct some ablation study to show that the inferior versions of SSM are, while still computationally efficient, not capable enough to support the dependency-capturing capabilities in language modeling, compared to the proposed SPADE.

### Summary
Authors propose to augment the Transformer with SSM models to achieve better performance from computational and memory consumption perspectives. 

Experiments show that such architecture outperforms selected baselines on language modeling tasks and on Long Range Arena datasets. Furthermore, the authors showed that such a model could be successfully utilized for pre-training and fine-tuning, as shown in Section 5.

### Strengths
- The paper is well-motivated and solved task is important for the field.

- The paper is mostly well-written except for some flaws described in the weaknesses Section.

### Weaknesses
 - My main concern for this paper is the lack of baselines. Including a comparison with other recent SSMs, such as S5 [1] or Hyena [2], would be highly beneficial.
- The abovementioned models could be incorporated with SPADE by replacing the SSM module with any other model. However, it would be beneficial to understand whether the performance gap between SPADE and S4 is caused by adding Transformer blocks on top of the SSM module. Training SPADE with Hyena may not improve performance over Hyena while being better than SPADE with S4. In this case, the motivation for the paper will disappear.
- I struggled to understand which SSM was used in SPADE (did I miss it?). It should be S4 based on the text. However, it would be helpful to name it in Section 3.2 explicitly.
- The paper lacks reproducibility despite an extensive description of training within the text since no supplementary material with source code was released.
