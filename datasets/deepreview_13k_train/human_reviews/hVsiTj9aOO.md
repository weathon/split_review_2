# Improved Variational Bayesian Phylogenetic Inference using Mixtures

- Decision: Reject
- Scores: 3, 6, 6, 6

## Abstract
We present VBPI-Mixtures, an algorithm designed to enhance the accuracy of phylogenetic posterior distributions, particularly for tree-topology and branch-length approximations. Despite the Variational Bayesian Phylogenetic Inference (VBPI), a leading-edge black-box variational inference (BBVI) framework, achieving remarkable approximations of these distributions, the multimodality of the tree-topology posterior presents a formidable challenge to sampling-based learning techniques such as BBVI. Advanced deep learning methodologies such as normalizing flows and graph neural networks have been explored to refine the branch-length posterior approximation, yet efforts to ameliorate the posterior approximation over tree topologies have been lacking. Our novel VBPI-Mixtures algorithm bridges this gap by harnessing the latest breakthroughs in mixture learning within the BBVI domain. As a result, VBPI-Mixtures is capable of capturing distributions over tree-topologies that VBPI fails to model. We deliver state-of-the-art performance on difficult density estimation tasks across numerous real phylogenetic datasets.

### Summary
The authors tackle the problem of inferring the posterior over phylogenetic trees given a Bayesian model as well as nucleotide sequence data. The authors approach this from a Variational Inference perspective and seek to enhance existing VI techniques by combining advances in mixture-based Black Box VI methods with advances in modeling phylogenetic trees using subsplit Bayes Nets. Combining these two methods gives numerous advantages such as the ability to better model multimodal posteriors using mixtures as well as the ability to model correlations between different subsplits.

The authors have provided a mathematical derivation of the gradient update equation for their variational approximation and shown how this can be computed in a stable manner. Further, experimental results confirm that the new methods produces better marginal log likelihood on standard phylogenetic datasets.

### Strengths
The authors have motivated the problem quite well in terms of why they chose to combine mixture-based VI methods with subsplit Bayesian networks for modeling phylogenetic data.

The mathematical derivations seem sound and the authors seem to be well aware of recent advances in VI for estimating stable gradients which tends to be very important.

I fully understood the paper and all the key points made without any background in phylogenetics. Although I did have to read some primers on phylogenetics to fully understand what these trees represented and what things like a "clade" meant. However, the focus of this paper is not so much on phylogenetics and more on VI, so it would be of relevance to the audience of this conference.

### Weaknesses
The work seems to lack in technical depth. The main gradient update equations for VI which are the crux of this paper follow quite naturally from prior work on mixtures in VI. Equation 6, for example follows directly from prior work. All of the observations made in this paper about the advantage of using a mixture in VI are from prior work.

The derivation in equation 9 does seem somewhat new and this is perhaps the only thing that I couldn't directly pin on a prior paper. However, I didn't see any technical issues in going from equation 6 to equation 9.

The analysis in the experiments fail to convince an outsider to phylogenetics. I see that there is a claim of better marginal log likelihood. First of all, it is not clarified whether this improvement is observed on held-out test data. More importantly, there is no demonstrated improvement in accuracy, say, on a downstream phylogenetic task. In other words, it is not possible to estimate how valuable this contribution is to the field of phylogenetics.

### Questions
Is there a downstream task on which the better posteriors of the phylogenetic trees can be demonstrated to have an effect?

Have the authors considered other approaches to model multimodal posteriors such as Stein Variational Inference? https://arxiv.org/abs/1608.04471

Why does the paper use the terminology KL (p || q) in the figures and in the text rather than KL (q || p)? The latter is more common in VI and the paper also seems to be using the latter since all the expectations are taken with respect to to q. In the toy example, I agree that KL(p||q) could be computed, but I would still suggest to report KL(q||p) as well.

The paper claims the following, "Mixtures of SBNs allow for modeling correlations in the sampling of the partitions, and thus increase the flexibility of the approximation." Now, I understand the claim in terms of increasing the flexibility of the approximation, but I do not understand (lacking any phylogenetics background) as to why this flexibility is important in phylogenetics. A very native reader like myself might ask why two disjoint parts of the phylogenetics tree don't evolve independently?

### Summary
A black-box variational inference algorithm with mixture variational posteriors is proposed to solve the Bayesian phylogenetic inference task. Motivation and detailed derivation of the method are presented and the proposed method achieves state of the art performance on real phylogenetics datasets.

### Strengths
- The presentation of the paper is excellent. The appropriate amount of details are given to help the reader understand the method clearly.
- The experimental sections are comprehensive, presenting good results with multiple reasonable baselines to compare against.

### Weaknesses
 - The method that the paper presents is a fairly straightforward application of preexisting methods (MISELBO, VIMCO) to a specific class of problems, which suggests a minor lack in the novelty of the work.
- The authors put a lot of emphasis on the claim that "the components [of the mixture] jointly explore the tree-topology space." I find that to be a weak statement. If the resulting ELBO is better, one would naturally expect the mixture components to be different, because otherwise it would not have any representational advantage over the single-component method. I think it would be more interesting and meaningful to explore more deeply what the individual components are trying to capture.

### Questions
- In section 3.1.1, "we conclude that extending the VIMCO estimator to S > 1 cannot be trivially achieved without our derivation provided above," what exactly do you mean by this?

### Summary
This paper derives variational inference Monte Carlo objectives for fitting deep mixture models to phylogenetic tree data. This enables testing mixtures of subsplit Bayesian nets to approximate distributions over the tree topology space, and favorable comparison to existing methods that are unable to leverage the benefits of mixture distributions.

### Strengths
The experimental validation is thorough, and the careful derivation of the VIMCO objectives is sound. The relationship to existing work is also made clear.

### Weaknesses
The clarity of the paper could be significantly improved. For example, figures refer to DS4, DS7, and DS8 whereas a specific and simpler example might help a reader better understand the method. The use of these dataset identifiers, without sufficient context or explanation, makes it difficult to grasp the practical implications of the method. A more pedagogical approach, perhaps using a synthetic dataset or a well-established, easily understood example, would greatly enhance the accessibility of the paper. Similarly, Figure 3 is difficult to read -- perhaps separating the target distribution into a separate plot from the learned approximate posteriors could help clarify this. The current overlay of these distributions makes it hard to visually discern the quality of the approximation. Furthermore, the motivation and examples (perhaps even Figure 1) could be expanded to use cases that could include e.g. syntax trees; programming languages; models of mathematics. This would ensure the work is of broader interest than just to the phylogenetic inference community. The current focus on phylogenetic trees limits the perceived applicability of the method, and exploring its potential in other domains would strengthen the paper's impact.

### Questions
I am curious how the variance of the gradients compares across different numbers of samples of the importance-sampled objective. Perhaps including a plot of this could help guide practitioners to understand the trade-offs of the difficulty of implementing this method versus a single-sample variational objective.

### Summary
The paper introduces VBPI-Mixtures, an algorithm designed to enhance the accuracy of phylogenetic posterior distributions, particularly for tree-topology and branch-length approximations. The paper utilizesadvanced deep learning methodologies such as normalizing flows and graph neural networks to  a leading-edge black-box variational inference (BBVI) framework, Variational Bayesian Phylogenetic Inference (VBPI). The VBPI-Mixtures algorithm bridges this gap by harnessing the latest breakthroughs in mixture learning within the BBVI domain. As a result, VBPI-Mixtures algorithm is  capable of capturing distributions over tree-topologies that VBPI fails to model. On the experimental side, the paper empirically validates that a single-component approximation will struggle to properly model all parts
of the target distribution when learned with black-bo. Additionally, the paper substantiates that the various mixture components cooperate to collectively encompass the target density. In addition, the paper demonstrates that the increased model flexibility and promotion of exploration translates into better marginal log-likelihood estimates and more accurate tree-topology posterior approximations.

### Strengths
* VBPI-Mixtures is a new algorithm for Bayesian phylogenetics.
* The paper shows that Mixtures of subsplit Bayesian nets (SBNs) can approximate distributions that a single SBN cannot, making a persuasive case for VBPI-Mixtures.
* A VIMCO gradient estimator is derived for mixtures.
* VBPI-Mixtures achieve a slightly better results than previous on eight popular real phylogenetics datasets,

### Weaknesses
 * The mixture approximation for variational posterior has been already used in previous works on VAE. Therefore, the novelty is restricted to the application of Phylogenetic Inference.
* Although the usage of Normalizing Flow could lead to an improvement in performance, they are not new in the VI context. Similar to the mixture approximation, they could be new in the application of Phylogenetic Inference.
* The improvement in NLL compared to other baselines in Table 2 is not significant. Furthermore, the paper does not provide a clear analysis of the computational cost associated with the proposed method. This makes it hard to evaluate its practical applicability. For instance, the computational cost of training and inference with the mixture model, especially with an increasing number of components, should be analyzed in detail. It is unclear if the slight improvement in NLL justifies the potential increase in computational resources.

### Questions
* It is not convincing to me to say that the proposed methods give a clear benefit in performance than other baselines. Could the paper include new experiments on new datasets or provide other benefits of the algorithm e.g., computational time, memory, etc?
