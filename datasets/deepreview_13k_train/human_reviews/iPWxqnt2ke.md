# Identifying Policy Gradient Subspaces

- Decision: Accept
- Scores: 8, 6, 6, 6

## Abstract
Policy gradient methods hold great potential for solving complex continuous control tasks.
Still, their training efficiency can be improved by exploiting structure within the optimization problem.
Recent work indicates that supervised learning can be accelerated by leveraging the fact that gradients lie in a low-dimensional and slowly-changing subspace. 
In this paper, we conduct a thorough evaluation of this phenomenon for two popular deep policy gradient methods on various simulated benchmark tasks.
Our results demonstrate the existence of such \emph{gradient subspaces} despite the continuously changing data distribution inherent to reinforcement learning.
These findings reveal promising directions for future work on more efficient reinforcement learning, e.g., through improving parameter-space exploration or enabling second-order optimization.

### Summary
**EDIT: After the rebuttal, I am raising my score. The authors have promised that they have included additional explanations in the paper (and will add the rest) along with some experiments that they are running, and have modified the abstract to clearly specify the scope of this paper. With these additions, I feel that this paper can be a worthwhile addition to this conference.**

The paper empirically analyzes two popular policy gradient methods (PPO and SAC) on standard RL benchmark tasks and demonstrates (for the first time, to the best of my knowledge) that the actor and critic gradients lie in a tiny subspace (containing about 1% of the original network parameters) and that this subspace changes very slowly. Similar knowledge, as the paper discusses, about the gradients of neural networks in supervised learning have already resulted in various methods to improve training. This paper has the potential to result in similar advances for RL.

I propose a weak accept for this paper because 
(0) The findings seem novel and can have a positive impact on PG algorithm development
(1) I find the empirical methods of this paper ad-hoc and not well justified; and
(2) Many empirical details are missing (although, maybe they are all minor details, and I'm over-estimating their importance, especially since the authors released their code);

Note to the authors: I have a limited experience in deep learning, and as such my knowledge of most of the references and the methods employed in this paper is very limited. So if you feel that I don't understand the significance of your analysis, I would appreciate if you could point it out in your rebuttal (and finally in the revised paper). Thanks!

### Strengths
**Originality and significance:** The paper (empirically) shows that for the first time that policy gradients (and the critic gradients) of the widely popular deep RL methods (PPO and SAC) lie in a very tiny subspace and this subspace remains somewhat stable during the course of learning. This result is interesting in itself as it gives us additional insights into the deep RL methods. Further, such a result can have significant implications on developing policy gradient methods, as outlined by the authors: Since deep learning methods often have a large number of parameters, this paper's insights can speed up existing RL methods by restricting optimization to a small fraction of those parameters. It can also result in better exploration techniques.

**Quality and clarity:** The paper does a great job of outlining existing research: it's literature survey and references to relevant works is very thorough. The main ideas of the paper themselves are presented in an easy to follow manner, complemented by clear graphs and intuitive explanations. The writing itself is free from any grammatical mistakes (which is uncommon in the papers I have reviewed; so that is nice!).

### Weaknesses
# Major issues (these affect my score significantly):

The major weakness of the paper is a lack of rigor and concrete results.

## 1. There is a very weak link between the experimental results and the claims made in the paper: ##

(a) For example, see the following claims of the paper:
- Section 1 (last paragraph): "(i) parameter-space directions with significantly larger curvature exist in PG": --> why can we say that the curvature is significantly larger? Figure 1 is highly qualitative in nature. In fact, Figure 2 is essentially qualitative as well. (And larger than what?)
- Section 1 (last paragraph): "(iii) the subspace is sufficiently stable to be useful for training" --> how do the experiments justify the sufficiency? As far as I understand, Figure 3 only shows that the magnitude of the largest eigenvector projected to the subspace is, say, 0.4 for most part of the learning. What does 0.4 mean? How does that imply sufficient stability for learning based on methods that make updates in this subspace?
- Section 1 (last paragraph): "observe that the value function subspace often exhibits less variability and retains a larger portion of its gradient compared to the PG subspace" --> inconclusive (Figure 2 shows very similar trends for actor and critic)

(b) The results for the paper are specifically for well-tuned PPO and SAC agents on specific RL benchmarks, while the conclusions are drawn for general results. For instance, can we be sure that the subspace would also exist for a random hyperparameter configuration? The existence of subspace is even more important for a wide range of hyperparameters, since we won't know the optimal choice apriori for a random problem. Would the subspace be as restricted (for instance a dimensionality of 0.1% of the total parameter values) for a random SAC agent?

(c) Section 4.3 (paragraph 3): "Similar to the gradient subspace fraction results from Section 4.2, the subspace overlap is more pronounced for the critic than the actor." --> why? Are the scales comparable for the actor and critic graphs in Figure 3? Is this "extra" overlap really useful for designing algorithms? (Maybe it is, but without any explanations or additional experiments, this information is just speculative.)

## 2. There is no rigorous motivation about various metrics used: ##
It seems that the paper adopted the metrics from Gur-Ari et al. (2018) for its experiments. However, these metrics seem somewhat arbitrary, and it is unclear how they relate to the usefulness/existence of the gradient subspace.

(a) Gradient subspace fraction (Eq. 5) seems uninformative. Why showing that the gradient norm in the projected subspace is similar to the original gradient norm helpful? For instance, from the [Johnson-Lindenstrauss lemma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johnson%E2%80%93Lindenstrauss_lemma) we know that any random projection matrix will ensure that the projected gradient norm is not too far away from the actual gradient norm. My point being, the metric in Eq. 5 doesn't seem to be useful right away. Maybe one way to make it more informative would be to establish a scale (so compare the norm of the projected gradient to the Hessian eigenvector subspace and the norm of the gradient projected to random subspaces).

(b) Subspace overlap (Eq. 7): This metric is very complicated and I don't clearly see why it helps with showing the stability of the subspace and what that means for restricting training there. Maybe additional references could help with this.

## 3. Missing details about the implementations: ##

I give some examples below:
- Section 4.3 (the equation for S_overlap): what is $k$ in the experiments? Does $k$ change with $t$ in the graph?
- Section 4.3: "where $v_i$ is the ith largest eigenvector at timestep t" --> how is the largest eigenvector determined? Is it by the size of the corresponding eigenvalue?
- Section 4 (paragraph 2): This section is unclear and doesn't provide sufficient details for reproduction (I understand the code does that, but without some details, the paper's results are very difficult to reason about). For instance, SAC usually has multiple Q networks; which ones do the experiments analyze?
- Page 6, Figure 2: I was not able to understand the difference between the three categories: "Estimated/true" gradient, "estimated/true" Hessian, and why does that matter (probably Hessian is used to find the projection matrix $P_k$; if so, please explicitly mention it somewhere)? For instance, why do we care about estimated gradients? I understand that estimated Hessian can be important because we will use it to identify the policy gradient subspace and then use it downstream in algorithms. Some more justification about this could be nice.
- Page 6 (first paragraph): Why was 2%, 0.14%, and 0.07% chosen? These seem highly arbitrary choices. How do the trends change when these numbers are changed?
- Page 5: cutoffs for Equation 6 seem arbitrary.

# Minor issues / suggestions (these do not affect my score as much; please ignore them if you don't agree):
- The abstract seems incomplete/misleading in its present form, and it overclaims the contributions of the paper. For instance, it says "we demonstrate the existence of such gradient subspaces for policy gradient algorithms." While this is not technically wrong to say that, the paper only empirically shows these subspaces, and that too for a very limited class of algorithms, i.e. deep policy gradient methods (in fact just two algorithms PPO and SAC). This could be easily rectified, for instance, by including this line from the introduction: "This paper conducts a comprehensive empirical evaluation of gradient subspaces in the context of PG algorithms, assessing their properties across various simulated RL benchmarks." Further, the line "Our findings reveal promising directions for more efficient reinforcement learning, e.g., through improving parameter-space exploration or enabling second-order optimization." seems to be suggesting that the paper also introduces methods for exploiting these subspaces, whereas that is just suggestion for future research.
- The appendices are not properly referenced anywhere in the paper. At the very least, each section of the appendix should be referenced at the appropriate place in the main paper, explaining what additional details are there. Currently, appendices are a dump of graphs with no accompanying textual explanations (other than the caption). 
- Do you think the "LoRA: Low-Rank Adaptation of Large Language Models" (https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.09685) paper could be added to the related works section as well?
- In Section 3.1: can $\gamma$ be 1? Is the setting episodic? 
- In Section 3.1 (paragraph 2): The phrase, "expected cumulative reward" could be replaced by "expected (discounted) cumulative reward"
- In Section 3.1 (paragraph 2): "advantage function ... and can also be defined as" --> why say "can also be defined as"? Isn't that the definition of advantage function? Maybe rephrase the sentence..
- Section 3.2, first line: Maybe give a reference for the objective function $J(\theta)$? 
- Section 3.2, first line: Also, the definition of the expectation is unclear: in particular, in its current form, the expression $J = \mathbb{E}[ \pi(a_t | s_t) \hat A_t]$ seems to depend on the timestep $t$. That shouldn't be the case..
- Section 3.2, first paragraph: What "estimator of advantage function" is being used? It is not specified.  
- Section 3.2, first paragraph (above equation 2): what is the target value for the critic?
- Section 3.3 (above Eq. 4): "exponential of the learned Q-function" --> isn't saying something like a Gibbs distribution or softmax distribution more appropriate?
- Figure 2: since the "true gradient" is just the gradient computed using more state-action pairs, maybe calling it "true" is not accurate?

### Questions
I would really appreciate if the authors could clarify the following points (please refer to the Weaknesses section for details):

1(b) Is my understanding correct here? Would these conclusions continue to hold for randomly chosen hyperparameters?

2(a) Why can Eq. 5 helpful? How would the projections on random subspaces look like?

### Rating

### Rating Number

### Confidence
2: You are willing to defend your assessment, but it is quite likely that you did not understand the central parts of the submission or that you are unfamiliar with some pieces of related work. Math/other details were not carefully checked.

### Summary
The papers verifies experimentally the existence of gradient subspace in reinforcement learning in the on-policy algorithm PPO and off-policy algorithm SAC.

### Strengths
Current literature on identifying gradient subspace focus on supervised learning, and related work in RL focus on identifying parameter subspace rather than gradient subspace. Therefore, this work is the first to identify gradient subspace in the context of RL and is informative for training RL algorithms. Project codes are provided for reproducibility.

### Weaknesses
It is unclear to which extent the contribution of identifying gradient subspace comparing to existing works in RL that focus on identifying parameter subspace (e.g. Gaya et al 2023 in the references) is significant, since both approaches have the same goal of improving training efficiency of policy parameters. While the paper identifies a gradient subspace, it does not clearly articulate how this subspace offers unique advantages over parameter subspaces for improving training efficiency. The connection between the identified gradient subspace and its utility in guiding parameter exploration or enabling second-order optimization remains vague. The paper lacks a clear justification for focusing on the gradient subspace rather than parameter space, especially given the existing literature on parameter subspace methods.

It is also not clear how the identified gradient subspace can be practically used to improve policy gradient methods. The paper mentions that the gradient subspace could be used for guiding parameter-space exploration or enabling second-order optimization, but these remain as high-level ideas without concrete implementation details or experimental validation. It is not clear whether the identified gradient subspace would be robust to changes in the environment or task, and whether the identified subspace would be stable during the training process. The paper does not provide any experiments that demonstrate the practical benefits of using the identified gradient subspace for improving the training efficiency of RL algorithms, or compare the performance with existing parameter subspace methods.

### Questions
- Could you elaborate in more detail the motivation of identifying gradient subspace in comparison to parameter subspace, for the goal of guiding parameter-space exploration? This seems to be overlapping with Gaya et al. 2023's claimed benefit of identifying parameter subspace and it is not clear there what would be the benefits of using gradient subspace instead of parameter subspace in that case.
- Is it possible to experimentally verify in a realistic example that the methods of Gaya et al. fail and the methods in current paper succeed?

### Summary
Previous literature demonstrated that the gradient in supervised learning could be dominated by some of several high-curvature subspaces. Inspired by this, the authors investigate whether that is true in policy gradient methods and find that similar phenomena appears in both PPO and SAC by checking the gradient subspace fraction. Moreover, the authors demonstrate that these high-curvature subspaces remain stable across the training process with empirical results.

### Strengths
- The paper is clearly presented and easy-to-follow, the motivation and the methodology are clearly described.
- The work has demonstrated that the subspace exists in policy gradient methods as well, similar to what people have discovered in the supervised learning setup. This is done by relatively comprehensive experiments including different approaches to estimate the policy gradient and Hessian matrix and consider both the policy model and the critic model.
- The authors also discuss how to leverage the insights to improve RL algorithms such as subspace-based optimization or parameter-space exploration.

### Weaknesses
One of the perspectives to make the paper stronger and more convincing is to show the unique conclusion and domain-specific insight for policy gradient learning, since most of the conclusions actually come from the gradient subspace paper under a supervised learning setup. The paper's analysis, while thorough, largely replicates findings from supervised learning within a reinforcement learning context without sufficiently highlighting novel aspects specific to policy gradient methods. For instance, the observation of high-curvature subspaces dominating the gradient is not unique to RL, and the paper does not delve deeply enough into the nuances of how these subspaces manifest differently in policy optimization compared to supervised learning. The current discussion of leveraging these insights for RL, such as subspace-based optimization or parameter-space exploration, remains somewhat generic and does not provide concrete, RL-specific examples or adaptations. The paper would benefit from a more detailed exploration of how these subspaces interact with the unique challenges of RL, such as non-stationarity and delayed rewards.


### Questions
One of the perspectives to make the paper stronger and more convincing is to show the unique conclusion of the policy gradient since this is an extension of the gradient subspace in the supervised learning setup. I could imagine more in-depth discussion in the paper could be helpful. For instances:

- Investigate and explain why the PPO/on-policy method has a much lower gradient fraction in Figure 2, and how much of this is due to the data distribution shift.

 - Have more experiments/configurations in Figure 2 to make the conclusion and discussion more sound, for instance, whether the PPO low gradient fraction is consistent across more RL tasks or not.

 - Have demonstrative experiments to explore one of the potential RL applications (using the insight obtained from this experiment) to make it more convincing that these insights will be helpful for RL training.

### Summary
The authors investigate the *existence* of gradient subspaces in policy gradient algorithms. More specifically, they conduct an empirical campaign on two relevant methods (i.e., PPO and SAC) to verify that there exist directions with high curvature spanning a subspace that stays relatively stable throughout the training and that contains the gradient. To this end, the authors propose several numerical setups that verify such an existence. All experiments are conducted both for the actor and the critic gradients. Finally, the authors discuss how the existence of these subspaces could be used in practice to advance the state-of-the-art in policy search algorithms.

### Strengths
- The existence of gradient subspaces has gathered consistent attention in the supervised learning community. This work aims to empirically show that such subspaces exist in RL as well. Given the numerous challenges that are introduced in RL, the existence of gradient subspaces is not trivial. In this sense, the work done by the authors aims at filling this gap within the literature, and, therefore, I retain it to be interesting for the community. 

- The paper is well-written. The main concepts and idea are easy to understand.

### Weaknesses
1. The contribution of the paper is focused on the **empirical existence** of gradient subspaces. Although the authors, in Section 5, discuss how the existence of this sub-space could be leveraged in practice, it remains an open question to provide empirical evidence of these eventual benefits. The discussion in Section 5 is largely speculative, lacking concrete connections to existing algorithms or clear proposals for new methods. The paper would be strengthened by demonstrating how the identified subspaces can be practically utilized to improve policy gradient methods, rather than just postulating potential uses.

2. **Limited experimental campaign**. It has to be noticed that the contributions of this paper are only empirical. As a consequence, I would have expected more experiments to prove the empirical existence of these sub-spaces. Results are limited to 6 domains (i.e., Finger-spin, Ball_in_cup, Ant, HalfCheetah, Pendulum, Walker2D). The choice of these environments, while diverse, does not fully cover the spectrum of challenges in RL. For example, environments with sparse rewards or high-dimensional observation spaces are not adequately represented. A more comprehensive evaluation, including a wider range of environments with varying complexities, would be necessary to establish the generality of the findings.

3. **Clarity and writing (minor)**. I would encourage the authors to introduce and follow a more rigorous and formal definition of the elements that are used in the paper (e.g., subspace and so on). All the discussion is, indeed, rather informal. The lack of formal definitions makes it difficult to precisely interpret the results and to build upon this work in future research. For instance, the term 'high curvature' is used without a clear quantitative definition, and the precise method for identifying the subspace is not rigorously described.
