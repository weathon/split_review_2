# Meta-Evolve: Continuous Robot Evolution for One-to-many Policy Transfer

- Decision: Accept
- Scores: 5, 8, 6, 5

## Abstract
We investigate the problem of transferring an expert policy from a source robot to multiple different robots.
To solve this problem, we propose a method named \emph{Meta-Evolve} that uses continuous robot evolution to efficiently transfer the policy to each target robot through a set of tree-structured evolutionary robot sequences.
The robot evolution tree allows the robot evolution paths to be shared, so our approach can significantly outperform naive one-to-one policy transfer.
We present a heuristic approach to determine an optimized robot evolution tree.
Experiments have shown that our method is able to improve the efficiency of one-to-three transfer of manipulation policy by up to 3.2$\times$ and one-to-six transfer of agile locomotion policy by 2.4$\times$ in terms of simulation cost over the baseline of launching multiple independent one-to-one policy transfers.

### Summary
The paper presents a novel method for transfer learning of policies from one source robot to multiple target robots. In other to achieve this, the authors extend HERD (and REvolveR) with a novel robot kinematic evolution tree that is based on Steiner Trees. The experiments showcase that the proposed method performs better than HERD and other baselines in several experiments.

### Strengths
- The idea is using p-Steiner trees to represent the robot kinematic evolution tree is interesting, intuitive, simple and seems effective.
- The method clearly accelerates transfer learning compared to the baselines provided.
- The paper is generally well-written and the main messages are effectively conveyed.

### Weaknesses
 - My main concern is the practicality of the proposed method. In other words, how can this be used in real(ish) world applications? I explain further:
    - First, as the name suggests the method explores in the kinematic space of the robots. What happens if the dynamics differ drastically? An example would be, having a robot that has the same kinematic structure but twice the masses. Can the method handle this? It seems that no. Isn't changing the dynamics but keeping the kinematics the same a different robot? I think this deserves more intuition and explanation.
    - Then, I am not sure how we should interpret the additional experiments on commercial robots. I cannot see the added value of those experiments and how they contribute towards convincing us that the method is applicable to real-world situations/robots. The robots are purely position-controlled and the behaviors are quite simple.
    - Lastly, the comments on Sim2Real are weak imho. I do not see why the paper is not relevant to Sim2Real methods. The paper/method claims one to many policy transfer with *different dynamics* involved (per robot).
- The authors have chosen to consider a model-free approach to RL/transfer learning, while obviously the models are known (at least the kinematics part). This choice should be better motivated and highlighted in the text.
- **One of the videos is not properly anonymized; we can clearly see the face of someone performing the experiments.** Is this part of the video part of the DexYCB dataset? If this is the case, it should have been highlighted. If not (and the one performing the experiments is one of the authors), the AC should take a position on this as I am not sure if this is allowed by ICLR regulations.

### Questions
1) How can the proposed method handle significant dynamics differences between the source and target robots? Can it even do that?
2) How does the proposed method fit inside the Sim2Real literature?
3) How can the proposed method integrate model-based RL/learning? Why did the authors not experiment with this?

### Summary
In Meta-Evolve: Continuous Robot Evolution for One-to-many Policy Transfer, the authors introduce a novel method of policy transfer which they claim is able to improve the efficiency of policy transfer between robots when multiple recipient bodies are involved, by performing policy transfer along an “evolutionary” line of intermediary bodies. Using “kinematic tree matching” and some geometric heuristics (based on Steiner trees), they are able to identify bodies which can be used in the paths of multiple recipients, reducing the total number of bodies where training is needed to enable the policy transfer. They demonstrate significant increases in efficiency over alternative methods which do not use such intermediates.

### Strengths
The paper is very well written with nice graphical explanations of the technique and clear and well reasoned theoretical work. The authors were careful to make sure that the technical details were written unambiguously and the descriptions of the underlying mathematics were excellent. The results of the work seem compelling and are well described.

### Weaknesses
It is not obvious to me, as someone who does not deal much with the realm of physical robots, how common the problem addressed in this paper is—my uninformed guess would be that it is not so common, but the technique does not suffer much for this. It is not obvious that the work has much to do with evolution, in either the biological or computational senses, except in its use of trees which are reminiscent of the tree of life. It is also not obvious why the word “meta” was chosen, especially given that it has other connotations in Reinforcement Learning. It is not established within the paper how efficacious the kinematic tree matching methods are—although it seems to be good enough at transferring, it would be interesting to see how this matching deals with adverse cases. The number of training runs in the experiments was quite small, with only 5 random seeds. It would have been better to see a higher-quality evaluation of the method, but the presented results seem clear. It is also not obvious why some of the thresholds in the evaluation were selected, and it would be interesting to see if a change from 80% to 70% or 90% would change the order of the methods. I suspect that it would not, but the choice of selecting a single threshold leaves the question open. It is also concerning that the ablation study of the Steiner tree variants was not performed on all of the tasks, and it is unclear why the 1-Steiner tree was the only one attempted in the door task. Finally, it is concerning that the authors do not have a good explanation for why their method outperformed HERD in the one-to-one transfer case on the Hammer task, as this could indicate that the method's performance is not due to the intended mechanism.

### Questions
1. How common is the problem addressed by this paper, of transferring an effective policy from one robot morphology to multiple others at once?
2. Why was the only the 1-Steiner tree attempted in the door task?
3. Why were so few seeds used for the results?
4. Why was the value of 80% selected?
5. Did the authors consider the relationship between the reduction in the total length of the paths in the graph (as compared to independent paths) and the reduction in the training time? Were these correlated?
6. Why wasn’t DAPG run to completion? How effectively was it able to perform the task, given that it did not complete in the time provided?
7. Do the authors have any comments on why (e.g. in the Hammer task, on path 8-10-11) their outperformed HERD on one-to-one transfer?

### Summary
The paper discusses the Meta-Evolve method, which aims to transfer expert policies from a source robot to multiple target robots. The paper introduces a new research problem and proposes a solution that utilizes continuous robot evolution and a robot evolution tree. The experiments conducted on hand manipulation tasks and agile locomotion tasks show that Meta-Evolve outperforms one-to-one policy transfer baselines. Ablation studies and discussions on handling different target robots and learning or optimizing the evolution tree are also presented. Overall, the paper highlights the effectiveness of Meta-Evolve in inter-robot policy transfer and suggests areas for future research.

### Strengths
The paper highlights the effectiveness of Meta-Evolve in inter-robot policy transfer, as demonstrated through experiments on hand manipulation tasks and agile locomotion tasks (very interesting). The results show that Meta-Evolve outperforms one-to-one policy transfer baselines in terms of training and simulation costs.

### Weaknesses
The experiments are mainly limited to hand manipulation tasks, which can be easily represented by tree structures. Does your main idea still works on modular robots (like 3d voxel-based robot)?

### Summary
This paper introduces a method to perform expert policy transfer from one robot to many other robots of different morphology. As opposed to previous works, this method defines a tree structure that finds a meta-robot to act as an intermediary fine-tuning platform before the policy is transferred to a target robot (i.e. finding a common robot-morphology ancestor in the robot evolution tree). This robot evolution tree allows for faster transfer between source and target robots because the policy only needs to be transferred to the meta robot once, as opposed to N times (as with previous methods). The paper experiments on several transfer tasks, including manipulation tasks where the morphology of the robotic hand changes from source to target.

### Strengths
This paper is clearly written and motivates the problem well. This method exposes clear gaps in the literature regarding and proposes a simple and novel method that can improve the sample efficiency of existing robot-robot transfer methods. Additionally, the authors propose an interpretable way to measure the distance between robot hardware morphologies in equation (3). 

Mainly, the authors' proposal of an ancestral meta-robot common to all target robots is an interesting idea worth exploring. It is clear from the results reported in the paper that this idea speeds up training time/simulation time.

### Weaknesses
There are several weakness in the paper that I think need to be addressed.

1.
-  In section 3.2, the authors discuss kinematic tree matching between robots with similar kinematic structures. However, I am concerned that they are claiming that just because two robots share a similar kinematic tree, that they also share a similar expert policy. In my understanding, the kinematic tree matching would relate a pair of robots with 2 fingers and 3 fingers more closely than a pair robot with 2 fingers and 4 fingers. However, it very well may be the case that a robot with 2 fingers will act more similarly to a robot with 4 fingers than one with 3 fingers.
- Further, the convex hull of robot hardwares might be irrelevant if the robots close in hardware-space are far in policy space

2. I am curious about the method the authors use to actually train the policies on the new robots. The description of generating new robots is clear but the method for actually transferring the policies is not.

3. I am concerned about the notion of neural plasticity in this problem. Simply fine-tuning the policy more times might lead to the degredation in performance that we see in the HERD and REvolveR methods

4. The authors do not demonstrate the quality of the new policies. I know they are training to achieve some specified success rate but I think more experimentation on what the transferred policies are is important to discuss in this paper

### Questions
1. How does changing the morphplogy of a robot affect the optimal policy?
2. How are the authors training the new policies on the new robots?
3. Does the simple fact that the authors are fine-tuning the same policy more times on the baselines lead to poor performance?
4. Can you please describe quantitatively/qualitatively the quality of the learned target policies between the different methods?
