- Decision: Reject
- Scores: 6, 6, 5, 6

## Abstract
Linear programming has played a crucial role in shaping decision-making, resource allocation, and cost reduction in various domains. In this paper, we investigate the application of overparametrized neural networks and their implicit bias in solving linear programming problems. Specifically, our findings reveal that training diagonal linear networks with gradient descent, while optimizing the squared $L_2$-norm of the slack variable, leads to solutions for entropically regularized linear programming problems. Remarkably, the strength of this regularization depends on the initialization used in the gradient descent process. We analyze the convergence of both discrete-time and continuous-time dynamics and demonstrate that both exhibit a linear rate of convergence, requiring only mild assumptions on the constraint matrix. For the first time, we introduce a comprehensive framework for solving linear programming problems using diagonal neural networks. We underscore the significance of our discoveries by applying them to address challenges in basis pursuit and optimal transport problems.

### Summary
This work looks into the dynamics of gradient descent (or GD) optimization, specifically focusing on the reparameterized GD for linear programmings. By reparameterizing the problem, the author(s) claim to provide a clearer understanding of the implicit bias of GD, particularly how it induces sparsity in solutions. The paper's theoretical contributions demonstrate that this reparameterized GD converges to zero-loss solutions and biases the flow toward solutions with better sparsity properties than conventional vanilla GD. The author support their claims with mathematical proofs and experiments that compare the performance of reparameterized GD with traditional GD and mirror-descent methods, suggesting advantages in terms of sparsity and convergence.

### Strengths
This study's approach, reparameterizing GD for linear programs, offering a novel perspective on the implicit bias of GD. The quality is demonstrated through rigorous mathematical analyses, which include bounding the iterates of the algorithm and characterizing the limit points of the convergence. 

Clarity is another strength, with the paper presenting its methodology and findings in a structured and understandable manner.

### Weaknesses
 - a notable weakness is the limited scope of the experimental setup; their simulation relies on isotropic Gaussian features, which may not be representative of real datasets that often contain features with varying scales and correlations. Moreover, the paper does not discuss the impact of non-Gaussian noise or different initialization schemes, which could potentially affect the generalization of the results
  - can the author provide some results on real-world benchmarks? If conditions permit, I also suggest that the author compare it with sota linear programming algorithms (like some commercial solvers) and plot learning curves of the objective func value decreasing over time t

- the paper's analysis assumes a batch size of $m$, which may not scale well or apply directly to the common practice of using mini-batches. Moreover, the discussion on the impact of step size and batch size on the effective initialization scale is not sufficiently detailed, potentially limiting the applicability of their findings

- while the paper offers a comparison with mirror descent, it may benefit from a broader comparison with other optimization algorithms in the community (empirically, or theoretically) to establish a more comprehensive understanding of its advantages

### Questions
1. In practical applications, mini-batch GD is common; could the authors speculate on how their results might change with the introduction of mini-batches? Could the authors discuss the limitations of their assumptions regarding initialization and step sizes in more technical depth, possibly suggesting how these might be relaxed or generalized?

2. Are there any theoretical insights from the paper that could suggest practical guidelines for tuning hyperparameters (like the step-size) in GD to leverage the sparsity-inducing properties observed in the reparameterized model?

3. The theoretical framework is focused on diagonal linear networks; could the authors discuss the potential challenges and modifications required to extend their framework to deep / non-linear networks?

### Confidence
2: You are willing to defend your assessment, but it is quite likely that you did not understand the central parts of the submission or that you are unfamiliar with some pieces of related work. Math/other details were not carefully checked.

### Summary
The authors prove linear convergence rates for the discrete and continuous versions of gradient on diagonal linear networks. In addition, they show that the continuous and discrete versions converge toward the solution of an entropically regularized linear problem.

### Strengths
The theoretical results are new and elegant, I am not aware of previous results connecting linear programming and diagonal linear networks.

### Weaknesses
 - Section 2.2 and 2.3 are a little bit scientifically "loose", it draws some connections with other methods, but I am not sure there are proper theoretical results that can be extracted from these parts

- Experiments. I understand this is a theoretical paper, but I think the paper would have more impact with more extensive experiments. The current experimental section illustrates the linear convergence of the algorithm and has one comparison to the mirror descent. Maybe the authors could provide an experiment with optimal transport and compare the proposed method to the standard Sinkhorn algorithm

### Questions
- In the experiment section, the authors mention that the theoretical step size found is too conservative. This conservative step size problem can usually be overcome with coordinate descent-like methods, that use a larger coordinate-specific step size. In addition, the authors mention some previous results on coordinate descent for diagonal linear networks. I was wondering if it is possible to extend the theoretical results of the authors to coordinate descent.

### Summary
This manuscript studies the implicit bias of re-parametrized gradient descent in which the macroscopic learning rates are used. By leveraging the characterization of the implicit bias and the convex geometry of a linear program, they prove the linear convergence of GD on the linear regression problem under the quadratic parametrization. Importantly, they make minimal assumptions to prove their results.

### Strengths
The extension of the previous results [1,2] on reparametrized gradient descent/flow under minimal assumptions on data and macroscopic choice of learning rate is a nontrivial result. The analysis under this generality introduces additional complexity, but this work successfully establishes (linear) convergence for this setting.

### Weaknesses
The presentation can be further improved in several ways to enhance clarity and readability:
*  Firstly, I could not follow how the similarity between Algorithm 1 and the Sinkhorn algorithm is used in the paper. 
* Additionally, to the best of my knowledge, the result in [1] proves a similar result in the manuscript in a fairly general setting too. I think it would be helpful for the readers if the authors could elaborate on these points more in their revised manuscript.

Another aspect that requires attention is the lack of characterization of the effect of using large step sizes in the paper. In particular, [1] studies the effect of large step size in the same setting on the generalization; however, this study does not provide insight about the consequence of using large step size.

### Questions
In the experiments, the authors show that for the large step size cases, re-parametrized GD converges faster than the exponentiated gradient algorithm (or mirror descent with the entropy potential). Can they comment on why this is the case and if their results imply anything in that direction?

### Summary
This paper shows that gradient descent on a diagonal linear network (with a quadratic parametrization) under specific initialization leads to an approximate solution to the entropy-regularized solution to a linear programming problem. The convergence results are presented for both gradient flow and gradient descent algorithms.

### Strengths
1. This paper presents a new idea that solves LPs via training a diagonal linear network, which exploits the implicit bias of diagonal networks.
2. linear convergence results are shown for training diagonal linear networks with GD, which is different from what has been established, for example, the results in Vaškevičius et. al. 2019.

### Weaknesses
The main weaknesses are the presentation and the significance of the results, mainly for Theorem 3.4 and 3.5.
1. There needs more discussion on the upper bound $\bar{\eta}$ on the step size, and the linear rate $\rho$ in Theorem 3.4, specifically their dependence on 1) the underlying LP problem $(A,b,c)$, and its scale (# of decision variables, #of constraints, etc.); 2) the initialization $u_0$. For example, if either $A$ is ill-conditioned, or the initialization is close to the origin, then I believe $\rho$ should be close to one. Merely showing that GD converges linearly does not make a significant contribution if what authors propose is to implement this GD algorithm for solving real LP problems. 
2. Theorem 3.5 only shows that the GD converges to some $x^\infty$ that is close to the desired solution to the LP, but the result is weak in the sense that it doesn't suggest an upper bound on the # of GD iterations for achieving certain accuracy. Specifically, the convergence result one expects is that given some $\epsilon>0$, the GD with some step size $\eta(\epsilon)$ takes $T(\epsilon)$ iterations to achieve either 1) $\|x^T-x^*\|\leq \epsilon$, where $x^*$ is the true optimal solution; 2) or the optimality gap is less than $\epsilon$. 
3. Another concern I have is that I don't find, from the discussions and experiments in this paper, any evidence that the proposed algorithm has advantages in solving certain LPs, compared to existing methods.
