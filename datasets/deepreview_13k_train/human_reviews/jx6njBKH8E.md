# Amplifying Training Data Exposure through Fine-Tuning with Pseudo-Labeled Memberships

- Decision: Reject
- Scores: 6, 6, 5, 6

## Abstract
Neural language models (LMs) are vulnerable to training data extraction attacks due to data memorization. This paper introduces a novel attack scenario wherein an attacker adversarially fine-tunes pre-trained LMs to amplify the exposure of the original training data. This strategy differs from prior studies by aiming to intensify the LM's retention of its pre-training dataset. To achieve this, the attacker needs to collect generated texts that are closely aligned with the pre-training data. However, without knowledge of the actual dataset, quantifying the amount of pre-training data within generated texts is challenging. To address this, we propose the use of pseudo-labels for these generated texts, leveraging membership approximations indicated by machine-generated probabilities from the target LM. We subsequently fine-tune the LM to favor generations with higher likelihoods of originating from the pre-training data, based on their membership probabilities. Our empirical findings indicate a remarkable outcome: LMs with over 1B parameters exhibit a four to eight-fold increase in training data exposure. We discuss potential mitigations and suggest future research directions.

### Summary
This work investigates how model fine-tuning may potentially make the models more vulnerable to leaking their pre-train dataset. The authors apply the machine-generated text with more like human-written to fine-tune the language models. Reinforcement learning with self-generation is employed to fine-tune the models. To demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach, the author conducts experiments on six datasets over 6 language models with different amounts of trainable parameters.

### Summary
The paper proposes a new attack strategy to increase the exposure of private training data from pre-trained language models. The main contributions are:
1. The paper introduces a novel scenario where an attacker fine-tunes a pre-trained language model with self-generated texts that are pseudo-labeled based on their machine-generated probabilities. The paper assumes that texts with lower machine-generated probabilities are more likely to contain training data.
2. The paper uses a zero-shot machine-generated text detection method (DetectGPT) to calculate the perturbation discrepancy of each generated text, and a reinforcement learning from human feedback method (RLHF) to fine-tune the target language model to favor texts with lower perturbation discrepancy.
3. The paper evaluates the proposed attack strategy on six versions of the OPT language model and shows that it can amplify the training data exposure by four to eight times compared to the reference models. The paper also analyzes the extracted samples and discusses potential mitigations and future research directions.

### Strengths
1. Originality: The paper introduces a novel attack scenario where an adversary fine-tunes a pre-trained language model to amplify the exposure of its training data. This strategy differs from prior studies by aiming to intensify the model’s retention of its pre-training dataset. The paper also proposes a two-step approach to achieve this goal, involving pseudo-labeling based on machine-generated probabilities and reinforcement learning with self-generations. To the best of my knowledge, this is the first work to explore such an attack strategy and demonstrate its feasibility and effectiveness.
2. Quality: The paper is well-written and provides sufficient technical details and empirical evidence to support its claims. The paper follows the standard structure of an ICLR submission and adheres to the formatting guidelines. The paper also discusses potential mitigations and countermeasures against the proposed attack, as well as open questions for future research. The paper uses appropriate references and citations to acknowledge previous work and situate its contribution in the literature.
3. Clarity: The paper is clear and easy to follow. The paper defines the threat model, the adversary’s capabilities and objective, and the main steps of the attack strategy in a precise and coherent manner. The paper also explains the rationale and intuition behind each step of the attack, as well as the challenges and assumptions involved. The paper uses figures, tables, and equations to illustrate the key concepts and results. The paper also provides qualitative analysis of extracted samples and discusses the limitations and implications of the attack.
4. Significance: The paper addresses an important and timely problem of training data extraction attacks on neural language models, which pose serious privacy risks for both data owners and model users. The paper demonstrates that such attacks can be amplified by adversarial fine-tuning, which can increase the exposure of sensitive training data by up to eight times. The paper also provides insights into the factors that affect the vulnerability of language models to such attacks, such as model size, training dataset type, and perturbation function. The paper contributes to advancing the understanding and mitigation of privacy threats in language modeling.

### Weaknesses
1. The paper does not specify how the adversary evaluates the effectiveness of the TDE attack, and what are the assumptions and limitations of the attack scenario. The paper also does not compare or contrast its attack strategy with existing TDE attacks in terms of feasibility, scalability, and practicality.
2. The paper relies on a single zero-shot machine-generated text detection method (DetectGPT) to pseudo-label the self-generated texts, without considering other possible methods or evaluating the robustness and reliability of DetectGPT. The paper also does not explain how the perturbation discrepancy correlates with the membership probability or the presence of training data in the generated texts. The paper does not account for the potential confounding factors or sources of bias in its experiments, such as the choice of prompts, sampling methods, hyperparameters, datasets, and evaluation metrics.
3. The paper does not discuss the ethical and social implications of its attack strategy. The paper proposes a novel form of TDE attack that can amplify the exposure of sensitive and private information from pre-trained LMs, but does not address the potential harms or risks that such an attack can pose to individuals, organizations, or society at large.

### Questions
1. In Figure 1, perturbed LM generations are divided into two classes: "good answer" and "bad answer," based on the value of d(x). Was the threshold for d(x) chosen empirically?
2. In Table 1 for Epoch 1, the three values with the lowest test accuracy are highlighted. In contrast, for Epoch 2, the highlighted values represent the top-3 highest test accuracy. There are no highlights in Epoch 0 and Epoch 3. Should the highlighting approach be consistent, or was this variation done intentionally for a specific reason?

### Summary
This paper focuses on amplifying training data memorization in terms of the extraction attack performance. The goal is to put the target model in a state where it is more likely to regurgitate training data.

More specifically, the authors propose a fine-tuning method, using reinforcement learning, text generation and machine-text generation detection to condition the model such that it is likelier to regurgitate its training data. They do this with restricted whit-box access to the model, and no access to the training data. They attempt to achieve this by doing the following steps: 1) generating many samples from the model 2) using detectgpt to give scores on how likely each generation is to be human written, intuition being that human written text is more likely to have been pre-training data. 3) create pairs of training/generation data 4) training a reward model to distinguish between the generation and pseudo training data. 5) fine-tune the target model using the reward model. 6) taking samples from the new model and comparing tot the non-trained reference model.

The authors then test the performance of the proposed method by taking samples from the fine-tuned model and then measuring exact matches with training data and reporting the values. They compare these numbers to those of a non-fine tuned model. They also study the performance of the reward model separately.

### Strengths
1. The approach/way of looking at the extraction problem is novel, prior work usually focuses on coming up with post-hoc extraction and not fine-tuning-based methods, where the decoding process is modified such that it incentivizes training data extraction. This paper however, tries to change the model so that its more likely to generate training data.

2. The problem is also an important problem, as current extraction methods are not very successful, most of them demonstrating low extraction rates.

### Weaknesses
1. Lack of enough experiments and ablations to support the main claim of the paper, that the method amplifies memorization. See questions 1-3 below. This is my main concern with the approach, as the model might as well just be regurgitating the same set of n-grams, over and over and as the reported is not measured over deduplicate generations based on n-grams (it seems like the only deduplication performed is wrt to full matched strings with training data), nor is there a diversity metric reported. Intuitively, I would assume that the fine-tuning is going to get the model to collapse on the set of generations used for RM training/FT. I also wonder why the authors did not use a metric similar to BLEU.

2. The structure of the paper is hard to follow and its not really well written. Some of the results are not explained well, also the way the deduplication is performed is not fully clear.  See questions 3 and 4 below.

3. Section 5.2 only shows how well a reward model can learn to differentiate between machine generated and human written text. It does not provide any evidence to support the claims of the paper regarding training data. It is simply an ablation. I am not sure what it is included as one of the first results. The fact that the reward model can differentiate between different texts does not necessarily translate to it being better at incentivizing the target model to regurgitate training data.

### Questions
1. Can the authors disentangle how much of the extractions overlap with the generated text that they fine-tuned with, and how much of the extracted text is non-overlapping and actually a generation of the model that is due to the amplification. Right now the main remaining question is does this method actually reinforce memorizations or is it just overfitting to the pseudo labeled data? (this corresponds to weakness 1 from above)

2. How many of the generated samples after fine-tuning differ from the reference model generations? as mentioned in question 1, if the model is collapsing, the new generations that the fine-tuned model has would overlap a lot with the generations from the refenrece model. it would be interesting to see if that is the case, or if there are any entirely new generations.

3. One main problem with the results is that the generation deduplication is happening on a full string level, and not n-gram overlaps. Same as point 1, I think there is probably huge overlap, what is the diversity of generations? There are no ablations here. We need a lot more ablations on the experiments. 

4.  section 5.2 please elaborate on the duplicate token overlaps, and the intervals. I went over the text multiple times but did not realize what the point of that experiment is.

### Summary
The paper presents a novel attack strategy aimed at increasing the vulnerability of pre-trained language models to training data extraction attacks. By adversarially fine-tuning the LMs, the authors claim to amplify the exposure of sensitive pre-training data. They propose the use of pseudo-labels to help fine-tune the model in a way that favors text likely to have originated from the pre-training dataset. Their experiments suggest that this approach can lead to a significant increase in training data exposure, particularly in large models with over 1 billion parameters.

### Strengths
1. Generally, the paper is well-written and easy to follow. 
2. The paper introduces a unique and unexplored attack vector that goes beyond the traditional post-hoc data extraction methods.
3. Given the widespread use of large LLMs, the paper addresses a timely and significant issue of data privacy.

### Weaknesses
1. The paper assumes the availability of restricted white-box capabilities, which may not always be the case in real-world scenarios. Specifically, the assumption that the attacker has access to model weights and can perform gradient-based fine-tuning is a significant limitation. In many practical scenarios, access to the model is limited to API calls, making this attack less feasible. The paper should discuss the limitations of this assumption in more detail and consider scenarios with limited access.
2. Although the author provided extensive empirical study results, I'm still curious about the underlying mechanism behind the attack. Could the author elucidate how the proposed adversarial fine-tuning method effectively amplifies data exposure? It might be helpful to use a naive linear classification task as an illustrative example. The current explanation lacks clarity on how pseudo-labels guide the fine-tuning process to favor the generation of pre-training data. A more detailed explanation of the specific loss function and its effect on the model's output distribution is needed. It would be beneficial to see a mathematical formulation of the adversarial fine-tuning objective and how it relates to the model's tendency to generate training data.

### Questions
How would the efficacy of this adversarial fine-tuning approach change if some form of differentially private training was already applied to the pre-trained language model? Would the attack still be as effective, or would it require significant modifications?
