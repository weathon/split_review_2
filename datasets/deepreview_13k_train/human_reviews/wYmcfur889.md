## Abstract
Due to their flexibility, scalability, and high quality, 
diffusion models (DMs) have become a fundamental stream of modern AIGC. However, a substantial performance deficit of DMs emerges when confronted with a scarcity of sampling steps. This limitation stems from the DM's acquisition of a series of weak denoisers obtained by minimizing a denoising auto-encoder objective. The weak denoisers lead to a decline in the quality of generated data samples in scenarios with few sampling steps. To address this, in this work, we introduce the Data-Prediction Denoising Model (DPDM), a constructor that embodies a sequence of stronger denoisers compared to conventional diffusion models. The DPDM is trained by initializing from a teacher DM. The core idea of training DPDM lies in improving the denoisers' data recovery ability with noisy data as inputs. We formulate such an idea through the minimization of suitable probability divergences between denoiser-recovered data distributions and the ground truth data distribution. The sampling algorithm of the DPDM is executed through an iterative process that interleaves data prediction and the sequential introduction of noise. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of the DPDM on two tasks: data distribution recovery and the few-step image data generation. For the data distribution recovery, the DPDM shows significantly stronger ability to recover data distributions from noisy distribution. For the data generation task, we train DPDMs on two benchmark datasets: the CIFAR10, and the ImageNet$64\times 64$. We compare the DPDM with baseline diffusion models together with other diffusion-based multi-step generative models under the few-step generation setting. We observe the superior performance advantage of DPDMs over competitor methods. In addition to the strong empirical performance, we also elucidate the interconnections and comparisons between the DPDM and existing methodologies, which shows that DPDM is a stand-alone generative model that is essentially different from existing models.

### Summary
This paper studies student-teacher fine-tunning method that improves and accelerates sampling steps for Diffusion Models (DM). The primary hypothesis motivating this research asserts that the conventional score matching objective used in training leads to suboptimal denoisers for DM, thereby limiting the generation of high-quality samples when constrained to a minimal number of sampling steps (NFE < 10). Results are shown on two datasets comparing to several most recent  baselines.

### Strengths
1, The beginning of the article (Section 1 and Section 2) is well written and presents the motivation behind the introduction of the proposed student-teacher fine-tunning method in a very didactic way.

2,  There are some theoretical justifications for the training gradient of the proposed smoothed KL.

3,  Numerical experiments on small datasets (e.g., 64X64) verify that the proposed DPDM outperforms previous sampling methods in terms of quality (FID) with fewer function evaluations

### Weaknesses
1, While Diff-Instruct was not explicitly designed to accelerate diffusion model sampling, the proposed DPDM still shares many similarities in format, such as the smoothed KL divergence, student-teacher fine-tuning, and the gradient update of the 'objective.' More importantly, Diff-Instruct tested its sampling quality with small NFEs as well. These aspects make the actual novelty of DPDM not clear to the reviewer.

2, While there are some theoretical demonstrations concerning the gradient of KL divergence for a single denoiser, equivalent analyses for multiple denoisers in Eq.3.4 appear to be missing, making the work somehow incomplete. Specifically, the extension from a single denoiser to multiple denoisers, as presented in Equation 3.4, lacks a rigorous derivation. The weighting function w(t) is introduced without a clear justification, and the impact of this weighting on the overall convergence and stability of the training process is not analyzed.

3, Compared to other training-free sampling acceleration methods, the computation costs of DPDM are still relatively heavy, making the practical impacts unclear. The paper does not provide a detailed breakdown of the computational costs associated with DPDM, particularly in comparison to training-free methods. This makes it difficult to assess the practical advantages of the proposed method, especially considering that training-free methods do not require any additional training overhead.

4, This work is only demonstrated for image synthesis on small datasets, while other conditional sampling tasks (e.g., text-to-image or image-to-image translation) are missing. The lack of experiments on more complex tasks and datasets limits the generalizability of the findings. The paper does not address the potential challenges of applying DPDM to conditional generation tasks, such as text-to-image synthesis, where the input space is more complex and the generation process is more intricate.

### Questions
1, What is the runtime comparison between the proposed and other methods ?

2, Can this strategy be directly adapted to other conditional sampling methods, such as image-to-image translation? On the other hand, given that the sampling trajectory is implemented by different denoising operators, how robust is the DPDM to variations at intermediate stages, especially at low noise levels ?

3, In Table 4, it seems that DPDM performs worse than Diff-Instruct for NFE < 4. What accounts for such differences?

4, When training multiple denoisers, how does convergence occur in those student networks?

### Summary
This paper proposes Data Prediction Denoising Models (DPDM)s, a new class of generative models that incorporates a sequence of strong denoisers for data generation. It is argued that conventional diffusion models embody weak denoisers, which in turn requires a high number of steps at inference time for generation, reducing the overall efficiency. To alleviate this challenge, DPDM training uses a teacher DM for initialization, and minimizes probability divergences between denoiser-recovered data distributions and the ground truth data distribution. In addition, a sampler suitable for DPDMs is presented. It is shown that DPDM can attain strong performance on CIFAR-10, and ImageNet64x64 with only a few number of sampling steps.

### Strengths
- The proposed method is novel, and the technical contribution is strong. DPDMs provide a new framework for generative modeling which is different from diffusion models, although it draws many inspirations from diffusion models.
- The experimental results are convincing where DPDMs outperform many recent baselines, illustrating their capability on data generation using a small number of NFEs.

### Weaknesses
 - The scope of the experiments section is limited where the results are presented on low-resolution datasets such as CIFAR-10, and ImageNet 64x64. The experiments would benefit from demonstrations with high-resolution datasets to illustrate the generalizability of the method. 
- Although the focus of the paper is on inference efficiency, inference metrics are not provided. The comparison is made in terms of NFEs which is an important aspect. However, metrics such as inference memory, seconds per iteration at inference, and overall inference time until convergence should be provided for a valid comparison.

### Questions
Questions:
- How does inference memory and time compare with state-of-the-art baselines?
- What does $\tilde{x}$ stand for in Equation 1? I don't think it has been defined anywhere.

Suggestions:
- Typographical issues: There are issues such as duplicate references, (Song et al., 2020b and Song et al., 2020c), duplicate paragraphs (Training Efficiency and GPU-memory Cost in main and appendix) and other issues which should be fixed.

### Summary
This paper introduces an algorithm to train a denoiser given a pre-trained diffusion model, use the denoiser to sample an image, and shows that this method is better than general diffusion on small sampling steps.

### Strengths
- A new algorithm to accelerate the diffusion sampling.
- Excellent results on small sampling step.

### Weaknesses
With my carefully proofreading, I still suffer from understanding the key idea of this paper. From what I understand, this paper aims to train a separate denoiser such that (1) the denoiser can predict a clean image from noisy image, and (2) when Gaussian noise is added to the predicted clean image, the distribution of the new noisy image is consistent to that of the noisy images used to train the diffusion model. However, training this separate denoiser appears to use a loss function that is mathematically equivalent to the training loss of the original diffusion model, specifically an L2 loss on the predicted noise. From this aspect, it seems like this idea is more like a fine-tuning (or just training it longer) method. I cannot follow why such a fine-tuning idea, or an equivalent training procedure, would be effective when having small sampling steps. Could the author clarify this point, specifically detailing the differences in the training objective and how it leads to improved performance with fewer sampling steps?

The sampling method considers the clean image as the mean of the next step distribution, which contradicts the theoretical analysis of DDPM, which predicts the mean of the denoised distribution, not the clean image itself. This distinction is critical, and the authors need to justify this deviation from the established theoretical framework. The paper needs to clarify why directly predicting the clean image and adding noise is a valid approach, and how it relates to the underlying principles of diffusion models.

Moreover, this paper claims it provides a solid mathematical foundation for the proposed method, which is unclear what that means. The paper should explicitly state what mathematical formulation is used, and how that formulation leads to the proposed algorithm. The connection between the mathematical foundation and the practical implementation is not clearly established.

Need justification and more explanation of the proposed method. (see the weakness)

### Summary
This paper addresses the performance drop in DMs with limited sampling steps, attributing it to the weak denoisers used in their training. To mitigate this issue, the authors introduce the Data Prediction Denoising Model (DPDM), a multi-step generative model that outperforms DMs with few sampling steps. DPDM enhances data recovery capabilities by minimizing distribution divergence, which results in stronger denoisers capable of better recovering data distributions from noisy data. A corresponding sampling algorithm, DPDM sampler, is introduced to generate samples from DPDMs.

### Strengths
1) The paper addresses a useful and practical issue with Diffusion Models (DMs). The research is novel and the exposition is clear and well-structured. 
2) The paper begins with a clear and well-supported empirical observation regarding the performance drop in DMs when the number of sampling steps is limited. The paper introduces the Data Prediction Denoising Model (DPDM) as a novel approach to address the limitations of DMs. DPDM is designed to enhance data recovery abilities, and its effectiveness is rigorously demonstrated through experiments.
3) The paper provides some mathematical foundation for DPDM by emphasizing the importance of minimizing distribution divergence. This adds depth and theoretical support to the proposed model.
4) The paper goes beyond presenting DPDM and conducts extensive comparisons with existing multi-step generative models.

### Weaknesses
1) While the paper claims to solve a practical problem by needing less compute resources for sampling compared to DMs. However, training DPDMs require an auxiliary diffusion model, a retrained DM and a multi-step denoiser model which may bring additional memory costs and training time requirements. The paper does not provide a detailed analysis of the memory footprint during training, especially considering the need to store and update multiple models. The computational overhead of training the auxiliary model, the retrained DM, and the multi-step denoiser is not thoroughly quantified, making it difficult to assess the practical benefits in terms of overall resource consumption.
2) The paper predominantly focuses on low-resolution image generation tasks, such as 64x64 pixel images. While it demonstrates the effectiveness of DPDM in this context, it does not explore or provide results for higher-resolution image generation or other types of data generation tasks. The lack of experiments on higher resolution images (e.g., 256x256 or 512x512) limits the generalizability of the findings. It is unclear how DPDM would perform on more complex datasets or tasks, such as text-to-image generation or 3D data generation.
3) Minor comment: When NFE is first introduced in Page 2, the full form is not mentioned. Please include this in the revised version to improve readability.

### Questions
While the paper is generally well-written, I have the following questions.

1) Can the authors demonstrate the results for generating higher resolution images such as 256x256 or higher and how DPDMs compare with DMs?
2) Can the authors comment on the training and inference times and compute requirements for DPDMs and comparable DMs?
