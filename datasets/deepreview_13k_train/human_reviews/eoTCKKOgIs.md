## Abstract
A key challenge of modern machine learning systems is to achieve Out-of-Distribution (OOD) generalization---generalizing to target data whose distribution differs from that of source data. Despite its significant importance, the fundamental question of ``what are the most effective algorithms for OOD generalization'' remains open even under the standard setting of covariate shift.
This paper addresses this fundamental question by proving that, surprisingly, classical Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) purely using source data (without any modification) achieves the \emph{minimax} optimality for covariate shift under the \emph{well-specified} setting. That is, \emph{no} algorithm performs better than MLE in this setting (up to a constant factor), justifying MLE is all you need.
Our result holds for a very rich class of parametric models, and does not require any boundedness condition on the density ratio. We illustrate the wide applicability of our framework by instantiating it to three concrete examples---linear regression, logistic regression, and phase retrieval. This paper further complement the study by proving that, under the \emph{misspecified setting}, MLE is no longer the optimal choice, whereas Maximum Weighted Likelihood Estimator (MWLE) emerges as minimax optimal in certain scenarios.

### Summary
This study investigates the effectiveness of maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) in the out-of-distribution optimization problem. The authors prove the effectiveness by showing the minimax optimality.

### Strengths
This study enlightens the use of the MLE under correctly specified models. The reported results are practically important because we can avoid using advanced methods for addressing the covariate shift problem. The main strength of this study lies in the finite-sample minimax optimality of MLE under a covariate shift.

### Weaknesses
Although the points raised by the authors are practically important, I cannot find novel findings.

**OOD under the correctly specified models**
Firstly, as the authors mention, it is known that the covariate shift problem is not serious when models are correctly specified (Shimodaira, 2000). Although it seems that recent studies tend to omit discussing model misspecification when discussing the covariate shift problem, classical studies motivate the use of covariate shift adaptation by considering the model misspecification setting. Those studies and classical statistics agree that correctly specified models can address the OOD generation. Therefore, when models are correctly specified, "MLE is all we need" has been known to researchers, though recent studies often omit this point.

**Finte sample optimality**
Then, my question for this study is its contribution. The authors insist that the contributions lie in the finite-sample minimax optimality of MLE under correctly specified parametric models. However, if we consider parametric models and minimax optimality, I think that such a result has already been shown by existing studies with more general forms or is trivial, though I do not raise some specific related work. This is because when considering parametric models $f_\theta(x)$ parametrized by $\theta$, it is enough to consider the minimax optimality of estimation of $\theta$. Once we establish the optimality, we can extend the result to show the minimax optimality of estimation of $f_\theta(x)$ using the Taylor expansion for each $x$ or uniformly over $x$. There are various results to discuss the optimality of $\theta$ estimation, and we can just employ them.

**Uniform convergence**
Several existing studies discuss the uniform or point-wise minimax optimality of estimation of $f_\theta(x)$, which directly implies the minimax optimality under a covariate shift. I believe that we can easily obtain such a result if we only consider parametric models, and the results shown by the authors can be more strengthened.

### Questions
1. Why do authors consider the minimax optimality of parametric models under a covariate shift? Is it difficult to derive corresponding results for nonparametric models? Or can the authors show uniform optimality?
2. To the best of my knowledge, it has been known that correctly specified parametric models can adapt the OOD, at least in statistics. Therefore, the contributions of this study mainly lie in the finite-sample minimax optimality. Is my understanding correct?


**Title**
By the way, I think that the title may not be appropriate. As I discussed and the authors mention in the draft, "MLE is all we need" has been known. The true contribution of this study is the finite-sample minimax optimality of MLE for correctly specified parametric models. If so, the title should express the true contributions. For example, if I were the authors, I name the study "Minimax Optimality of Maximum Likelihood Estimation for Covariate Shifted Norm." Anyway, the authors should focus on their contributions more to clarify the claims of this study.

### Summary
The authors consider the problem of generalization for parametric models in the presence of covariate shift. Specificallly, we are given $(X,Y)$ pairs where the distribution of $X$ might be different during training and testing, but the conditional $Y|X$ is the same. They first consider the well specified regime, where the conditional distribution $Y|X$ lies in the parametric family considered. In that regime, they prove that for general parametric families under minimal assumptions (identifiability of the model, convexity of the likelihood), the Maximum Likelihood Estimator (MLE) is consistent and achieves the minimax-optimal sample complexity, without any assumptions on the density ratio between source and target distribution. They also instantiate their bounds for some concrete settings: linear regression, logistic regression and phase retrieval. They then focus on the misspecified setting, where the conditional $Y|X$ doesn't necessarily lie in the parametric class. They prove that MLE is no longer consistent and that a modification called Weighted Maximum Likelihood Estimation (WMLE) is indeed consistent. Finally, they provide a sample complexity lower bound for a specific parametric class which matches the upper bound for WMLE.

### Strengths
This paper tackles a well-motivated problem which has not been studied in prior work. I believe it is a nice step towards understanding the sample complexity of learning parametric models under covariate shift. It offers a comprehensive set of results, first tackling the well-specified case and then the mis-specified one, thus providing a clear picture of the state of the art in that area. A nice feature of the result in the well-specified case is that it gives a tight answer about the sample complexity, identifying exactly how the mismatch in training and test distribution will impact the performance. The paper is also written clearly, with claims that are explained adequately and there is a nice discussion about prior work.

### Weaknesses
Perhaps this is not much of a weakness, but some of the main results do not involve significant novelty on a technical level. For example, the proof of the upper bound follows using standard arguments in parametric estimation. First they prove that the parameter $\beta$ can be learned with accuracy $\sqrt{\frac{Tr(\mathcal{I}_S^{-1})}{n}}$(Lemma A.2), which is expected, as $\mathcal{I}_S$ is the Fischer information evaluated on the source distribution. This is shown using the standard Taylor expansion up to third order and utilizing the bounds on the first three derivatives. Then they compute how this guarantee on $\beta^*$ translates to a guarantee about the target distribution, which is how the final factor of $Tr(\mathcal{I}_T \mathcal{I}_S^{-1})$ is obtained. Overall, this is similar to the standard consistency arguments in parametric statistics.

### Questions
-The finite sample guarantees that are presented hold when the number of samples $n$ is greater than some threshold, which depends on many parameters of the problem, including for example $\|\mathcal{I}_T^{1/2}\mathcal{I}_S^{-1}\mathcal{I}_T^{1/2}\|_2$, which also measures how close the source and target distributions are in some sense. Since the sample complexity bounds only hold above that threshold, it seems that an important question is what is the dependence of the optimal sample complexity on quantities like $\|\mathcal{I}_T^{1/2}\mathcal{I}_S^{-1}\mathcal{I}_T^{1/2}\|_2$. Have the authors considered this question?

-The authors instantiate their general bound for the well-specified setting in the case of linear regression. It would be interesting to compare the results that they get with the guarantees of prior work on this problem, such as Lei et al., if such a comparison can be made.

-Since there are two different distributions of source and target, I think it would help with exposition if the authors had some notation about taking expectation wrt each of the two distributions instead of hiding this dependence. For example, in the proof of Lemma A.2 the expectation is wrt the source distribution.

-In page 14, in the derivation of inequality (13) in the second line, shouldn't there be an expectation above the equality sign? ($\mathbb{E}[\nabla l(\beta^*)] = 0$)

### Summary
This paper working under the classic covariate shift seating where the marginal distribution of X is different between source and target data but the conditional distributions of Y|X are the same, and proved the surprising yet elegant result that classical Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) purely using source data achieves the minimax optimality  under the well-specified setting. This result holds for a large family of parametric models and the authors illustrated this in linear regression, logistic regression, and phase retrieval, where no boundedness condition on the density ratio is required. They further proved that for the misspecified setting, MLE can perform poorly, and the Maximum Weighted Likelihood Estimator (MWLE) emerges as minimax optimal in specific scenarios, outperforming MLE.

### Strengths
The presentation of the covariate shift setting and the author's result is very clean and well-written, which is also reflected in the authors' choice of using linear, logistic models to illustrate their main result. The upper and lower matching bounds on the MLE estimator is nicely presented with necessary conditions along with the MWLE estimator under the misspecified model, which imposes stronger conditions.

### Weaknesses
It would be great it the authors could present more intuition on why simple MLE works so well in well-specified model, where the estimator uses purely source data. In addition, perhaps the authors could cite and compare with some growingly popular and relevant literature in nonparametric settings of covariate shift that leverages conformal prediction, such as https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.06019 and https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.01761;
Some comparisons between prediction and estimation problem under covariate shift could be very beneficial to the community.

### Questions
In the well-specified case where the MLE estimator is minimax optimal, is there anything to gain if there is also access to X and Y in the target population?

### Summary
This paper studies the problem of covariate shift, where a model is trained on a dataset sampled from a source distribution and aims to achieve minimal generalization error on a target distribution. It is presumed that both the source and target distributions share the same conditional distribution of label $Y$ given covariates $X$ (i.e., the so-called well-specified case) but differ in their distribution over the covariates. Under specific assumptions about the model class and the source and target distributions, the authors demonstrate that the minimax generalization error on the target distribution is achieved by the MLE (Maximum Likelihood Estimation) using only data sampled from the source. The authors further apply their findings to several (generalized) linear models. In conclusion, the authors show that there are instances in the miss-specified case where the MLE is not consistent, whereas a weighted version of MLE achieves tight sample complexity.

### Strengths
This is a technically solid paper, which demonstrates, for certain natural models, that the MLE achieves the minimax optimal sample complexity for covariate shift in the well-specified case. The authors also apply their findings to several (generalized) linear models, which may have potential real-world applications. The examples distinguishing between the well-specified and misspecified cases are also intriguing.

### Weaknesses
My primary reservation about this paper is that it might overly exaggerate its contributions. While the title suggests that MLE is "All You Need" for well-specified covariate shift, the authors introduce a series of quite non-trivial assumptions in Assumption A. It seems to me that Theorem 3.1 is essentially a direct corollary of these assumptions. Technically, these assumptions appear to essentially state that the MLE converges to the optimal parameter — the very result that Theorem 3.1 claims to prove. Additionally, regarding applications, the paper limits its focus to only (generalized) linear models. This narrow scope hardly convinces that the MLE is indeed "All You Need".  

I would urge the authors to represent their results more accurately. Specifically, I recommend changing the title to "Minimax Optimal Sample Complexity for Well-Specified Covariate Shift via MLE" or something along those lines.

I would like to outline the following further comments:

- Assumption A and C apply to both the model class and the source and target distributions, not only to the model class as claimed by the authors.
- In Section 4, regarding the applications, it would be beneficial to also mention the lower bounds for each example.
- The current length of the paper, spanning 50 pages, is excessive. It would be beneficial to provide an outline of the primary proof techniques. This would help readers in distinguishing between essential steps and routine procedures.
