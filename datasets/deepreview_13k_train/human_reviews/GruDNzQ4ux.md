- Decision: Accept
- Scores: 6, 5, 6, 6

## Abstract
Model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL) has gained much attention for its ability to learn complex behaviors in a sample-efficient way: planning actions by generating imaginary trajectories with predicted rewards. Despite its success, we found that surprisingly, reward prediction is often a bottleneck of MBRL, especially for sparse rewards that are challenging (or even ambiguous) to predict. Motivated by the intuition that humans can learn from rough reward estimates, we propose a simple yet effective reward smoothing approach, \textit{DreamSmooth}, which learns to predict a temporally-smoothed reward, instead of the exact reward at the given timestep. We empirically show that DreamSmooth achieves state-of-the-art performance on long-horizon sparse-reward tasks both in sample efficiency and final performance without losing performance on common benchmarks, such as Deepmind Control Suite and Atari benchmarks.

### Summary
In model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL), it is crucial to correctly estimate the reward model. However, when the rewards in the environment are sparse, it poses challenges in learning the reward function. The authors have shown convincing examples that the algorithm may achieve a smaller loss by simply predicting zero rewards, than predicing the sparse rewards at an incorrect time step.

This work remedies this problem by asking the algorithm to learn a smooth reward function. The proposed algorithm is based on the DreamerV3 algorithm and evaluated on a wide range of tasks.

### Strengths
This work proposes a simple yet effective approach to improve an MBRL agent’s performance in environments with sparse rewards. The algorithm is evaluated on simulated robotic control, 2D navigation, and Atari game domains. The authors also conducted ablation studies to show that this approach outperforms some other baseline algorithms to address the sparse reward issue, including oversampling sequences with sparse rewards, increasing reward model size, etc.

Additionally, this work also empirically verifies the challenges of reward learning in MBRL, finding out that the agent may achieve a smaller loss by predicting zero rewards than by predicting wrong rewards.

### Weaknesses
 **Novelty.** This is more like an engineering trick that the community has considered as an ad-hoc approach to resolve to learn in environments with sparse rewards. Although this smoothing technique intuitively makes sense, I didn’t see justifications for the correctness of this approach. See Question 1 below.

**Baseline method.** DreamV3 is the only baseline method for almost all the tasks, except that TD-MPC is used for the Hand Task. Unless this work only considers robotic tasks, other more popular RL algorithms need to be included. Also, if this work is indeed only constrained to robotic tasks, I believe the authors need to make that clear in the paper, and also explain why this simple technique cannot be applied to other RL algorithms.

### Questions
1. When we change the reward function, is the agent’s policy guaranteed to have a high value under the original reward function?
When sparse rewards indeed specify critical states that have high rewards, would a smooth reward function blur out the true critical states, so that the optimal policy does not visit the critical states?

2. Is there any rationale for using DreamV3 as the baseline for most tasks?

### Summary
This paper introduces DreamSmooth, a simple and effective method that improves the performance of model-based RL on sparse reward environments. The authors observe that on sparse reward tasks, it is challenging to fit an accurate reward model due to data imbalance. This in turn bottlenecks the performance of model-based RL methods like Dreamer. To mitigate this problem, the authors apply a smoothing function to the reward, effectively spreading the reward signal to adjacent states in the trajectory. The authors propose three reward smoothing functions: Gaussian, Uniform, and EMA. While EMA is the only function that guarantees policy invariance, all three are empirically found to work well, resulting in more accurate reward predictions and higher performance in sparse reward tasks compared to baselines.

### Strengths
- Reward sparsity is a long-standing problem in model-based RL. Even with an accurate dynamics model, policy optimization would not work if the reward model fails to capture sparse reward signals.
- The method is extremely simple, with only a one-line change to the Dreamer code, yet it brings a significant improvement across a suite of challenging sparse reward tasks.
- The authors performed extensive analysis and ablation studies to identify the root cause of MBRL failure and demonstrate the effectiveness of their algorithm.

### Weaknesses
 - While reward prediction error is indeed one consequence of reward sparsity, the fundamental challenge that comes with sparse rewards is exploration. If there is no reward signal in the first place, then reward smoothing does not work either. While this paper provides a simple remedy to alleviate reward sparsity, it does not address the fundamental exploration problem. This is a critical limitation, as many sparse reward environments require sophisticated exploration strategies to discover any reward signal. Simply smoothing a non-existent reward will not lead to meaningful learning. 

- Two of the smoothing functions are unable to guarantee policy invariance, and it is possible to construct adversarial examples. Specifically, the Gaussian and Uniform smoothing functions introduce potential issues. For instance, consider an environment where a specific sequence of actions leads to a sparse reward. Applying symmetric smoothing could erroneously assign positive rewards to states that, in reality, lead away from the optimal trajectory. This could mislead the policy towards suboptimal behaviors. The authors should provide a more rigorous analysis of the conditions under which these smoothing functions fail and discuss the potential pitfalls in more detail.

- The potential for reward ambiguity introduced by smoothing is a serious concern. For example, if a bad state is visited right after a successful state versus after a sequence of bad states, it would get assigned different smoothed reward values. This inconsistency can confuse the agent and hinder learning. While the recurrent nature of Dreamer might help mitigate this to some extent, it's not guaranteed. A more thorough investigation into the effects of reward ambiguity on different types of model-based RL algorithms is needed. The authors should analyze how reward ambiguity impacts the convergence properties and stability of the learning process.

### Questions
- It seems that reward smoothing can potentially lead to reward ambiguity. For example, if a bad state is visited right after a successful state vs. after a sequence of bad states, it would get assigned different smoothed reward values. How does reward ambiguity affect MBRL methods? I suspect the recurrent architecture of Dreamer helps mitigate this issue. To verify, can you run a Markovian MBRL method like MBPO with reward smoothing and see if there's any improvement there?
- There are inductive biases built into each smoothing function. For example, Gaussian and Uniform smoothing functions assume symmetry. However, this may not align with the environment dynamics. Consider a ball rolling off a staircase and receiving a sparse reward right at the edge of the staircase. The smoothing function bumps up the reward of the states before and after falling off the staircase, but in practice, it is much harder to climb back up from the lower platform than to roll down. In other words, reward smoothing can give rise to overoptimistic behaviors. Do you see this reflected in any task?
- Does reward smoothing benefit model-free methods such as policy gradient?

### Summary
The paper studies the challenges of learning reward models in the context of Model-Based Reinforcement Learning (MBRL). The authors argue that existing methods in MBRL fail to learn a good reward model in sparse / partially observable/stochastic environments/tasks and show empirical evidence for this. Based on the intuitive idea that, in such challenging scenarios, one only has to rely on rough reward estimates as humans do, they propose a method called DreamSmooth. In DreamSmooth the reward model is now tasked to predict a temporally smoothed reward instead of the exact reward. The authors propose 3 reward-smoothing schemes and empirically show that the approach can significantly improve the performance on most sparse reward scenarios.

### Strengths
These are the strengths of the paper in my opinion:

1) Studies a largely ignored, yet important problem of reward modelling in the context of MBRL.
2) Propose a simple yet effective solution for the same.
3) Well Written.

### Weaknesses
The major weaknesses are as follows:

1) Counter-intuitive results in Crafter, where the method performs worse even after having a much better reward model.
2) The need to experiment with 3 different reward smoothing schemes each with its own hyperparameters (since none of them seems to consistent favourite across tasks).

### Questions
1) Have you experimented with different loss functions (on the unsmoothed rewards)? For example, what would happen if you use an L1 Loss instead of an L2 Loss commonly used in literature?
2) The rationale behind why the counter-intuitive results in crafter is not convincing. Did the authors perform further empirical studies / analysis ?

### Summary
This paper propose DreamSmooth which is based on Dreamer-V3. The technique used in this paper is to smooth the ground truth rewards when trainining Dreamer-V3. Experiments show that this modification works well on both dense and sparse rewards environments.

### Strengths
The proposed method solves a problem in model based RL when the gt rewards are sparse in these environments. Smoothing the rewards would make the reward function prediction process (reward leanring in model based RL) much better than before. At the same time, DreamSmooth shows it also performs well on dense rewards environments. It makes the whole algorithm more convincing. I think it is a good paper to investigate the reward smoothing technique for model based RL.

### Weaknesses
Dreamer-V3 has a symlog prediction function with reward learning process. I think different reward prediction function would contribute to the reward learning process. Do the authors conduct some experiments with different prediction function head to justify whether it could solve the sparse rewards problem? I think the issue discussed in this paper is mainly about the reward generalizability problem. It is hard for reward function in MBRL to generalize in sparse reward setting.

I am curious about why DreamSmooth works comparable without reward smooth technique in dense reward environments. The reward smoothing technique changes the  reward distribution. As far as I am concerned, using this kind of technique would decline the final performance. Since MBRL like Dreamer is so important to this community, I lean to weak accept for this paper. However, I do have some concerns about this simple yet effective algorithms, especially why the final performance doesn't decline (especially on dense reward environments).
