## Abstract
\vspace{-1em}
Despite the recent advances in large-scale diffusion models, little progress has been made on the layout-to-image (L2I) synthesis task. Current L2I models either suffer from poor editability via text or weak alignment between the generated image and the input layout. This limits their usability in practice. To mitigate this, we propose to integrate \textbf{a}dversarial supervision into the conventional training pipeline of \textbf{L}2I \textbf{d}iffusion \textbf{m}odels ({\ourdm}). Specifically, we employ a segmentation-based discriminator which provides explicit feedback to the diffusion generator on the pixel-level alignment between the denoised image and the input layout. To encourage consistent adherence to the input layout over the sampling steps, we further introduce the multistep unrolling strategy. Instead of looking at a single timestep, we unroll a few steps recursively to imitate the inference process, and ask the discriminator to assess the alignment of denoised images with the layout over a certain time window. Our experiments show that {\ourdm} enables layout faithfulness of the generated images, while allowing broad editability via text prompts. Moreover, we showcase its usefulness for practical applications: by synthesizing target distribution samples via text control, we improve domain generalization of semantic segmentation models by a large margin ($\sim$12 mIoU points).

### Summary
This paper proposes to embed adversarial supervision into the training of a diffusion model conditioned on layout. By introducing adversarial supervision and the multi-step rolling strategy, the framework can get strong results, better than baseline methods like control net which does not explicitly use adversarial supervision. It also shows that the generated samples can boost the domain generalization for semantic segmentation tasks.

### Strengths
- The paper is well-written and easy to understand, the proposed method is simple but effective
- Adversarial supervision is not new though, it is the first time to be used in the context of diffusion model
- The experimental results are strong and are better than the baseline methods.

### Weaknesses
 - The qualitative results seem to be much better than baseline methods, are they cherry-picked? A non-cherry picked results can better show that the proposed methods largely exceed the current baselines.
- What is the difference between Control-Net + Adv Supervision and multi-step rolling in Table 1 compared with ALDM?
- Can you show some outputs of the discriminator? Since it works in the latent space, we need to be more careful about what is happening inside.

### Summary
This paper proposes to adopt a ControlNet architecture for better semantic image synthesis using an adversarial discriminator (as in OASIS) on the per-pixel label maps. Furthermore, a multistep unrolling mechanism is presented so that adversarial supervision takes into account several denoising steps to improve the signal at low noise levels.

### Strengths
- This paper is well-structured and well-written.
- Ideas and results are presented clearly.
- Adapting a pre-trained diffusion model for semantic image synthesis is interesting and challenging.

### Weaknesses
There are several issues with the presented work.

- The technical contributions of this manuscript are limited. Adversarial supervision on the semantic maps is identical as in OASIS. Multistep unrolling is computationally very expensive (scales linearly and hence can take up x9 longer), and has a small effect on the performance.
- The results (while improving over the diffusion baselines) are behind OASIS, a GAN from 2020.
- The motivation to use a strong text-to-image model and adapt it for semantic image synthesis is flawed. The paper motivates it by enabling text-conditioned content and style transfer, but the semantic mask completely specifies the content. Hence, the application is reduced to text-guided style and color transfer. 
- Furthermore, the proposed model does not perform style transfer well. When changing to a snowy scene, the whole image and all objects are resampled. Local editing is also not possible. Instead, the whole image is affected when changing "a red van" to "a burning van". 
- A simple baseline combining OASIS and a state-of-the-art style transfer model should be considered.

Side remarks:
- Layout-to-image is usually referred to as a task that transforms a list of bounding boxes and class labels into an image [1,2]. This paper tackles semantic image synthesis where the input is a label mask (each pixel is labelled).
- The paper states that Stable Diffusion based models do not comply well with layout input, but see [3,4]

### Summary
The paper "Adversarial Supervision Makes Layout-to-Image Diffusion Models Thrive" proposes to augment diffusion models with adversarial methods to achieve a model that is controlable from text and segmentation map layout simultaneously. In particular, the authors propose two additions to fine-tune a Stable Diffusion model: 1) a recent adversarial learning methods incorporating segmentation networks is applied to the outputs of the diffusion network, and 2) the diffusion process is unrolled, and the segmentation network is applied already to intermediate de-noised steps. It is shown in the paper that there's incremental value in both. The method is evaluated on two datasets (ADE20K and Cityscapes), and the proposed method is showns to be superior to several recent baselines (T2I-Adapter, FreestyleNet and ControlNet) qualitatively, as well as quantitatively. Finally, the method is applied on a domain generalization task, and is shown to perform best against the baselines there.

### Strengths
+ the paper is well written, intuitive motivations are given, and it is well understandable.
+ the proposed method is shown to work well. It shows both qualititatively better alignment and quantitative improvements.
+ it also shows very good results on domain generalization.

### Weaknesses
 - it's unclear if careful tuning of a frozen segmentation network's impact on the total loss wouldn't be competitive to the proposed adversarial approach. I.e. in Table 3, the frozen UperNet achieves the best mIoU, but much worse FID - consistent with the hypothesis that the impact of the segmentation network is just too strong. Verying the impact of the segmentation loss relative to the diffusion loss while fine-tuning would clarify this. Specifically, it's not clear if the performance difference is due to the adversarial training, or simply due to the fact that the segmentation network is updated. A more thorough ablation study should be performed, where the impact of the segmentation loss is varied, and compared to the proposed adversarial approach, while keeping the segmentation network frozen.
- The introduction gave a good intuition for the whole method. However, the combination of diffusion models with adversarial methods remains ad-hoc, and there's no theoretical justification for the validaty of the approach given. It should be either worked out, or at least added for future work that propoer understanding of diffusion-adversarial coupling should be investigated (to make these methods work best together).

Smaller things:
- Figure 1 lowest right image: this example shows that the method doesn't yet work perfectly. The top part of the truck is a building (see the windows and the 'roof structure'). It should be pointed out in the paper that some failed cases still persist (even if harder to see).
- In "Related Work" you write "more attention has been devoted to leveraging pretrained knowledge for the L2I task and using diffusion models"; I think this is an important point, and should already be part of the motivation of the general method in the Introduction.

### Questions
- why don't you train a diffusion model from scratch for the task of L2I and T2I simultaneously? Recent segmentation models are very powerful, and can produce the segmentation maps needed to augment the dataset (e.g. LAION-5B). I'd expect that to work best.
- for the case of a frozen pre-trained segmenter: did you train a diffusion model plus an additional loss for the segmentation model? That is surprising, because I wouldn't have expected the diffusion model to collapse in such case (the same training method/loss is still there).

### Summary
This paper aims for a better layout-to-image method. It applies a segmentation-based discriminator (Sushko et al., 2022) to the diffusion generator on the pixel-level alignment between the denoised image and the input layout. In addition, it proposes multistep unrolling, predicting the clean image at multiple timesteps and apply the segmenter-based discriminator. The experiments are on the classical segmentation datasets ADE20K and Cityscapes. The model exhibits comparable pixel level alignment and image fidelity. Different type of L2I synthesis adaptation models and segmenters are tested, to demonstrate its effectiveness.

### Strengths
1. The proposed method seems straightforward and effective.
2. The paper contains thorough ablation tests on different settings (different L2I models and segmenters) and different hyperparameters.

### Weaknesses
1. As mentioned in the Failure Cases, when editing the attribute of one object, it could affect the other objects as well. It is claimed to be inherited from Stable Diffusion.
2. Despite thorough ablation tests, the paper does not give any insights on the experiments. The text in the experiments only describes the results instead of analyzing the phenomenon. Thus, I think it shows limited contribution to the community. I suggest to delete the plain description of the results, as we can all see from the tables and figure captions, but add more analysis and insights of why it can work.

### Questions
1. When using a frozen segmenter, mIoU is higher and FID is also higher. Why does it happen, any insight?
2. It is mentioned in the limitations that editing one object may also affect others. However, in Figure 4, it shows better local controllability than ControlNet and FreestyleNet. Any insights why? Because of better pixel alignment? If that's the case, is better mIoU always means better local controllability? For example, can the one trained on frozen segmenter exhibits better local controllability?
3. Why larger number of unrolling steps is always better? Have you tried any K>9? Do all steps contribute the similar gradient magnitude or some of them is more important? What if we omit some of the earlier steps?
