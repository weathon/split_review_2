# Efficient Offline Reinforcement Learning: The Critic is Critical

- Decision: Reject
- Scores: 5, 5, 5

## Abstract
Recent work has demonstrated both benefits and limitations from using supervised approaches (without temporal-difference learning) for offline reinforcement learning. While off-policy reinforcement learning provides a promising approach for improving performance beyond supervised approaches, we observe that training is often inefficient and unstable due to temporal difference bootstrapping. In this paper we propose a best-of-both approach by first learning the behavior policy and critic with supervised learning, before improving with off-policy reinforcement learning. Specifically, we demonstrate improved efficiency by pre-training with a supervised Monte-Carlo value-error, making use of commonly neglected downstream information from the provided offline trajectories. We find that we are able to more than halve the training time of the considered offline algorithms on standard benchmarks, and surprisingly also achieve greater stability. We further build on the importance of having consistent policy and value functions to propose novel hybrid algorithms, TD3+BC+CQL and EDAC+BC, that regularize \textit{both} the actor and the critic towards the behavior policy. This helps to more reliably improve on the behavior policy when learning from limited human demonstrations

### Rating

### Rating Number

### Confidence
4: You are confident in your assessment, but not absolutely certain. It is unlikely, but not impossible, that you did not understand some parts of the submission or that you are unfamiliar with some pieces of related work.

### Summary
The authors in this paper consider pretraining the critic function using a mix of objectives of Monte-Carlo estimation and TD estimation of Q values from offline data and then train both the critic function and with policy with standard offline algorithms such as  TD3+BC. The empirical results demonstrate that such a training pipeline would help the latter training and make the policy learning converges faster.

### Strengths
- The authors show a toy example at the beginning of the paper, which demonstrates the intuition why the pertaining of the critic function might help for later offline policy and critic learning.
- The idea is simple to follow and not hard to implement. 
- The authors evaluate the idea on both simple offline benchmark environments such as mujoco, and also hard ones, such as Adroit environments. Demonstrate that the proposed method can be helpful for both simple and complex scenarios. 
- A detailed ablation study has been done in the appendix to make sure the proposed idea is valid and indeed helps the latter offline training.

### Weaknesses
 - The pretraining stage increases the complexity of the overall training pipeline. From the training curve, we can see that the training converges faster than that without the pertaining, but almost for each environment, the performance would first drop and then begin to improve, which is quite weird in terms of robustness for the training. 
- The authors did not provide the training curves of policy learning on hard environments, which makes me wonder if the performance drop would be even larger than that of standard mujoco environments.


### Questions
- Please explain the performance drop phenomenon in detail. 
- Please provide the training curves on hard environments such as Adroit. 
- Please explain why the pertaining steps are different for different environments, is that a hyperparameter? 
- I wonder if the pertaining loss can be a regularization loss in additional to previous regularization loss, maybe in this way we can make sure the whole training is more robust and the training curve would be more smooth.

### Summary
Off-policy reinforcement learning is able to further improve the offline RL performance while suffering from instability and inefficiency. This works propose to bridge the supervised approach and the off-policy approach aiming for a more stable offline RL. The key innovation is the pre-training of the critic using a supervised Monte-Carlo value-error, which leverages information from offline data. This step provides a consistent actor and critic for off-policy TD-learning. The experiments on D4RL MuJoCo benchmark show that the proposed method is more stable and efficient during the offline training comparing with other method, such as behavior cloning and TD3.  Meanwhile the results in Adroit shows the proposed method can achieve good performance for most of the tasks.

### Strengths
1. This paper is well-motivated and focuses on an important problem in offline RL.
2. The proposed method is easy to understand and shown to perform well comparing with previous methods.

### Weaknesses
1.  The motivation example is rather unnecessary due to its simplicity
2.  The consistence of the actor and critic networks play critical roles in the proposed method, while it is unclear how much degree of consistence is needed in order to make it work well for off-policy training? If it is possible to derive any explicit criteria on this matter?

### Questions
1. How do you choose the pretraining phase steps, e.g. different environments choose different pretraining steps in Figure 2. What is the impact of the pretraining steps on the final performance?
2. What is the main reason for the huge performance drop in Walker2d-edium-EDAC?
3. What is the computation complexity for the pretraining phase? Does it exceed a lot comparing with the offline training?

### Summary
The paper presents an approach that combines supervised learning and off-policy reinforcement learning to enhance efficiency and stability. This is achieved through pre-training the critic using a supervised Monte-Carlo value-error and applying regularization to both the actor and the critic. The results demonstrate a reduction in training time and improved learning efficiency.

### Strengths
* Utilizing Monte-Carlo estimation as the initialization for offline RL is reasonable, yet it is ignored in prior works.
* The efficacy of the proposed method is demonstrated through experiments conducted on MuJoCo and Adroit tasks.
* Implementation details are provided in the Appendix.

### Weaknesses
 * First of all, the overall structure and writing of this paper necessitate meticulous reorganization and refinement. Some paragraph is confusing and hard to follow due to poor organization. Especially in Section 4 and Section 5, the important conclusion in these paragraphs need to be highlighted and summarized. In Section 5, the transition from Monte Carlo (MC) pretraining to emphasizing both actor and critic regularization is perplexing, especially since these regularization are not introduced in the methods section. And the title "Application to Adroit Environments" is incongruous as the methodology differs from the prior parts.

* The two parts of pretraining and regularization that the authors want to underscore appear to be incremental additions rather than naturally integrated components. This disjointed presentation detracts from the coherence of the paper and needs to be addressed.

* Regarding the methodology, the paper's primary emphasis appears to be on the use of Monte Carlo (MC) estimates as pretraining targets. However, the results in Appendix A.3 indicate that the efficiency and performance during pretraining stem from the Behavioral Cloning (BC) loss rather than MC. MC only contributes to stability during subsequent fine-tuning. Furthermore, in Section 5, the authors assert that pretraining is less critical than both regularization techniques. Consequently, I am unconvinced about the significance of this work.

*  The experiments are also limited in variety of dataset types and domains. For instance, BC pretraining may depend on data quality; therefore, additional dataset types such as "medium-replay" and "random" datasets are necessary to substantiate the importance of this work. Moreover, further ablation studies are required to validate the paper's claims. Current results in Figures 3, 5, and 6, which only base on a single dataset, are unconvincing. Additionally, the inclusion of more domains, such as AntMaze, would be beneficial.

### Questions
* Revise the structure and refine the writing to make the conclusions and emphasized information more evident.

*  The two parts of the methods seem to be added incrementally rather than integrated as natural components. The authors need to improve the presentation to address this problem.

* The reviewer finds the significance of the MC pretraining unconvincing based on the results in Appendix A.3 and Section 5.

* How is the performance of the pretraining approach on "medium-replay" and "random" datasets?

* It is necessary to conduct more ablation experiments with additional environments.

* How does pretraining and the regularizations perform on the AntMaze domain?
