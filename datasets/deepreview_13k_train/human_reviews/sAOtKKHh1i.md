# Subwords as Skills: Tokenization for Sparse-Reward Reinforcement Learning

- Decision: Reject
- Scores: 6, 5, 3, 6

## Abstract
Exploration in sparse-reward reinforcement learning (RL) is difficult due to the need for long, coordinated sequences of actions in order to achieve any reward. Skill learning, from demonstrations or interaction, is a promising approach to address this, but skill extraction and inference are expensive for current methods. We present a novel method to extract skills from demonstrations for use in sparse-reward RL, inspired by the popular Byte-Pair Encoding (BPE) algorithm in natural language processing. With these skills, we show strong performance in a variety of tasks, 1000$\times$ acceleration for skill-extraction and 100$\times$ acceleration for policy inference. Given the simplicity of our method, skills extracted from 1\% of the demonstrations in one task can be transferred to a new loosely related task. We also note that such a method yields a finite set of interpretable behaviors.

### Summary
This paper proposes using the recently popularised byte-pair encoding strategy for tokenising in NLP to tackle the exploration problem in deep RL. This involves the key steps of collecting a dataset of demonstrations, discretising actions, tokenising them, and then using this tokenised action space to learn a policy using any RL algorithm. Their approach demonstrates better performance on many different environments than some other RL and HRL baselines.

### Strengths
- The main strength of this paper is that this is a neat idea that borrows insights from another field (NLP in this case) to propose an innovative and intuitive solution to one of the main challenges in HRL.
- The results indicate that this approach shows better performance than the other baselines in several sparse-reward environments.
- The details regarding implementation of the approach and baselines, resources used, wall clock time, and hyperparameters provided in the Appendix are quite exhaustive and will greatly help with reproducibility.

### Weaknesses
 - Algorithm 1 could be presented in a much clearer way by adding comments for each of the steps and what each of the variables means.
- I am unclear on why the mean vector for each subword is calculated in this way. Is there prior work that does it this particular way, or is it a design decision? Maybe this can be elaborated in the paper.
- I think some important ablations should have been included in the experiments:
    - Clustering-only: how far can you go with pure discretisation of the action space, without learning skills?
    - Alternate tokenisation strategy: if instead of having a preference for longer skills/subwords, what would the performance look like if the size of each skill was fixed? ($N_{max}$ seems to have been varied across environments, per the appendix, so this would also be an interesting ablation).
- The description of the type of data used in each environment is missing in the main text (it is present in the appendix). Given that the appendix mentions that the ant maze data consists of poor samples, whereas the kitchen data consists of nearly perfect demonstration, this design decision warrants an explanation/analysis in the main text.
- There is some explanation in the appendix regarding the choice of vocabulary size for the different environments, but it is tied to the choice of data used for tokenisation. It would be nice to see a separate ablation experiment for this hyperparameter.

### Questions
- The paper mentions that for frequency-based merging, the longest subword is selected and all its constituent subwords are pruned. My understanding is that this biases the approach in favour of longer subwords/skills. Could you confirm?
- From Table 1, it appears that frequency-based merging has little to no impact on performance; the key gains seem to be coming from distance-based merging. Since distance-based merging entails knowledge of the environment in that we want agents to cover longer distances through their actions, is it fair to compare this approach with the other baselines (SSP/SFP/SAC)?
- Why did the kitchen dataset consist of expert demonstrations, when the other datasets did not?
- Did you perform any analysis/have any insights on the frequency of usage of each skill for a trained policy?

### Summary
This paper presents a method for discovering skills by first discretizing the action space through clustering, and then leveraging a tokenization technique borrowed from NLP to generate temporally extended action. The skills discovered by the proposed method supports better exploration that lead to better performance than baselines in sparse-reward settings.

### Strengths
This paper presents a novel idea for discovering skills borrowing the idea of tokenization from NLP. The learned skills from offline dataset provides rich exploration behavior for online RL. The proposed method is simple but effective, especially for sparse reward RL tasks. Experiments in the ant maze domain also demonstrate the generalization capability of learned skills.

### Weaknesses
One major weakness of the proposed approach is that discretization removes resolution from the action space, which can be detrimental in settings that require the full range of actions, such as fast locomotion or precise manipulation. Experiments demonstrating this failure mode would be useful for the audience to understand this limitation. Specifically, the authors should explore how the number of clusters affects performance in tasks requiring fine motor control, and how this discretization impacts the ability to achieve optimal policies. Additionally, execution of the identified skills is currently open loop, which can lead to inefficient and unsafe exploration. The lack of termination conditions for the learned skills means that the agent may execute skills for too long or in inappropriate situations, leading to suboptimal behavior. At the same time, the merging process used in the approach may be too computationally expensive to perform in high-dimensional visual input domains. The authors should provide a more detailed analysis of the computational cost of the merging process, particularly as the dimensionality of the input space increases. The authors discuss these limitations and suggested potential solutions, but they still represent significant challenges to the practical application of the approach.

Skill discovery is important beyong RL settings, more experiments and discussions on applying tokenized skills for imitation learning tasks would also be interesting. Imitation-based methods should also be considered as baselines in the experiments. The current evaluation focuses solely on RL performance, but it would be valuable to see how the learned skills perform in an imitation learning setting, especially given the method's reliance on offline data. This would help to better understand the generalizability of the learned skills. The success of skill discovery seems heavily dependent on the provided dataset, it would be useful to vary the diversity of the offline dataset to test the limitations of the method. It is unclear how the quality of the offline dataset impacts the learned skills, and the authors should investigate this dependency by training skills on datasets with varying amounts of noise and suboptimality.

### Summary
This paper proposes to extract skills from offline dataset via tokenization, providing temporal abstractions for downstream RL. The continuous actions in the dataset are clustered into discrete tokens. Then, similar to the tokenization in NLP, consecutive tokens are merged into new tokens recursively and some tokens are pruned. The paper proposes a metric based on change of the observation caused by the action token to select tokens to merge and prune. Experiments in AntMaze, Kitchen and CoinRun shows that the method outperforms some state-free skill learning baselines and vanilla SAC. The method also has advantages in computation efficiency, exploration ability, and domain generalization compared with baselines.

### Strengths
1. This paper brings a novel idea that uses the technique of tokenization in NLP to provide temporal abstract actions for RL.

2. The experiments evaluate various aspects of the proposed method, including performance, computation efficiency, exploration behavior, and domain generalization, which are all important for skill learning methods.

### Weaknesses
1. About paper writing: In Introduction, the background of RL and exploration is too long, while the study only  focuses on the topic of skill discovery from data, which has been extensively studied. In Related Work, the section of "Skill Learning from Interaction" is also unnecessary because it is in parallel with your topic. 

2. About the observation distance-based score: Since it is complicated and lacks a theoretical explanation, more intuitive explanations or visualization is needed to illustrate this formula. In many domains with image observations, partial observations or complicated robotic tasks, the Euclidean distance in the observation space may not work. The paper does not address the sensitivity of the tokenization process to the choice of distance metric or the potential impact on downstream task performance.

3. Soundness of experiments:
- Lack a state-based baseline in Table 1 experiments, like SPiRL. SPiRL reaches a return of 2.9 [1] in Kitchen, which outperforms the proposed method a lot. It may also perform well in other environments. The paper does not adequately justify the choice of baselines, particularly the absence of a strong state-based skill learning method, making it difficult to assess the relative advantages and disadvantages of the proposed approach.
- Training curves of returns are usually required for RL experiments, which depict both performance and sample efficiency. However, this paper only presents the return at the end of training in Table 1, which can be doubtful due to the instability of RL algorithms. The data in Table 1 have large variance and are therefore unreliable. The lack of training curves makes it impossible to assess the learning dynamics and stability of the proposed method, which is critical for evaluating its practical applicability. The reported standard deviations are often as large as the means, indicating high variability in performance, which is concerning without further analysis of the learning process.

4. Lack the discussion of disadvantages of state-free skills: The paper emphasizes the generalization ability of state-free skills, but ignores its disadvanteges. State-free methods are inefficient on large datasets with diverse behaviors, since a large skill space is required to model all the behaviors. In this case, state-conditioned methods like SPiRL can model possible behaviors based on the state, thus providing a compact skill space. The paper also lacks such study on the influence of data diversity. The paper does not explore the limitations of state-free skills in scenarios with highly diverse datasets, where the required skill space might become excessively large and inefficient, potentially hindering performance compared to state-conditioned methods.

### Questions
1. I suggest that the author revise the paper to introduce the topic of skill discovery more directly and give a problem formulation before the section of Method.

2. In action space clustering, the number of clusters is very small ( $2\times d_{act}$ is less than 20 in AntMaze and Kitchen). Is this because the agent behavior in the dataset is not diverse? 
If the dataset is large or collected by various stochastic policies, a small number of clusters can make the discretized actions unable to complete the task. In this case, do we need a number of tokens proportional to $2^{d_{act}}$?

3: You are fairly confident in your assessment. It is possible that you did not understand some parts of the submission or that you are unfamiliar with some pieces of related work. Math/other details were not carefully checked.

### Summary
The authors propose a method to build a set of skills from a set of demonstrations by discretizing the action space, identifying elementary tokens and binding these tokens together into skills. The corresponding skills are not conditioned on an input state. The authors show that their method is faster to learn and more efficient than relevant baselines in a variety of ant-maze demonstrations, Kitchen demonstrations and CoinRun.

After a first of changes performed by the authors, I moved my score from 5 to 6.

### Strengths
- The authors made a set of clever design choices to get an efficient method: learning from demonstrations, discretizing actions, learning skills without training a neural network, avoiding conditioning on states or observations.

- They performed a good bibliographic study and identified relevant baselines

- The experimental study addresses good questions

### Weaknesses
 - Several points are unclear (see questions below)

- Some important results which do not speak in favor of the method are deferred to the appendices

- The related work in the main paper could be more focused (see below)

If the authors manage to produce a next version that properly answers my questions below, I will be happy to switch my evaluation towards acceptance.

### Questions

- In Table 1, are the antmaze results obtained by conditioning on the state or on images observations? I suspect this is the state. If I'm right, how did you adapt SSP and SFP, which are designed to work with images? Isn't this comparison unfair, since SSP and SFP, which are designed to work with images?
- Still in Table 1, I was wondering why you did not compare to SpiRL and SpiRL-cl, which are defined in the same paper as SSP (SSP is a sort of ablation of SpiRL). After reading Appendix G, it happens that you did so, but the results speak less in favor of your method. This is somewhat unfair.
- From the above 2 questions and remarks, my feeling is that to be fair, the main paper should have two tables like Table 1, one with learning from states and one with learning from images, where the separation of baselines and the environments all make sense. Eventually, if you don't have enough room, I think you could move all SSP results to an Appendix, as SSP is just an ablation of SPiRL. The fact that your method does not establish a new SOTA on all these results does not matter much, it has interesting enough features to deserve publication if properly presented.
- In Table 3, SFP looks faster than SSP, whereas the paper seems to mention the contrary in several places. Can you clarify this?
- Is Table 3 obtained when learning from images or from states?
In Table 1 (and/or 3 and/or 9), it would ne nice to specifiy the number of obtained skills with your methods and the baselines. If this is a hyper-parameter, this should be made clear too. 
- I did not find a list of hyper-parameters of your method. BTW, it would be nice to give a name to your method.
 
- Section 4.2 could be made clearer. At first read, it is unclear whether you are (1) using RL "from scratch", (2) you are learning from a dataset of demonstrations or (3) something intermediate. My guess is that up to the first half of the second paragraph, you speak about (1). But then, after "Moreover", you speak about weaknesses of SFP and SSP in the context of (2), without proper articulation of the ideas. And the remark about SAC goes back to (1). Again, Figure 5 displays "state visitation" of your method, but if your method is learning from a dataset, this makes no sense. All this must be clarified, including the title of the section.
- Note also at the end of the paragraph: "the large error bars of our method are a result of an optimization failure", we don't have pictures with error bars in the paper, just std info in some tables.

### Local issues

- Figs 1 and 3 are not much informative, particularly Fig. 1b is not readable

- The first paragraph of Section 4.1 is more about related work than about experiment. I think you should have a more focused related work section (mostly the "learning skills from demonstration" part) where you can give more details about these methods and reject what is less relevant into an Appendix. Another approach is to have a "Baselines" section where you describe the baselines with enough details so as to make the point you made in this paragraph.

- I appreciate the honesty of Appendix F, but it cast doubts on the validity of your results. As advocated in [1], if you don't have the compute to get statistically valid results, work on cheaper tasks :)
