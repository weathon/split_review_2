# Active Procedure Planning with Uncertainty-awareness in Instructional Videos

- Decision: Reject
- Scores: 6, 5, 6

## Abstract
Procedure planning involves the generation of a sequence of steps that bring a specific start state to the desired goal state. Both states are given as visual observations in the case of planning from instructional videos. This is a challenging task due to ambiguities in the visual representations of states and variations arising from multiple feasible plans. Existing approaches address these challenges by adopting strong visual representation learning methods and sophisticated reasoning mechanisms. However, the decision process is passive in the sense that both the visual observations and the reasoning process are fixed during the planning phase. In this paper, we propose an active procedure planning approach that takes account of uncertainties arising from imperfect visual observations and task plan variations. In particular, we develop quantitative metrics to evaluate task uncertainty and use them to guide the selection of additional visual observations. Empirical results show that visual observations driven by uncertainty-awareness lead to significantly higher performance gain compared to opportunistic visual observations. The findings are useful for developing trusted and explainable AI models for procedure planning.

### Summary
The conventional instructional video procedure planning problem aims to predict a sequence of action steps that can drive the current visual state toward the goal visual state. The authors of this paper argue that visual observations and the reasoning process are fixed (i.e., kept constant) throughout the planning process, which fails to account for the interactivity of agents and uncertainty that typically arises in the real world.

The paper proposes active procedure planning in instructional videos; in this setting, agents (e.g., a planning model) can make additional intermediate observations to disambiguate the states and constrain the planning trajectories during testing. The central challenge then becomes how to select a subset of intermediate additional observations to enhance planning accuracy while keeping the cost within a predefined budget. The proposed approach is uncertainty-aware, meaning an agent will use additional observations only when there is uncertainty. This is achieved by measuring the uncertainty arising from task sequence variation and the uncertainty related to the model's prediction confidence.

Experimental results provide empirical evidence regarding the effect of active procedure planning with uncertainty awareness on the accuracy of the generated plans.

### Strengths
The paper introduces active procedure planning, a novel problem setup that provides a unique lens on the task of procedure planning in instructional videos. The motivations and ideas behind this paper are sound and convincing. Additionally, the proposed uncertainty-aware approach is innovative.

The contributions of this paper are fairly substantial. For instance, the methodology represents a paradigm shift in procedure planning in instructional videos, transitioning from passive reasoning to a more dynamic and adaptive form of learning and reasoning.

Furthermore, the paper is well-written, providing an enjoyable and enlightening read.

### Weaknesses
Some methodology and technical details are not clear, and some analyses are missing (e.g., efficiency-efficacy trade-off); see Questions below.

Specifically, the paper does not explicitly state that the proposed active procedure planning requires annotations of intermediate observations during both training and testing. This is a significant requirement that should be clearly stated, as it differs from typical procedure planning setups where only start and goal observations are needed. Furthermore, the paper lacks a thorough analysis of the computational overhead associated with the proposed method. While the authors mention an uncertainty threshold for triggering the use of additional observations, the computational cost of this process is not quantified in terms of inference time and memory usage. This is crucial because the active planning approach introduces a conditional execution path, which could significantly impact efficiency, especially when compared to passive planning approaches that only use start and goal observations.

### Questions
1. How have you incorporated the active planning mechanism into the diffusion-based procedure planning models? That is, how does the inference model depicted in Figure 2 accommodate the additional set S? The model architecture was not originally designed or trained to accept additional visual observations. What modifications did you implement for these models? Are the adjustments you made easily transferable to non-diffusion model-based procedure planning models?

2. While additional visual observations lead to improvements in the generated procedure plans, they also increase the computational burden. There is a clear efficiency-performance tradeoff, yet an analysis of this is currently absent. Could you quantify the increase in inference time and memory usage incurred while achieving performance gains?

3. From an application standpoint, how realistic or significant is the proposed active procedure planning setup? How could additional intermediate visual observations be made available at the time of testing? Conventional procedure planning is understandable, as one can envision a scenario where a human provides a robot with a photo of available ingredients (initial visual observation) and a photo of a prepared dish (goal visual observation), asking the robot to generate a sequence of steps as the procedure plan. However, it is challenging to imagine how a robot could access intermediate additional visual observations when it is uncertain in the aforementioned application scenario.

### Summary
The paper proposes a heuristic to guide the selection of additional visual observations for procedure planning.

### Strengths
+ Originality: The paper proposes a entropy-based criterion to model the uncertainty of task sequence variation and considers using temperature scaling to calibrate the confidence score.
+ Clarity: The presentation is in general clear and easy to follow.

### Weaknesses
 - Quality & significance:

i) The prediction confidence score is proposed and used without further justification. How do the authors determine the temperature used for calibration? Is there any evidence that the final score is truly calibrated with temperature scaling on the selected datasets?

ii) The proposed uncertainty score for task sequence variation seems over-simplified. First, it is a direct application of the definition of entropy. Second, the proposed score is only useful when the testing cases have the (a_1, a_T) tuple seen during training. How does the proposed score deal with the scenario where a_1 and a_T are seen during training, but their combination (a_1, a_T) are unseen?

iii) Considering the simplicity of the proposed method, the experiment set-ups are not comprehensive and convincing. To be specific, the authors only consider adding one additional visual observation for all the experiments. It is necessary to consider adding more observations and examine the effectiveness of the proposed method under that circumstance.

iv) The baseline model is not a good competitor. Randomly selecting additional observations is expected to perform poorly. Also, it is unclear how this random selection is performed. Since there is only one additional observation allowed (the one near the temporal center of the video clip), I would assume that in this set-up the model randomly decides whether to include this observation or not. This could be explicitly mentioned in the text.
