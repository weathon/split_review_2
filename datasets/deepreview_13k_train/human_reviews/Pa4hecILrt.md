# Incremental Successive Halving for Hyperparameter Optimization with Budget Constraints

- Decision: Reject
- Scores: 3, 5, 3, 3

## Abstract
Hyperparameter optimization (HPO) is indispensable for achieving optimal performance in machine learning tasks. While some approaches focus on sampling more promising hyperparameter configurations, methods based on the successive halving algorithm (SHA) focus on efficiently evaluating hyperparameter configurations through the adaptive allocation of evaluation resources and stopping unpromising candidates early. Yet, SHA comes with several hyperparameters itself, one of which is the maximum budget that can be allocated to evaluate a single hyperparameter configuration. Asynchronous extensions of SHA (ASHA) devise a strategy of autonomously increasing the maximum budget and simultaneously allowing for better parallelization. However, while working well in practice with many considered hyperparameter configurations, there are limitations to the soundness of these adaptations when the overall budget for HPO is limited. This paper provides a theoretical analysis of ASHA in applications with budget constraints. We propose incremental SHA (iSHA), a synchronous extension of SHA, allowing to increment the maximum budget. A theoretical and empirical analysis of iSHA shows that soundness is maintained while guaranteeing to be more resource-efficient than SHA. In an extensive set of experiments, we also demonstrate that, in general, iSHA performs superior to ASHA and progressive ASHA.

### Summary
The authors propose iterative successive halving (iSHA) as an extension to the successive halving algorithm which extends an original run of SHA to a higher maximum resource by reusing computation of partially trained configurations.  The authors study iSHA and shows in the limit it can achieve 1/\eta savings over SHA where \eta is the promotion rate.   Finally, the authors propose an incremental version of Hyperband which comes with same guarantees as Hyperband.  Experiments comparing iSHA to
SHA and a more resource efficient variant of ASHA called Progressive ASHA (PASHA) shows iSHA to outperform more frequently in terms of speed and selection quality.

### Strengths
The primarily strength of this paper is it's a simple and intuitive extension to SHA/Hyperband.  The theoretical analysis of ASHA provides insight in the budget constrained setting but the rate of incorrect promotions for ASHA gets smaller with larger set of configurations unless configurations are drawn adversarially.

### Weaknesses
- The speedup of iSHA over SHA is effectively upper-bounded by 1/eta so benefit of the extension is somewhat incremental.
- Experiments are limited to fairly simple surrogate benchmark.  I encourage the authors to evaluate iSHA on more challenging benchmarks like NASBench201 and NASBench301.
- The authors exclude a comparison to ASHA with resumption, which with SHA, are one of the two baselines to beat.

### Questions
- What are the mean and standard deviation of iSHA and PASHA on the benchmarks studied?
- How dependent is iSHA on \eta?  How do results look for \eta=4?
- PASHA paper showed much more significant speedups than ASHA on the benchmarks they evaluated.  Why are the speedups in the empirical section of this paper much more limited?

### Summary
Most state-of-the-art multi-fidelity methods rely on successive halving as a sub-routine to allocate resources to the evaluation of hyperparameter configurations. The idea is to evaluate a set of configurations for a minimum resource budget, e.g. one epoch, and then to discard the worst half and continue the better half for twice as much budget. This process is iterated until either only a single configuration survives or until some maximum budget is reached.

While very successful in practice, a caveat of successive halving is how to set the minimum and maximum budget before the optimization process starts. For example, setting the maximum budget too small might lead to premature termination of hyperparameter configurations, whereas too large values lead to a high resource consumption. This paper presents a modification of successive halving that allows adapting the maximum budget during optimization, such that a previous run of successive halving is continued without rerunning previous evaluated configurations.

### Strengths
- The visualizations in Figure 1 and the pseudo code help a lot to understand the proposed method.

- Overall, I found the paper to be well written and clearly structured.

### Weaknesses
- While I personally found the paper easy to follow, uninitiated readers might have some troubles to understand the paper in detail, since it uses a lot of jargon (e.g what means budget for for evaluating a hyperparameter configuration)


- I think the paper needs to better motivate the proposed approach. First, the introduction lists all the relevant hyperparameters of successive halving but the proposed method only adapts the maximum budget. It's not clear why this is more important to adapt than, for instance, the minimum budget. The paper would benefit from discussing this choice. 
It would also be helpful if the paper could show some realistic use cases where it is unclear how to set the maximum budget or where a poorly chosen maximum budget leads to severe performance loss. Especially given that most benchmarks in the literature provide a predefined maximum budget, demonstrating scenarios where this causes issues would strengthen the motivation. 




- The empirical evaluation in the paper could be strengthened in a few ways:
First, directly comparing the proposed method to ASHA would make the results more convincing, rather than just reporting PASHA outperforms ASHA from the previous work. Reproducing a comparison to ASHA demonstrates good scientific practice.  
Second, while the method achieves a reduction in runtime compared to SHA, the decreases are relatively modest at 25% for η=2 and 15% for η=3. Providing additional experiments on more complex tasks/datasets could help show if the benefits of PASHA scale to more difficult optimization problems.

### Questions
- Figure 3: Could you also mark the mean or median in these plots?

 - How often is the maximum budget increased? Is it always increased after each bracket, or can it also be kept fixed?


### Typos:
- \eta = 85% I guess it should mean \eta = 3

### Summary
The paper presents a new method called incremental Successive Halving Algorithm (iSHA) to extend an existing hyperparameter optimization process done with Successive Halving (SH). When the expansion factor eta=2, iSHA doubles the budget and creates new brackets by filling the lowest level of the existing bracket with randomly sampled new hyperparameter configurations. It then completes each bracket using the SH algorithm. This allows partial reuse of previous runs, speeding up the process. 

The paper also provides theoretical analysis for both ASHA and iSHA. Experiments comparing iSHA to PASHA are done on four different search spaces. Overall, iSHA allows seamlessly continuing an SH hyperparameter optimization run by efficiently reusing previous evaluations.

### Strengths
The authors propose an approach to address the tricky issue of selecting hyperparameters for hyperparameter optimization methods, particularly when the choices can strongly impact final performance. Their idea of increasing the R parameter in SH at lower cost could be useful for practitioners. 

To build confidence in their method, the authors provide theoretical analysis. They also analyze ASHA in a similar theoretical manner.

### Weaknesses
The method to continue SH is relatively straight-forward. Other equally simple methods are not discussed. Just one example: Assume we have 2N completed brackets and we want to increase the budget from R to 2R. What we could do is merge the 2N brackets into N brackets and only run SH for the newly introduced level. Then continue with SH as usual.

The claim that their method outperforms ASHA lacks evidence. The asynchronous issues with ASHA are less relevant given the massive parallelization speedups. In my opinion, the fact that iSHA is synchronous is a strong limitation.

The empirical analysis in the paper focuses only on PASHA, SH, and iSHA. However, it would strengthen the work to include the following additional baselines for comparison:

- ASHA: As the authors mention, ASHA is an important algorithm to include. Its performance compared to PASHA, SH and iSHA should be analyzed. If ASHA was already included and I missed it, please point me to where it is discussed.

- Training top k configurations (for k=1,...): Evaluating performance when simply training the top k configurations found by SH for a larger budget would provide a naive but fast and likely competitive baseline. This would demonstrate the value of more sophisticated methods like iSHA. 

- Naive continued SH: An additional baseline could be to continue SH and ignore that previous runs are incomplete. If the configuration with highest val score happens to be among the incomplete ones, just train until completion.


Comparing only accuracy or budget is insufficient - a scatter plot on budget vs performance axes, counting the number of times one method dominates the other, would be better.

Figure 3 is unreadable. It's impossible to quantify dots above or below the 0 line.

Overall, the empirical methodology needs more baselines and better evaluation metrics to demonstrate advantages. In particular, a comparison to ASHA is missing.

### Questions
How do you continue configurations? From scratch or from a checkpoint? Given some of the benchmarks, I assume the former.

### Summary
The work introduces a way on how to extend the maximal budget for Successive Halving without starting from scratch, but by reusing the information from the previous run. The authors provide a theoretical analysis and empirical results, where they compare against one related baseline and provide extensive results on 3 diverse benchmarks comprising 378 tasks.

### Strengths
- Extensive results on 3 diverse tabular benchmarks.

### Weaknesses
- **Writing is very unclear** (A few examples out of many): 
    
    **In Section 5:** the manuscript refers to Algorithm 1 and then continues with $S$, $C_0$ without describing them. 
    
    **Algorithm 1**: $(C_k)_k$ is not explained and $k$ is not defined, while additionally it is added twice. Only later in the manuscript, $C_k$ is defined as rungs.

    **Section 7.1:** Hyperband is mentioned, but the plot shows iSHA and PASHA, I am not sure how to understand the sentence.
    
- While the authors do mention sample and evaluation efficiency in the related work, they do not provide an introduction to methods that combine both. For example, model-based methods that do not adhere to a SHA schedule [1][2] but use a dynamic budget allocation, or methods that sample the fidelities together with the hyperparameter configurations [3].
    
    **As such, I consider the related work rather incomplete.**
- Only one baseline is included in the experiments.
- I believe the future belongs to methods that do not follow a static schedule, but a dynamic one. Since with a static schedule, even if a hyperparameter configuration were to diverge/stagnate, one would still need to follow the schedule. As such I believe the work will not have an impact in the field.
- Considering the SHA schedule, there are 2 parts, the max budget and the min budget that a configuration will be run to evaluate the performance (the min budget in this case would correspond to the first rung). The authors describe how to increase the max budget, when there is already an existing run, in this example, one could reuse the results from before instead of running everything from scratch. However, what is more important in my perspective, is how to define the $r_{min}$ for the initial run, since that is the fidelity that should be representative of the performance of a hyperparameter configuration.

### Questions
- **"state-of-the-art algorithm PASHA"**

    Based on what results is PASHA state-of-the-art?
- Could the authors provide a few descriptive statistics on what is the mean improvement and mean degradation for iSHA and PASHA?
- I would recommend the authors to reinforce the related work with the most recent practices regarding multi-fidelity BO.
- I would suggest the authors to update the manuscript and improve readability.
- I would additionally recommend the authors to include more baselines in the experiments.
