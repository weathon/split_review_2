## Abstract
Maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) flows 
suffer from high computational costs in large scale computations.
In this paper, we show that MMD flows with Riesz kernels $K(x,y) = - \|x-y\|^r$, $r \in (0,2)$
have exceptional properties which allow their efficient computation.
We prove that the MMD of Riesz kernels, which is
also known as energy distance, coincides with the MMD of their sliced version.
As a consequence, the computation of gradients of MMDs can be performed in the one-dimensional setting.
Here, for $r=1$, a simple sorting algorithm can be applied to reduce the complexity
from $O(MN+N^2)$ to $O((M+N)\log(M+N))$ 
for two  measures with $M$ and $N$ support points.
As another interesting follow-up result, the MMD of compactly supported measures
can be estimated from above and below by the Wasserstein-1 distance.
For the implementations we approximate the gradient of the sliced MMD by using only a finite number $P$ of slices. 
We show that the resulting error has complexity \smash{$O(\sqrt{d/P})$}, where $d$ is the data dimension. 
These results enable us to train generative models by approximating MMD gradient flows by neural networks even
for image applications. We demonstrate the efficiency of our model by image generation on MNIST, FashionMNIST and CIFAR10.

### Summary
The work proposed to use sliced MMD with Riesz kernel  to compute MMD gradients for generative model training. The authors introduced the Riesz kernel with its sliced version in section 2 and show that  sliced version is actually the Riesz kernel. Section 3 showed how to compute gradients of sliced MMD in one-dimensional space by its special property of ordering projected data. Section 4 presented MMD flows. The author demonstrated their methods in section 5 with MNIST, FashionMNIST and CIFAR10 datasets.

### Strengths
The paper is easy to follow and read. 
The proposed method is simple and computational efficient. 
The experiment results showed an improvement of FID in MNIST and FashionMNIST data sets.

### Weaknesses
All the theory part is quite simple, specially the important theorem 1, which proved that the Sliced Riesz kernel is an equivalent form of Riesz kernel. I have the same impression for the sorting algorithm in 1-D case and results of error bound for stochastic MMD gradient in theorem 4. 

The experimental part is very limited with few experiments. The methods is shown to work with simple data sets like MNIST and FashionMNIST, when they considered a much more complicated-structure data set like CIFAR10, then its FID is quite bad compared to NCSN and WGAN.  

I do not find both theory and application part strong enough for publication.

### Summary
The paper is dedicated to the question: how to estimate a gradient of the MMD distance between two empirical distributions w.r.t. points of the first distribution. The MMD distance is a natural distance between distributions, using which one can solve generative modeling problems. So the latter computational problem is quite important for generative modeling based on kernels. It is shown that the MMD distance defined by the Riesz kernel has a very special structure, namely that the so-called sliced Riesz distance coincides with the MMD distance.
This allows one to estimate the gradient very precisely because one can take few 1-dimensional projections of empirical points and calculate an averaged sliced MMD. Based on that, authors design a generative modeling algorithm (described in the Appendix as Algorithm 3). Their algorithm performs well, taking into account Table 1, though which part of their algorithm is mainly responsible for such a promising outcome is a non-trivial issue.

### Strengths
Major theoretical claims are correct, and proofs seem convincing, though I have not checked all of them.

### Weaknesses
The paper is dedicated to accelerating the computation of the gradient of the sliced MMD with the Riesz kernel. Experiments are dedicated to a new algorithm for generative modeling (Algorithm 3 described in Appendix). A natural question appears: what is responsible for good results on MNIST/FashionMNIST/CIFAR10? Is it the sequential approach to train MMD flows, or the fact that gradients are estimated better, or the fact that Riesz kernel defines such a special MMD, or maybe specifics of architecture of neural networks Ф_1, ..., Ф_L (modified from some previous work)?

For me, it is hard to make a judgment of what these experimental results really mean. There are too many ingredients there. It is unclear how much each component contributes to the observed performance. For example, the sequential training approach could be beneficial regardless of the specific MMD gradient approximation, and the choice of UNet architecture could also play a significant role. Without a more detailed ablation study, it is difficult to isolate the impact of the proposed gradient approximation method.

### Questions
A natural question: is the Riesz kernel so special, that the MMD distance induced by it leads to successful generative modeling? Or your algorithm for an accurate approximation of gradient is responsible for success?

### Summary
This article focuses on MMD flows with a Riesz kernel that is the distance between points raised to a power $r \in (0,2)$. The main contributions are, firstly, to demonstrate that this kernel is identical (up to a constant) to its 'sliced' version and, secondly, to use this characterization for the efficient computation of gradients in MMD flows.

### Strengths
I find this article to be well-written and its contributions to be interesting. Efficient MMD computation is indeed an important point, not only for MMD flows. The article addresses an important problem and offers an elegant solution for Riesz kernels. However, there are several points that appear to need correction or, at the very least, further elaboration.

### Weaknesses
 - Concerning Theorem 2:

Theorem 2 establishes bounds between MMD and Wasserstein distance of order 1. In my opinion, these results are not very sharp, and there appears to be an important missing reference here. Under the same assumptions of compact support, the article [1, Theorem 1] demonstrates that the Wasserstein distance $W_1$ is bounded by an MMD with the Coulomb kernel $k(x, y) = -|x - y|^{2-d}$ but without the power dependency of $1/(d+1)$. Since the measures are bounded, MMD with the Riesz kernel and the Coulomb kernel are related by a constant (dependent on the dimension) on the support of the measures. Therefore, it seems important to mention this result and discuss its relevance.

In a more general sense, I'm having trouble grasping the significance of these bounds for the current article. They don't appear to be entirely novel, and more importantly, they are not utilized subsequently, neither theoretically nor practically, nor in the discussion.

- Regarding Theorem 3:

Theorem 3 is the main contribution of this article, and I agree that it is interesting and significant. However, there is a minor point that needs clarification: while the function $E$ is shown to be differentiable everywhere in the proof, for the differentiability of $V$, the authors use an argument that doesn't seem rigorous. Indeed, the function $x \to |x-y|$ is not differentiable at $x=y$. In practice, this may not be very important because this event is almost surely zero if the samples come from measures with densities. Still, it's important to note this limitation.

- Regarding the dimension dependency:

An important aspect that is not detailed in the article is the dependence on dimension. Indeed, the sliced Riesz Kernel is not exactly equal to the Riesz kernel; it differs by a constant that depends on the dimension. As the dimension approaches infinity, this constant $c_{d,r}$ behaves as $O(d^{r/2})$, and thus the rescaled kernel tends to zero as $O(d^{-r/2})$. This suggests that estimating the gradient with a finite number of projections becomes increasingly challenging in high dimensions, as also observed in Figure 2 and the bound in $O(\sqrt{d/P})$.

This point is not thoroughly discussed in the article. It would be interesting to visualize the relative error in the gradient not only as a function of the number of projections but also with respect to the dimension.


- About training a sequence of neural networks (Section 4.2):

I am having difficulty grasping the intuition behind the iterative training of neural networks $\Phi_1, \cdots, \Phi_L$ to approximate the generation scheme. Why are these networks needed? Does the flow not work without them? What are the results without these networks on CIFAR10 or MNIST, for example?

Furthermore, it seems to me that training a network per step is very costly; I doubt the feasibility of this method. Is this standard practice?

- Regarding the "related work" section in the introduction:

I believe that this section could be improved. The paragraph is somewhat confusing as it introduces a set of articles without providing clear context for the current work or establishing connections between the cited articles. As a result, I find this part to be not very illuminating for understanding the related work.


- Additional remarks:

  - Figures 1 and 2: The tables are not informative and hard to read. Since the information is already contained in the plots, I don't see the purpose of these tables. I suggest removing them and using the available space for more details on the points described earlier. Additionally, Figure 1 lacks a legend for the runtime (in ms?).

  - The Riesz kernel also defines a valid MMD for $r=2$. So why restrict it to $r \in (0,2)$ with 2 excluded?


  - Unless I am mistaken, the result about $D_{K}$ as a metric on $P_{r/2}$ in (Modeste & Dombry, 2023) is not mentioned anywhere in the cited article. Can you provide more details on this fact or provide the correct reference ?

  - I'm quite curious to know if the approach presented in the article can be generalized to the case of $r \in (0,2]$? Particularly, the fast gradient computation.

  - It seems that the reference (Numayer & Steidl, 20201, Lemma 3.3) is incorrect, or at least Lemma 3.3 doesn't state that the two MMDs coincide.

### Summary
The paper proposes a non-parametric generative model, sliced MMD Flows with Riesz Kernels. The paper initially presents the concept of "Sliced MMD with Riesz Kernels," which is essentially a sliced variation of MMD with Riesz Kernels. The paper demonstrates that Sliced MMD with Riesz Kernels qualifies as a metric in the space of probability distributions, having non-negativity, symmetry, triangle inequality, and identity. Additionally, it establishes an equivalence between Sliced MMD with Riesz Kernels and the MMD with sliced Riesz Kernels. Furthermore, the paper elaborates on the methodology for calculating Sliced MMD with Riesz Kernels and its gradient, showcasing that this approach achieves nearly linear complexity in relation to the support count of two discrete distributions. Lastly, the paper compares the proposed frameworks with other generative modeling techniques, such as NCSN, WGAN, MMD GAN, SIG, SWF, and more.

### Strengths
* The paper represents a progression in utilizing MMD flows for generative modeling. Through the introduction of an innovative and clever method for calculating gradients of MMDs using Riesz kernels, the suggested approach opens up the possibility of employing MMD flows in generative modeling tasks that were previously considered impractical for these types of functions.
* The demonstration of the metric property and calculating MMD gradients linked to Riesz kernels is a great contribution. it brings attention to Riesz kernels, which might have been somewhat neglected within the broader landscape of kernel methods.
* The connection with Wasserstein distance is interesting. 
* The paper archives the best FID score on MNIST and Fashion MNIST.

### Weaknesses
 * The FID score on Cifar10 is relatively high to other generative models.
* The computation of the FID score is only from 1 run without any standard deviation. 
* It seems that the proposed framework is not scalable in terms of dimension since the result from CIFAR10 is quite blurry and noisy.

### Questions
* Could any methods be used to improve the experimental results on high-dimensional datasets?
