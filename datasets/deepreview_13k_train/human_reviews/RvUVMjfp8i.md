- Decision: Accept
- Scores: 8, 8, 8, 8

## Abstract
Semi-supervised learning (SSL) is a powerful paradigm for leveraging unlabeled data and has been proven to be successful across various tasks. Conventional SSL studies typically assume close environment scenarios where labeled and unlabeled examples are independently sampled from the same distribution. However, real-world tasks often involve open environment scenarios where the data distribution, label space, and feature space could differ between labeled and unlabeled data. This inconsistency introduces robustness challenges for SSL algorithms. In this paper, we first propose several robustness metrics for SSL based on the Robustness Analysis Curve (RAC), secondly, we establish a theoretical framework for studying the generalization performance and robustness of SSL algorithms in open environments, thirdly, we re-implement widely adopted SSL algorithms within a unified SSL toolkit and evaluate their performance on proposed open environment SSL benchmarks, including both image, text, and tabular datasets. By investigating the empirical and theoretical results, insightful discussions on enhancing the robustness of SSL algorithms in open environments are presented. The re-implementation and benchmark datasets are all publicly available. More details can be found at https://ygzwqzd.github.io/Robust-SSL-Benchmark.

### Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of non-robust performance in semi-supervised learning (SSL) due to inconsistencies between labeled and unlabeled data, especially in open environments with different data sources. The authors introduce the Robustness Analysis Curve (RAC) and related metrics, reshaping the framework for robust SSL to achieve global robustness rather than just local robustness. They evaluate a variety of statistical and deep SSL algorithms across diverse datasets (tabular, image, and text) in three open environment scenarios: inconsistent data distributions, label spaces, and feature spaces, providing a comprehensive benchmark and detailed analysis to enhance the robustness of SSL algorithms in open environments.

### Strengths
1. Clarity and Precision in Motivation: The manuscript excels in presenting a clear and well-articulated motivation for the research conducted. The authors emphasize the challenges posed by inconsistencies between labeled and unlabeled data in open environments. They have set a strong foundation for the study, making it easier for readers to understand the significance of the work and the potential impact it could have in advancing the field of robust machine learning. 
2. Comprehensive Experimental Evaluation: The manuscript stands out in its thorough and well-structured experimental evaluation. The authors have gone to great lengths to ensure that the performance of various statistical and deep SSL algorithms is rigorously assessed across a wide range of datasets, including tabular, image, and text data. The inclusion of three distinct open environment scenarios (inconsistent data distributions, label spaces, and feature spaces) adds depth to the evaluation, ensuring that the results are comprehensive and reliable. The meticulous design of the experiments and the extensive coverage of different scenarios demonstrate a commitment to empirical rigor, which significantly enhances the credibility and value of the research findings.
3. Solid Theoretical Foundation: The strength of the manuscript is further augmented by its robust theoretical framework. The introduction of the Robustness Analysis Curve (RAC) and the associated metrics offers a novel perspective to approach the problem of robustness in SSL. The detailed theoretical analysis provided in the paper not only supports the empirical findings but also offers deeper insights into the underlying mechanisms that contribute to the robustness of SSL algorithms in open environments. This solid theoretical grounding ensures that the contributions of the manuscript are not just empirical but also provide a conceptual advancement in the understanding of robust SSL.

### Weaknesses
1. The manuscript lacks clarity in some of its detail descriptions, such as the explanation of the variable 't', which is not very comprehensible. The author could provide a detailed example to help readers better understand the meaning and function of 't'. Specifically, the paper introduces 't' as a measure of inconsistency but does not clearly define how it is quantified or how it relates to the different types of inconsistencies (data distribution, label space, feature space). A concrete example, perhaps with a toy dataset, would be beneficial. For instance, if 't' represents the degree of distribution shift, how is this shift measured (e.g., KL divergence, Wasserstein distance) and how does the value of 't' change with varying degrees of shift? This lack of clarity makes it difficult to assess the practical implications of the theoretical results.
2. The robust semi-supervised learning referred to in the manuscript actually mainly pertains to safe semi-supervised learning. Perhaps utilizing the term "safe semi-supervised learning" would be more suitable and precise in this context. The current framing of 'robust' is too broad and could encompass many different notions of robustness. The paper focuses on ensuring that the SSL model performs no worse than a supervised model trained only on labeled data, which is the core idea behind safe SSL. Using the term 'safe' would more accurately reflect the specific type of robustness being addressed, and would also help to position the work more clearly within the existing literature on safe SSL methods.
3. In Figure 2, there are too many methods presented, making it difficult to read. It would be sufficient to showcase a comparison of some representative methods instead. The sheer number of methods plotted in Figure 2 makes it challenging to discern meaningful differences between them. The figure would be more effective if it focused on a smaller subset of representative methods, perhaps including a few strong baselines, a couple of state-of-the-art SSL algorithms, and the proposed method. This would improve the clarity of the figure and allow readers to focus on the most important comparisons.
4. The manuscript introduces numerous evaluation metrics; however, the inherent relationships among these metrics are not very clear. The individual motivations for proposing each of these metrics could be further elucidated. While the paper presents several metrics, it does not adequately explain how these metrics relate to each other or why each one is necessary. For example, how does the Robustness Analysis Curve (RAC) relate to the other metrics, and what specific aspects of robustness does each metric capture? A more detailed discussion of the motivation behind each metric and their interdependencies would greatly enhance the paper's clarity.

### Questions
The current theoretical results appear to be applicable only when the degrees of inconsistency across the three types of variations are the same. It raises the question of whether the theory would still hold if the degrees of inconsistency were different.
