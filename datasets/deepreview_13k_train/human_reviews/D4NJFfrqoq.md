# Optimistic Bayesian Optimization with Unknown Constraints

- Decision: Accept
- Scores: 8, 5, 8, 6

## Abstract
Though some research efforts have been dedicated to constrained Bayesian optimization (BO), there remains a notable absence of a principled approach with a theoretical performance guarantee in the decoupled setting. Such a setting involves independent evaluations of the objective function and constraints at different inputs, and is hence a relaxation of the commonly-studied coupled setting where functions must be evaluated together. As a result, the decoupled setting requires an adaptive selection between evaluating either the objective function or a constraint, in addition to selecting an input (in the coupled setting). This paper presents a novel constrained BO algorithm with a provable performance guarantee that can address the above relaxed setting. Specifically, it considers the fundamental trade-off between exploration and exploitation in constrained BO, and, interestingly, affords a noteworthy connection to active learning. The performance of our proposed algorithms is also empirically evaluated using several synthetic and real-world optimization problems.

### Confidence
4: You are confident in your assessment, but not absolutely certain. It is unlikely, but not impossible, that you did not understand some parts of the submission or that you are unfamiliar with some pieces of related work.

### Summary
The paper proposes an algorithm tackling BO with unknown constraints by (1) explicitly measuring the benefits of querying the objective and the benefits of querying the constraint(s), (2) maximizing the general benefits to achieve an efficient trade-off of learning the unknown constraint and optimizing the unknown objective. The theoretical analysis offers a convergence guarantee of the proposed CBO method, a significant advancement in the domain.

### Strengths
1. The key concepts and proposed algorithm mostly rely on the confidence interval, which bears good interpretability.

2. The analysis extends GP-UCB results into the CBO setting.

3. The figures are illustrative, and the paper is, in general, well-organized.

### Weaknesses
1. Though the author highlights the connection of the proposed method to active learning (AL), it lacks a discussion on the link to the existing AL methods. For example, the concepts, including the uncharted area and $\nu_t$-relaxed feasible confidence region, resonate with the concepts in [1], and the analysis also bears connections.

2. The definition of regret is unconventional and lacks sufficient discussion. Typically, in the CBO setting, the reward is only defined within the feasible region, as there is no reward incurred by querying the points that are infeasible. The regret here is defined on both the objective and constraints, which circumvent the problem of infinite instantaneous regret in cumulative regret analysis when querying points out of the feasible region.

### Questions
1. Could the author include the line of work in constraint active search [2][3] in a discussion of related work? They are closely related to the CBO problem as it aims at searching feasible points efficiently within feasible regions defined by unknown constraints.

2. There is a recent paper studying a similar CBO solution [4] to the proposed algorithm. It is unnecessary to include it in the paper due to its release publication time, but I encourage the author to explore it.

### Summary
This paper studies the Bayesian optimization with unknown constraints. Different from previous work, this paper focuses on the decoupled setting where objective function and constraints are evaluated independently at different inputs. A new constrained BO algorithm is proposed, and empirical results show the effectiveness of the algorithm.

### Strengths
1. This paper studies the constrained Bayesian optimization problem in the decoupled setting, which was a problem seldom studied before.
2. The whole paper is well organized, and I like the illustration figures in Figure 1, which are helpful.
3. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world problems are conducted to show the effectiveness of proposed algorithm.

### Weaknesses
1. In Introduction, the motivation of studying decoupled constrained BO (CBO) is unclear to me. What are the real-world applications of decoupled CBO? In which case should we evaluate objective function and constraints at different inputs? In that case, can we run several independent standard BOs to solve all problems separately? Or can we run multi-objective BO to solve it?
2. I’m surprised to see definition of regret in eq (3) by combining objective function evaluation together with constraint violations. They may sit in totally different function ranges. Let F denote the range of objective function and let C denote the range of constraints. If C is much greater than F, then regret has little information about convergence. Also, the optimal point x* is defined w.r.t. objective function and $r_c$ is independent to x*. Why is $r_c$ is part of the regret?
3. How do you solve optimization problems in Line 3 and 4 in Algorithm 1? Definition of $O_t$ seems like making solving Line 3 intractable.

### Questions
1. How does the last equation hold in eq 8 by adding vertical exploration bonus?
2. In last paragraph of Section 3.1, how does Lemma 3.1 imply that $O_t$ is non-empty with probability $>1-\delta$?

### Confidence
3: You are fairly confident in your assessment. It is possible that you did not understand some parts of the submission or that you are unfamiliar with some pieces of related work. Math/other details were not carefully checked.

### Summary
The paper addresses the challenge of constrained BO within a decoupled setting, where evaluations of the objective function and constraints occur independently at different inputs. The decoupled setting requires adaptive selection between evaluating the objective function or a constraint, alongside selecting an input.  Additionally, the paper empirically evaluates the performance of the proposed algorithms using both synthetic and real-world optimization problems.

### Strengths
By allowing separate evaluations, the decoupled setting mirrors a more practical and realistic scenario, offering flexibility in the optimization process. This approach is more adaptable to various situations and potentially reduces computational expenses or time. Additionally, the proposed method is equipped with a theoretically proven performance guarantee.

### Weaknesses
n/a

### Questions
1. In plotting the UCB-C's regret against the number of queries (e.g., Figure 2g), as evaluations are conducted at both the objective function and constraints in each BO iteration, how are they plotted? Does the plot advance by jumping every #constraints + 1?
2. Just curious, in cases where the query point is feasible, why don’t we evaluate the constraints together with the objective function? What are the advantages of strictly adhering to UCB-D?

### Summary
This paper proposes a constrained Bayesian optimization algorithm which aims at dealing with constrained black-box optimization under decoupled setting. The authors utilized confidence bound derived from Gaussian process to determine the function oracle to query, and derived the cumulative regret bound in terms of both maximization and summation computation way. Experiment on synthetic function and real-world application demonstrates the query-efficiency of the proposed UCB-D algorithm.

### Strengths
1. The idea is clear and easy to follow.

2. The paper is well-written, and the presentation from the active learning aspect helps better understanding the proposed algorithm.

3. The experiment result well demonstrates the query efficiency of UCB-D.

### Weaknesses
1. The paper does not explicitly introduce the motivation of decoupling the function query, and seems that the chosen real-world benchmark does not has the property of decoupling the function queries.

2. The result plot only shows the summation of regrets, which does not tell the found solution is feasible or not. Can you separately show the regret of  the objective function and constrant functions? 

3. In Figure 2 (h), the standard error of UCB-D is much larger than other baselines. Can you give some insights of why this happens?

### Questions
1. As mentioned in weakness part, my major concern lies in the motivation of decoupling the function queries, since in many real-world applications, the objective and constraint values are simultaneously evaluated after one trial, and decoupling the function query seems not save the cost. Can you explain the motivation and potential application of decoupling the function queries?

2. The result plot only shows the summation of regrets, which does not tell the found solution is feasible or not. Can you separately show the regret of  the objective function and constrant functions?
