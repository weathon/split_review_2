- Decision: Accept
- Scores: 6, 6, 8, 8

## Abstract
When a machine learning (ML) model exhibits poor quality (e.g., poor accuracy or fairness), the problem can often be traced back to errors in the training data. Being able to discover the data examples that are the most likely culprits is a fundamental concern that has received a lot of attention recently. One prominent way to measure "data importance" with respect to model quality is the Shapley value. Unfortunately, existing methods only focus on the ML model in isolation, without considering the broader ML pipeline for data preparation and feature extraction, which appears in the majority of real-world ML code. This presents a major limitation to applying existing methods in practical settings. In this paper, we propose Datascope, a method for efficiently computing Shapley-based data importance over ML pipelines. We introduce several approximations that lead to dramatic improvements in terms of computational speed. Finally, our experimental evaluation demonstrates that our methods are capable of data error discovery that is as effective as existing Monte Carlo baselines, and in some cases even outperform them. We release our code as an open-source data debugging library available at https://github.com/easeml/datascope.

### Summary
This paper introduces a framework for identifying influential training examples in a machine learning pipeline using Shapley Values algorithm in an efficient manner. The first efficiency problem that the paper addresses is identifying whether the output of data preprocessing pipeline for a given training example belongs to a given subset of training examples in O(1) time. The paper claims that this condition holds for the following three pipelines: map, fork, and one-to-many join.
The second efficiency problem that the paper addresses is related to the performance of the ML model and the utility metric used to measure the quality of the model. In this case, the paper suggests to use KNN algorithm and requires that the model quality metric is additive. The authors show that their framework is computationally more performant compared to baseline approaches. It also reaches competitive results in terms of accuracy on downstream tasks.

### Strengths
1) The work discusses related work thoroughly and highlights their pros and cons and the relation to the work that they are proposing.
2) The visual figures 1 and 2 are well made and help with the understanding of the proposed method.
3) The work provides experimental results for a variety of different pipelines for text, tabular and image datasets.  It also shows improvements not only for runtime but also for accuracy and fairness metrics.

### Weaknesses
1) From the introduction and abstract of the paper there is an impression that the paper aims to identify influential training examples but they doesn't seem to be any experimental results on that aspect. The experimental results are mostly cumulative w.r.t. overall accuracy, runtime, etc. There are no examples that show the effectiveness of the method w.r.t. specific training instances. It would be beneficial to see examples of how the method identifies specific influential data points and how these identifications lead to improvements in model performance after targeted interventions, such as label correction or removal of noisy instances.
2) To make the paper more clear it would be good to define what exactly “canonical” pipeline and “ data provenance”  mean in the beginning of the paper. The readers need to have a clear understanding of those terms. Without a precise definition, the scope and applicability of the proposed framework remain unclear. For instance, what are the criteria for a pipeline to be considered canonical, and how does data provenance specifically enable the efficient computation of Shapley values?
3) The notation  `D_{tr}[v] to denote D` is a bit confusing.  t \in f(D_{tr})  is confusing too since t \in D_{tr} and we see exactly t \in D_{tr}  notation later in the paper. It would be good to change the notation to make it more straightforward. The current notation introduces ambiguity and makes it difficult to follow the mathematical formulations. For example, the distinction between input and output tuples within the pipeline needs to be clearer, and the use of `t` for both input and output tuples creates confusion.
4) In section 3.3  f* doesn’t seem to be defined too ? The lack of a clear definition for f* makes it difficult to understand the approximation being introduced and its implications on the accuracy of the Shapley values.
5) Figure 3 is referenced in pages 4 and 5 and it is not explained. It’s unclear why the Compute time of Canonpipe TMC x100 is worse than TMC x10. The lack of explanation for the observed performance differences in Figure 3 makes it difficult to assess the practical benefits of the proposed method. Specifically, the reader needs to understand why increasing the number of Monte Carlo iterations in Canonpipe TMC leads to worse performance than using fewer iterations in the baseline TMC.
6) The intuitions behind modified KNN  and quality metrics in section 4.1 are unclear. It is not clear why a modified KNN is needed, and how the specific quality metrics are chosen. The paper needs to provide a stronger justification for the choice of KNN and the specific additive quality metrics, as these choices directly impact the validity and applicability of the proposed framework.
7) The description of  Counting Oracle is not very clear. It would be good, if possible, to describe it in a more intuitive way. It seems to be overloaded with math notations and is not straightforward to follow. The current description of the Counting Oracle is too dense and lacks intuitive explanations. The reader needs a clearer understanding of how the counting oracle works and why it is essential for the efficient computation of Shapley values.

### Questions
1) Sections 3.2 - 3.3: why are  One-to-many, fork and join canonical ? How is the canonical pipeline defined ? Why exactly is `reduce` non-canonical ? Would you, please, bring examples ?
2) Are modified KNN  and quality metrics based on previous work or something new that the authors propose ?
3) What are the limitations of the work ? 
4) Since we are using modified quality metric and ML algorithm (KNN), I wonder how practical is the approach in terms of non-KNN models and different quality metrics?

### Summary
Data repair is typically performed on preprocessed data at the stage immediately preceding model training. This paper explores data valuation on raw data before preprocessing steps are performed. This necessitates a framework of data provenance in ML pipelines and a computation approach for data Shapley under a KNN approximation. The paper demonstrates the usefulness of this data valuation framework as achieving competitive performance in data debugging at significant compute cost/time reduction.

### Strengths
The paper is thorough in introducing a new problem setting within data valuation and debugging. The methodology builds on KNN Shapley but factors arbitrary general data preprocessing pipelines. The algorithm includes theoretical guarantees on polynomial time computation and an extensive set of experiments to demonstrate the compute efficiency of the proposed method.

### Weaknesses
 - The framework depends on a data preprocessing pipeline to be the same for both training and validation (equation 2). However, one challenge of data valuation before pre-processing is that there may be different pre-processing pipelines between training and validation. For example, we can consider random data augmentation techniques used in training, but not for testing. Does this methodology handle different pre-processing pipelines, or for example, a validation pipeline that is a subset of the training pipeline?
- Near Section 3.2/3.3 (or a detailed version in the Appendix), it would be useful to have a detailed dictionary of common pipelines / components and how they fit into Map, Fork, Join, or can be approximated by Map-reduce. This could be a table for example similar to Table 1. A table such as this would make the significance of the proposed work more clear in terms of how an ML practitioner can think of pre-processing steps in these pipelines.
- If I understand the experiments correctly, the baselines are performing data importance on the raw data before pre-preprocessing. Furthermore, existing KNN Shapley methods cannot accurately model the combinatorial explosion in subsets obtained from a data pipeline, making them conceptually unattractive. However, one baseline in data repair may be to perform valuation on data points after pre-processing, and then simply invert the pipeline manually to determine the relevant raw data points. How would existing methods including KNN Shapley perform on label repair in terms of accuracy improvement and compute time? More generally, what is the practical significance of identifying data points for repair with a method that captures the pre-processing operations versus simply identifying potential points for repair after pre-processing and then inverting the preprocessing pipeline to determine affected raw data points? The paper does not adequately address the potential for simpler, post-processing valuation methods.
- The experiment protocol is not thoroughly explained and relies on referencing prior work (e.g., noise injection, measuring labor cost). It would be useful to include this discussion perhaps in Appendix.
- There is some minor writing improvements to be made, for example, In page 2, set S is used without definition

### Summary
This work studies a novel and relevant problem of incorporating Shapley-based data evaluation into data processing pipelines. The work first clarifies the current limitations on implementing Shapley methods with data processing pipelines–the Monte-Carlo sampling approach would necessitate re-running the data processing pipeline which costs significant time; KNN-based approximations are incompatible with some constraints posed by the data processing pipelines and thus sometimes cannot be applied. Then, this work proposes the concept of “canonical” pipelines which allow directly relating inputs and outputs. By approximating pipelines as canonical, the proposed methods may achieve significant speed-ups for the Monte Carlo approach. Also, by combining canonical pipelines with the K-nearest neighbor as a proxy model, the proposed  PTIME Shapley computation algorithms allow applying KNN Shapley as a special case applicable to map pipelines. The paper is technically solid.

### Strengths
The paper is clear, sharp, and well-structured. The paper is well-written, well-contextualized, and well-motivated. The language is technically sound. The identified problem is valid and important. The proposed technical approaches are well-documented with rigorous elaborations. This work could be of lots of interest to data science practitioners. Proposed methods achieve significant speedups in empirical studies.

### Weaknesses
I do not see major weaknesses. I'm familiar with the literature on Shapley methods and their practical implementations but not much on data processing pipelines in the real world. The review provided is limited by the scope of my knowledge. I would leave it to other reviewers to evaluate the practicalness of the modeling and treatment of the data processing pipelines.

### Summary
This paper proposes a method called Canonpipe for efficiently computing Shapley-based data importance over machine learning pipelines. The authors introduce several approximations that lead to significant speed-ups, making Canonpipe capable of data error discovery that is as effective as existing Monte Carlo baselines, and in some cases even outperform them. Overall, Canonpipe is a solution to the fundamental concern of discovering the data examples that are the most likely culprits for poor-quality ML models.

### Strengths
+ The authors tried to address a very important problem. i.e., computing Shapley value efficiently for a large dataset over general machine learning pipelines.
+ The authors proposed a novel provenance-based solution over canonical machine learning pipelines, which can address the computational challenges for evaluating Shapley values.
+ The authors also provided rigorous theoretical analysis for their proposed solution, which is sound and convincing
+ The authors also performed extensive experiments in different settings to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

### Weaknesses
 + Some experimental details are missing, For example, in Section 5.2 when the authors discussed the scalability, I am not sure whether the results in Figure 7 are the ones for evaluating Shapley value for one sample or all the training samples. I guess it would be the former case. Otherwise, the time complexity would be quadratic. So it would be better if the authors could clarify this. It is unclear how the computation is performed for all training samples without incurring a quadratic time complexity, given that Shapley value computation typically requires considering all subsets of data points. The authors should explicitly state whether the reported time is for a single sample or the entire dataset, and if the latter, provide a more detailed explanation of how they achieve sub-quadratic complexity.
+ The overall experiments seem not to be comprehensive since the authors only evaluate their methods on simple dataset, e.g., FashinoMNIST, with simple models, such as KNN model. It would be great if the authors could demonstrate that their proposed method can handle large-scale datasets such as the ImageNet dataset. The current experiments do not fully demonstrate the scalability of the proposed method to real-world, large-scale datasets. The authors should provide results on more complex datasets with higher dimensionality and larger sample sizes, such as ImageNet, to validate the practical applicability of their method.
+ Although the authors refer to the earlier work on approximately evaluating Shapley values with KNN surrogate model, it is unclear to the readers how that can work, it would be better if the authors could briefly discuss this prior work, in particular what kind of correctness guarantee that can be obtained by approximately evaluating Shapley values with KNN surrogate models. This can make this paper more self-contained. The paper lacks a discussion on the theoretical underpinnings of using a KNN surrogate model for Shapley value approximation. It is unclear what kind of error bounds or convergence guarantees can be expected from this approximation. A more thorough discussion of this approximation, including its limitations, is needed to make the paper more self-contained and rigorous.
+ Also, the overall presentation could be improved. Although the authors mentioned that the PTIME computation time can be achieved with ADD. all the discussions of ADD are included in the appendix along with the main algorithm. Since this is the main contribution of this paper, it would be better if the authors could put some of these core technical parts in the main paper and briefly discuss them there. The core technical contribution of the paper, namely the use of ADDs to achieve polynomial-time computation, is relegated to the appendix. This makes it difficult for the reader to grasp the main technical novelty of the paper. The authors should include a more detailed discussion of ADDs and their role in achieving efficient Shapley value computation in the main body of the paper.
