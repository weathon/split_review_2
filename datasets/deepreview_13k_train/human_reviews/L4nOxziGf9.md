# Rephrase, Augment, Reason: Visual Grounding of Questions for Vision-Language Models

- Decision: Accept
- Scores: 6, 6, 6

## Abstract
An increasing number of vision-language tasks can be handled with little to no training, i.e., in a zero and few-shot manner, by marrying large language models (LLMs) to vision encoders, resulting in large vision-language models (LVLMs).
While this has huge upsides, such as not requiring training data or custom architectures, how an input is presented to an LVLM can have a major impact on zero-shot model performance.
In particular, inputs phrased in an \emph{underspecified} way can result in incorrect answers due to factors like missing visual information, complex implicit reasoning, or linguistic ambiguity.
Therefore, adding visually-grounded information to the input as a preemptive clarification should improve model performance by reducing underspecification, e.g., by localizing objects and disambiguating references. 
Similarly, in the VQA setting, changing the way questions are framed can make them easier for models to answer. 
To this end, we present \fullform{} (\method{}), a gradient-free framework that extracts salient details about the image using the underlying LVLM as a captioner and reasoner, in order to propose modifications to the original question. 
We then use the LVLM's confidence over a generated answer as an unsupervised scoring function to select the rephrased question most likely to improve zero-shot performance.
{Focusing on three visual question answering tasks, we show that \method{} can result in a $3.85\%$ (absolute) increase in zero-shot accuracy on VQAv2, $6.41\%$, and $7.94\%$ points increase on A-OKVQA, and VizWiz respectively. }
Additionally, we find that using gold answers for oracle question candidate selection achieves a substantial
gain in VQA accuracy by up to $14.41\%$.  
Through extensive analysis, we demonstrate that outputs from \method{} increase syntactic complexity, and effectively utilize vision-language interaction and the frozen LLM

### Confidence
4: You are confident in your assessment, but not absolutely certain. It is unlikely, but not impossible, that you did not understand some parts of the submission or that you are unfamiliar with some pieces of related work.

### Summary
This paper introduces "Repare", a gradient-free framework that consists of three phases: Visual Details Extraction, Question Rephrasing and Augmentation, and Question Selection. "Repare" rephrases questions with more precise information, drawing from image captions, question keywords, and rationale details. Following rephrasing, Repare produces multiple question variations, which are then filterd through an unsupervised quality score provided by a Language Model (LM). The paper concludes with an assessment of Repare's performance on VQAv2 and A-OKQA datasets, showing enhancements when compared to the BLIP2 and MiniGPT4 baseline models.

### Strengths
- The paper is easy to read and generally well-written
- Interesting idea of improving VL models in VQA tasks by just modifying one modality (e.g text).
- Improvements over baselines (BLIP2, MiniGPT4) looks reasonable.

### Weaknesses
 - Evaluation suite should be improved. For example including: TextVQA, VizWiz. Additionally, authors should consider evaluating tasks such as HatefulMemes which might be more challenging to the proposed approach. Also, consider recent evaluation tasks such as MME.
- Including recent instruct multimodal models (e.g. LLaVa, Qwen-VL) would be an interesting experiment to see if the gain with Repare is still relevant in these models.
- Minor:
    - >One approach involves additional VL pretraining ...
   
         In this case, LENS does not involve additional multimodal pretraining.
  - Why not include BLIP2-XXL as one of your main baselines and improve it with Repare?

### Rating

### Rating Number

### Confidence
3: You are fairly confident in your assessment. It is possible that you did not understand some parts of the submission or that you are unfamiliar with some pieces of related work. Math/other details were not carefully checked.

### Summary
The paper proposes an pipeline for using LVLMs to solve VQA that modifies the question using visual information from the image and select the answer with the best confidence. Experiment results on VQAc2 and A-OKVQA show improvement in all question categories. The authors use ablation studies and shown that the visual details and question entity do help improve the performance.

### Strengths
1. The performance improvement from the method seem to be solid.
2. The paper is mostly clear with extensive experiments.

### Weaknesses
1. Some of the text requires further clarification.
2. The underlying hypothesis should be stated more clearly, which in my understanding is that distribution of more specified questions are more aligned with the training data of LVLMs and the answers with higher confidence are more likely to be correct.
3. In 4.4, why is that "In all cases, REPARE increases the gap between LLM-only and BLIP-2"? As it seems that the gap actually decreases. (The numbers should be negative)
4. The baseline of adding captions alone to the question, i.e. <caption><question>, should be compared.

### Questions
1. Any explanations on why questions with numeric answers benefit the most from RepARe?
2. What does it mean using `golden` answers for selection? And also `paraphrase oracle`.
3. In 4.4, why is that "In all cases, REPARE increases the gap between LLM-only and BLIP-2"? As it seems that the gap actually decreases. (The numbers should be negative)
4. The baseline of adding captions alone to the question, i.e. <caption><question>, should be compared.

### Summary
This paper proposed a pipeline framework for improving the accuracy of LVLMs in VQA tasks.
First, details are identified from the question and the image, including entities (using off-the-shelf tools) and rationales (using the LVLM), which are then used to obtain related details from the image (using the LVLM), and descriptions from the image (using the LVLM).
Second, the details are fused with the question, generating multiple question candidates (using the LVLM), the results of which are filtered to exclude semantically inconsistent ones (using off-the-shelf tools).
Finally, the LVLM answers each candidate question; the final answer is selected using the LVLM with the confidence-based method.

On two benchmark sets, i.e., VQAv2 and A-OKVQA, solid improvements are shown on 3 LVLMs. The with/without kind of ablation is conducted suggesting each element in the pipeline contributes to the improvement. Further analyses are conducted to try to show that the new questions are effective because of less underspecification and ambiguity, i.e., because of the added details that are obvious for humans but not quite so for LVLMs. The asymmetric strength hypothesis seems to suggest that the visual components alone are not quite up to the job of the VQA task.

### Strengths
- The motivation is straight-forward, clear, and reasonable.
- The improvements seem solid and the analyses support the improvements that come from the proposed pipeline.
- The code and the data are provided and the authors promised public release. This is very important because the proposed pipeline is complicated and not easily reproducible.

### Weaknesses
 - The pipeline seems overcomplicated and involves many steps that are indispensable to the overall performance. Unlike plain CoT, which usually conducts inference once, the proposed pipeline conducts inference multiple times using the LVLM and involves off-the-shelf tools twice. The complexity may affect the reproduction of the method and the incurred (computation and time) cost may hinder the adoption of the method in application.
- The main results (Table 1) need more explanation. (1) For example, the standard deviation considering the oracle implementation is high. I did not expect that using the optimal candidate would lead to higher variance. Are there results regarding the choice of the number of the question candidates? (2) I would love to see more QA datasets (from diverse sources) tested on. (3) I wonder if the asymmetric strength hypothesis holds, is it possible that stage 2 and stage 3 can be changed to using the original question and the extracted details in texts without the image? (4) All analyses are based on BLIP-2, an encoder-decoder model. I don't think I find a discussion on the effect of model architecture (encoder-decoder or decoder-only).
- The writing and the organization can be improved. Personally, I would like Section 3 Methodology to be more straightforward. From what I understand, Stage I (ii) adopts different post-processing from (i) and (iii). The paragraph before Section 3.2 states "we prompt the LVLM to answer each question" and the first paragraph in Section 3.2 states "To select which question to answer", which are contradictory. I had to check the appendix and the footnotes multiple times to guess what's going on.
