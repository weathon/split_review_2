# Unnormalized Density Estimation with Root Sobolev Norm Regularization

- Decision: Reject
- Scores: 5, 5, 3

## Abstract
We propose a new approach to non-parametric density estimation that is based on regularizing a Sobolev norm of the density. This method is consistent, different from Kernel Density Estimation, and makes the inductive bias of the model clear and interpretable. While there is no closed analytic form for the associated kernel, we show that one can approximate it using sampling. The optimization problem needed to determine the density is non-convex, and standard gradient methods do not perform well. However, we show that with an appropriate initialization and using natural gradients, one can obtain well performing solutions. Finally, while the approach provides unnormalized densities, which prevents the use of log-likelihood for cross validation, we show that one can instead adapt Fisher Divergence based Score Matching methods for this task. We evaluate the resulting method on the comprehensive recent Anomaly Detection benchmark suite, ADBench, and find that it ranks second best, among more than 15 algorithms.

### Summary
This paper proposes a new nonparametric density estimator based on regularized maximum likelihood estimation. The estimate is represented as the square of its square root, ensuring non-negativity at the cost of not having unit mass, which the paper argues is sufficient for applications, such as anomaly detection or sampling, that can utilize such an unnormalized density estimate.

### Strengths
The proposed method is fairly clearly well-explained. The empirical results on the anomaly detection benchmark are quite impressive and show the proposed method is useful in a number of real-world problems.

### Weaknesses
 **Major**

1. Page 1, Paragraph 1:
> *While there is recent work for low dimensional (one or two dimensional) data... there still are very few non-parametric methods applicable in higher dimensions.*

I'm not convinced by this motivation, for a two reasons. First, many nonparametric methods have been described for data of arbitrary dimension (including in some of the cited papers). However, standard minimax lower bounds show that high-dimensional non-parametric density estimation is statistically intractable, in terms of many performance metrics. Thus, I'm not convinced that a new method will perform well in high dimensions unless it makes some more explicit assumptions on the density being estimated. Second, while recent neural network based density estimation methods are technically parametric, the complexity of these models is so large that they often behave more like non-parametric methods; i.e., they can fit quite complex densities. So it's not clear that a new nonparametric method should outperform these models in practical applications.

2. Eq. (1): This objective is unbounded if the order of the derivative $D$ is $\leq d/2$ (since the Sobolev $W^{k,2}(R^d)$ contains singularities, which can be centered on the samples.) The assumption $m > d/2$ in Theorem 2 addresses this, but, when first seeing Eq. (1), I was a bit confused by this. So perhaps it is worth mentioning this assumption earlier.

3. Section 1, Last Paragraph, and Section 2, Last Paragraph: Both of these briefly mention consistency, but no details are provided here regarding the type of consistency (in $L_2$ in probability) or the assumptions made.

4. Section 3.1, just after Eq. (5)
> "there seems to be no computationally affordable way to restrict the optimization to the positive cone $\mathcal{C}$... We resolve this issue in two steps..."

Although it seems reasonable in practice, the solution proposed here is *ad hoc*, and it's not clear how this relates to the consistency guarantee (Theorem 11). Ultimately, in Appendix K, the paper assumes "positivity on the data points $x_i$", and it's not clear whether this condition is likely to hold as $n \to \infty$. On one hand, the estimate might approach the true (non-negative) density, but, on the other hand, the number of points $x_i$ is increasing. So, I think this is a big hole in the consistency guarantee. To fix this, the paper should analyze whether the "positivity on the data points $x_i$" condition holds as $n \to \infty$, and whether any additional conditions are necessary to ensure this (e.g., it might suffice if the true density is bounded away from $0$?). The fact that the optimization is not performed directly in the positive cone, but rather with a heuristic initialization, further complicates the consistency argument.

5. While the experiments demonstrate impressive performance on an anomaly detection benchmark, it's not clear from the paper where this advantage comes from or whether it is statistically significant or simply due to chance. One way to strengthen this would be an experiment on synthetic data where one can clearly (i.e., in an intuitive and unambiguous manner) see the advantage of RSR. The synthetic experiment in Section 5 almost does this, but it doesn't go as far as quantifying the advantage of RSR.

6. I didn't really understand the purpose of Section 5. The two curves in Figure 2(b) seem almost identical, up to a constant scaling factor. Since the $y$-axis log likelihood, this just looks like INER=(KDE)$^2$, up to a constant factor. Related to this, I didn't understand why "the gap between the values on the first and second cluster [being] larger for the RSR model" explains why RSR is better for anomaly detection -- what matters for anomaly detection is probably the *ratio of the between-cluster variation to the within-cluster variation*, but the within-cluster variation is also much bigger for RSR (INER) than for KDE.

**Minor**

1. Usually $\mathcal{H}^a$ denotes the Sobolev space $W^{a, 2}$ (i.e., the space of $L_2$ functions with $a^{th}$ derivatives in $L_2$). I suggest aligning the use of $\mathcal{H}^a$ in this paper with this more standard notation. In particular, it is strange to me that the derivative order is not explicitly denoted in this paper's usage of $\mathcal{H}^a$.

2. Page 2, Paragraph 1, Last Sentence: Should "|f^*|_{L_2}$" be "||f^*||_{L_2}$"? I believe this is a proper norm...

3. Section 4, "Single Derivative Order kernel approximation": Although I realize this is not the intent, the name "Single Derivative Order kernel" makes me think "first" derivative, rather than a single derivative of arbitrary order. I suggest a more explicit name like "$m$-order Derivative kernel".

4. The paper ends a bit abruptly. I think it would help the reader to end with a summary of the paper's key contributions and perhaps a discussion of the limitations and weaknesses of the proposed method.

### Questions
**Major**

1. A central idea of this paper is to estimate a square root of the target density function, in order to ensure non-negativity of the estimated density (after squaring). This is closely related to the proposal of [MFBR20], who propose a general framework for estimating non-negative quantities built on this idea. In the particular case of nonparametric density estimation, I think their proposal is very similar to the present paper's (namely, maximum likelihood with Sobolev norm regularization). They also propose various mechanisms to enforce the constraint that the density estimate integrates to $1$. How exactly does the present paper's proposal differ from that of [MFBR20], and what, if any, are the advantages?

2. Regarding the "positivity on the data points $x_i$" assumption in Appendix K: Does this assumption hold (for large $n$, with high probability) as $n \to \infty$?

**Minor**

1. Is there a motivation for explicitly enforcing the $L_2$ penalty $||f||_2$, as opposed to simply enforcing the Sobolev pseudo-norm penalty $||D f||_2$?

2. Equation (9): I think there is an extra square in the definition of this inner product (i.e., $\langle D^\kappa f, D^\kappa g \rangle^2$ should be $\langle D^\kappa f, D^\kappa g \rangle$).

3. Figure 1: What is "INER"? Should this be "RSR"?

4. Figure 2: What do the error bars indicate? Quantiles?

### Summary
This paper proposes a novel framework for un-normalized kernelized density estimation that differs from common practice mainly in 2 aspects: 

- Kernel density estimation generally uses $ \hat{f} = \sum_{i=1}^N \alpha_i k_{x_i} $ with a non-negative coefficients $\alpha_i$ and non-negative valued-kernel $k$; the proposes $\tilde{f} = \left(\sum_{i=1}^N \beta_i k_{x_i}\right)^2$ with un-constrained $\beta_i$ and $k$, which trades away normalization with a different objective in regularization. The paper presents contrived example about the difference between the two density estimators and argue in favor of using the squared density estimator for spectral clustering and anomaly detection. 
- The paper proposes the SDO kernel, a stationary kernel whose RKHS norm involves derivatives of $f$ to a certain order. The paper notes that the kernel has a tractable spectral density (up to a normalization constant), and proposes a random Fourier feature approximation based on MCMC sampling of the spectral density.

### Strengths
- Soundness: the paper establishes a sound theoretical framework for un-normalized density estimation. 
- Novelty: (i) the authors propose a novel SDO kernel, which furthers our understanding on the relation between Sobolev spaces and the spectral densities of kernels; (ii) the argument how RSR differs from KDE is interesting and presents a good motivation to use this framework for density estimation. 
- Experiments: the paper mainly focuses on anomaly detection with overall good empirical results.

### Weaknesses
 - Motivation: I admit my lack of familiarity in un-normalized density estimation but I hope the authors can help clarify on a few issues: (i) I think the paper makes a sound argument about using the squared version of a linear combination of kernels by comparing it against KDE, but the decision to use a _single_ derivative order lacks motivation in my view. Specifically, the choice of considering only the $m$-th order derivative in the RKHS norm, as opposed to derivatives up to order $m$, is not well-justified. This choice drastically alters the nature of the regularization and its impact on the estimated density. A more thorough discussion of why this specific form of Sobolev norm is preferred is needed. I pose this question in the next section, and I believe that a well-written section on this topic should be included in the paper. (ii) the paper mentions on the top section of p. 2 that regularizing over $ |f^*|_{L_2} $ is a desirable property: what does it mean? It's unclear why minimizing the L2 norm of the function itself is a desirable property in the context of density estimation, especially given that the proposed method is unnormalized. The connection between this regularization and the goal of density estimation needs to be clarified.
- Presentation: the paper is well-written overall, but the latter parts of the manuscript seems in a draft form: (i) the manuscript lacks a final summary section, and the Fisher divergence and hyperparameter tuning section seems better placed in an early section when the authors present the methodology; (ii) The paper mentions the consistency of the estimator in the main manuscript, but delays all discussions about consistency to the supplementary materials - I believe that it would be helpful to bring up the main theorems for consistency in the main text.

### Questions
I have one main question about the objective of the SDO kernel: the paper proposes an RKHS norm that involves the L2 norm of the function, and also its derivatives _at_ a certain degree $m$, leading to a kernel with no analytical expression, but has a tractable spectral density (up to a normalization constant). The type of Sobolev norm $ \sum_{|\kappa|_1=m} ||D^{\kappa} f||^2 $ seems quite unusual. 

We know that the original Sobolev norm involves derivatives _up_ to degree $m$: $ \sum_{|\kappa|_1\leq m} ||D^{\kappa} f||^2 $, and the Sobolev spaces are norm-equivalent to the RKHS of a Matérn kernel (in closed form and well-studied). Could the authors explain why their choice of the Sobolev norm is useful, and what will the results be like if one uses the Matérn kernel in replacement of the SDO kernel? I think a good justification for this model choice is a useful addition to the paper, as the Matérn kernel is sufficiently close to a regularization on Sobolev norm, and the SDO kernel seems more difficult because of the reliance on using Fourier features to approximate its kernel values. 

- The paper's main method is marked as "INER" in Figures 1 and 2, but the text makes no mention of what it stands for: is this a mistake?

### Summary
This paper studies the density estimation using the likelihood with the Sobolev norm regularization. Unnormalized models are employed for non-parametric estimation. The algorithm is implemented using gradient-based learning. The authors proposed sampling approximation for computing the RKHS norm. Then, they investigate the difference between the proposed method (RSR) and the standard kernel density estimator (KDE). Indeed, two estimators provide different results for the separability of the cluster structure. Some numerical experiments indicate that the proposed method outperforms most of the existing works for anomaly detection. Also, computational properties are numerically analyzed.

### Strengths
- The formulation of the proposed method (RSR) is simple and easy to understand.
- The authors studied some properties of the proposed estimator, e.g., the ratio of the estimated probability densities shown in Section 5.

### Weaknesses
 - The proposed estimator is rather straightforward and has less impact the machine learning community. 
- Once the estimator for the unnormalized model is estimated, how can the estimator be utilized?
- Section 6.3 reports the ratio of negative values for the estimated function f. I'm not sure why the ratio of negative values is important to assess the computational properties.
- Sobolev space is closely related to the RKHS with Matern kernel; see [1] below. Some supplementary comments on that relationship would be helpful for researchers interested in theoretical analysis of the learning algorithms.
