# On the Hidden Waves of Image

- Decision: Reject
- Scores: 8, 6, 5, 6

## Abstract
In this paper, we introduce an intriguing phenomenon – the successful reconstruction of images using a set of one-way wave equations with hidden and learnable speeds. Each individual image corresponds to a solution with a unique initial condition, which can be computed from the original image using a visual encoder (e.g., a convolutional neural network). Furthermore, the solution for each image exhibits two noteworthy mathematical properties: (a) it can be decomposed into a collection of special solutions of the same one-way wave equations that are first-order autoregressive, with shared coefficient matrices for autoregression, and (b) the product of these coefficient matrices forms a diagonal matrix with the speeds of the wave equations as its diagonal elements. We term this phenomenon *hidden waves*, as it reveals that, although the speeds of the set of wave equations and autoregressive coefficient matrices are latent, they are both learnable and shared across images. This represents a mathematical invariance across images, providing a new mathematical perspective to understand images.

### Summary
This article studies how to use wave equations in a hidden space of an image to recover it. The wave equations can be solved using first-order autoregressive generative model. The main contribution is to make two significant extensions of existing works to recover diverse images of high-resolution, one based on diagonalization of wave equations, the other based on using several first-order autoregressive models with shared weights.

### Strengths
The diagonalization idea is interesting as it simplifies the way to solve wavelet equations. As a whole, this model defines a powerful way to represent natural images with limited number of parameters.

### Weaknesses
A major issue is the lack of mathematical clarity in presenting your model. As a consequence, certain central idea such as diagonalization does not seem to be correct.

- In your model, A,B matrices defined in eq 2 are real-valued matrices and learnable. How do you guarantee that AB^-1 is diagonalizable such that the eigenvalues are all real-valued? (the Lambda diagonal matrix in eq 4 contains only real values along diagonal). In general, one could only assume that AB^-1 is diagonalizable such that V and Lambda are complex-valued (if AB^-1 is not symmetric).
- It is not very clear in Fig 1 which part is trainable. Do you also train the encoder and decoder to recover input images ? If the encoder is not trained, how is it defined? Also what is your training loss?
- Your decoder is linear, would that make the recovered images loss details (such as sharp edges) in images? This is not very clear from PNSR metrices. It would be better to add some visual examples.

- The notation in the article was not mathematically rigorous enough for me to understand the model. An improvement is needed. I still do not understand why xi(x,y) is in R^C (defined on top of page 4).
- I do not know how to motivate the study of real-valued eigenvalues lambda_k in Table 2, as you are assuming that A B^-1 is diagonalizable in your model. It is not clear to me whether this assumption still holds when you consider real-valued eigenvalues.

- In the discussion of [Q1], it is of course still not fully clear (or mathematically guaranteed) that $AB^{-1}$ is diagonalizable (even over $\mathbb{C}$), right? This just happens to be the case because the set of matrices that can not be diagonalized is so small/thin, that a non-diagonalizable matrix never occurs as a result of a learning process?

### Summary
This paper studies a new finding about the mathematical properties of realistic images, i.e., that they can be recovered well from a set of specific solutions to one-way wave equations with the help of an encoder that generates initial conditions for the wave equations and a simple decoder that maps the wave equation solutions back to an image. The paper extends prior work of Chen et al., FINOLA, by interpreting their autoregressive process as the discretization of the one-way wave equation and by considering the sum of multiple such FINOLA solutions as an input to the decoder network. Numerical results illustrate that the reconstruction of the superposition of FINOLAs yields a significantly better PSNR than a single one, e.g., improving from 24.8 to 27.8.

### Strengths
The paper is well written and the continuous interpretation of FINOLA that implies a solution to a wave equation is very interesting. In particular, the fundamental type of question investigated here, i.e., if certain wave equations are a common mathematical principle that allows reconstructing any realistic image well is intriguing and has large potential if answered positively. In this sense, I found the paper very interesting to read.

### Weaknesses
Unfortunately, I also see several weaknesses in the presented work.
- Contribution: It is stated in section 2, that the prior work FINOLA is extended in two ways: a) generalizing FINOLA to a set of one-way wave equations and b) relaxing the local constraints. Yet, a) is merely an interpretation, and b) is done by summing over multiple FINOLA solutions. I consider this to be rather simple with the increase in PSNR being very natural due to the larger latent space of the resulting model. 
- Insights on whether wave equations are really a common joint principle in natural images: There is no comparison to other autoencoders, no motivation on why the wave equation could be of particular importance to images, and no illustration/interpretation of the latent space encodings $q_i$ or the corresponding solutions $z_i$ of the autoregressive FINOLA features. In particular, a $256 \times 256 \times 3$ color image is represented, e.g. with a $8 \times 1024$ latent space variable and subsequently decoded (using the multi-path FINOLA) with a PSNR of 27.1. But how would approaches perform that use a latent space of similar dimension and do not exploit any autoregressive (or wave-equation-based) operation in their decoder? In order to believe that wave equations or FINOLA are a fundamental "underlying mathematical property shared by images", the proposed approach would have to perform significantly better than competing approaches. A truncated PCA, keeping the largest patch-wise DCT (or wavelet) coefficients of an image, and training a standard convolutional autoencoder would be natural very classical baselines. Currently, I am not convinced that multi-path FINOLA / wave equations are the fundamental ingredient that makes the autoencoder work exceptionally well.


After the rebuttal, I am increasing my score due to several very encouraging additional experiments. Yet, the new version of the paper is a major revision that should undergo a full new review process. In particular, technical details (like the architecture of the convolutional autoencoder) seem to be missing. In general,  in my opinion, to claim that wave equations are a mathematical property shared by all natural images more analysis is needed (including an interpretation of wave speeds, the diagonalizing basis, or experiments on what happens if the wave equation is solved differently from the special structure of the sum of FINOLAs). For claiming that a superposition of FINOLAs is one of the strongest latent compression techniques, more detailed comparisons (taking works on learned image compression into account) are needed.

### Questions
- As stated under 'Weaknesses' above, did you compare to any other encoding-decoding techniques that make the hypothesis, that wave equations are fundamental to all images more credible? The supplement compares to DCT and wavelet coding, but seemingly in terms of general aspects only, not in terms of reconstruction quality. 
- The cited work of FINOLA by Chen et al. does not have a journal, conference or ArXiv ID. Is it published? Please complete the bibliography entry as this citation is of utmost importance for your work.

### Summary
This paper introduces the concept of "hidden waves," a phenomenon that enables the successful reconstruction of images through a series of one-way wave equations with hidden and adaptable speeds. To compute the initial conditions for each image, a visual encoder is employed based on the original image. The paper extends the existing framework of FINOLA by making two key enhancements: generalizing it and relaxing the local constraints. These relaxations not only enhance the image reconstruction performance but also lead to the observation of specific phenomena under certain conditions within the representation. They performed rigorous experiments to gain understanding of this perspective.

### Strengths
- Through mathematical enhancements and experiments, they develop a deep understanding of FINOLA, which is a general wave representation of an image.
- The section comparing "hidden wave representation" with image autoregression or transformations is well-written and provides clear insights into this encoding.
- They conducted numerous experiments to validate the improvements they implemented.

### Weaknesses
 - Experimental design

Drawing conclusions from the current results is uncertain due to the limited number of data points and the lack of significant differences. For instance, the interpretation of Table 3 remains unclear. Should we consider choosing initial condition positions different from the center? Overall, experiments were conducted from various perspectives, they do not yield meaningful insights or conclusions.

- The phenomenon is undoubtedly intriguing and interesting, it remains unclear how this method can be applied to future research or practical applications. The paper would be improved by including discussions on potential future perspectives.

### Questions
- Were all images resized to the same aspect ratio?  The aspect ratio can impact wave speed, and it may be more natural to preserve the aspect ratio from the original images.
- Conventional image compression methods like DCT transform the image into a linear composition of orthogonal basis. This is simple and provides a straightforward understanding of each coefficient. The paper effectively describes the differences, but what are the main strengths and weaknesses of this method?
- Is the selection of hyperparameters for training this method not very sensitive? How long does the training process take?
