- Decision: Reject
- Scores: 6, 6, 3, 6

## Abstract
While significant progress has been made on Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs), a comprehensive comparison of these methods across a wide range of Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) is still lacking. This study introduces PINNacle, a benchmarking tool designed to fill this gap. PINNacle provides a diverse dataset, comprising over 20 distinct PDEs from various domains, including heat conduction, fluid dynamics, biology, and electromagnetics. These PDEs encapsulate key challenges inherent to real-world problems, such as complex geometry, multi-scale phenomena, nonlinearity, and high dimensionality. PINNacle also offers a user-friendly toolbox, incorporating about 10 state-of-the-art PINN methods for systematic evaluation and comparison. We have conducted extensive experiments with these methods, offering insights into their strengths and weaknesses. In addition to providing a standardized means of assessing performance, PINNacle also offers an in-depth analysis to guide future research, particularly in areas such as domain decomposition methods and loss reweighting for handling multi-scale problems and complex geometry.  To the best of our knowledge, it is the largest benchmark with a diverse and comprehensive evaluation that will undoubtedly foster further research in PINNs.

### Summary
This paper provides both a collection of benchmark datasets as well as a standardized suite of PINN-type neural network PDE solution approximators arranged as a python package.

It further shows benchmark numbers of the different PINN methods on the benchmark datasets.

### Strengths
Providing any meaningful benchmark to the community is a valuable service.
In addition to creating the benchmark data sets, the authors have made a big effort in collecting and unifying PINN methods into a unified framework.
The paper appendix contains detailed specifications about the particular setup for the data benchmark.

### Weaknesses
While providing a benchmark data set to the community is a valuable service, several aspects could be improved.

Minor: 
-It would be great to have a table or list (in the appendix) detailing a comparison of the provided data sets to those in PDEarena (and PDEbench).

Major: 
- The relative error values in the results tables are for the most part shockingly bad and simply not useful for many numerical analysis contexts. Given that PINNs seem to be mostly providing different function spaces for PDE solutions, one original base PINN should be included in the benchmark, which is to give each hat function on a finite element mesh one parameter, and hence include finite element methods. Because some of the data sets were created using FEM, the original mesh would yield 0 error, but different meshes may not, and in particular coarser meshes would accumulate error. Analyzing a curve of remeshing from same resolution to coarse would provide a baseline for the performances of the other PINNs.

- In the above sense, it also becomes important to quantify flop counts. It appears that most PINNs need to be fitted for each PDE solution, incurring the typically high flop count of solving an optimization problem (compared to one forward pass), and only some of them can learn solutions conditional on hyperparameters given as input and require only forward passes to solve e.g. from different inital conditions.
For all cases, there should be 3 different flop counts provided: 1) The number of flops required to create the training set 2) The number of flops required for any general training of the method  3) the number of flops required to evaluate/fit the method on a particular example. Many PINNs, and the FEM baseline would only have nonzero counts in point 3, and it would be good to compare them.
Having flop counts or even wall time counts would allow answering questions like "at equal error rate, does fitting a PINN or fitting FEM cost more computational power?" and "At equal computing power, can FEM beat the error rates of the listed PINNs?"

- continuing the discussion about flop counts, methods learning from multiple data sets/examples should be included in order to compare flop counts and provide additional reference error values. In particular for the time propagating PDEs, solutions using U-nets or FNOs from e.g. PDE bench should be included as reference values, in terms of performance, flops required for training, flops required to generate the required training data, and flops required to run a forward pass to obtain a solution. Then one can assess how many PINNs or FEM solutions one can compute for the same budget as a certain number of forward passes of the propagator network. The should be a break-even point at some number of forward passes justifying the training effort.

Without these points, the benchmark is unfortunately sitting just beyond actual widespread utility. I would highly encourage the authors to add these baselines to make the benchmark useful. Despite my positive bias towards benchmarking efforts I cannot recommend acceptance of this paper in its current state.

### Summary
This paper provides a comprehensive comparison of PINN training methods, problems, and data. The paper visits common problems with training PINNs, namely the complex geometry, the multi-scale phenomena, nonlinearity of some PDE ofrs, and the high dimensional PDE problems. They also provide various training mechanisms such as domain decomposition and loss reweighting methods.

### Strengths
1. The paper is well-written; it seems obvious this work has gone through a few rounds of polishing and review.
2. The literature review is detailed and comprehensive.
3. The challenging aspects of training PINNs are decomposed and categorized well.
4. The appendix section of the paper is thorough and contains quality information.
5. The suite of experiments is admittedly comprehensive; there are more than 20 PDE forms, 10 methods considered and compartmentalized well in this paper.
6. The scale of the experiments and the analyses of the hyper-parameters is certainly admirable.

### Weaknesses
1. I'm saying out of respect to the author's work, but this paper may be more suited for a journal format. In particular, the page limit constraint is hitting the work hard in my opinion.

  * By the time the authors present the data and experiments, there is less than half a page left to interpret the results and provide discussions and conclusions.
  * Many key discussions, at different points in the main text, were deferred to the appendix. While they do exist in the appendix and carry out important information, they carry more scientific content than the existing paper's text.

    To be clear, the paper's topic is certainly relevant to ICLR and could benefit the ICLR community. However, the conference format may not be the most suitable to present the work as best as it could have been.

2. The work utilizes 10 different methods for training PINNs, but a brief description of these methods in a single mathematical framework is missing. Adding such a description and correlating the numerical findings to the theoretical properties of each method is probably the most important, yet under-performed, part of the work in my opinion.

    To be clear, I understand the paper's space constraints, but this is very important in my opinion. The least the authors could do is to add such a section, however briefly, to the appendix.

5: You are absolutely certain about your assessment. You are very familiar with the related work and checked the math/other details carefully.

### Summary
The paper provides a benchmarking tool called PINNacle which was lacking in the domain of PINNs. The tool provides a diverse set of 20 different PDEs spanning over various application domains. The tool also provides implementations of 10 state-of-the-art techniques in PINNs and shows extensive experiments to show the strengths and weaknesses of each method.

### Strengths
1. The paper is overall well written and easy to follow.
2. The paper provides an extensive comparison of the different SOTA methods for different PDEs.

### Weaknesses
1. The paper lacks technical novelty to be considered for the main track. In my opinion, the paper is more suitable for an application/dataset track, for e.g., NeurIPS Dataset/Benchmark Track.
2. The insights provided in the paper are not novel and are also well-known in the PINN literature which the paper cites as well.
3. Table 3 shows that all of the selected SOTA methods fail on the KS Equation. However, some PINN methods can solve KS Equations such as Causal PINNs [1].
4. When comparing the effect of the parametric PDEs on different PINN variants (shown in Table 4), using the Average L2RE is not a good choice. It would be more informative to show the mean and the standard deviations for the different parameter choices. The average L2RE can be skewed if one (or few) of the parameter settings fails (i.e., have L2RE of 100%) while others have very low errors (such as ~1e-4).

### Weaknesses
The paper has some areas it could improve on.

First, the authors only discuss PINN methods. They didn't look at other common methods. It would be good to see how PINN methods compare to these.

Second, they didn't give much detail on what computer stuff is needed for PINN methods. They did say if the methods work fast or slow. But, it would be helpful to know what computer tools or power is needed. People who want to use these methods would find that information useful.

Last, the authors worked with a set of 20 PDE problems. But they might have missed some other important problems. In future studies, it would be good to add more problems to their list. This way, we can learn even more.

### Questions
How did you ensure that the PINN methods you evaluated were able to handle the diverse range of PDEs in your dataset, and what challenges did you encounter in this process?

Can you describe the process of training the neural networks for each PDE, and how you optimized the hyperparameters for each method?

How did you handle issues such as boundary conditions and initial conditions in your experiments, and what strategies did you use to ensure that these conditions were satisfied?

Can you discuss the limitations of your benchmarking tool, and how future research could address these limitations to further advance the field of PINNs?
