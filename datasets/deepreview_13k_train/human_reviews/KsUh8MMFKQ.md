## Abstract
In this work, we aim to teach robots to manipulate various thin-shell materials. 
Prior works studying thin-shell object manipulation mostly rely on heuristic policies or learn policies from real-world video demonstrations, and only focus on limited material types and tasks (\textit{e.g.,} cloth unfolding). However, these approaches face significant challenges when extended to a wider variety of thin-shell materials and a diverse range of tasks.
On the other hand, while virtual simulations are shown to be effective in diverse robot skill learning and evaluation, prior thin-shell simulation environments only support a subset of thin-shell materials, which also limits their supported range of tasks. 
To fill in this gap, we introduce \textit{\model} - a fully differentiable simulation platform tailored for robotic interactions with diverse thin-shell materials possessing varying material properties, enabling flexible thin-shell manipulation skill learning and evaluation. Building on top of our developed simulation engine, we design a diverse set of manipulation tasks centered around different thin-shell objects. Our experiments suggest that manipulating thin-shell objects presents several unique challenges: 1) thin-shell manipulation relies heavily on frictional forces due to the objects' co-dimensional nature, 2) the materials being manipulated are highly sensitive to minimal variations in interaction actions, and 3) the constant and frequent alteration in contact pairs makes trajectory optimization methods susceptible to local optima, and neither standard reinforcement learning algorithms nor trajectory optimization methods (either gradient-based or gradient-free) are able to solve the tasks alone. To overcome these challenges, we present an optimization scheme that couples sampling-based trajectory optimization and gradient-based optimization, boosting both learning efficiency and converged performance across various proposed tasks. In addition, the differentiable nature of our platform facilitates a smooth sim-to-real transition. By tuning simulation parameters with a minimal set of real-world data, we demonstrate successful deployment of the learned skills to real-robot settings. Video demonstration and more information can be found on the project website\footnote{ \url{https://vis-www.cs.umass.edu/ThinShellLab/}}.

### Summary
The paper introduces a differentiable simulator designed to handle thin shell materials such as sheets of paper and cloth to explore manipulation of such objects. To this end a set of tasks are defined to challenge various methods. Finally, an approach to tackle the proposed tasks using combining sampling and optimization is proposed.

### Strengths
- Development of a simulator for specific kind of object geometries
- Definition of a set of tasks to challenge manipulation methods on thin objects
- Overall easy to understand and follow

### Weaknesses
The idea of the paper are clear and the writing is easy to follow. Some of that, however, stems from a lack of detail regarding the simulator and the tasks. The description of the simulator, one of the core contributions, is barely a page long and mostly covers high-level concepts, physical quantities being modeled, and methods used to implement the simulator. I would have expected to see greater detail about this as currently it's hard to assess if this is a straight forward task of writing up a few equations or involved required complex derivations and developments. What also would be good is a discussion regarding the chosen way of modeling thin objects, as the approach selected is likely not the only one and a discussion of the pros and cons of modeling the interactions one way or another would be a valuable contribution.

Another aspect where more detail would be expected are the task descriptions. The tasks are easy to understand at a high level. However, their actual definition is omitted which makes it unclear what objective the various methods are required to optimize for later on. As there are many ways to formulate the described tasks it is important to have this information present.

One aspect of the experiments that could be improved is conveying what the goal is. The only information is that the goal is to evaluate the performance and behavior of the simulator and methods. Being more concrete and actually laying out the things to be investigated would improve the readability of the entire section.

The presentation of the results is at times incomplete. For example, Table 2 shows numbers with +/- values but there is no mention of what those values are. One can assume that it is mean +/- standard deviation, however, this should be stated clearly. In that table there is also a single row which has no +/- values, why? There are also various cells in the table that are lacking values, which is not explained. The results list score values for each of the tasks, but without knowing level of "success" these scores correspond to it is impossible to know whether the differences in scores are significant or not.

The presentation of the real-world experiments does not convey any information and fails to provide information. This section should either be improved to add actual experimental data, as opposed to referring the reader to an appendix with a handful of plots, and provide a discussion.

The paper describes a hybrid approach, though details are extremely limited. Due to the lack of detail of that approach and the focus being about the simulator, it is unclear why this was added nor that it adds anything. The idea of combining global search with local refinement is sensible. However, I would expect this to be common knowledge in the RL community given the (by default) unguided nature of RL exploration and the fact that RL tends to perform well once it finds a solution to a problem. There are also odd behaviors of the hybrid method that are not discussed. In some of the curves shown in Figure 3 the variance in the scores are excessively large, why does this occur?

Another question that should be addressed is the benchmark aspect. The paper states that the goal is for this to be used as a benchmark. Is the idea to use this similar to gym and atari game setups, or more like the benchmarks used in the computer vision community with tasks on withheld data to counteract overfitting on a set of tasks?

The core aspects of the paper, i.e. the simulator and task descriptions, are good yet could benefit from additional detail. The experiments are ok, though need to be improved to more clearly convey their information.

### Questions
- What solution quality / success rate do the various rewards correspond to?
- How fast does the simulator run, is it real-time, faster, slower?
- What is the limit of object complexity that can be simulated?

### Summary
The paper introduces ThinShellLab, a differentiable simulation platform tailored for robotic interactions with diverse thin-shell materials possessing varying material properties, enabling flexible thin-shell manipulation skill learning and evaluation. The experiments highlight unique challenges in thin-shell manipulation, such as reliance on frictional forces, sensitivity to minimal variations in interactions, and frequent contact pair changes. The authors also study a hybrid optimization scheme that combines sampling-based trajectory optimization and gradient-based optimization. They also showcase the proposed simulation platform allows for a smooth transition from simulation to real-world robot deployment.

### Strengths
1. The proposed simulator can model diverse thin-shell materials with a wide range of bending-stiffness and bending plasticity, as well as frictional contact between thin-shell materials and end-effectors, which is hardly modeled in prior benchmarks.

### Weaknesses
1. The writing is not clear enough. Please see the *Questions* section for details.
2. Figure 2 can be improved. The images are not well aligned. There is not a clear boundary between "left" and "right" mentioned in the caption, which makes it hard to distinguish 7 manipulation tasks and 3 inverse design tasks.
3. It is better to have some success indicators for tasks in the benchmark. Otherwise, it is hard for readers to understand difference in performance between methods, if only rewards are provided (e.g., Table 2).

Minor typo: In B.1, the table is linked to the section B.1 instead of Table 3.

### Questions
1. In Sec 4.1, it seems that the observation includes a set of points. Does the order of points matter? How do the learning algorithms (SAC, PPO) used in the paper handle the observation if the input observations (points) are unordered?
2. In Sec 4.1, does the 6DoF stand for the pose change in SE(3), and does the 7DoF include one more DoF for gripper closeness (mimic behaviors for two finger tips)?
3. In Sec 5.1, the authors mentioned that they reported "the maximum scores achieved within a specified number of timesteps". Does it mean that the benchmark currently focuses on "optimization" rather than "generalization"? Besides, how do the authors count "timesteps" for CMA-ES and GD methods?
4. What's the meaning of "episode" (x-axis) for GD and CMA-ES in Figure 3?
5. In Sec 5.2, for "our gradient-based method converges these parameters towards a uniform outcome.", do the authors mean that the method converges to similar solutions despite different initialization?

### Summary
The paper shows a comprehensive benchmark framework for thin-shell object manipulation. A simulation environment is provided that expands upon previous work by including bending-stiffness and frictional contact. Since this simulation is differentiable, the authors show how gradient-based optimization can be used to enhance existing gradient-free methods for finding better performing policies for various robotics tasks. Real-world validation is shown on a specific subset of tasks for sim-to-real accuracy.

### Strengths
A much needed framework for robotic manipulation of general thin-shell objects is proposed by the authors, which will enable the robotics community to tackle more challenging problems in the future. Although the separate parts in the simulation is not a novelty in itself, the whole framework and its validation in benchmarks is a valuable addition to the field. The paper describes the tasks clearly, and the accompanying website is easy to understand and shows the core contributions well. A lot of analysis was provided as well to all the tasks, and on how and why the hybrid optimization method helps in solving the given problems.

### Weaknesses
The presentation in the paper does not feel quite as refined as the website, especially the figures, feel like they could use some work. For example, Figure 2 does not have the image bounding boxes align, and within the Sliding subfigure you can see how the edges of the images don't match up. A similar small issue is present in Figure 3 with a typo in "Separatering". Unfortunately, most of the presented tasks are dynamic, hence images don't capture them all that well, and hence the animations on the website do a more convincing job on why this particular application case matters.
Another point is that a lot of information is pushed to the Appendix, even though it could be beneficial to have in the main text. For example, the description of the hybrid method, which is a quite large engineering contribution of the paper to show working policies, is described on a high-level. A more detailed description would help here, and mentioning how much work it was to tune/balance the gradient-free and gradient-based steps could help the community. Another example is how the real-to-sim system identification is performed, how the disparity between simulation and reality is computed, these details should be included.

### Questions
How well does the simulation environment run in practice, is it achieving something close to real-time, or how long does simulation take? When parallelizing the simulations on GPU, does that only benefit CMA-ES and RL, or is GD also gaining some advantage from the parallelized environments?

### Summary
This study focuses on teaching robots to manipulate a variety of thin-shell materials. It includes the introduction of ThinShellLab, a fully differentiable simulation platform that is specifically designed for robotic interactions with an array of thin-shell materials. The researchers conduct numerous experiments using reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms, in conjunction with sampling-based, gradient-based, and hybrid trajectory optimization methods, across 10 different thin-shell manipulation tasks.

### Strengths
1. The ThinShellLab is unique, standing as the first simulator of its kind to support a diverse range of thin-shell materials while also maintaining differentiability.

2. Unlike existing simulators, it has the capability to support Bending Plasticity.

3. This innovative simulator offers a benchmark for understanding prevalent methods associated with thin-shell objects, accommodating various types of approaches such as RL, and trajectory optimization.

### Weaknesses
1. The overall presentation is good. However, there could be improvements in clearly labeling the three system identification inverse tasks - Sliding, Bouncing, and Card - in both Table 2 and Figure 3. Their current placement together without clear labels within the table or graph is confusing. 

2. Furthermore, it would enhance the paper if some clear conclusions were drawn, along with providing some directions or suggestions to guide readers to explore each type of method.

### Questions
Interested to know what is the speed of the simulation? Is multiple GPU parallelization supported by the simulation?

### Summary
This work develops ThinShellLab, a simulator and benchmark for robotic learning in thin-shell material manipulation.
The simulator models volumetric and thin-shell materials with finite-element methods with tetrahedral and triangular elements, and is differentiable.
The robotic manipulation benchmark defines tasks including lifting, separating, following, folding, pick-folding, and forming. The benchmark is used to evaluate manipulation methods including sampling-based, gradient-based, and hybrid trajectory optimization, as well as reinforcement learning methods.
The simulator is also shown to support system identification, which allows transferring certainly simulated policies to be deployed in the real world.

### Strengths
- This work is the first to properly implement a differentiable thin-shell object simulator for robotic manipulation.
- The paper is overall written clearly.
- The manipulation tasks are well-designed to reflect properties of thin-shell materials. The benchmarked methods have good coverage.

### Weaknesses
 - Some details of the simulator are not clear (see Questions section).
- Some useful simulation features are not shown in this paper.
  - It seems the system does not fully support/couple with rigid-body simulation, which is important for modeling robots.
  - The paper does not show any tasks involving constraint simulation (e.g., cloth with one end fixed).
- Real-world manipulation only contains a single case. It is not convincing that in general the described system identification method will improve sim-to-real policy deployment.


### Questions
- The contact model uses quadratic energy instead of barrier. How does the system correctly identify that 2 triangles are penetrating? Based on the paper, it seems it is based on normal direction, however, this does not seem correct since the normal would flip if one of the contacting shell is flipped.
- The paper describes the system as simulating tetrahedral and triangular elements, how is the rigid-body action space achieved?
- Newton's method requires solving a large linear system. How is this implement on the GPU? Is it solved through sparse matrix algorithms, conjugate gradient methods, or some other method?
- What is the speed/performance of this simulator? What are the bottlenecks?
