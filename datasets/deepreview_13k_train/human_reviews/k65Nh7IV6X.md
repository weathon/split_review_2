# Two-shot learning of continuous interpolation using a conceptor-aided recurrent autoencoder

- Decision: Reject
- Scores: 3, 6, 6, 3

## Abstract
Generalizing from only two time series towards unseen intermediate patterns poses a significant challenge in representation learning. In this paper, we introduce a novel representation learning algorithm, "Conceptor-Aided Recurrent Autoencoder" (CARAE), which leverages a conceptor-based regularization to learn to generate a continuous spectrum of intermediate temporal patterns while just being trained on two distinct examples. Here, conceptors, a linear subspace characterization of neuron activations, are employed to impose a low-dimensional geometrical bottleneck on the neural dynamics. During training,  CARAE assembles a continuous and stable manifold between the two trained temporal patterns. Exploiting this manifold in the inference, CARAE facilitates continuous and phase-aligned interpolation between temporal patterns that are not linked within the training data. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the CARAE framework through comprehensive experiments on temporal pattern generation tasks and the generation of novel complex motion patterns based on the MoCap data set.

### Summary
The work proposed CARAE an approach of learning a continuous spectrum of temporal representation from two sequence of training examples. The proposed approach is based on the existing study of Conceptor and a matrix conceptor $C$ is inserted into an RNN model to control the update dynamics of the RNN's internal states. Two separate $C$s are learned from the two training sequences and a regularization term in the training objective attempts to minimize their distance. Interpolation is performed between the two $C$s to generate sequences that have temporal patterns interpolating between the two training sequences.

### Strengths
The proposed problem setting is indeed challenging and novel and despite the challenging setting. Qualitative results from experiments on both synthetic data and real-world MOCAP data suggest the capability of the proposed CARAE in learning interpolatable representation from two training sequences.

### Weaknesses
The major weakness of the work is a lack of justification for its practical significance, which makes it difficult to judge the work's contribution.
1. It is hard for me to judge the practical significance of the problem settings of the work, learning a continuous spectrum of representations that can interpolate between two training examples. The work mentioned related works of interpolatable representation learning in different areas, including locomotion modelling, robotics, and reinforcement learning. None of the mentioned work studies problems settings even close to the proposed setting. The proposed setting also restricts the approach to a two-shot learning setting and it is not clear how the approach can be extended to few-shot learning settings with more training examples and if the proposed approach would still have any practical value when larger amount of training data is available, which is not unusual in practice. 
2. The proposed CARAE is based on an artificial RNN model with specific architecture designs, which is different from more commonly used RNN architectures like LSTM or GRU. Extending CARAE to these more common RNN architectures or more recent transformer architecture could significantly improve its practical value.

Apart from my concerns on practical significance, the work also have the following minor weakness:
1. In Sec. 5, the work uses *two data sets* and *two distinct examples* to call $u_1$ and $u_2$ which can be confusing. It would be much more clear if $u_1$ and $u_2$ are referred to as two training examples consistently in the work.
2. The work only presents qualitative results and training loss curves. The lack of a systematic quantitive evaluations makes the proposed approach and claimed contributions less convincing.

### Questions
In Sec. 2, the work identifies 4 challenges in the ability of RNN to generalize to different temporal dynamics. **Inferences** is explicated tackled with in Sec. 3. Does CARAE address the other three challenges? If so, how are they addressed?

2: You are willing to defend your assessment, but it is quite likely that you did not understand the central parts of the submission or that you are unfamiliar with some pieces of related work. Math/other details were not carefully checked.

### Summary
The paper proposes to use conceptors (soft-projection matrices) to constrain the dynamics of an RNN to a low dimensional geometry space when learning temporal patterns in a two-shot regime. By encouraging the conceptors corresponding to the two input patterns to be close to each other when training in an autoencoder setup, the RNN learns a manifold of conceptors that can be traversed to generate interpolations, similar to the latent space traversal in a VAE.
The proposed method is validated with a simple sine waves example and with an example of interpolating between walking and running using 2 sequences from the Mocap dataset.

### Strengths
The idea of learning to control the dynamics of an RNN with only two-shots is very appealing. 
The proposed formulation is simple and appears to work very well for the given examples.
The method seems to be novel, but I do not have enough familiarity with the topic to give a stronger assessment.
The paper is well written.

### Weaknesses
If the two sequences differ in multiple underlying factors, would the learnt interpolation still give sensible results? E.g. given 2 moving mnist sequences, that differ in the colour of the digits (red vs blue on black background) and the digits themselves (e.g. 0s vs 8s), what would the interpolations look like?

Were the values of \beta_1 and \beta_2 (in eq 8) ablated?

Small comment: in Fig 3 (c->j), it is difficult to distinguish the different colours.

Post rebuttal and after checking the other reviews, I decided to reduce the score to 6. Indeed, the evaluation could be improved.

### Summary
The authors introduce a novel algorithm called "Conceptor-Aided Recurrent Autoencoder" (CARAE) to address the challenge that generalizing from just two time series to create intermediate patterns in the context of representation learning. In addition, the author show the effectiveness proposed method on mocap motion modeling .

### Strengths
- The method section is well prepared and concise.

### Weaknesses
In all honesty, I'm not well-versed in this particular subject, and I've noticed that there are limited related works available for reference. Despite dedicating a significant amount of time to study the topic, I'm still finding it challenging to provide a comprehensive and professional feedback on the paper.


- Limited Related Works: Research can be more challenging when there are few related works to use as a basis for comparison or to gain a deeper understanding of the context.

- Outdated References: The reference to Jaeger (2014) being eight years old may indicate that the paper doesn't incorporate more recent developments in the field. It's common in rapidly evolving fields like machine learning for research to become outdated relatively quickly.

### Questions
1. Why using RNN rather than more recent and powerful transformer architecture?
2. Why there is not a comparison with related works or baseline?
3. It's hard to get that (b) in Figure 4 is intermediate pattern.

### Summary
This paper deals with analysis of time series. It is proposed to design a generator of such time series from limited observation data.Those data being limited in the sense that only two patterns type are considered as available. The aim of this paper is then to be able to generate 'intermediate' patterns. This is performed through the use of recurrent auto-encoder with a conceptor-based regularization. This conceptor-based regularization is based on two folds: (1) ensuring a close representation of patterns and (2) ensuring close conceptors for each pattern. 
From this trained recurrent auto-encoder, a linear interpolation of conceptors is proposed to generate intermediate patterns.

Experimental results are reported on sine-wave patterns and MoCap motion modelling.

### Strengths
The proposed method allows to provide a recurrent auto-encoder generator that is able to generate continuous type of patters although being trained on two patterns.

### Weaknesses
The proposed controlled recurrent auto-encoder allows to be able to generate continuous patterns evolution between two initial pattern of time series. However this is quite hard to assess the benefits of the proposed approach since no comparison to other technique is proposed nor any quality metrics. Only subjective evaluation is reported.

References to equation and figures needs to be revisited since when cited it is often omitted to mention if it refers to a table, image or other.

As quickly mentioned in footnote of page 6, SPD matrices are to be associated to a specific manifold. So linear interpolation used in equation 10 could be discutable. But also the distance metric used in equation 8. It would be interesting to consider also here some classical metrics and interpolation technique of SPD matrices to see the impact of distance metric and interpolation technique there. See also [1,2] for additional paper on SPD matrices metrics.

No discussion on the impact of $\beta_1, \beta_2$ parameter is provided. What about for exemple using only pattern proximity (e.g. $\beta_1=0$) ?

Details on backward pass in appendix B.2 is quite useless when considering Deep Learning frameworks that automaticaly compute back-propagation path (e.g. TensorFlow, Pytorch).

### Questions
1. Could there be objective metric to evaluate the performance of proposed approach? For example what about having a 3rd pattern to be used for evaluation?
2. What about the impact of $\beta_1, \beta_2$ hyper-parameters? Could there be a specific ablation study?
3. How does the proposed technique performs with respect to other approaches?
