# Conditional Information Bottleneck Approach for Time Series Imputation

- Decision: Accept
- Scores: 6, 6, 6, 8

## Abstract
Time series imputation presents a significant challenge because it requires capturing the underlying temporal dynamics from partially observed time series data. Among the recent successes of imputation methods based on generative models, the information bottleneck (IB) framework offers a well-suited theoretical foundation for multiple imputations, allowing us to account for the uncertainty associated with the imputed values. However, directly applying the IB framework to time series data without considering their temporal context can lead to a substantial loss of temporal dependencies, which, in turn, can degrade the overall imputation performance. To address such a challenge, we propose a novel conditional information bottleneck (CIB) approach for time series imputation, which aims to mitigate the potentially negative consequences of the regularization constraint by focusing on reducing the redundant information conditioned on the temporal context. We provide a theoretical analysis of its effect by adapting variational decomposition. We use the resulting insight and propose a novel deep learning method that can approximately achieve the proposed CIB objective for time series imputation as a combination of evidence lower bound and novel temporal kernel-enhanced contrastive optimization. Our experiments, conducted on multiple real-world datasets, consistently demonstrate that our method significantly improves imputation performance (including both interpolation and extrapolation), and also enhances classification performance based on the imputed values.

### Summary
The paper *Cconditional Information Bottleneck Approach for Time Series* extends the information bottleneck (IB) to deal with time series imputation by proposing a novel conditional information bottleneck. The authors also propose a novel deep learning method that can approximately achieve the proposed CIB objective for time series imputation using the lower bound and a novel temporal kernel. The proposed model is compared against some state-of-the-art VAE-based models for time series imputations under three different datasets, showing promising results and outperforming the other baselines.

### Strengths
The paper is well-structured and easy to follow. The motivation and the proposed method are very well described in the manuscript and nicely derived in the Appendix. The more tricky points are also well described (e.g. the application of the chain rule in Equation 5). The related work section is also nicely depicted, making clear that the authors are aware of the most recent works for missing data imputations in temporal series. Finally, the results are concise and clear to read. It is evident from the results that their proposed method opens very prospective lines for future research in missing data imputation in time series. 

Furthermore, the paper holds interest from an information bottleneck perspective in two significant ways. Firstly, it extends the information bottleneck concept to a conditional information bottleneck, representing a novel contribution in its own right. Secondly, the introduction of a fresh objective for VAE-based models to address missing data concerns is noteworthy. The authors follow the standard assumptions for handling missing data using VAEs, such as evaluating the objective on the observations of filling the missing points with zeros. However, the paper sets itself apart not solely due to its new objective based on the conditional information bottleneck but also because of its capacity to generate fresh avenues of research and stimulate discussions during the conference

### Weaknesses
I would like to point out some weaknesses that I consider the paper exhibits and that could be further analyzed by the authors:

1. As many papers dealing with temporal data, sometimes notation becomes a bit complex and makes the reading more difficult. 
2. I believe more information about the experimental section could be provided. That, is, for HealingMNIST and RotatedMNIST, which kind of CNN-based encoder/decoder architecture is being used; for Physionet, which kind of networks are used? There is no information about this, especially for the proposed method, since for baselines this can be accessed in their referred papers. And this is quite important when asking why the proposed method outperforms any other baseline. This leads me to the following point. 
3. I am a bit hesitant about the superior performance of the proposed method in (almost) every dataset and performance metric. This creates some doubts that will be asked in the question section.
4. There is no reference for code availability to reproduce the experiments. Will you upload the code to Git Hub or any available repository? This is rather important for the sake of reproducibility. And given that the results are (fairly always) better than baselines, this should be a must-have for this paper. 
5. I find the paper rather novel in terms of the proposal of the CIB objective. However, in terms of the VAE-based model, I believe there is much inspiration coming from GPVAE [1], due to the idea of including an extra kernel to further enhance the learning of the temporal dynamics. Is this the case? Should the authors be more worried about properly referencing this work?
6. An ablation study should be included to determine the importance of each contribution in the paper. That is, i) how the different terms in the proposed objective influence the optimization ii) how important is it to introduce the kernel — without the kernel, would the results approach the ones from GPVAE, or does the proposed model still outperform other baselines? I think it is important to analyze each contribution of the paper to obtain a clear and detailed view of the behaviour of the proposed model.

### Questions
Here are some questions that I would like the authors to address:

1. In Equation 7, in the denominator, why do you have a summation over X when you don’t have any variable x, just z? This also holds for Equation 9. I believe you mean that you sample from the encoder to get z out of x. However, I think the equation could be improved. 
2. The samples from Equation 4, how are they taken? How many samples? Is the method sensible to the number of samples? Do the results improve by taking more samples? Did you consider the following approaches such as MIWAE? 
3. Why do you always outperform all baselines, in all datasets under any missing data assumption? I find it rather surprising given that you have a loss (Equation 8) composed of three terms, which I believe must be difficult to optimize. Besides, there is not much information about the $\beta$ and $\gamma$ parameters. How do they influence the optimization? There is no discussion about this. 
4. What do black crosses and black dots represent in Figure 3? I believe dots are observations and crosses missing points, but this is not commented on. 
5. Looking at Figure 3a), for example: how is it possible that HIVAE and GP-VAE obtain such poor results compared to your proposed method? I assume this is the case for HIVAE since it is not designed to deal with temporal data, but for GP-VAE this is very surprising. As described in [2], I would expect this to happen in the missing parts, where the GPVAE would produce a more “mean” solution less correlated to the original signal. However, in the observations, I would expect the GP-VAE to obtain better results. 
6. In Table 3 you have an interesting result. In terms of RMSE, it can be observed that mean imputation (one of the most naive approaches) outperforms any baseline, even state-of-the-art methods. What do you think about this result? As observed in [2], sometimes error metrics are inconclusive when evaluating temporal scenarios. Did you find this behaviour in other datasets? Did you think about the possibility of instead of using missing data randomly or following other mechanisms (which you withdrew from GPVAE and other papers I believe) using missing data in burts or sequences, where actually it is the standard scenario you would find in a temporal scenario such as in healthcare? This could be an interesting point to be analyzed here: check whether the solutions from baselines and proposed methods are more correlated.

### Summary
This paper focuses on time series imputation. The authors believe that information bottleneck (IB) is a well-suited theoretical foundation for imputation task. While directly applying conventional IB framework may results in substantial loss of temporal dependencies, the authors propose a novel conditional information bottleneck (CIB) approach. The proposed CIB suggests the model to learn more information about latent representation from temporal contexts. The idea is novel and interesting, which is supported by some theoretical analysis and experimental result.

### Strengths
1. The proposed TimeCIB is novel and technical sound.
2. The theoretical analysis is solid, making the whole framework more persuasive and reliable.
3. Smoothing the latent representation is interesting and novel.

### Weaknesses
1. The motivation of using conditional term $X^o_t | X^o_{\t}$ should be further explained. Why using the conditional term can tackle the issue of conventional IB? The explanation lacks a clear, intuitive connection to the problem of temporal dependencies. It's not immediately obvious why conditioning on the *other* time steps helps preserve temporal structure, and a more detailed explanation of the underlying mechanism is needed. Specifically, how does minimizing information from the *other* time steps, *given* the current time step, prevent the model from losing crucial temporal dynamics? This requires a more rigorous justification, beyond a high-level description.
2. A figure of the whole framework will be helpful for understanding this work.
3. The compared baselines are out of date. There exist massive works on time series imputation, the authors should compare their method with more recent works.
4. It would be appreciated if the authors could provide code.

### Summary
Time series with missing values are prevalent in real-world applications. The paper proposes the use of an improved information bottleneck approach for irregular time series imputation, achieving superior performance compared to other VAE-based methods, as demonstrated in the experiments.

### Strengths
The model effectively addresses the issue of temporal information loss in the latent space of VAEs.

### Weaknesses
1. The paper exclusively focuses on Variational Autoencoder (VAE) models grounded in Information Bottleneck (IB) theory.  While this approach is well-articulated, it is notable that other kinds of generative models, for instance, ODE-based models and diffusion models, have demonstrated remarkable performance in the field of time series imputation.  The absence of a discussion or comparison with SOTA models in the related work and experimental sections is conspicuous, making it less convincing regarding its contribution to the irregular time series imputation task.

2. While the paper introduces a novel regularization method in the context of time series imputation, the innovation appears to be somewhat incremental. The approach can be perceived as a clever technique or ‘Trick’ rather than a substantial paradigm shift.

### Questions
1. What are the unique aspects of the CIB approach compared to other methodologies, including ODE, transformers, and diffusion models? Can you provide a more comprehensive evaluation, including comparisons with state-of-the-art models like ODE-based models and diffusion models, to demonstrate the performance of your model?

2. The paper claims that the CIB approach can mitigate the excessive regularization associated with IB. However, there seems to be a lack of quantitative analysis to substantiate this claim.  It would be beneficial if the authors could provide explicit metrics or criteria to measure the extent of regularization and demonstrate how CIB effectively addresses this issue.

3. Mitigating regularization is a double-edged sword, as it might lead to overfitting, especially in the context of learning temporal dependencies in time series data.  The paper should address how the CIB approach ensures an optimal balance, preventing the model from overly adapting to the training data and subsequently degrading its performance on unseen data.  Is there any empirical evidence or theoretical analysis to showcase this balance?

4. Using MINIST in the illustration of temporal dependency (Figure 1) is dubious compared to other irregular time series datasets (e.g., weather, traffic). It cannot demonstrate how the model handles temporal dependencies between different dimensions in multi-variate situations. How does the CIB approach model handle the multi-variate dependencies exactly?

### Summary
This paper propose a novel time series imputation method inspired from the perspective of information bottleneck (IB). To solve the temporal context loss issue of vanilla IB, they propose a conditional IB to better consider temporal context. Several lower bound and upper bound are deducted for optimization. In a specific contrast learning loss, a kernel trick is used to reweright contribution of data from different time steps. Experiments results show that the proposed method achieve SOTA performance.

### Strengths
1. The method is inspired from a theoritical background of information bottleneck and can impute stochastically. 
2. The bound derivations are interesting.

### Weaknesses
1. In equation 4, both the entropy term and the KL term are dropped to compute the lower bound. Will this bound be too loose? After dropping, the lower bound looks like a reconstruction loss rather than mutual information. The justification for dropping the entropy term relies on it being independent of the model parameters, but this doesn't address whether the resulting bound is sufficiently tight for practical optimization. The KL divergence term is also dropped, and while the authors suggest it will be small if the variational approximation is good, this is an assumption that needs to be empirically validated, and the impact of this approximation on the overall bound tightness should be discussed.

2. The paper doesn't mention the number of learnable parameters for each method. This makes it difficult to assess the computational cost and efficiency of the proposed method relative to baselines. It is crucial to know if the performance gains are due to architectural advantages or simply due to a larger model size.

3. I'd like to see comparison with another two baselines mTAN [1] and CSDI [2]. These methods represent different approaches to time series imputation (attention-based and diffusion-based, respectively) and would provide a more comprehensive evaluation of the proposed method's strengths and weaknesses.
