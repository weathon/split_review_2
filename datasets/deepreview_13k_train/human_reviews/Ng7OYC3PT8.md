## Abstract
Training autonomous agents with sparse rewards is a long-standing problem in online reinforcement learning (RL), due to low data efficiency. Prior work overcomes this challenge by extracting useful knowledge from offline data, often accomplished through the learning of action distribution from offline data and utilizing the learned distribution to facilitate online RL. However, since the offline data are given and fixed, the extracted knowledge is inherently limited, making it difficult to generalize to new tasks. We propose a novel approach that leverages offline data to learn a generative diffusion model, coined as \emph{Adaptive Trajectory Diffuser (ATraDiff)}. This model generates synthetic trajectories, serving as a form of data augmentation and consequently enhancing the performance of online RL methods. The key strength of our diffuser lies in its adaptability, allowing it to effectively handle varying trajectory lengths and mitigate distribution shifts between online and offline data. Because of its simplicity, ATraDiff \emph{seamlessly integrates with a wide spectrum of RL methods}. Empirical evaluation shows that ATraDiff consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance across a variety of environments, with particularly pronounced improvements in complicated settings. Our code and demo video are available at \url{https://atradiff.io}.

### Summary
"ATraDiff: Accelerating Online Reinforcement Learning with Imaginary Trajectories" addresses the challenge of training autonomous agents with sparse rewards in online reinforcement learning (RL). The authors propose a novel approach called Adaptive Trajectory Diffuser (ATraDiff), which uses offline data to learn a generative diffusion model. This model generates synthetic trajectories that serve as data augmentation, thereby enhancing the performance of online RL methods.

The key advantage of ATraDiff is its adaptability, which allows it to handle varying trajectory lengths and mitigate distribution shifts between online and offline data. The simplicity of ATraDiff enables it to integrate seamlessly with a wide range of RL methods. Empirical evaluations show that ATraDiff consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance across various environments, with significant improvements in complex settings.

The paper also discusses related work in the areas of offline pre-training for online RL, diffusion models in RL, and data augmentation in RL. It provides a background on Markov Decision Processes (MDPs), diffusion models, and replay buffers, which are essential components of the proposed method.

The methodology section of the paper details the design and training of ATraDiff, its deployment in online RL, and an online adaptation mechanism that addresses distribution shifts. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of ATraDiff in improving the performance of online RL methods and offline-to-online RL algorithms in complicated environments.

### Strengths
A solid and technically sound paper. Addresses an important problem in RL using generative (diffusion) models for generating imaginary trajectories. Generality is another strength of the method -  ATraDiff can be integrated with any online RL algorithm with a replay buffer. Authors address in a clever way varying trajectory lengths and potential distribution shifts. The efficiency of the method was confirmed by a diverse set of experiments and ablation studies.

### Weaknesses
There is no data about trade-offs associated with using ATraDiff. Diffusion model data generation can be pretty slow. How does it affects wall-clock training time?

### Questions
Diffusion model data generation can be pretty time-consuming. How ATraDiff affects wall-clock training time for SAC and REDQ? It would be good to see more discussions and data on this topic.

### Confidence
3: You are fairly confident in your assessment. It is possible that you did not understand some parts of the submission or that you are unfamiliar with some pieces of related work. Math/other details were not carefully checked.

### Summary
This work trained diffusion model on offline data to generate more training trajectories so that it can accelerate online RL learning.

The authors conducted experiments on two settings 1) online RL setting (3 envs) and 2) offline-to-online (hybrid) setting (3 envs). The experimental results shows improvement comparing to baseline without using generated trajectories.

### Strengths
- Using diffusion model to generate trajectories as data augmentation approach is novel, as far as I know.
- The approach is relatively straightforward and can be combined with a wide family of RL approaches.

### Weaknesses
 - This approach assume the access to the ground truth reward function, which is a very impractical setting. Most of tasks evaluation of trajectories is expensive. 
- This work lack of discussion on the assumptions of offline datasets that is already available to the approach. Is it a medium quality dataset? Is it a low-quality dataset? Does it contains trajectories from optimal policy?  My understanding is that this will make substantial difference to the algorithm performance. The D4RL dataset contains different level of offline data. It would be good to clarify the setting of offline datasets.
- In the online setting, the fair comparison would be using the offline data with the online algorithms. e.g., learning from demonstration approaches would be a better baseline. O.w. the proposed approach has an advantage of using more offline data. It's unclear to me whether the improvement comes from the access to the additional offline dataset or the proposed approach.

### Questions
- Did the author consider replacing the query. of reward function from env by training a reward function from offline trajectories?

### Summary
The paper proposes ATraDiff, a data augmentation method to generate synthetic trajectories with diffusion models to enhance online RL and offline-to-online RL. The method is able to handle varying trajectory lengths, and overcome offline-to-online data distribution shifts. Orthogonally applicable to RL methods with a replay buffer, ATraDiff improves their performance on several benchmarks, particularly in complicated tasks.

### Strengths
- Good performance improvement, orthogonally applicable to any RL algorithm with a replay buffer.

### Weaknesses
 - The additional latency of using ATraDiff, and the continual training of the diffusion model on new experiences is not mentioned, but it's a rather important detail.
- Figure line names ordering and colours are not very intuitive to follow
- Would have liked to see an analysis on the quality of the images generated by ATraDiff, particularly it would be interesting to see how temporally correlated are the trajectories.
- Overall the paper would benefit from more in depth analysis of the ablation studies too. Would like to see comparison with the state-based diffuser on more tasks, as well as a full comparison with it's closest method SynthER, both in terms of performance and computational requirements.
- Unsure how reproducible the paper is as many implementation details are missing.

### Questions
- How temporally correlated are the image trajectories generated by diffusion? Does it create a coherent video? A good analysis on this would definitely strengthen the paper.
- What is the added latency of using ATraDiff compared to only using one of the baseline RL algorithms? Regardless if it's significantly more computationally expensive, it would still be helpful to know quantitatively.
- Not sure I understand why there is no comparison with its closest method SynthER?

To recap, a more insightful analysis on the kind and quality of trajectories generated, and a comparison with SynthER could help improve the score.

Edit: Rating improved after concerns were addressed by the authors response.

### weaknesses:
 See questions.

### questions:
 1. In Sec. 4.2, is the synthetic trajectory actually $(\ldots,s_L,a_L)$ instead of $(\ldots, s_t,a_t)$? 
2. How can the reward $R(s_i,a_i)$ of a synthetic state-action pair be calculated from the environment if the action is not executed in the environment, or is the reward function accessible to the agent?
3. In the last part of Sec. 4.3, it states that "Hence, we will randomly drop some samples from the maintained subset regardless of
their importance". Is there any ablation study to support the effectiveness of this random dropping strategy?
4. A recent work [1] about offline and online data augmentation using diffusion models has been published. Could you please include some comparison between your work and [1]? Experimental comparison will be better.

### Summary
The paper introduces a method to generate synthetic trajectories for online reinforcement learning using diffusion models, using offline data to bootstrap data generation. The training data for the diffusion model is generated by projecting low-dimensional states to images and then stacking them in a single image. The authors then fine-tune Stable Diffusion with this dataset, with the option to continuously update with online data. Generated images are then projected back to low-dimensional states. The resulting approach improves performance on a number of standard benchmarks.

### Strengths
- The problem setting is well-motivated and important to data efficient reinforcement learning.
- The paper proposes an interesting approach to generating trajectories in image-space by fine-tuning Stable Diffusion with stacked images.
- The approach shows promising results across a wide variety of datasets and benchmarks, with ablations on relevant portions of the algorithm.

### Weaknesses
While the paper shows promising improvements over the non-augmented baseline, unclear presentation and missing details make it hard to determine the contribution of the paper. In particular, 
- **(Incomplete description of algorithm)** A huge amount of detail is missing when the authors claim they convert states to images and then back to states in Section 4.1. This is highly non-trivial and should be justified further. For example, can the authors present pictures of rendered states, what is the error from converting to image and back again? There is also no description of how Stable Diffusion was fine-tuned or how long online image generation takes. Furthermore, it is not explained how the authors would generate low-dimensional actions or obtain rewards from an image model.
- **(Benefit of trajectories vs. transitions)** The paper claims “full trajectories offer a more comprehensive source of information, enabling RL agents to better learn from past experiences” without evidence in the introduction. No comparison is made to the transition-based baseline in [1] which also evaluates on the same MuJoCo locomotion environments in Figure 2. Furthermore, [3] also proposes a trajectory based method for generating synthetic data with diffusion models and is not discussed.
- **(Why project states to images)** The paper claims that generating a collection of images outperforms single states in Figure 5. It is unclear why the simpler option of generating a sequence of states as in [2, 3] is not chosen. Given the image-based approach, it may also be asked why the authors do not focus on upsampling image datasets from the start, e.g. from [4].
- **(Incomplete experimental description)** Unclear what experimental setup is used in Figure 2. Is each figure the average of 4 different D4RL datasets? No explanation for what environments or datasets are used in Figure 5.
- **(Unclear description of sampling scheme)** There is an extremely vague description of what the reward or TD-error based pickup strategy means in Appendix A.1.1.

Minor
- The description of the state diffusion model in Appendix A.2 is copied nearly verbatim from Appendix B.2 of [1]. The authors should reword this to avoid plagiarism and cite this appropriately.
