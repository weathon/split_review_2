- Scores: 5, 5, 5, 5

## Abstract
Can transformers generalize efficiently on problems that require dealing with examples with different levels of difficulty? 
We introduce a new task tailored to assess generalization over different complexities and present results that indicate that standard transformers face challenges in solving these tasks.
These tasks are variations of pointer value retrieval previously introduced by \citet{DBLP:journals/corr/abs-2107-12580}. 
We investigate how the use of a mechanism for adaptive and modular computation in transformers facilitates the learning of tasks that demand generalization over the number of sequential computation steps (i.e., the depth of the computation graph).
Based on our observations, we propose a transformer-based architecture called Hyper-UT, which combines dynamic function generation from hyper networks with adaptive depth from Universal Transformers. This model demonstrates higher accuracy and a fairer allocation of computational resources when generalizing to higher numbers of computation steps. We conclude that mechanisms for adaptive depth and modularity complement each other in improving efficient generalization concerning example complexity.
Additionally, to emphasize the broad applicability of our findings, we illustrate that in a standard image recognition task, Hyper-UT's performance matches that of a ViT model but with considerably reduced computational demands (achieving over 70\% average savings by effectively using fewer layers).

### Summary
This paper focuses on the generalization performance of Transformers across various levels of task complexity. The paper introduces a new synthetic task, C-PVR (conditional point-value retrieval) to evaluate this generalization capability. In C-PVR, the model is asked to find a value at a specific position indicated by a pointer. In contrast to the PVR task (Zhang et al., 2021), C-PVR requires the model to navigate through multiple pointers until it reaches the desired position. The authors define the task's complexity in C-PVR by quantifying the number of hops to find the target value. Based on this task, the authors observe that modularity and adaptivity across tasks of varying complexity are significant to achieve better generalization. To address this, they propose Hyper-UT, a model equipped with Hyper-Modules that contains both modularity and adaptivity.
In the experiments, the authors demonstrate that Hyper-UT exhibits better generalization performance and efficiency when compared to conventional Transformers. Additionally, it performs competitively on ImageNet-1k, a well-known System-1 task. Furthermore, they analyze the generalization performance of pre-trained language models like T5 on C-PVR and observe that the scratch-pad can enhance the chain-of-thought ability of these models.

### Strengths
* They introduced a novel task that can evaluate the generalization capacity of Transformers across different complexity.
* They demonstrated that the generalization capacity of Transformers across task complexity can be improved through modularity and adaptivity.
* They compared and analyzed various models to confirm the importance of modularity and adaptivity in improving generalization capacity.
* The paper is well-written and easy to understand.

### Weaknesses
 * In Section 4.2, a comparison with the T5 model trained from scratch is absent. To explore the influence of pre-training with language modeling on the generalization capacity, it is essential to include a comparison between the pre-trained T5 model and a T5 model trained from scratch specifically for the C-PVR task. This comparison will provide valuable insights into the impact of pre-training on the generalization.
* Comparing models with and without the scratch-pad in Figure 5 is challenging. It would be more helpful to combine Figure 5 (a) with Figure 5 (b), and Figure 5 (c) with Figure 5 (d).
* Ablation studies on the Hyper-Module are missing. To gain a better understanding of the effects of modularity and adaptivity, it would be beneficial to include an ablation study on the size of the weight embedding pool.

### Questions
* What do the notations "32x3" and "128x2" mean in Table 2 and Table 3 in the appendix?
* Is Hyper-UT also parameter-efficient compared to other methods?
* Is it possible to apply multi-head attention to the attention-based router? How it will affect the generalization capacity compared to the single-head one?

### Confidence

### Summary
This paper proposes a new hypernetwork-structured parameterization for transformers, which focuses on adaptive and dynamic computation. In showcase its advantages, the paper considers a new task called conditional pointer value retrieval and demonstrates some improvement on this task and conventional ImageNet classification.

### Strengths
- The paper is well structured and clearly presented in general. It is easy to follow.

- The dynamic nature of the proposed Hyper-UT is interesting and makes intuitive sense, as for different task/input, different levels of computation complexity is required.

- The experimental results look good and Hyper-UT indeed shows some improvement.

### Weaknesses
 - Hyper-UT is essentially an alternative parameterization of HyperNetworks, despite the dynmaic computation is placed in transformer blocks. I don't find it particularly different from HyperNetworks and its numerous variants, say [1,2,3,4,5].

- The motivation behind Hyper-UT is not clear to me. Although the design of HyperNetwork-like stucture makes the computation dynamics and may save the inference cost, I fail to understand the motivation of the design choices made in Hyper-UT. Why the proposed design will be better than many other HyperTransformers is not clear to me. It seems that it is simply yet another hypernetwork.

- The experiment on C-PVR is not particularly convincing, as the task is a synethic one rather than a real problem. Could the authors find some other tasks that are more representative and yet realistic?

### Summary
The paper proposes Hyper-UT which is a Transformer architecture that can perform adaptive computation and dynamically generate weights. The goal is to have Transformers that can generalize to higher number of computation steps and effectively allocate different amounts of computation depending on input complexity. The paper also introduces C-PVR task to measure the multi-step generalization of various Transformer models and found that existing Transformers perform worse than Hyper-UT. Hyper-UT also demonstrates strong accuracy and efficiency on ImageNet tasks, compared to ViT and U-ViT.

### Strengths
- Good analysis on the weaknesses of existing Transformers using the proposed multi-step reasoning task C-PVR.
- Intriguing finding that combining adaptive computation and modularity can have strong complementary effects.
- Experimental results are very promising, especially the HyperU-ViT results on ImageNet datasets. HyperU-ViT matches or outperforms traditional ViT using a significantly small fraction of FLOPS that ViT requires.

### Weaknesses
 - The individual components like ACT and Hyper-Module are not new inventions. They have been introduced in existing papers. This paper merely uses the two within Transformer in a relatively simple manner.
- The details on how and where ACT is being used in Hyper-UT/HyperU-ViT is lacking. It is also similar for Hyper-Module. While there's diagram that shows the attention-based router, it is unclear how attention-based router is formulated (i.e., there's no equation).
- There's no comprehensive ablation study on the different components.

### Questions
Can this be applied to NLP Transformers (e.g., LLMs)? What's the reason of using ViT/image classification as the testbed?

### Summary
This paper proposes a task to probe the capability of models to generalize across reasoning steps and the authors design a transformer-based architecture that combines dynamic function generation from hypernetworks with adaptive depth from universal transformers. Extensive experiments show the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

### Strengths
Exploring the general efficiency of transformers on problems that require dealing with examples with different levels of difficulty seems novel.

### Weaknesses
1. The task definition is unclear. Specifically, it is not well-defined how the complexity of the reasoning steps is controlled or measured. The paper mentions generalization across reasoning steps, but it is not clear what constitutes a 'step' and how the model is expected to handle varying numbers of steps during training and evaluation. The lack of a formal definition makes it difficult to assess the novelty and significance of the proposed approach.
2. The proposed method seems a combination of transformers and hyper-modules (Ha et al., 2017). The paper does not provide sufficient detail on how the dynamic function generation from hypernetworks interacts with the adaptive depth mechanism of universal transformers. It is unclear how the hypernetwork generates functions, what the input and output spaces of these functions are, and how they are integrated into the transformer architecture. The novelty of this combination is not well-established.
3. In the experiment, the authors do not compare the state-of-art methods. The paper only compares against a vanilla transformer, which is not a strong baseline for this type of problem. There are various methods that incorporate adaptive computation and modularity, and the paper should demonstrate how the proposed approach compares against these existing techniques.
