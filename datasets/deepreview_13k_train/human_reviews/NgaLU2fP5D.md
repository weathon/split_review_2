## Abstract
Intelligent tutoring systems optimize the selection and timing of learning materials to enhance understanding and long-term retention. 
This requires estimates of both the learner's progress (``knowledge tracing''; KT), and the prerequisite structure of the learning domain (``knowledge mapping''). 
While recent deep learning models achieve high KT accuracy, they do so at the expense of the interpretability of psychologically-inspired models.
In this work, we present a solution to this trade-off. 
PSI-KT is a hierarchical generative approach that explicitly models how both individual cognitive traits and the prerequisite structure of knowledge influence learning dynamics, thus achieving interpretability by design. %
Moreover, by using scalable Bayesian inference, PSI-KT targets the real-world need for efficient personalization even with a growing body of learners and learning histories. %
Evaluated on three datasets from online learning platforms, PSI-KT achieves superior multi-step \textbf{p}redictive accuracy and \textbf{s}calable inference in continual-learning settings, all while providing \textbf{i}nterpretable representations of learner-specific traits and the prerequisite structure of knowledge that causally supports learning. 
In sum, predictive, scalable and interpretable knowledge tracing with solid knowledge mapping lays a key foundation for effective personalized learning to make education accessible to a broad, global audience.%

### Summary
The paper presents PSI-KT, a novel knowledge-tracing model that combines individual learning dynamics with structural influences from prerequisite relationships. PSI-KT uses Bayesian inference to model learner-specific cognitive traits and shared prerequisite graphs. Evaluated on real educational datasets, PSI-KT achieves superior predictive accuracy and scalability while also providing interpretable representations of learners and knowledge structure. The model helps advance personalized intelligent tutoring systems by combining insights from cognitive science and machine learning. PSI-KT demonstrates how explicitly modeling psychological principles within AI systems can enhance performance and interpretability.

### Strengths
* The model is designed based on psychological principles and evaluated on multiple datasets. The experiments demonstrate predictive accuracy, scalability, and interpretability. The paper is technically strong in its probabilistic modeling and inference methodology.
* The paper is well-written and provides intuitive explanations of the model components. The background gives a clear overview of knowledge tracing and related work.
*The model advances knowledge tracing for intelligent tutoring systems by enhancing predictive accuracy, scalability, and interpretability. The interpretable representations of learners and knowledge structure provide an important basis for personalized education. The integration of cognitive science and AI is significant for developing systems that leverage psychological insights.

### Weaknesses
 * The evaluations focus on three specific educational datasets. Testing on a more diverse range of datasets, including those with different characteristics (e.g., varying levels of noise, different subject matter, or different temporal granularities) could better reveal the model's capabilities and limitations. The authors could discuss what other domains or data characteristics pose challenges, such as datasets with less explicit prerequisite structures or those with more complex interaction patterns between learners and the system. For example, how would the model perform on datasets where the prerequisite relationships are not strictly hierarchical or where the learning process is more exploratory?
* Long-term retention modeling could be enhanced. The current exponential decay, while mathematically convenient, may be too simplistic to capture the complexities of human memory. Exploring more complex forgetting functions, such as power-law decay or models incorporating consolidation and interference effects based on memory research literature, could improve long-term predictions. The model should also consider how individual differences in memory capacity and learning styles might influence long-term retention.
* While superior overall, some accuracy metrics are comparable to certain baselines, particularly on specific datasets or for certain types of predictions. Further ablation studies, beyond simply removing entire components, could provide more granular insight into which specific aspects of each model component (e.g., specific parameters or functional forms) contribute most to the observed accuracy gains. For example, it would be useful to see the impact of varying the complexity of the prerequisite graph or the temporal dynamics of the learner traits.

### Questions
* Could you provide insights into the dataset limitations and discuss potential challenges in applying the model to other educational domains or datasets?
* Have you considered exploring more complex forgetting functions based on memory research literature to improve long-term predictions?
* Could you perform ablation studies to dissect the contributions of different model components to predictive accuracy, providing insights into the model's strengths?

### Summary
This paper proposes a probabilistic state-space generative approach named PSI-KT by explicitly modeling individual cognitive traits and shared knowledge graph of prerequisite relationships to achieve predictive, scalable and interpretable knowledge tracing, inspired by cognitive science and pedagogical psychology. The author conducts extensive experiments on three datasets to demonstrate that PSI-KT can achieve superior predictive accuracy, scalable inference in continual-learning settings, and interpretability of learners’ cognitive traits and prerequisite graphs. The paper’s contributions are as follows:

1.The paper proposes a novel hierarchical probabilistic state-space model for knowledge tracing by introducing individual cognitive traits and prerequisite shared knowledge graph.

2.Unlike recent discriminative KT models that utilize cross-entropy loss, PKI-KT distinguishes itself by introducing a psychologically-inspired probabilistic generative model, which leverages approximate Bayesian inference and variational continual learning techniques for model optimization.

3.Extensive experiments demonstrate that PKI-KT achieves impressive results in multi-step predictive accuracy and scalable inference in continual-learning settings. Moreover, novel confirmatory experiments further validate the specificity, consistency, disentanglement, and operational interpretability of individual cognitive traits, as well as the reliability of the inferred prerequisite graph.

### Strengths
1.Good textual expression, mathematical notation, and formula derivations. The paper provides a clear description of motivation, problem definition, and experimental setup, along with professionally presented mathematical expressions.

2.The motivation is both novel and reasonable. PSI-KT takes into account students’ individual cognitive traits and the prerequisite knowledge graphs while modeling students' knowledge states.

3.The proposed method is intriguing. PSI-KT applies a Probabilistic State-Space Model to model students' knowledge states in KT. It introduces a three-level hierarchical structure, utilizes approximate Bayesian inference for generating students' knowledge states and cognitive traits, and optimizes model parameters using the Evidence Lower Bound (ELBO) instead of the common cross-entropy used in recent discriminative KT models.

4.The paper includes extensive confirmatory experiments with detailed and favorable results. In addition to conducting rich experiments on predicting student performance in both within-learner and between learner settings, the authors also carries out numerous analytical validation experiments concerning the representation of cognitive traits and the inferred knowledge prerequisite relationships, all of which have yielded positive outcomes.

### Weaknesses
1.The cognitive traits in the paper lack somewhat interpretability. While the authors have conducted extensive validation experiments on the representation of cognitive traits, considering that the paper introduces cognitive traits from the perspectives of cognitive science and psychology, it is advisable to explicitly state in the text which specific cognitive psychology traits the four dimensions of cognitive traits represent. This would help readers better understand the meaning and significance of these traits. Specifically, the paper should clarify how each dimension relates to established cognitive models or constructs, such as working memory capacity, attention span, or learning styles. Without this explicit mapping, the interpretation of these traits remains somewhat abstract and difficult to relate to existing psychological literature.

2.Experiments are somewhat insufficient. Although the authors have conducted an extensive array of analytical and validation experiments, there is a notable absence of ablation study to demonstrate the effectiveness of the two proposed motivations in the paper, namely cognitive traits and the prerequisite relationship graph, on PSI-KT. Furthermore, given the mention of the use of the prerequisite graph in the paper, it seems somewhat inadequate not to include some explicit baseline models that utilize knowledge concept graphs for comparison. Specifically, the paper lacks a rigorous analysis of how much performance gain is attributable to each of the proposed components. Without ablating the cognitive traits or the prerequisite graph, it is hard to assess the true contribution of each component. Furthermore, comparing against models that explicitly use knowledge graphs, such as GKT [1] or SKT [2], is important to benchmark the performance of the proposed method against state-of-the-art techniques that utilize similar structural information.

### Questions
1.Could the authors provide some explanations about the four dimensions of cognitive traits and how they represent specific characteristics of students? It would be particularly helpful if these dimensions can be correlated with concepts from cognitive science. Additionally, I'm interested in an experimental analysis of the impact of the other two dimensions.

2.Have the authors considered supplementing with essential ablation study and adding baseline models that explicitly take into account the knowledge graph structure, such as GKT[1] or SKT[2], the latter of which also considers prerequisite relationship between concepts?

### Summary
This paper introduces PSI-KT, a generative knowledge tracing method that places emphasis on predictive accuracy, scalable inference, and interpretability. PSI-KT models both the cognitive processes of students and the underlying knowledge prerequisite structure. Extensive experimental results clearly showcase the method's superiority over various baselines from multiple angles.

### Strengths
1. The proposed method is designed carefully and comprehensive, focusing on mutiple perspectives of the knowledge tracing task.
2. The motivation is meaningful that this paper focus on the pain point about interpretability of the knowledge tracing field.
3. The paper is well-structured.

### Weaknesses
1. The method's description is not sufficiently clear. As indicated in the appendix, PSI-KT also employs neural networks to generate cognitive parameters. However, the main body of the paper only briefly touches upon this aspect, potentially leading to the misconception that PSI-KT is not a deep learning approach. The lack of detail regarding the architecture and training process of this neural network component makes it difficult to fully assess the method's complexity and potential limitations. Specifically, the paper should clarify the input features, the number of layers, the activation functions, and the optimization algorithm used for the inference network. 
2. The experimental setup lacks persuasiveness. As demonstrated in Table 1, two datasets contain over 10,000 learners, yet the authors chose to use only 100-1,000 learners as training data. Conducting experiments with a small dataset may unfairly disadvantage deep learning baselines, which can effectively leverage the abundance of available data. The reasoning provided, "to simulate real-world data constraints in education," may not hold in the context of the vast amount of student learning data generated today. This choice limits the generalizability of the findings and raises concerns about the fairness of comparisons with methods designed for larger datasets. The paper should include experiments with the full dataset to properly evaluate the performance of the proposed method and baselines under more realistic conditions.
3. The introduction of interpretable KT methods is not comprehensive. For instance, recent approaches like IKT, ICKT, and QIKT [1, 2, 3] incorporate interpretable psychological and cognitive modules into their methods. These relevant methods are not referenced in this paper, let alone included as baselines in the experiments. The absence of these important baselines makes it difficult to position the proposed method within the broader landscape of interpretable knowledge tracing research. The paper needs to provide a more thorough discussion of existing interpretable KT methods and include comparisons to the most relevant approaches.
4. The assessment of the model's interpretability is not entirely convincing. The limited dimensionality of hidden learner representations in deep learning methods (e.g., DKT, AKT) at just 16 may constrain the neural networks' capabilities. Furthermore, there is no supporting evidence indicating that the learner representations of PSI-KT and these deep learning baselines capture the same underlying student features, making direct comparisons less rational. The paper should provide a more rigorous analysis of the learned representations and justify the use of mutual information as a measure of interpretability. It is unclear whether the mutual information is capturing the same underlying factors for all models.
5. Perhaps conducting case studies of PSI-KT could offer a more intuitive understanding of its interpretability, such as visualizing trends in students' knowledge mastery, as shown in Figure 1(a). The paper would benefit from illustrative examples that demonstrate the model's ability to capture meaningful patterns in student learning trajectories. Visualizations of individual student's knowledge states over time, along with explanations of how these states are influenced by specific interactions, would greatly enhance the paper's claims about interpretability.

### Questions
1. Why did the authors choose to experiment with only a limited portion of the datasets? The explanation provided, "to simulate real-world data constraints in education," may benefit from additional clarification.
2. Could the authors consider using more recent interpretable deep learning methods like QIKT as their baseline comparisons? Doing so could enhance the credibility of the study.
3. Is there a specific reason why the authors did not provide case studies to visually demonstrate the model's interpretability, as has been done in previous KT research?
4. Could the authors elaborate on the detailed rationale behind using mutual information between PSI-KT's learned parameters and the hidden vectors of baselines to measure interpretability? Further explanation would enhance the understanding of the experiments.

### Summary
This paper constructs a scientifically sound model for the knowledge tracing problem that takes into account past performance, prerequsite knowledge graphs, and individual learner traits. They compare this to a number of other methods for predicting learner performance using public data and exceed the baseline.

### Strengths
Predictive Accuracy was reasonable and well evaluated. The data used in the experiments was relevant and allowed reasonable evaluation. The graphs and tables produced were helpful in following the results. 

In terms of the 4 primary dimensions used for an ICLR Review

- Originality: Combining knowledge tracing and knowledge mapping into one method is a nice combination of ideas into one framework. 

- Quality: Quality was good, useful data of a reasonable size with a good baseline of comparison to other methods. In terms of basic accuracy this was well presented.

- Clarity: The presentation overall left a lot to be desired in this paper but the graphs and tables were 

- Significance: The primary significance of these results is in the interpretability of the results.

### Weaknesses
Most of the focus of this paper was on the accuracy. Interpretability and scalability were not well evaluated and much of that was in the form of "correct by construction".

The prerequisite graph was interesting, although the correctness of the graph was not well quantified.

And although I thought the accuracy beat the provided baseline and had sufficient data to support that, I do not think the results are good, only that they are better than the baseline. For a binary problem, getting accuracy of 55-80 is not a strong result.

### Questions
I would also like to more details on the datasets, particularly from the perspective of diversity. Claims about educational effectiveness and knowledge graphs that do no reflect a sufficient cross section are suspect at best and can be actively harmful.
