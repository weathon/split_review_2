## Abstract
\vspace{-6pt}
Safe offline reinforcement learning is a promising way to bypass risky online interactions towards safe policy learning. Most existing methods only enforce soft constraints, \textit{i.e.,} constraining safety violations in expectation below thresholds predetermined. This can lead to potentially unsafe outcomes, thus unacceptable in safety-critical scenarios.
An alternative is to enforce the hard constraint of zero violation. However, this can be challenging in offline setting, as it needs to strike the right balance among three highly intricate and correlated aspects: safety constraint satisfaction, reward maximization, and behavior regularization imposed by offline datasets.
Interestingly, we discover that via reachability analysis of safe-control theory, the hard safety constraint can be equivalently translated to identifying the largest feasible region given the offline dataset. This seamlessly converts the original trilogy problem to a feasibility-dependent objective, \textit{i.e.}, maximizing reward value within the feasible region while minimizing safety risks in the infeasible region. Inspired by these, we propose \textit{FISOR} (\textit{FeasIbility-guided Safe Offline RL}), which allows safety constraint adherence, reward maximization, and offline policy learning to be realized via three decoupled processes, while offering strong safety performance and stability. In FISOR, the optimal policy for the translated optimization problem can be derived in a special form of weighted behavior cloning, which can be effectively extracted with a guided diffusion model thanks to its expressiveness. Moreover, we propose a novel energy-guided sampling method that does not require training a complicated time-dependent classifier to simplify the training.
We compare FISOR against baselines on \textit{DSRL} benchmark for safe offline RL. Evaluation results show that FISOR is the only method that can guarantee safety satisfaction in all tasks, while achieving top returns in most tasks. Project website: \url{https://zhengyinan-air.io/FISOR/}.

### Confidence
2: You are willing to defend your assessment, but it is quite likely that you did not understand the central parts of the submission or that you are unfamiliar with some pieces of related work. Math/other details were not carefully checked.

### Summary
The paper introduces a method for safe offline policy learning with hard constraints, called FISOR. The method works through three dedicated learning objects that separate the feasible and infeasible region plus satisfaction of safety constraints. Policy learning is performed via a guided diffusion model and experiments show that FISOR is both effective int terms of high rewards and safety.

### Strengths
Safety in RL is an important and relevant topic and this paper is a nice addition to the existing body of work. The approach to introduce safety via the three learning objectives is well motivated and substantially explained (although I did not follow all details). The usage of the diffusion model for policy learning is interesting. 

Extensive experiments including ablation studies are performed on well-known environments.
While FISOR does not achieve the highest rewards in these environments, it consistently is safe and has lower cost than the baseline methods, except for CPQ in the metadrive environment.

### Weaknesses
The presentation of the results in Table 1 is a bit confusing. What is the criterion for an agent to be safe? Is it formulated as a threshold on the cost or do you count actual safety violations and only indicate those?

I would like a more thorough discussions of limitations of the method. In the conclusion the limited availability of offline RL data is mentioned, but it is (if I didn't miss something) not well motivated or shown how this limitation affects the method or if it is more a general concern.
What are other limitations? Are there safety constraints that cannot be handled or that are substantially more difficult?

The figures are a bit blurry on my reader, maybe they can be converted to a different format.

### Summary
Safe offline reinforcement learning aims to develop safe policies without risky online interactions, but most existing methods risk potential safety violations by only enforcing soft constraints. This work presents a new approach, FISOR (FeasIbility-guided Safe Offline RL), utilizing reachability analysis from safe-control theory to enforce hard safety constraints, by maximizing rewards within a feasible region determined by the offline dataset and minimizing risks elsewhere. FISOR decouples the process into safety adherence and reward maximization. The result outperforms baselines in safety satisfaction and return performance in the DSRL benchmark for safe offline RL.

### Strengths
- The idea of including reachability analysis into the learning for safety satification is interesting.
- The paper is well-written.

### Weaknesses
 - There seems to be an inconsistency between the goal and the actual approach. The paper aims for 100% guarantee in safety. However, the approach still need to estimate the feasible areas and then to yield the value function threshold. There could be estimation error and this estimation requires very thorough dataset provided, which may not be practical in reality.
- The learnt infeasible states may be false negative. How do you assure that the infeasible states are really unsolvable instead of you able not able to solve it?

### Questions
- How do you guarantee the gap between the ground-truth infeasible regions and the learnt infeasible regions?
- How do you measure the normalized cost in the evaluation? Why is it not zero for cases that are 100% safe?

### Summary
This paper studies safe offline reinforcement learning by introducing feasibility into the RL problem for safety-critical systems. The authors convert the safe offline RL problem into a feasibility-dependent optimization problem, i.e., when feasible, maximize reward, when infeasible reduce the safety violation as much as possible.

### Strengths
1. The paper is novel and the idea is interesting. It scales the HJ reachability to the high-dimensional RL problem and leverages it to offline compute feasible regions, which helps build feasibility-dependent RL problems to encode hard constraints. 
2. The paper is well-motivated, well-organized, and in general easy to follow. 
3. The paper is sound, at least from the writing logic, given the fact I didn't check the math details in the appendix. 
4. The experiments are comprehensive and the results are quite significant compared to the existing work.

### Weaknesses
1. The authors may need to add more references to cover "safe RL with hard constraints" to better motivate this work and claim the differences. A quick search gives me several recent papers, such as
a. Wang, Yixuan, et al. "Enforcing hard constraints with soft barriers: Safe reinforcement learning in unknown stochastic environments." International Conference on Machine Learning. PMLR, 2023.
And those in 
b. Zhao, Weiye, et al. "State-wise safe reinforcement learning: A survey." arXiv preprint arXiv:2302.03122 (2023).

2. It seems that the baselines in the experiments all consider soft safety constraints. The reviewer would like to see the comparison with baselines belonging to safe offline RL with hard constraints if there is such work.

### Questions
1. because this work uses learning to learn feasible regions by HJ reachability, how "accurate" the learned regions are? How does the learning region error affect the optimization problem and safety violations?

### Summary
This paper proposes an algorithm for safe offline RL problems. Unlike most of the existing studies that deals with expected form of safety constraints, this paper deals with hard safety constraint (i.e., probability-1 constraints). The authors discover that the hard safety constraint can be equivalently translated to identifying the largest feasible region given the offline dataset, which leads to a feasibility-dependent objective which can be further solved using three simple decoupled learning objectives. The authors compare their proposed algorithm called FISOR against baselines on DSRL benchmark for safe offline RL.

### Strengths
- This paper is well-written and easy to follow. The problem settings are motivated and I think it is an important direction for safe RL research.
- The proposed method is solid and looks sound to me.
- The empirical evaluation are conducted in various benchmark tasks.

### Weaknesses
### Related Work

Hard constraints in safe RL have been studied in online RL settings. There are several important missing references as being represented by:

- Sootla, Aivar, et al. "Sauté rl: Almost surely safe reinforcement learning using state augmentation." International Conference on Machine Learning. PMLR, 2022.
- Wang, Yixuan, et al. "Enforcing hard constraints with soft barriers: Safe reinforcement learning in unknown stochastic environments." International Conference on Machine Learning. PMLR, 2023.
- Wachi, Akifumi, and Yanan Sui. "Safe reinforcement learning in constrained Markov decision processes." International Conference on Machine Learning. PMLR, 2020.

I agree with the authors that there is litte literature on safe **offline** RL and know that there is Table 4 in the Appendix. However, there are existing studies that are directly related to this paper. For example, Sootla et al. (2022) can be easily extended to the offline RL settings since all we have to do is to augment the state and provide a large penalty for violating the hard safety constraint.

### Experiments
While I would like to thank the authors for conducing good experiments, I am not fully convinced by the experimental results. First, all the baselines are based on the soft safety constraint and it seems unfair to simply compare their safety performances (Note that I do not say that such baseline methods should not be compared given there is few exising paper with the same problem settings). I personally consider that, if safe online RL algorithm can be extended to offline settings, such algorithms should be additionally included as a baseline. Second, I want the authors to discuss the experimental results on the reward performance. I understand sinec FISOR is enforced a hard constraint, it is natural that reward performance is deteriorated. However, under the condition that most of the baseline methods do not satisfy the safety constraint (because safety requirements are different by nature), I feel that it is rather arbitrary to compare the reward peformance **within** safe agents. Though the authors say that " FISOR is the only method that can
guarantee safety satisfaction in all tasks, while achieving top returns in most tasks", I personally feel that this claim is overstated. I think the experimental results are interesting; hence, I would like the authors to discuss more on the **Main Results** paragraph for future readers (e.g., why CPQ satisfy the safety constraints, why FISOR does not perform well in Safety Gym tasks, etc.)

### Questions
[Q1] I consider that there are several safe online RL algorithms with hard constraints. And some of them can be easily extended to offline RL settings. Could you give me some comments about my thoughts?

[Q2] In general, the performance of an offline RL algorithm largely depends on the data coverage of the offline dataset. Could you explain the (empirical) relationship of the performance if FISOR and the data coverage? Is FISOR more efficient in terms of the data coverage compared to other baselines?

[Q3] Why only CPQ satisfies the safety constraints within the baseline methods?
