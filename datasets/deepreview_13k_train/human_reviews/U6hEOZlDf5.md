# 3D-Aware Hypothesis & Verification for Generalizable Relative Object Pose Estimation

- Decision: Accept
- Scores: 6, 6, 6, 6

## Abstract
Prior methods that tackle the problem of generalizable object pose estimation highly rely on having dense views of the unseen object. By contrast, we address the scenario where only a single reference view of the object is available. Our goal then is to estimate the relative object pose between this reference view and a query image that depicts the object in a different pose. In this scenario, robust generalization is imperative due to the presence of unseen objects during testing and the large-scale object pose variation between the reference and the query. To this end, we present a new hypothesis-and-verification framework, in which we generate and evaluate multiple pose hypotheses, ultimately selecting the most reliable one as the relative object pose. To measure reliability, we introduce a 3D-aware verification that explicitly applies 3D transformations to the 3D object representations learned from the two input images. Our comprehensive experiments on the Objaverse, LINEMOD, and CO3D datasets evidence the superior accuracy of our approach in relative pose estimation and its robustness in large-scale pose variations, when dealing with unseen objects.

### Summary
The paper addresses the problem of estimating the pose of an object observed in a query image relative to a reference image. A novel method is presented for estimating the relative 3D orientation of the object. Multiple orientation hypotheses are sampled and scored using the proposed verification strategy. The verification strategy relies on extracting 3D feature volumes from the query and reference image, and measuring similarity between the 3D volume of the query with the 3D volume of the reference transformed with the 3D orientation of the hypothesis. The comparison of the 3D volumes is done using a novel feature aggregation strategy to gain robustness with respect to the background. The paper also introduces a new benchmark for this task, relying on synthetic images of objaverse objects, and real images of the LINEMOD dataset.

### Strengths
S1. The paper is well easy written and easy to understand.

S2. The method can operate from RGB images, and only requires a single reference image.

S3. The technical contributions are sound and demonstrated to be effective in an ablation study (Table 4 of the main paper). In particular, the attention layers to extract 3D features capturing information from both query and reference images; and the aggregation mechanism to gain robustness with respect to the background are well motivated. 

S4. The method combines several interesting design choices which are demonstrated to lead to higher relative rotation estimation accuracy compared to several baselines (Table 1). However it is not clear if the comparison with RelPose and RelPose++ is fair (see weakness W3).

### Weaknesses
W1. The object pose estimation setup addressed in this paper should be better motivated. If a CAD model of the object is available, multiple reference images can be rendered or other methods applied directly, e.g. [A,B,C,D,E,F]. In this paper, availability of a CAD model of the object is not assumed, but obtaining the pose of the object with respect to the camera in the query image would still require the pose of the object to be known in the reference image. It is not clear how the reference pose would be obtained in practice without assuming the CAD model is known. In addition, the method presented and evaluated in this paper does not estimates the absolute or relative 3D translation of the object between the query and reference images. Overall, the paper would be more convincing if practical applications of the presented approach were discussed. The single reference image setting is not well justified, as in practical scenarios, multiple views or a 3D model are often available, making the problem setting somewhat artificial. The paper would benefit from a more thorough discussion of the scenarios where this approach would be uniquely beneficial compared to existing methods that leverage multiple views or CAD models.

W2. The runtime of the approach is not mentionned. 50000 hypotheses are evaluated during testing, what is the tradeoff between accuracy and runtime ? The paper lacks a detailed analysis of the computational cost associated with evaluating 50,000 hypotheses. The practical implications of this computational overhead, especially in real-time applications, are not discussed. A comparison of the runtime with other methods would be beneficial to understand the efficiency of the proposed approach.

W3. Is it not clear if the RelPose, RelPose++ and the presented approach were all trained using the same images for the comparison on CO3D presented in Table 1. The supplementary material mentions that the approach is trained using objects from the objaverse dataset. Is it also the case for the experiments in Table 1 ? 

Minor details:
- Some papers have incorrect citations, e.g. Gen6D is an ECCV paper, DOPE is a CoRL paper.

### Questions
The method presented in this paper is well designed and demonstrated to be effective for estimating the relative 3D orientation of an object observed in two different images. I however currently have questions regarding the quantitative comparison with state-of-the-art (W3), and concerns regarding the practical applications of such approach (W1) and it’s runtime (W2). I will gladly increase my rating if these concerns can be addressed.

### Summary
The paper proposes an object pose estimator that can estimate relative pose with a single reference view.
To tackle the large viewpoint change scenarios, they propose a hypothesis-and-verification framework for robust pose estimation.
The image features and 3D feature volumes are extracted for each image first.
Then the poses are sampled and used to warp 3D feature volumes to the reference view, where the verification scores are regressed by transformer architecture. Pose is estimated by selecting the hypothesis with the largest similarity score.

### Strengths
1) The proposed hypothesis-and-verification framework seems to be effective especially for large viewpoint change scenarios, compared with matching-based methods.
2) The experiments and ablation studies are thorough.
3) The overall writing is clear and easy to follow.

### Weaknesses
1) The generalizability across datasets. The proposed method is generalizable and can handle unseen objects. I'm curious about the generalizability across datasets. For example, the proposed method is trained on the CO3D dataset, but how about the generalizability of the LINEMOD dataset? I think the generalizability across datasets is important for the proposed method, especially for real-world applications.

2) Running time comparisons. The paper needs to sample M=50000 poses for verification at test time. I'm concerned about the efficiency of estimating a single pose, even if the verifications are parallelized. I think the running time comparisons with other methods are necessary.

### Summary
This paper addresses the problem of relative pose estimation for unseen objects. The authors assume that only one object image as the reference is available and they aim to estimate the relative object pose between the reference and a query image. To this end, the authors propose a hypothesis-and-verification paradigm by introducing a 3D-aware verification. In particular, 3D transformation is explicitly coupled with a learnable 3D object representation. Experiments were performed on Objaverse, LINEMOD, and CO3D datasets, taking both synthetic and real data with diverse object poses into account.

### Strengths
Object pose estimation is a central task for 3D computer vision. Generalizable object relative pose estimation allows dealing with unseen object and is important to apply the technology to real world applications. This paper addresses this task along this direction and specifically focus on the cases that only one reference image is available. This case is difficult, especially when the object image appearance is view-dependent and the query and reference images have very different viewpoints. Despite of the difficulties, the proposed methods shows significant performance improvement than SOTA baselines on several public datasets including Objaverse, LINEMOD, and CO3D. The paper is well organized.

### Weaknesses
Weakness of the paper: 

(1) Although the task setting chosen by the paper is challenging for SOTA methods, the motivation of this task setting is not clearly explained. Using only one reference image can pose great difficulty for the pose estimation task. An extreme example is that the reference image is taken from frontal viewpoint and a query image is taken from rear viewpoint, which may share no common features to match at all. Meanwhile, with any modern camera device, one can actually easily capture multiple images as use them as reference. In what scenarios, and why using only one reference image is critical is not mentioned in the paper.

(2) An important component of the method is the 3D reasoning model that learns the 3D volumes from 2D feature maps of two RGB image inputs. However, this is itself a very challenging research topic about open-set 3D volume representation reconstruction with two RGB inputs. It’s difficult to understand why it is possible to obtain reliable 3D representation for an unseen object from only its two views, which may even present large variations in view angle and lighting. Also, experimental verification for this component is missing. It would be informative to show some visualizations of the intermediate results of this component.

### Questions
Questions for the author:

(1) In what scenarios or applications is using only one reference image necessary for the pose estimation task? Why this is a meaningful problem setting?

(2) How it is possible to obtain reliable 3D volume representation for an unseen object from only its two views, which may even present large variations in view angle and lighting?

(3) Is it possible to show some visualizations of the intermediate results of the 3D reasoning component?

(4) What are the remaining error cases of the model for the defined task? 

(5) What backbone network is used? Does the backbone network selection affect model performance?

(6) What is the computational cost and speed of this method?

### Summary
This paper proposed a 3D latent object representation and 3D-aware hypothesis verification framework for general object relative pose estimation from two 2D images. The latent 3D representation is obtained by lifting the 2D feature map into 3D space and the 3D-aware hypothesis are generated and verified in a RANSAC-like manner. Experiment has been done on public benchmark dataset CO3D, Objaverse and LINEMOD and the proposed method achieved superior performance compared with previous SOTA.

### Strengths
1. The proposed method combined several modules to construct an interesting pipeline for general object relative pose estimation, including 2D-to-3D feature lifting, 6D continous rotation representation hypotheses sampling, RANSAC-style hypothsis verification. 
2. The achieved performance improvement over RelPos++ is impressive
3. Pose estimation robustness in case of background clutter and object motion are handled with modules of 3D masking, feature aggregation, etc.

### Weaknesses
1. The paper claims that the method can be used for unseen object relative pose estimation, but it actually may rely on object detection to get relevant object area for pose estimation, and there is no reliable unseen object detector available
2. The presentation is not clear and sometimes confusing, in 4.5 ablation study section, the method of 'RelPose*' should be explicitly explained, and it seems that the attention module, mask module and aggregation module donot result in significant performance improvement, it would be clearer if we start from baseline and add the proposed modules step by step to show their effectiveness
3. There are some typos, Sec.3.1, 'as illustrated in Fig.3' -> 'as illustrated in Fig.2'

### Questions
1. The number of hypothesis during training and testing is huge, 9000 for training and 50000 for testing, how about the computational cost? why they are different?
