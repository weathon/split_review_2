# ReForm-Eval: Evaluating Large Vision Language Models via Unified Re-Formulation of Task-Oriented Benchmarks

- Decision: Reject
- Scores: 3, 5, 6, 6

## Abstract
Recent years have witnessed remarkable progress in the development of large vision-language models (LVLMs). Benefiting from the strong language backbones and efficient cross-modal alignment strategies, LVLMs exhibit surprising capabilities to perceive visual signals and perform visually grounded reasoning. 
However, the capabilities of LVLMs have not been comprehensively and quantitatively evaluated. Most existing multi-modal benchmarks require task-oriented input-output formats, posing great challenges to automatically assess the free-form text output of LVLMs. 
To effectively leverage the annotations available in existing benchmarks and reduce the manual effort required for constructing new benchmarks, we propose to re-formulate existing benchmarks into unified LVLM-compatible formats. Through systematic data collection and reformulation, we present the ReForm-Eval benchmark, offering substantial data for evaluating various capabilities of LVLMs. Based on ReForm-Eval, we conduct extensive experiments, thoroughly analyze the strengths and weaknesses of existing LVLMs, and identify the underlying factors. Our benchmark and evaluation framework will be open-sourced as a cornerstone for advancing the development of LVLMs.

### Summary
This paper claims that the capabilities of LVLMs have not been comprehensively and quantitatively evaluated. Accordingly, it proposes a ReForm-Eval benchmark, which re-formulates existing task-oriented benchmarks into unified LVLM-compatible formats. Based on ReForm-Eval, it conducts extensive experiments, thoroughly analyzes the strengths and weaknesses of existing LVLMs, and try to reveal insights behind LVLMs.

### Strengths
1. ReForm-Eval benchmark re-formulates 61 benchmark datasets based on existing data resources, including visual perception to high-level visual reasoning and dialog. 
2. ReForm-Eval has a large scale.

### Weaknesses
1. ReForm-Eval is not suitable for a fair comparison of capability dimensions among different LVLMs. It is composed of 61 existing datasets. A number of these datasets are widely used in training data for LVLMs, e.g., VQA, VQAv2, GQA, OK-VQA, TextVQA, OCR-VQA, Text caps, Flickr30K, and so on. Different LVLMs will choose different training datasets but only cover some of them. However, ReForm-Eval merges both trained and reserved datasets into ability dimensions, leading to unfair comparison. 
2. This paper tries to reveal insights into model architecture and training datasets. However, since different LVLMs have different model architectures (Vision Encoders, connection modules, LLMs) and training datasets (pretraining and instruction tuning), the summarized insights in this paper are not convincing. 
3. The methods to generate appropriate negative options in visually grounded reasoning and multi-turn dialogue may not be reliable. The information of question and answer may not be sufficient to generate reasonable negative options with ChatGPT.

### Summary
This work introduces a novel benchmark called ReForm-Eval for assessing large vision-language models. The underlying approach of ReForm-Eval involves transforming several publicly available VQA datasets into a multiple-choice format.

### Strengths
1. This work proposes a novel benchmark, namely ReForm-Eval. Reformatting the current VQA dataset into multiple-choice questions partially alleviates a problem in using the current metric in the VQA dataset to evaluate generative VLMs. The problem is the exact matching between the prediction and the reference target, which leads to potential limitations.
2. Some insights are good, such as "FlanT5-based models" performing well on the multiple-choice tasks, which aligns with findings in the NLP domain.

### Weaknesses
1. The very impressive ability lies in the large language models (GPT-4, ChatGPT, Llama, etc.) and the popular vision-language model (CLIP) is their powerful zero-shot learning ability. One important way to evaluate the zero-shot learning of models is to ensure there is no dataset overlap between the evaluating data and the training data, such as the evaluating strategy in CLIP[1]. However, ReForm-Eval includes many datasets that are trained in the evaluated VLM. This might incur two issues: (1) it is unfair to compare models that were trained by datasets evaluated in ReForm-Eval with models that have not been trained on any datasets in ReForm-Eval. (2) Ultimately, ReForm-Eval can only evaluate the "supervised learning" ability instead of the "zero-shot learning."

2. Some insights might not be solid. For example, (1) when discussing which connection module is more suitable for which visual backbone, this work should ensure that other influential factors are the same between compared models, such as training data and language model. Specifically, the authors should control for the language model architecture and training data when comparing different visual backbones and connection modules, as these factors can significantly impact performance. (2) The grouping of high-quality data and without high-quality data might be cherry-picked, as some models (Lynx) in the high-quality group also use "data filtered on rules or CLIP." The criteria for defining 'high-quality' data needs to be more rigorous and consistently applied across all models. (3) The variance in Fig. 4 (c) is so large that it is difficult to conclude that "more instructional data leads to better performance." The observed trend is not statistically significant due to the high variance, making the conclusion unreliable.

3. Using CIDEr to evaluate visual descriptions is not optimal, especially for models that intend not to generate concise descriptions, such as LLaVA, and it benefits models that are tuned by dataset, such as coco-caption, whose ground truth descriptions are in a shorter format. CIDEr, designed for evaluating concise image captions, may not accurately reflect the quality of more verbose and descriptive outputs from models like LLaVA. This discrepancy introduces a bias in the evaluation process.

### Summary
This paper proposes a new strategy to benchmark large vision language models.
It reformulates 61 existing benchmarks into multiple-choice problems or specialized text generation problems,
test existing LVLMs with the ReForm-Eval, and report the accuracy and CIDEr for two types of problems, respectively. 
With ReForm-Eval, the authors benchmarked multiple LVLMs and studied the effect of model backbone, connection module, pre-training data, instruction-tuning data. 
Furthermore, the paper also discussed the effect of in-context sample, the difference between generation and likelihood based evaluation, and the instability during evaluation.

### Strengths
This paper provides a practical approach to unify existing computer vision benchmarks under a unified formulation. It converts 61 existing datasets to multi-choice problems and specialized text generation problems and provides extensive evaluation results.

### Weaknesses
1. Some findings presented in this paper are not original findings. For example, the effect of in-context examples and the instability of existing LVLMs have already been discussed in MMBench. 
2. The core contribution of this work is to propose an approach to convert existing benchmarks to a unified formulation. However, the authors used many pages to present and discuss the evaluation results, rather than delving deeper into the reformulation methodologies. In fact, many aspects can be explored during the reformulation:
    1. In general, one need to use some distractors as the negative options when building multi-choice problems. There exists multiple ways to obtain these distractors (as mentioned in this paper): 1. find the negative classes with the highest confidence; 2. find some semantically related but not synonymous answers; 3. LLM-based hard-negative generation. Besides, another baseline is to randomly pick incorrect class labels as negative options. How can the use of those distractors quantitatively affect the evaluation results?
    2. Fine-grained recognition, which is a substantial component of Fine-grained perception,  is not included in the fine-grained perception tasks.

### Questions
1. For Figure 10, why the proportions of 'A' and 'B' in Ground-truth Option Distribution are not the same? Does that mean there exists questions with only one option?
2. Typo in Page.8 Line 1, MSOCO
3. It would be better if the authors can provide more ablation study for the reformulation process, on factors including: 1. the methods to add the distractors, 2. the number of options. 
4. Reform-Eval is a large dataset contains over 500,000 evaluation instances, when doing the sub-sampling, do the authors do it uniformly or sample evaluation instances from each benchmark with different probability to improves the data balance? Besides, have the authors studied if the shrink of the dataset size will change the evaluation results? Can we use a even smaller subset for evaluation?

### Summary
This paper contributes a new benchmark for evaluating the large vision-language models (LVLMs) comprehensively. The benchmark re-formulates 61 benchmark datasets based on existing data resources and evaluate the models with both black-box and white-box methods. The authors also conduct extensive experiments to analyze the strengths and weaknesses of existing LVLMs.

### Strengths
1. The scale of benchmark is large, including 61 datasets and is 100 times the size of MMBench.
2. The evaluation dimensions are comprehensive, including many perception and cognition sub-tasks.
3. Some insightful conclusions are required from the experiments on proposed benchmark.

### Weaknesses
Limitations in novelty to some extent: the formulation of multiple-choice is widely used in previous work like MMBench [1]; the proposed generation and likelihood evaluation method are also used in previous benchmarks, like VisualGPTScore [2] proposed using likelihood of generating references conditioned on images and prompts to do multiple-choices tasks. 



### Questions
1. Are the formulation of current datasets used in the benchmark modified manually?
2. Should we use generation metric, likelihood metric, or both of them when using the benchmark? 
3. Are there any human validation or other validations to show the superiority over other benchmarks?
