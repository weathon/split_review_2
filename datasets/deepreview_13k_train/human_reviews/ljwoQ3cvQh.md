## Abstract
Conventional wisdom suggests that neural network predictions tend to be unpredictable and overconfident when faced with out-of-distribution (OOD) inputs. Our work reassesses this assumption for neural networks with high-dimensional inputs. Rather than extrapolating in arbitrary ways, we observe that neural network predictions often tend towards a constant value as input data becomes increasingly OOD. Moreover, we find that this value often closely approximates the optimal constant solution (OCS), i.e., the prediction that minimizes the average loss over the training data without observing the input. We present results showing this phenomenon across 8 datasets with different distributional shifts (including CIFAR10-C and ImageNet-R, S), different loss functions (cross entropy, MSE, and Gaussian NLL), and different architectures (CNNs and transformers). Furthermore, we present an explanation for this behavior, which we first validate empirically and then study theoretically in a simplified setting involving deep homogeneous networks with ReLU activations. Finally, we show how one can leverage our insights in practice to enable risk-sensitive decision-making in the presence of OOD inputs.  \blfootnote{Correspondence to: \href{mailto:katiekang@eecs.berkeley.edu}{katiekang@eecs.berkeley

### Summary
The paper proposes the "reversion to OCS" hypothesis: Neural network predictions often tend towards a constant value as input data becomes increasingly OOD; that constant value closely approximates the optimal constant solution (OCS), which is the prediction that minimizes the average loss over the training data without observing the input. This hypothesis is verified by empirical results on a wide range of datasets and architectures with different input modalities and loss functions. Moreover, the paper also provides theoretical results to explain the observed behavior. Specifically, the feature norm of each neural layer can drop easily with OOD inputs, which shows why the model's output converges to the OCS when the input becomes more OOD. Finally, the authors leverage this insight to enable risk-sensitive decision-making.

### Strengths
* Finding of the paper is interesting. 

* Paper writing is careful and clear. 

* The paper includes detailed evidence, both empirically and theoretically, for their claims.

### Weaknesses
There is no significant weakness.

### Questions
1. Do behaviors of $W_i \phi_I(x)$ mentioned in Section 4.1 remain on realistic datasets, such as ImageNet and Amazon? 

2. From the insight of the paper, can we say that methods that try to improve models’ performances on OOD inputs are actually moving the models’ outputs away from the OCS?

### Summary
The paper aims to show that, contrary to the (somewhat) common belief, OOD inputs mostly lead to predictions closer to the average of training labels (more specifically, the optimal constant solution, OCS, minimizing the training loss without the inputs), as opposed to overconfident incorrect results reported in many previous works. The paper first demonstrates the strong (negative) correlation between the distance to OCS and the OOD score (estimated by separately trained low-capacity models) over 8 image & text datasets using ResNet, VGG and DistilBERT (Fig 3), then shows the reason is that OOD inputs tend to have smaller projected feature norms $||Wh||$ (Fig 4), which could be theoretically explained within homogeneous DNNs with ReLU activations (Thm 4.1). Finally the paper presents an OCS-based selective classification algorithm using MSE loss, and validates its performance (abstain ratio, reward) against the standard (CE) classification and an oracle (with access to evaluation data) on 4 CV datasets (Fig 6 & 7).

### Strengths
+ [Originality] The paper novelly reassesses DNN’s OOD behavior both empirically and theoretically (OCS, OOD score, Sec 4.2), and reports interesting results (dispute of the common belief, OCS-based selective classification).
+ [Quality] The paper is of sufficient quality in my opinion, with proper empirical (Fig 3 & 4) and theoretical (Thm 4.1, Prop 4.2) validations of the main claims, and experimental evidence of the proposed algorithm’s effectiveness (Fig 6 & 7, although can be further improved, see Weaknesses).
+ [Clarity] The paper is overall clear and easy to follow, although certain details, e.g. the construction of the $(x,a,r)$ dataset in Sec 5.1, can be further elaborated for better understandability.

### Weaknesses
 - [Evaluation] While it’s understandable that this work doesn’t focus on achieving SOTA results, it’s still highly desirable to see how the proposed algorithm compares to existing selective classification (or OOD detection) baselines, and/or how they can be combined to further boost performance (discussion would be fine too).
- [Significance] While this paper is good in most aspects (as summarized in Strengths), its significance however is a bit insufficient in my opinion and can be substantially improved by addressing the following issues:
1) Evaluation as stated above. More evaluation can help strengthen the applicability of the paper.
2) The failure of the claim in some of the distribution shifts (adversarial perturbation and impulse noise in Appendix A) raises concerns about the generalizability of this work. What kinds of OOD shifts (extrapolations) are actually supported and not supported by this work? Is there a way to more formally and/or finely characterize them? More evaluation datasets as well as systematically generated OOD shifts e.g. [1] could be helpful.

### Questions
* In Fig 7, reward prediction seems to be noticeably better than standard classification on all CIFAR10 noises and particularly OfficeHome even at the training distribution (t), i.e. supposedly not OOD. Is this solely because of abstention (as shown in Fig 6), or does MSE loss somehow works better than CE loss in this case? More generally, how do their accuracies (instead of rewards) compare e.g. without considering the abstained samples?
* In Fig 4, the normalized norm in early layers for CIFAR10 (bottom left panel) seems to be systematically increasing with noise, contrary to later layers. Is this an expected behavior?
* Is there a particular reason to use -4 for the incorrect results? Does any number that brings the OCS below 0 (-3.5 in the paper) work?

### Summary
This paper focuses on the extrapolation of neural networks. It formulates a hypothesis that neural networks tend to move towards a constant value as the distribution shift on the input data increases. The first empirical observation exhibits that the norm of the feature representations decreases when the data are OOD and not sampled from ID. Then, the paper argues that this translates into the input-independent parts of the network (e.g. bias vectors) to dominate the output representation, thus explaining the more uniform prediction. The paper further argues that this constant value is close to the optimal constant solution (OCS). Then the paper focuses on why the OOD predictions have this tendency to move towards the OCS; the paper associates this behavior with the low-rank assumption on the learnt subspaces. The paper conducts a series of experiments with standard neural networks (e.g. resnet) to verify this hypothesis empirically. An application in high-risk decision making is also presented to exhibit the usefulness of this observation.

### Strengths
+ The paper is well-written, while understanding and improving the OOD of existing networks is important. 

+ I personally like sec. A in the appendix, where the paper demonstrates some cases that have an unexpected performance with respect to their hypothesis. 

+ The hypothesis seems new to me, while there are empirical results to support the hypothesis.

### Weaknesses
 - Some of the training details are opaque in the main paper, which might lead into a simpler explanation over the observed empirical performance. For instance, could the learning algorithm or the data augmentation or the normalization impact this hypothesis?

- I am skeptical about the hypothesis formed in the following sense: even if we assume a zero input, most modern networks rely on a normalization scheme, e.g. batch or layer normalization. Then, in a trained network, the “centering” provided by the learnt means and variances of the network will not result in a zero-mean representation for the next layers. As such, I am wondering how the normalization plays into the formed hypothesis. The paper does not sufficiently address how these normalization layers might be influencing the observed behavior, especially considering that these layers introduce learned affine transformations that could counteract the tendency of feature norms to decrease. This is a crucial point because the core argument relies on the feature representations moving towards zero, and normalization could easily disrupt this.


### Questions
Beyond the weaknesses above, the following questions come to mind about this submission: 

- In fig. 4, I am wondering what the norm is for ID data; is it the case that the norm is also decreasing on those networks as well? 

- In theorem 4.1 it mentions a “shallow” network with L’ layers. Is this a contradiction? 

- Even though not strictly mandatory, I am wondering whether structures that differ from the feedforward structure of MLPs differ in the solution they find. For instance, graph neural networks or multi-path networks. In other words, I am not sure whether the proved extrapolation properties (see Xu et al 2021 and Wu et al 2022 that are already cited) affect the formed hypothesis.

### Summary
It is well-established that neural networks are miscalibrated and overconfident on Out-Of-Distribution (OOD) data. At the same time, it is also known that classifiers tend to be less confident on OOD compared to In-Distribution data [1]. 
In this paper, the authors investigate the reasons why neural networks are less confident on OOD data, and propose the “reversion to the OCS” hypothesis as a possible explanation of this behavior. The Optimal Constant Solution (OCS) is a constant output to which neural networks converge when diverging from ID data. In the case of a classifier, the OCS corresponds to the uniform distribution over the target classes.

**Contributions**
In relation to the OCS hypothesis, the paper's contributions are the following:
- Empirical validation that the learned feature representations on OOD data have smaller norms (Fig. 4). This leads to the fact that the output of OOD is mostly driven by the input-independent components of the model (biases). Accordingly, the OCS is then mostly identified by the biases of the network (Fig. 4). Lastly, the role of the feature norms and network biases on OOD data was investigated theoretically in the restricted setting of Deep ReLU networks (Section 4.2).
- Empirical validation that as data deviates further from ID data, the output converges to the OCS (Fig. 3).
- In Section 5, the OCS hypothesis was leveraged as a tool for risk-sensitive decision-making. More in detail, we can define a classifier with a rejection option such that the OCS corresponds to preferring rejection to guessing one class. In this way, following the “reversion to the OCS” hypothesis, the further the classifier with rejection is from ID data, the more is prone to prefer the rejection option.

**Limitations**
The authors also addressed the limitations of the OCS hypothesis in the appendix, by showing that the hypothesis does not hold for adversarial examples (Fig. 8) and for specific types of noise (Fig. 9).

### Strengths
- I found the paper very well written and clear. The experiments are all well presented and detailed.
- A lot of research has been recently devoted to addressing the issue of detecting overconfident OOD data and quantifying uncertainty in neural networks. This paper shows a result, that, in my opinion, might have been overlooked by the existing literature: while some OOD inputs might have high confidence, the more an input is far from ID data, the more the output *should* converge to some constant value.
- Existing OOD detectors, among the many, have exploited the norm of the learned features [1,2] and the confidence of the output [3] to detect OODs. This paper connects the two methodologies through the OCS hypothesis, by showing that OOD are less confident and detectable thanks to the lower feature norms and the reliance to the bias terms.

### Weaknesses
 **Weaknesses**
- Lack of references: the norm of the learned features was already known to be a discriminant characteristic between ID and OOD data (see, e.g., [1] and [2] cited above). The paper should more clearly distinguish its contributions from these existing works by highlighting the novel aspects of the OCS hypothesis in relation to feature norm analysis. Specifically, the paper needs to articulate how the OCS framework provides a unique perspective beyond simply observing that feature norms are smaller for OOD data. It should clarify whether the OCS hypothesis offers a predictive model for how feature norms will behave under various OOD conditions, or if it primarily serves as an explanatory framework.
- Lack of discussion on when the OCS does not hold. Although I understand that the results on the OCS hypothesis are still preliminary, I would like some additional remarks on when it might fail (as you showed in the appendix, but also as shown in works such as [1]). I suggest to briefly address this aspect in the introduction (see also Questions). The paper should also discuss the potential sensitivity of the OCS to network architecture, training procedures, and specific types of OOD shifts. For instance, do residual connections or batch normalization layers affect the tendency of a network to revert to the OCS? How does the OCS behavior change when the OOD data is generated by different types of transformations, such as rotations or changes in lighting conditions, as opposed to entirely different datasets?
- I don't understand the conclusions drawn from the decision-making scenario. Ideas contained in the Hendrycks baselines paper ([1] in the summary) implicitly assume the OCS: if we choose an abstain threshold on the output confidence of a standard classifier, we already expect a non-zero abstain ratio on OOD data.  In general, anomaly detectors on neural networks based on the output confidence are based on these ideas. Could you explain better the intuitions provided by section 5 on exploiting the OCS? How does the OCS hypothesis possibly change the way in which we define safer AI models with rejection options, compared to simple threshold-based ones?

### Questions
- Do you see the OCS hypothesis as an "average" behavior of neural networks on OODs? In other works, do you expect that high-confidence OODs have to be constructed (e.g. adversarial examples), while the other ones will mostly respect the OCS hypothesis?
- In the OCS hypothesis, you clearly stated the assumption that OODs are high-dimensional. Is the OCS not valid on low-dimensional toy examples? 
- In Figure 6, the OfficeHome dataset is the only one that has lower abstain ratio for the oracle compared to the predicted rewards. Is this because of the high number of target classes, compared to the other dataset, that makes it easier to achieve low confidence outputs?
