# Equal Long-term Benefit Rate: Adapting Static Fairness Notions to Sequential Decision Making

- Decision: Reject
- Scores: 5, 3, 5

## Abstract
Decisions made by machine learning models may have lasting impacts over time, making long-term fairness a crucial consideration. 
It has been shown that when ignoring the long-term effect, naively imposing fairness criterion in static settings can actually exacerbate bias over time. To explicitly address biases in sequential decision-making, recent works formulate long-term fairness notions in Markov Decision Process (MDP) framework. They define the long-term bias to be the sum of static bias over each time step. However, we demonstrate that naively summing up the step-wise bias can cause a false sense of fairness since it fails to consider the importance difference of different time steps during transition. In this work, we introduce a long-term fairness notion called Equal Long-term Benefit Rate (ELBERT), which explicitly considers varying temporal importance and adapts static fairness principles to the sequential setting. Moreover, we show that the policy gradient of Long-term Benefit Rate can be analytically reduced to standard policy gradient. This makes standard policy optimization methods applicable for reducing bias, leading to our bias mitigation method ELBERT-PO. Extensive experiments on diverse sequential decision making environments consistently show that ELBERT-PO significantly reduces bias and maintains high utility.

### Summary
The paper considers long-term fairness through the ratio between aggregated group supply and demand. The paper proposes supply-demand Markov decision process (SD-MDP) to model group welfare in terms of the ratio between supply and demand, and proposes the ELBERT notion of long-term fairness based on static group-level fairness notions (EOdds and DP). Policy optimization approach is presented to achieve ELBERT.

### Strengths
Overall, the paper is not hard to follow. The authors present the setting, the modeling of the problem, and the proposed solution relatively clear. It is nice to see the attempt to draw connection and apply static fairness notions in dynamic scenarios.

### Weaknesses
The weakness of the paper comes from the not-clearly-motivated objective of interest in terms of the application of static fairness in long-term and dynamic settings. In particular, clarifications on points in Section __Questions__ would be helpful.

__Question 1__: the applicability of the way long-term fairness is characterized

In the motivating example, the hospital dispatches 0 treatment (action) to both blue and red groups, and dispatches a total of 101 treatments (actions) to both groups. As noted by authors, the treatment rate is 0 at time t, and 1 at time t+1 for both groups. I am not sure this is a good motivating example to emphasize the relation between the resource distributed and the group-wise importance of the state. First of all, why the supplies are modeled in a group-specific way from the user (here, is red/blue group) perspective, instead of from the supplier (here, is the hospital) perspective? Second, while I understand authors' emphasis on the fact that ratio is calculated after aggregation, I do not think the proposed modeling is more general than aggregating the supply-demand ratios along the temporal axis. In fact, those two modeling choices are complimentary, each suitable for specific practical scenarios. Third, the proposed long-term fairness notion is not robust towards group size imbalance. Imagine that the group size of red is significantly larger than that of blue, to the extent that even for the most unimportant states of red group, the demand is much larger than the entire population of blue group (and therefore, larger than the demand of blue group even in its most important state). One can imagine that in the calculated ratio, the supply/demand of blue group does not alter the result simply because they are out-numbered to a certain extent. The proposed fairness evaluation, in turn, may not provide sensible distinction between numerical variation and suffering of minority group.

__Question 2__: the claimed benefit of the proposed notion, compared to previous notions

As a follow-up on previous question, the proposed notion is claimed to address potential issues of previous utilization of static fairness in dynamic settings. Specifically, authors claim that the sequence of applying aggregation and ratio calculation matters. It is true that states have relative importance for each group. The discussion should include more than one (somewhat exaggerating) example to establish the (potential) advantage of ratio-after-aggregation compared to ratio-before-aggregation. To me, these two ways are complimentary, and the proposed notion is not well-motivated enough.

__Question 3__: the "importance" of state vs. long-term fairness goal

If the importance corresponds closely to the absolute size of demand at a given time, it is does not seem natural to model group-specific importance of states for the purpose of achieving long-term fairness. After all, if the focus is on fairness of resource distribution, what is the implication of state importance on long-term fairness, when the importance is only an intrinsic property of a certain state (e.g., if the base population is large).

### Summary
This paper introduces a novel long-term group fairness notion, where the (sensitive/demographic) group size is not determined at each time step such as in static fairness notion ("to decide fair relative to a group of individuals with certain demographics present at a certain time step, e.g., all females at one time step"), but the group is considered to be all individuals from a sensitive/demographic group across time steps ("to decide fair relative the cumulative group of individuals with certain demographics across all time steps, e.g., the entire group of females accumulated over all time steps"). The paper then introduces how to learn a policy adhering to their proposed fairness notion in a Markov Decision Making process setting.

### Strengths
[S1] The topic of fairness in sequential decision making, where individuals arrive on a rolling basis (at different time steps) and a decision has to be made at each time step, is an interesting one. 

[S2] The proposed fairness notion is looking at group-based fairness notions, where the group is not defined by the amount of individuals to be decided on at a certain time step, but across time steps. This could be interesting in a hiring scenario, where a firm would hire each month (12 times a year) and finds enforcing demographic parity (DP, i.e., equal acceptance rates) difficult to fulfill at each month, but can commit to fulfilling DP on a yearly base (average across all hiring decisions of the year).

### Weaknesses
 [W1] I have several difficulties to parse the example provided in the introduction. First, why is the proposed medical treatment a fair decision-making problem? Given the framing with individuals seeking medical care as "demand" and a medical facility providing healthcare as "supply", this appears to me a fair allocation/ranking problem, which is - to my undestanding - different from the general decision making, in having an upper bound on the (usually) positive decision. Second, what is the motivation for a decision-maker to aim for demographic parity (equal acceptance rates) in a medical treatment scenario, i.e., why is it the goal to provide the same proportion of service to blue and red patients? The motivation of the proposed fairness notion lives from the observation that it would be “unfair” to provide nobody of the group of 100 red people with a treatment at time step t, just because we do not provide the 1 blue person at time step t with treatment. I am struggeling to think of a real-world scenario, where a decision-maker would take such decisions, thus I have difficulties to follow the motivation for the example and thus the proposed fairness notion. As indnicated in [S2], it would be easier for me to see an application of this in a hiring scenario.

[W2] If I understood the example and fairness notion correctly, the demographic parity notion from the introduction is only expected to yield a different result than static one-step fairness notions, when i) demographic group sizes vary across time steps and ii) if a) decisions are trivial (i.e., either “accept all” or “accept nobody”) or b) we have one group with a group size 1. Here is a scenario, where i) is fulfilled, but ii) not: When we have 20 non-binary individuals and 100 binary individuals at t, then 80 non-binary individuals and 10 binary individuals at t+1 and fulfill DP with an acceptance rate p \in (0, 1) at each time step (such that DP-unfairness is zero), then the proposed long term notion yields the same as the single time step notion, e.g., p_t = 0.5, p_{t+1} = 0.25, then |(10+40)/(20+80) – (50+5) / (100+10)| = |50/100 – 55/110| = |0|. To my understanding from the example, the notion is only useful in a very specific case, which limits its practicality. I am happy to be corrected by the authors, if I misunderstood.

[W3] I find calling some time steps more “important” than others misleading. The authors call a time step “more important” for a demographic group, if there exist more of its members that are seeking a decision at that time step. This means, larger groups are paid more importance to than smaller groups. First, this is an ethical understanding that should be at least mentioned, if not discussed. Second, I find this understanding of fairness especially concerning, if the variance in the group sizes of individuals that arrive at each time step is biased or confounded by another factor. For a given demographic group (e.g., blue ones), individuals who tend to arrive in smaller groups may be treated unfairly in comparison to individuals, who tend to arrive in larger groups. This is because the fairness notion aggregates the blue individuals over all time steps to one large blue group and demands the cummulative decisions across all time steps to be fair to the cummulated blue groups. So this may yield to a type of inter-group unfairness. 

[W4] The authors claim on page 2: “Without considering the variation in temporal importance within a group, these prior metrics lead to a false sense of fairness.” I strongly object the attempt to claim that prior fairness notions are “false”, which the authors do several times on page 2. Different fairness notions capture different understandings of fairness and which one to pick is very dependent on the context and scenario, and importantly should be at the heart of different research fields, such as philosophy, ethics, sociology etc. I advocate to remove these strong claims, and additionally merge the related work section with the introduction or put it right after it to contextualize the claims made as well as the motivate the need for a "new" fairness notion better.

[W5] In the introduction, the authors keep writing that they measure “bias”, but to my understanding, what they are measuring is not a (statistical, sampling, cofounding etc.) bias, but their moral/ethical understanding of “unfairness”.

[W6] In the conclusion the authors write “However, in real world applications, extra constraints on demand might be needed. For example, the demand should not be too large (e.g. when demand is the number of infected individuals) or too small (e.g. when demand is the number of qualified applicants).” I am failing to follow this argumentation. “Demand” in how the users understand it, is the number of individuals a decision-maker is deciding upon at each time step (e.g., loan applicants). I am failing to see, how and why these extra constraints might be needed.

[W7] There are missing citations for the background section, e.g., for Standard MDP. In the experimental section, there are missing citations for each of the three environments considered.

Minors
- In times of increasing research on large language models, I would suggest the authors to pick a different name for their fairness notion than “ELBERT”, given the similarity to all the variations of BERT models.

### Questions
In addition to some of my questions / comments under "Weaknesses', I have the following questions: 

[Q1] The authors write on page 3 “In many static fairness notions, the formulation of the group well-being can be unified as the ratio between supply and demand.“ I have difficulties to understand, where this understanding of demand and supply in fairness notions comes from. There is no citation given. To my understanding, at a classical sequential decision making scenario, there is at each time step a set of individuals that are required to be made a decision upon, and the decision maker takes the features of the individuals as input and decides usually aiming to maximize their utility while potentially adhering to some fairness notions. The concept of supply and demand comes from economics, where the general standard assumption is that goods demanded/supplied are uniform, i.e., every individual item is the same. This is not the case in fair decision making; every individual is different. There is not a demand and supply of credits and as long as a decision maker can supply credits they will. Instead, they will aim to give the credit to the individuals that they expect to have a high probability of paying back. Could the authors please clarify this?

### Summary
This paper introduces a new long-term fairness notion called ELBERT that considers varying temporal importance and adapts static fairness principles to sequential settings. The previous long-term fairness notion in the MDP setting, which primarily considers the sum of step bias, could potentially lead to a false sense of fairness. Later, the paper relaxes the objective (RL with ELBERT, equation 1) into a unconstrained optimization problem (equation 2), and shows the policy gradient of the Long-term benefit rate can be transformed into a traditional policy gradient and uses a standard optimization method to solve for the gradient. Experimental results demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed method in terms of reducing bias.

### Strengths
The paper is well-written and relatively easy to follow. The new proposed fairness notion is intuitive, and the demonstration of Figure 1 emphasizes the importance of considering variation in temporal importance. The authors provide propositions to help understand their proposed method and clearly state their proposed algorithm.

### Weaknesses
The major concern is that the contribution of the paper feels relatively marginal besides the major contribution is the newly proposed long-term fairness notion. In addition, The proposed method involves a lot of relaxations/approximations, without enough rigorous theoretical justification, as evident from the questions raised below. Consequently, it appears to lean more towards a heuristic application of conventional MDP techniques rather than introducing a genuinely innovative concept. I would consider increasing my score if the authors address these concerns.

### Questions
1. How does solving (2) equivalent to solving (1)? I assume it's related to the Lagrangian form? Since equation (1) is the primary objective function of the paper, the authors should consider adding a detailed justification of the equivalency between the two equations. 

2. What is the "Bellman Equation"? It might be unclear to a non-expert in MDP, but it seems like an important concept. 

3. Continuing the above question, it's unclear how proposition 3.1 helps overcome the difficulty of being unable to compute $b(\pi)$ directly. 

4. The authors demonstrate in Figure 1 when ELBERT is strictly better than the sum of step-wise bias. Does it imply that ELBERT is always strictly better than the traditional fairness notion?
