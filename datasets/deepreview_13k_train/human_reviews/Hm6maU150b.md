# NeFL: Nested Federated Learning for Heterogeneous Clients

- Decision: Reject
- Scores: 6, 6, 5

## Abstract
Federated learning (FL) is a promising approach in distributed learning keeping privacy. However, during the training pipeline of FL, slow or incapable clients (i.e., stragglers) slow down the total training time and degrade performance. System heterogeneity, including heterogeneous computing and network bandwidth, has been addressed to mitigate the impact of stragglers. Previous studies tackle the system heterogeneity by splitting a model into submodels, but with less degree-of-freedom in terms of model architecture. We propose nested federated learning (NeFL), a generalized framework that efficiently divides a model into submodels using both depthwise and widthwise scaling. NeFL is implemented by interpreting forward propagation of models as solving ordinary differential equations (ODEs) with adaptive step sizes. To address the inconsistency that arises when training multiple submodels of different architecture, we decouple a few parameters from parameters being trained for each submodel. NeFL enables resource-constrained clients to effectively join the FL pipeline and the model to be trained with a larger amount of data. Through a series of experiments, we demonstrate that NeFL leads to significant performance gains, especially for the worst-case submodel. Furthermore, we demonstrate NeFL aligns with recent studies in FL, regarding pre-trained models of FL and the statistical heterogeneity.

### Summary
The authors present nested federated learning (NeFL), a framework that divides the global model into multiple submodels using an interpretation of ODEs for depthwise scaling and continuous channel-based pruning on convolutional neural networks and node removal on fully connected neural networks for widthwise scaling, and performs aggregation using Nested Federated Averaging scheme for models with incompatible sizes.

### Strengths
++ The paper has carefully examined the related literature, and have observed the presence of low degrees of freedom in model architectures that were proposed in previous studies to combat heterogeneity by model splitting.

++ The paper has cleverly used findings from other papers to increase the credibility of their arguments. 

++ The paper has performed a comprehensive set of experiments to show that NeFL performs significantly better than previous works.

### Weaknesses
-- Why scale the depth of the models using the interpretation of ODEs? The authors should motivate the reasons for using ODEs to scale depth and what makes this approach of scaling depth better than previous appraches. Why not use some other method for scaling depth? They should just perform depth scaling using ODEs and compare its performance to other depth scaling techniques in FL.

-- Since the authors propose a hybrid approach that combines depth scaling as well as width scaling in the spirit that a balanced network performs better, they should show how much better depth scaling using ODE is, when coupled with width scaling, and vice versa. Since in FL, the networks have not been depth scaled using ODEs, the authors should explain why they have not only used depth scaling via ODEs.

-- How is the aggregation of the consistent parameters even meaningful? In the presence of non-IID datasets and ResNets of different depths and widths, each layer in a particular ResNet serves a different purpose than the corresponding layer in the other, ResNet i.e., layers L1, L2, and L3 with widths W1, W2 and W3 inside client A's Resenet with layers: (L1, L2, L3) will have different purposes than the corresponding layers L'1, L'2 and L'3 with widths W'1, W'2 and W'3 inside client B's Resenet with layers: (L'1, L'2, L'3, L'4, L'5). So what is the justification behind aggregating layers that are incoherent in terms of their purposes in the network?

-- The parameterAverage subroutine is expected to returns N_s submodels, however it does not compute submodels 2,...,N_{s-1}. The parameterAverage subroutine should compute and return the submodels 2,...,N_{s-1}: theta_{c,2},...,theta_{c,N_{s-1}}. For example theta_{c,N_{s-1}} = U over all {j<=N_{s-1}} phi_j.

-- The authors should explain their diagrams and algorithms thoroughly. Please refer to Writing Issues.


Writing Issues:

* The authors should explain Figure 2, part b as that would help the readers understand their aggregation scheme well.

* Algorithm 2 is difficult to read because the paper has used notations that were not pre-defined. For example in line 9, the superscript 'i' has not been pre-defined and it is hard to make sense of the backslash ('\').

### Summary
The authors introduce a method called Nested FL which helps to improve performance when training with heterogeneous clients.

### Strengths
The authors do a good job describing the state of the art, the work is timely as the clients that are participating in FL are becoming increasingly diverse. Thus efficient schemes of tackling and even exploiting that heterogeneity are highly desirable. In principle, I found the concept of averaging nesting consistent parameters is simple yet novel and interesting. Finally the empirical performance based on the empirical numbers provided is encouraging. Appreciated that they have compared against a variety of recent frameworks that aim to do a similar task so we can get a broad idea of how the scheme performs.

### Weaknesses
- Lack of clarity what happens with stragglers and/or dropped nodes in the proposed framework.
- Reproducibility is important; unfortunately, there is no mention of code release statement - even after acceptance.
- The code was omitted in the submission and thus evaluation of the soundness of the implementation could not be performed.

### Questions
- What do the authors mean by "test time" and how does that happen in practice? Do they run a benchmark? Keep track of computation time? I feel this requires some clarifications...
- Why the code was not included part of the assessment as a private artifact? I see no sensitive data and/or methods in the paper to warrant this.
- How do the clients balance the task? Is that something that is covered by NeFL? Does that balancing act happen once? Or is that performed dynamically over time?
- What is the impact of stragglers in the final output? What happens if a client drops from the computation?

### Summary
This paper proposes a new sub-model training method in federated settings. 
The proposed method, NeFL, creates sub-models for participating clients by reducing both the depth and width of a full model. 
The way of creating sub-models is inspired by the interpretation that a model with skip-connections can be regarded as ordinary differential equations (ODEs). 
Depending on each client's resource, the client picks the feasible sub-model that can be trained locally. 
Therefore, training costs are reduced.

### Strengths
This paper targets a practical and important problem of reducing training costs in FL with large models, especially for large models. Several contributions are highlighted below.

**1**, The motivation for reducing both depth and width is interesting. 

In Sec.3, the authors justify the way of creating sub-models in NeFL. Inspired by the interpretation, that models with skip connections can be seen as ODEs, the authors argue that it is reasonable to remove some residual blocks, as skipping some steps in solving ODEs. 
The motivation is valid and interesting. 

**2**, Experiments cover different sub-model methods. 

The author compared NeFL with both depth scaling and width scaling methods. The results show promising results.

### Weaknesses
 **1**, Lack of explanations why NeFL is better than scaling width or depth only. 

While the authors show NeFL results in higher accuracy compared to width-scaling and depth-scaling methods, necessary explanations/intuitions are missing. As a reader, I do not see which part of NeFL contributes to performance gains. I believe the authors need to provide more insights to demystify NeFL. For instance, why scaling both width and depth is better than scaling one dimension only?


**2**, Lack of contributions.

Essentially, NeFL is a combination of width-scaling (e.g., HeteroFL) and depth-scaling (e.g., DepthFL). Other than that, I did not see a nontrivial contribution in this work. Importantly, it is doubtful such a combination can bring significant improvement over prior works.
