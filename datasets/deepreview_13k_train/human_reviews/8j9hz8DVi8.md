# Combining Axes Preconditioners through Kronecker Approximation for Deep Learning

- Decision: Accept
- Scores: 8, 6, 8

## Abstract
Adaptive regularization based optimization methods such as full-matrix Adagrad which use gradient second-moment information hold significant potential for fast convergence in deep neural network (DNN) training, but are memory intensive and computationally demanding for large neural nets. We develop a technique called Combining AxeS PReconditioners (CASPR), which optimizes matrix-shaped DNN parameters by finding different preconditioners for each mode/axis of the parameter and combining them using a Kronecker-sum based approximation. We show tighter convergence guarantees in stochastic optimization compared to a Kronecker product based preconditioner, Shampoo, which arises as a special case of CASPR. Furthermore, our experiments demonstrates that CASPR approximates the gradient second-moment matrix in full-matrix Adagrad more accurately, and shows significant improvement in training and generalization performance compared to existing practical adaptive regularization based methods such as Shampoo and Adam in a variety of tasks including graph neural network on OGBG-molpcba, Transformer on a universal dependencies dataset and auto-regressive large language modeling on C4 dataset.

### Rating Number

### Confidence
3: You are fairly confident in your assessment. It is possible that you did not understand some parts of the submission or that you are unfamiliar with some pieces of related work. Math/other details were not carefully checked.

### Summary
In this work, the authors propose a new second-order method inspired by the Shampoo optimizer. The authors show that the proposed method is theoretically grounded and empirically tested.  The authors demonstrate the performance of the proposed method on several large models.

### Strengths
This is a solid work. Strong theoretical results and empirical results are provided. I do not check the proofs in the appendices.

### Weaknesses
The authors should discuss the time and space complexity of the coupled Newton algorithm used for computing the matrix inverse p-root. 
Moreover, numerically stability of the proposed method should be discussed. 
For example, how to choose the damping term $\epsilon$? Note that the coupled Newton algorithm could be sensitive to the choice of the damping term.   
The proposed method may not work well in a low numerical precision setting such as float-32 or bfloat-16. The authors should explicitly discuss this point.

### Summary
The paper proposes an alternative to the recently successful Shampoo optimizer that is derived by minimizing the error of the approximation. They show that their method obtains a faster theoretical convergence guarantee in an online learning setting than the original Shampoo optimizer, and also in practice performs better.

### Strengths
- clear development of the method and comparison to Shampoo
- theoretical development that exists of Shampoo extended to caspr 
- experiments suggest that caspr improves over shampoo and potentially also other baselines (only compared to Adam(W))

### Weaknesses
- The abstract and introduction could be written more clearly. Currently, they only mention what is achieved but not how it will be done. For instance, the abstract states that the method obtains a faster theoretical convergence guarantee, but it does not provide any insight into the techniques used to achieve this.

- The paper presents limited benchmarking to other methods besides Adam(W). While the comparison to Shampoo is thorough, a broader comparison to other optimizers would strengthen the empirical validation. Furthermore, the lack of error bars on the experiments raises concerns about the robustness and reproducibility of the results. The reported figures appear to be from a single training run, which is insufficient to draw statistically significant conclusions. The absence of multiple runs with different random seeds makes it difficult to ascertain whether the observed improvements are consistent or due to chance. It is also not clear what is the target for tuning hyperparameters.

- It is unclear how this method extends to layers that are not fully-connected. The paper primarily focuses on fully-connected layers, and it would be beneficial to elaborate on the applicability of the proposed method to other layer types, such as convolutional or recurrent layers.

- Minor: The sentence on the first page "...to be at one end of this sequence" is confusing and requires clarification.

### Questions
- On page 3 it says the second-moments are computed per row of the gradient. Is it correct to say that this means it is a neuron-level conditioner? This is something that seems to exist in the context. See for example, Fig 1 "unit-wise" preconditioning in https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.04684.pdf.
- Are the 300 hyperparameters optimized for each method or only for caspr? What is the target for this hyperparameter tuning? Validation accuracy is the performance reported so is the grid search optimizing that value?
- Why are there no error bars included? Could the experiments be run on at least 3 seeds? Without a single rerun, the results could be random.

5: You are absolutely certain about your assessment. You are very familiar with the related work and checked the math/other details carefully.

### Summary
This work proposes an optimization algorithm called CASPR that yields tighter convergence guarantees for stochastic optimization. It is inspired from the commonly known Shampoo optimizer (which is a Kronecker product based optimizer) and uses the Kronecker sum approximation to obtain better convergence rate with similar complexity as in the Shampoo case. The technique is well motivated and provides theoretical/experimental proofs/explanations for all the claims in the paper (convergence guarantees, basic properties of kronecker product/sum and Loewner order).

### Strengths
1. clearly explains the motivation of a Kronecker sum based precondition, the differences in the updates of CASPR and Shampoo and comparison with diagonal Adagrad statistics in Figure 1 (all in section 3)
2. provides convergence guarantees
3. experiments are performed on transformers and graph neural network tasks (commonly known as difficult tasks) against Shampoo and AdamW, the main competitor optimizers in the literature
4. comprehensive appendix

### Weaknesses
1. the paper does not have experiments on computer vision tasks, such as ResNets, ViTs or other important architectures used for benchmarking in the literature

2. In the evaluation you introduce a momentum for $L$ and $R$ matrices for a fair comparison against the other optimizers, can you please say what is the impact of momentum terms in this case? Have you experimented without momentum?

I would like to point out some typos in the manuscript:
- at page 4, Lemma 3.1, the Frobenius norm should be squared (the 2nd power is missing from the norm)
- at page 5, when you rewrite the preconditioner $X_t^{caspr}(1)$ in terms of $X_t^L$ and $X_t^R$, I belive the matrices $L$ and $R$ are missing a tilde, based on the definitions of the $X_t^{L/R}$ terms 4 lines above
