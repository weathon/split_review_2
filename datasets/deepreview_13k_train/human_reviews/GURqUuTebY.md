## Abstract
Recent progress in text-to-3D generation has been achieved through the utilization of score distillation methods: they make use of the pre-trained text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models by distilling via the diffusion model training objective. 
However, such an approach inevitably results in the use of random timesteps at each update, which increases the variance of the gradient and ultimately prolongs the optimization process.
In this paper, we propose to enhance the text-to-3D optimization by leveraging the T2I diffusion prior in the generative sampling process with a predetermined timestep schedule. 
To this end, we interpret text-to-3D optimization as a multi-view image-to-image translation problem, and propose a solution by approximating the probability flow.
By leveraging the proposed novel optimization algorithm, we design {\ssname}, a practical three-stage coarse-to-fine text-to-3D optimization framework that enables fast generation of high-quality and high-resolution (i.e., 1024$\times$1024) 3D contents. 
For example, we demonstrate that {\ssname} is 5 times faster than the existing state-of-the-art text-to-3D method, while producing more photorealistic 3D contents.\footnote{Visit \href{https://kyungmnlee.io/dreamflow.io/}{project page} for visualizations of our method.}

### Summary
The authors propose a three-stage coarse-to-fine text-to-3D generation pipeline capable of producing high-resolution 3D assets from given text prompts. This involves the use of a variant of the SDS loss, Approximate Probability Flow ODE (APFO), to optimize a 3D representation learning from text-to-image priors. NeRFs and Meshes are used as the 3D representations at different stages, with the SDXL refiner applied to further enhance the extracted 3D meshes.

### Strengths
The paper is well-written and easy to follow. The perspective of considering SDS as a Schrödinger Bridges (SB) problem is insightful. The visual results appear comparable, and the quantitative scores are slightly better to the baselines. Notably, the proposed method demonstrates faster convergence than state-of-the-art methods.

### Weaknesses
1) While the authors provide insightful interpretations of the SDS method as an SB problem, its implementation exhibits strong similarities to the prior work ProlificDreamer [1]. Specifically, the core optimization process, despite the theoretical reframing, appears to rely on analogous techniques for updating the NeRF and mesh representations. Furthermore, the concept of timestep scheduling has been explored in previous works [1, 2, 3], which reduces the novelty of this aspect of the proposed method. The authors should more clearly delineate the practical differences between their method and [1] in terms of implementation details and optimization strategies.

2) When viewed as an SB problem, the proposed method using a LoRA-fine-tuned score function seems to have difficulties in generating diverse results. The reliance on a fine-tuned score function might inadvertently constrain the exploration of the 3D asset space. Further explanations and experimental results demonstrating the diversity of generated outputs are encouraged.

3) The improved numerical scores, as shown in the paper, are modest and are computed based on only 20 3D assets. A more comprehensive evaluation with a larger and more diverse dataset is necessary to validate the claimed improvements. Furthermore, some results contain weird textures, as observed in the example of "A stack of pancakes covered in maple syrup." This suggests potential limitations in the model's ability to accurately capture fine-grained texture details.

4) The results after the third stage exhibit color bias (Fig.5), and most generated 3D assets do not appear significantly improved after SDXL fine-tuning, except for the cottage example in Fig. 13. To explain this, additional ablation studies are recommended to fully evaluate the effectiveness of SDXL. Specifically, a comparison of results with and without SDXL refinement across a wider range of prompts would help isolate the impact of this stage.

Miscellaneous:

1) An explanation of the method referred to as "tie" is missing in Table 1. Without a clear definition, it is difficult to interpret the results presented in this table.

2) There appear to be typos in Eq.13, with "\Phi" possibly intended to be "\phi," and "q" possibly intended to be "p." Otherwise, clarification regarding the transition from Eq.12 to Eq.13 would be appreciated. The transition between these equations is not immediately obvious and requires further elaboration.

### Questions
1) In Fig.6, the stability of the APFO loss is attributed to the non-increasing timestep scheduling, as opposed to the two-stage stratified random scheduling used in the VSD loss from ProlificDreamer. However, the convergence of the loss curves may not precisely reflect the training quality of the 3D representation due to the random timestep sampling in VSD. Could the authors provide further clarification on this point?

2) Based on the above question, what would be the outcome if the VSD loss were applied using the same timestep scheduling as proposed by the authors? Moreover, the predetermined timestep selection process remains unclear, particularly regarding the decreasing ratio over iterations.

### Summary
This work designs DreamFlow, a practical three-stage coarseto-fine text-to-3D optimization framework that enables fast generation of highquality and high-resolution (i.e., 1024×1024) 3D contents. The experiments show that the framework outperforms exisiting baelines in both user-study and quantitative results.

### Strengths
1. The paper is well-written and the experiments are sufficient.
2. The theoretical part seems sound to me.
3. Some results have good visual quality.

### Weaknesses
1. My main concern is that the proposed APFO is too similar to VSD. Maybe a more detailed explanation should be given to demonstrate the difference between VSD and APFO. Specifically, the paper should elaborate on the theoretical underpinnings that differentiate APFO's time-derivative of the noise scale from VSD's weighting function. Providing a mathematical comparison highlighting the distinct mechanisms would be beneficial. Additionally, the paper should discuss the practical implications of these differences in terms of optimization behavior, such as convergence speed and the quality of the generated 3D models.

2. The color of some results are kind of "green" or "brown" (including the cactus in Fig. 4, the corgi in Fig. 7, etc.). While this might be attributed to the inherent variability of generative models, a more thorough analysis is needed. Can you explain the reason? Is this a limitation of the pre-trained text-to-image diffusion models used, or is it related to the optimization process itself? Providing insights into the potential causes and discussing possible mitigation strategies would strengthen the paper.

### Questions
1. What is the CFG scale used in 1/2/3 stages?
2. How is the GPU memory consumation of finetuning the LoRA of SDXL in stage3?
3. Can you provide the 2D experiment of APFO (using APFO to optimize a 2D image)? A 2D experiment will demonstrate the effectiveness of APFO better.

### Summary
This paper proposes a new method for text-to-3D from pre-trained 2D diffusion model. It formulates the 3D generation problem as a Schrodinger Bridge problem that transports multi-view renderings to the data distribution defined by the 2D diffusion model. An amortized sampling scheme is also proposed to avoid using random time step sampling during optimization. The method has more stable optimization loss variation and yields better quality results than previous methods, according to user preference study.

### Strengths
1. The formulation of text-to-3D as solving a Schrodinger Bridge problem is a novel perspective and insightful.

2. The proposed amortized sampling method stabilizes training loss (Figure 6).

3. User study is conducted to showcase the effectiveness of the method, which is more convincing than other quantitative metrics.

### Weaknesses
Although motivated differently, the final ODE (equation 12) looks very similar to VSD (equation 8). It looks like the main benefit of more stable training (Figure 6) comes from the amortized sampling (Section 3.2) where there is an inner loop for each t and t decreases gradually. I think the same thing can be implemented for VSD as well, but no such comparison is shown. Maybe this sampling method is more naturally motivated for this method than VSD. But if the above understanding is correct, I think it would be better if the authors can be more explicit about the similarity and difference between the two algorithms.

### Summary
The paper presents a novel approach to text-to-3D generation named DreamFlow, which is an optimization-based method similar to score distillation-based methods (e.g., DreamFusion, Magic3D, ProlificDreamer). By reframing text-to-3D optimization as a multi-view image-to-image translation problem, the authors propose a new gradient update rule to drive the optimization. Besides, through the use of a predetermined timestep schedule, the algorithm improves the speed and quality. The paper claims that DreamFlow is 5 times faster and produces higher quality 3D content than existing methods.

### Strengths
1. This paper offers a different perspective on how to model 3D generation problems. The authors interpret text-to-3D optimization as a multi-view image-to-image translation problem and propose a solution by approximating the probability flow.
2. The final experimental results of this work are fairly good. In terms of the same quality, it is five times faster than VSD.

### Weaknesses
1. Lack of Technical Contribution: 
(1). Although the authors are developing an optimization loss from a different angle, the algorithm they ultimately present is actually the same as Variational Score Distillation (VSD). Similarly, I also noticed that the results obtained by the authors are similar to those of VSD. From this perspective, it doesn't seem sufficiently novel.
(2). The author mentions that score distillation uses randomly drawn time steps at each update. However, there have already been many works that use a linear time schedule, which decreases from large t to small t during optimization. Additionally, there is a specialized work (DreamTime) that specifically studies this point. From this perspective, the technique does not appear to be original or novel.

2. Unclear Connection Between Motivation and Technical Details:
(1). From the abstract and introduction, it is evident that the authors' motivation is to address the issue of gradient variance. However, the methods section does not clearly explain how the proposed method or modeling perspective is related to the problem of gradient variance. 
They only visualize the gradient norm in the experimental section at the end to indicate that it is more stable (of "norm", instead of "direction"). However, this also relates to the time schedule; a random time schedule would naturally result in varying magnitudes of the gradient because the intensity of diffusion output scores can vary based on the timestep t.
(2). It remains unclear why this ("norm") variance is problematic for the optimization process. How is this demonstrated? For optimization, the direction of the gradient seems to be more important than its magnitude. In the experimental section on page 8, the author states, "This is because of the randomly drawn timestep during optimization, which makes optimization unstable. Thus, we observe that VSD often results in poor geometry during optimization, or over-saturated." I am unclear about the logical relationship indicated by "thus" here.

### Questions
1. Why is the variance in the norm of the gradient (which you describe as instability) a detrimental factor? Is there a rigorous and detailed mathematical explanation for this?

2. How is the time schedule related to your modeling? Is your model only applicable to a linear schedule?
What distinguishes your method from the timestep annealing mentioned in works like DreamTime?

3. Does your modeling approach have any broader applications? For instance, are there applications that could not be achieved in previous score distillation methods but might be feasible with your model?

4. Please elaborate on the differences and similarities between your method and VSD, as the final formulations appear to be nearly identical.

5. Please elaborate in detail on where the improvements in experimental results come from. For example, why is it faster, why do you think the results are better than VSD, and have you conducted independent ablation studies? (The current ablation study seems to be of limited significance, as adding each stage naturally leads to better results, but this is not the focus or contribution of the paper).
