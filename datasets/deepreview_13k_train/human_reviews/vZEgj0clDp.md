- Decision: Reject
- Scores: 5, 6, 5, 6

## Abstract
Knowledge Tracing (KT) is a problem that assesses students’ knowledge mastery (knowledge state) and predicts their future performance based on their interaction history with educational resources. Current KT research is dedicated to enhancing the performance of KT problems by integrating the most advanced deep learning techniques. However, this has led to increasingly complex models, which reduce model usability and divert researchers' attention away from exploring the core issues of KT. This paper aims to tackle the fundamental challenges of KT tasks, including the knowledge state representation and the core architecture design, and investigate a novel KT model that is both simple and powerful. We have revisited the KT task and propose the ReKT model. First, taking inspiration from the decision-making process of human teachers, we model the knowledge state of students from three distinct perspectives: questions, concepts, and domains. Second, building upon human cognitive development models, such as constructivism, we have designed a Forget-Response-Update (FRU) framework to serve as the core architecture for the KT task. The FRU is composed of just two linear regression units, making it an extremely lightweight framework. Extensive comparisons were conducted with 22 state-of-the-art KT models on 7 publicly available datasets. The experimental results demonstrate that ReKT outperforms all the comparative methods in question-based KT tasks, and consistently achieves the best (in most cases) or near-best performance in concept-based KT tasks. Furthermore, in comparison to other KT core architectures like Transformers or LSTMs, the FRU achieves superior prediction performance with approximately only 38% computing resources. Through an exploration of the ReKT model that is both simple and powerful, is able to offer new insights to future KT research. Code is available in the supplementary materials.

### Summary
The paper proposes a simple yet power knowledge tracing (KT) model called ReKT. The method consists of 1) three levels of knowledge state modeling including question-, concept-, and domain-level, and 2) a forget-response update (FRU) unit. Extensive experiments show that ReKT achieves state of the art KT performance on an array of datasets comparing many baselines.

### Strengths
- The proposed method is claimed to be simple yet powerful.
- the evaluation appears to be comprehensive.

### Weaknesses
1. I am not convinced that the FRU gate is "simple". It appears to me as a variant of the gated recurrent unit (GRU) without the reset gate. Compared to the GRU, FRU has a similar forget gate and the hyperbolic tangent function in the end (without the affine combination of the update gate). I think the FRU architecture design, though interesting, does not qualify it as "very lightweight, as it consists of only two linear regression units". Otherwise, I can make the same "very lightweight" statement for GRU, which only consists of three linear regression units. Why not just use GRU? GRU takes into account not just forgetting (as in FRU), but also remembering/resetting, which might make more sense and have more modeling power? What exactly in the reference article "Toward a theory of instruction" do the authors get the inspiration to build FRU? This is an important question that the author should answer because they claim FRU as one of their core contributions, whereas I think FRU is not much different from GRU, which diminishes the value of this contribution. The authors should also cite GRU as important alternative modeling choices to compare to FRU (in addition to LSTM).

2. The proposed approach to represent knowledge at question, concept, and history level is not entirely new; methods such as learning factor analysis (https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/11774303_17), performance factor analysis (https://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/ED506305.pdf), additive factor models (http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~ggordon/chi-etal-ifa.pdf, ), knowledge factoring machines (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1811.03388.pdf) also take into account of modeling students' knowledge at concept (sometimes called skills in these literature), question, or entire history levels. In the spirit of "revisiting", the authors neither mentioned nor compared to these classic knowledge tracing methods.

3. Some of the results need more clarifications. For example, AKT-R (https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.12324.pdf) can achieve an AUC of __0.8346__ on ASSIST09 (see Table 5 in the AKT paper), beating the AUC of 0.7917 by the proposed method. Several other baselines in the AKT paper also achieve AUC > 0.8.

### Questions
1. How is FRU different from GRU? What motivate the differences?
2. How is the proposed method contexualized within, and compared to, some classic literature such as LFA, PFA, AFM, KFM, and others?
3. Why are some results different (sometimes by a large margin) to existing published results?

### Summary
This paper presents an improvement of the deep knowledge tracing (DKT) algorithm, ReKT. The authors revisited the DKT algorithm to design it from three perspectives.: 1)question: whether the question was attempted before, 20 concept: performance on questions with similar concepts, and 3) the entire trajectory. 
Empirical results demonstrate the superior performance of ReKT compared to other variations of DKT.

### Strengths
- Superior performance while 38% less resource usage

### Weaknesses
1. The paper employs similar approaches to previous DKT methods, such as RAKT [1], AKT [2], and [3]  except for the FRU unit. All of three papers also implemented the FRU unit with exponential time decay as part of the attention mechanism in the transformer architecture. The authors have used MLP units as FRU and concatenated the hidden state to the final representations.

2. The authors did not provide any interpretations of the model's performance---which is very important in educational settings for both students' and teachers' perspectives. From a student's perspective, interpretation can help in recommending learning materials. From a teacher's perspective, it can be helpful to identify which questions or concepts students are struggling with.

### Questions
The Rasch difficulty is determined from students' question and response binary matrix.

As the authors have three different representations of question interactions, did the authors compute the Rasch difficulty from three different interaction matrices?

How did the authors handle multiple submissions for computing the Rash difficulty?

### Summary
The paper introduces a novel approach to Knowledge Tracing (KT) using the Forget-Response-Update (FRU) framework. KT is essential in online education systems for assessing and predicting student performance based on their interactions with educational content. 

The FRU framework, designed based on human cognitive development models, stands out due to its lightweight nature, consisting of just two linear regression units. The proposed model, named ReKT, was extensively compared with 22 state-of-the-art KT models across 7 public datasets. Results demonstrated that ReKT consistently outperformed other methods, especially in question-based KT tasks. In concept-based KT tasks, an adapted version of ReKT, termed ReKT-concept, achieved top or near-top performance across datasets. 

Furthermore, despite its simplicity, the FRU framework required only about 38% of the computing resources of other architectures like Transformers or LSTMs, showcasing its efficiency. The paper underscores the effectiveness, scalability, and efficiency of the FRU design in the realm of Knowledge Tracing.

### Strengths
The introduction of the Forget-Response-Update (FRU) framework offers a fresh perspective in the realm of Knowledge Tracing. While many models in the literature focus on complex architectures, the FRU's simplicity, relying on just two linear regression units, stands out as a unique proposition. The research brings a blend of cognitive learning principles and machine learning, fostering a more holistic approach to Knowledge Tracing.

The empirical evaluation of the proposed ReKT model is thorough. By benchmarking against 22 state-of-the-art KT models across 7 public datasets, the authors ensure a comprehensive assessment of their model's performance. The paper's methodological rigor is evident in the detailed descriptions of the FRU framework, the equations used, and the training methodologies employed.

The paper is well-structured, with distinct sections dedicated to introducing the problem, presenting the methodology, showcasing results, and discussing implications. The inclusion of figures, tables, and illustrative examples enhances the reader's understanding and provides a visual representation of the model's performance and capabilities.

### Weaknesses
The core of the proposed Forget-Response-Update (FRU) framework seems to be composed of two linear regression units. If this can be easily mirrored or replicated using two multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs), then the novelty of the FRU framework can be challenged. A deeper exploration or comparison with simple neural architectures, like MLPs, would provide clarity on the unique advantages of the FRU. Specifically, the paper lacks a rigorous ablation study comparing the FRU against a baseline model that uses MLPs for the forget and update operations. Without such a comparison, it's difficult to ascertain whether the observed performance gains are due to the specific design of the FRU or simply the use of a sequence-based model. Furthermore, the paper does not explore the impact of different activation functions within the linear regression units, which could influence the model's learning capacity and performance.

The use of terminology like "Forget", "Response", and "Update" in naming the modules of the FRU framework may imply distinct, targeted functionalities. However, in complex learning scenarios, such naming conventions can be misleading. In intricate neural architectures, a module named "Forget" might not necessarily perform a straightforward forgetting operation but might instead learn a more nuanced or intermediate representation. Over-reliance on such naming can lead to misconceptions about the actual functions and complexities of the modules, especially for those looking to adapt or build upon the framework. The paper should include a more detailed analysis of the internal representations learned by each module, perhaps through visualization techniques or probing tasks, to better understand their actual roles.

While the lightweight nature of the FRU is emphasized, there's limited exploration on how the FRU can be integrated into or combined with deeper or more complex neural network architectures. The paper does not discuss the potential benefits or challenges of using the FRU as a component within a larger model. For example, how would the FRU perform if used as an attention mechanism or as a recurrent layer within a Transformer-based architecture? The lack of such analysis limits the understanding of the FRU's versatility and potential for broader applications.

### Questions
How does the Forget-Response-Update (FRU) framework differ fundamentally from a structure consisting of two multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs)? What advantages does the FRU bring over a simple MLP setup?

Given the naming conventions like "Forget", "Response", and "Update", can you provide deeper insights into the exact functionalities and representations learned by each module during complex learning schedules?

How does the FRU framework integrate into more complex neural network architectures? Have there been experiments or considerations in this direction?

The paper mentioned that the FRU requires only about 38% of the computing resources compared to architectures like Transformers. Could you delve deeper into the parameter distribution within the FRU? Which module (Forget, Response, Update) consumes the most parameters?

### Summary
This paper aims to address the knowledge state representation and the core architecture design challenges of knowledge tracing (KT). To this end, the authors propose the ReKT model. They first take inspiration from the decision-making process of human teachers and propose the knowledge state of students from three different perspectives. Then, the authors propose a Forget-Response-Update (FRU) framework as the core architecture for the KT task. They finally demonstrate the effectiveness of their model in terms of efficiency in computing and effectiveness in score prediction through experiments on 7 public real datasets. Their experimental results show that their proposed method can reach the best performance in the question-based KT task and the best/near-best performance in the concept-based KT task, and their proposal only requires 38% computing resources compared to other KT core architectures.

### Strengths
1. The paper introduces a multi-perspective approach to modeling the knowledge state of students, considering questions, concepts, and domains, which is logically self-consistent.

2. The FRU framework designed as the core architecture of ReKT is lightweight yet effective. According to experiments, ReKT can achieve competitive performance with significantly fewer parameters and computing resources compared to other core architectures.

3. The experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of ReKT in question-based KT tasks and its competitive performance in concept-based KT tasks, showcasing the effectiveness of the proposed model.

### Weaknesses
1. In terms of the methodology, the authors did not provide theoretical analysis about the spatial-temporal complexity of FRU. I hope the authors append such analysis to make the efficiency of their proposal in terms of computing resource more persuasive.

2. In terms of experiment, the authors only presented results in score prediction and computational resource cost. However, as the goal of the KT task is not only to predict students’ score sequences, but also to track the dynamic change of their knowledge states. Therefore, it will be helpful if the authors append such experiments (e.g., case study and visualization of student knowledge states) and use them to explain how their proposal can model student knowledge states better

3. There are some syntax and spelling errors need to be solved, such as the index “I” in the formula of loss function, $Loss_{KT}$. I guess it should be replaced with $t$.

### Questions
1. Can you further explain the design and workflow of the FRU framework? For example, what is the connection between FRU and human cognitive development models, what are inputs, what are learnable parameters and what are outputs? Besides, what does $I_\alpha$ mean in Section 3.4? I cannot find it on Figure 3.

2. In terms of sequence modeling, RNN and LSTM are also simple but effective. What are the advantages of FRU compared to them, especially in the context of knowledge tracing? Does your proposed FRU have the potential to be applied to other areas except for knowledge tracing (e.g., sequential recommendation)?

3. There are some syntax and spelling errors need to be solved, such as the index “I” in the formula of loss function, $Loss_{KT}$. I guess it should be replaced with $t$.
