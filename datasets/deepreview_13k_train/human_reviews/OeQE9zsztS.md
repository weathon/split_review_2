## Abstract
Unlabeled data is a key component of modern machine learning.
In general, the role of unlabeled data is to impose a form of smoothness,
usually from the similarity information encoded in a base kernel, such as the $\epsilon$-neighbor kernel or the adjacency matrix of a graph.
This work revisits the classical idea of spectrally transformed kernel regression (STKR), and provides a new class of general and scalable STKR estimators able to leverage unlabeled data.
Intuitively, via spectral transformation, STKR exploits the data distribution for which unlabeled data can provide additional information.
First, we show that STKR is a principled and general approach, by characterizing a universal type of ``target smoothness'', and proving that any sufficiently smooth function can be learned by STKR.
Second, we provide scalable STKR implementations for the inductive setting and a general transformation function, while prior work is mostly limited to the transductive setting.
Third, we derive statistical guarantees for two scenarios: STKR with a known polynomial transformation,
and STKR with kernel PCA when the transformation is unknown.
Overall, we believe that this work helps deepen our understanding of how to work with unlabeled data,
and its generality makes it easier to inspire new methods.

### Summary
The paper focuses on utilising unlabelled data within the framework of Spectrally Transformed Kernel Regression (STKR). The rough idea is that unlabelled data can be used to infer the smoothness of the kernel. This is achieved by considering spectrally transformed (Mercer) kernels:
$$ K_s(x,y) = \sum_{i=1}^\infty s(\lambda_i) \psi_i(x)\psi_i(y). $$
The form of the transformation $s(\lambda)$ influences the smoothness of the kernel and this is what is learned from the unlabelled data. The paper investigates this theoretically by assuming the target function $f^*$ has a target smoothness constraint $f^* \in \mathcal{H}_t$ and assumes the target smoothness is at least as smooth as the base kernel $\mathcal{H}_t \subset \mathcal{H}_K$. 

Theorem 1 states that under certain conditions, $\mathcal{H}_t$ is the RKHS of a spectrally transformed kernel. This can be viewed as an existence result of a suitable $s$ and so motivates the rest of the paper.

Next, the authors consider the theoretical implications of this and construct algorithms of STKR in two different settings: (1) $s$ is known and (2) $s$ is unknown. Setting (2) is the real-world situation and so is of more practical benefit. 

Setting (1):

The problem here is that $K_s$ may not be computable. Therefore, the authors utilise the unlabelled data to estimate $K_s$ by a Monte-Carlo approximation of the kernels $K^p$, which is $K_s$ with $s(\lambda) = \lambda^p$ (it is assumed that the true $s$ is expressible as a power series). Under this scenario, it is shown that KRR is minimax optimal under exact evaluation of $K_s$ (Theorem 2). The approximation error of using $\hat{K}_s$ over $K_s$ is also shown to be bounded (Theorem 3).

Setting (2):

Firstly, the authors consider $s$ as the inverse regularised Laplacian. This is motivated by the fact that this $s$ has been shown to work well empirically in prior work and can be analysed theoretically.

Next, the authors consider a kernel where the first $d$ eigenfunctions are learned through kernel PCA on the unlabelled data. This is equivalent to STKR with $s$ as a truncation function, all eigenvalues smaller than $\lambda_d$ are eliminated. The authors provide theoretical guarantees that lower bound and upper bound the worst and best case errors respectively.

Main Contributions:
- Establishing STKR as a principled way to utilise unlabelled data, showing that under certain smoothness conditions, a target function must be smooth with respect to a certain Spectrally Transformed Kernel (STK).
- Implementing practicable STKR algorithm in an inductive setting with general transformations, which is more practical than previous transductive approaches. This implementation is scalable, has closed-form formulas for the predictor, and comes with statistical guarantees.
- Developing rigorous theoretical bounds for this general inductive STKR, proving estimation and approximation error bounds, some of which are tight or near-tight.

### Strengths
Overall, I find the paper very good. The authors provide a theoretical framework that unifies previous works of incorporating unlabelled data into learning algorithms. The author's approach, to my knowledge, has not been considered before.

The theoretical results are very interesting. The methodology developed is motivated and justified from the author's theoretical work. The authors developed a rigorous theoretical underpinning for inductive STKR and provide tight statistical learning bounds for prediction errors. This addresses the issue of generalisability in STKR, by offering strong statistical guarantees. Not only this, the methodology is practicable and this is evidenced from the experimental results and computational complexity calculations. 

The paper is very well written and easy to understand. A lot of background material is presented, which contextualises the work. The appendices are also well written and include extensive discussions on related works.

### Weaknesses
The main weakness, in my view, is the lack of a comprehensive empirical investigation.

While the paper does explore the effect of different transformations $s(\lambda)$ and provides a comparison to other methods such as label propagation and kernel PCA, it does not delve deeply into the conditions or characteristics of datasets that would lead to STKR's superior performance. It is probably very difficult to do this theoretically, but a more comprehensive empirical investigation could lead to insights. This could be seen as a limitation in fully understanding the potential and limitations of STKR.

Also, although the experiments cover several datasets, they are all within the realm of graph node classification. Expanding to other types of data could demonstrate the generality of the approach.

While the paper mentions the efficiency of the STKR-Prop, a detailed computational complexity analysis, especially in comparison with other methods, could add more depth to the evaluation of the methodology. 

Finally, I don't see where the regularisation term $\eta$ in SP-Lap is specified within the paper.

### Questions
Can you discuss when the conditions of theorem 1 are satisfied? The conditions being that if $r_{K^p}(f_1) \geq r_{K^p}(f_2)$ for all $p\geq 1$ then $r_t(f_1) \geq r_t(f_2)$. Could there be situations where this condition is violated and so the resulting theory doesn't hold? Does this have any practical consequences?

Could proposition 3 be generalised for other transformations $s(\lambda)$? With $s(\lambda) \geq \lambda$?

Do you have any intuition as to why STKR performance degrades as $p_{test}$ increases? Does this imply scalability issues?

Will the code used in the experiments be provided for reproducibility?

### Summary
This paper considers spectrally transformed kernel regression, a way of performing unsupervised or semi-supervised learning with kernels. Unlabeled data can be leveraged to obtain better estimates of a spectral transformation of the kernel, which can then be used for kernel regression. The paper proposes scalable algorithms to implement STKR for two different types of spectral transformations in the inductive setting, which is more practical than the transductive setting that is often used. Moreover, it provides a characterization of target smoothness of functions and provides theoretical guarantees on how fast such smooth functions can be learned using STKR.

### Strengths
Originality: While STKR itself is apparently well-known, the authors advance the understanding of this method both in algorithmical and theoretical aspects.
Quality: While I have not verified the proofs in the appendix except for Proposition 1, the quality of the results seems to be good.
Clarity: The paper is well-written, in particular it provides many useful comments on the motivation and interpretation of the theoretical results.
Significance: I am not familiar with previous literature on semi-supervised learning with kernels, but judging from the description in the paper, the existence of theoretical guarantees seems to be an advantage compared to previous work, and the introduction of practical algorithms for the inductive setting also appears to be relevant. I am not sure about the practical relevance due to limited experimental results.

### Weaknesses
The experiments are rather limited. First, they are limited to node classification in graphs, which is certainly an interesting class of problems, but it leaves me wondering whether the proposed method, despite its generality, is useful on other types of problems. Moreover, the results are only compared to one competitor method, label propagation. It would be interesting to see
- how the proposed method compares to label propagation in terms of (training and) inference time,
- if there is another known feasible inductive method, how this method compares to STKR,
- how the proposed method compares to other (non-kernel) methods, surely there have to be some deep learning methods for these problems?
Of course, the proposed method is already relevant through its theoretical analysis, but a better experimental evaluation would help to better understand the practical relevance.

The assumptions used in the theoretical analysis appear to be relatively strong compared to what I know from the supervised learning literature, at least when thinking about continuous input spaces rather than graphs. For example, if the base kernel was a Sobolev kernel, the associated RKHS would have to have a smoothness $s > d/2$, which might be unrealistic in high dimensions. In this case, many theoretical results such as the ones in Fischer & Steinwart (2020) allow the target function to lie in an interpolation space that is larger than the RKHS. In the case of this paper, I am wondering whether such an assumption could be sensible, as having higher smoothness than the base kernel appears to be crucial.

Paragraph before Proposition 1: The definition of $\overline{\mathcal{X}}$ is very imprecise. It looks like you are summing inside of $\mathcal{X}$, even though $\mathcal{X}$ might not be a vector space. It is also not clear whether the sums are allowed to be infinite. On the one hand, I would assume them to be finite because you didn't impose any assumptions on the $a_i$. On the other hand, you say later that $\overline{\mathcal{X}}$ is a Banach space, but it wouldn't be complete if you only allowed finite sums. I assume that you would want $\overline{\mathcal{X}}$ to be the space of finite signed measures on $\mathcal{X}$, then the norm / distance could be defined through kernel mean embeddings, and $f(\mu) = \mu_f$ would be the pushforward measure.

Proposition 1 seems to be mathematically elegant, at least when reformulating it with measures as discussed in the previous comment. However, the notion of this "alternative" Lipschitz constant seems rather unintuitive to me, and I am not sure what benefit it brings compared to just using the RKHS norm.

The centeredness assumption on the base kernel is worrying me, as I do not fully understand its practical and theoretical implications. Where is this assumption necessary? I understand that it is necessary for Proposition 1. Is the purpose to make the smoothness notion shift invariant and not having to worry about the constant part of the target function that is not covered by the smoothness $r_t(f)$?

In Theorem 1, it was not fully clear to me whether the assumptions above Section 2.2 are also assumed in the theorem; for example, the assumption $\mathcal{H}_t \subset \mathcal{H}_K$ is repeated in the theorem.

### Questions
**Questions**:
In Example 1, is $K^0(x, x')$ just $\mathrm{tr}(K)$?

Is there a setting in which a provable benefit of semi-supervised learning over supervised learning can be proven?

Could label propagation be made inductive by using it to label the unlabeled "other" set transductively, and then using these pseudo-labels to fit a supervised kernel regression method ("distillation")? How would you expect this to compare to STKR in terms of runtime and accuracy?

In the proposed algorithms, could it be beneficial to use more advanced linear system solvers like the CG method instead of Richardson iteration?

**Minor comments**:
- Section 2, page 2: You write $dp(x)$ in the integral multiple times, but you did not define $p$. You could just write $dP_{\mathcal{X}}(x)$.
- Footnote on page 2: Since $L^1(P_{\mathcal{X}}) \subseteq L^2(P_{\mathcal{X}})$, it is not necessary to assume boundedness for the existence of the expectation. Is boundedness also required for other things?
"$\mathcal{H}_{K_p}$ are also known as interpolation Sobolev spaces": I think from the definition these are known as power spaces, see e.g. [1], although they are often (?) identical to interpolation spaces. In the case where the RKHS of $K$ is a Sobolev space, these are usually also Sobolev spaces, but you did not assume this.
- Small typesetting observation: In Proposition 1, $\overline{\mathrm{Lip}}$ is italic while it is not italic above. Maybe you used \text{Lip} instead of other commands such as \DeclareMathOperator or \operatorname or \mathrm?
- Before Section 2.2, you use the absolute value on $\overline{\mathcal{X}}$, is this supposed to be the total variation norm?
- In Section 3 (page 6), you should explain that $s^{-1}(\lambda) = 1/s(\lambda)$ (if I understand correctly), or perhaps directly write $s(\lambda)^{-1}$. I thought that $s^{-1}$ was the inverse of $s$ until I noticed that it didn't fit with the implementation.

**Summary of discussion:**
While the authors did not extend their experiments much, the theoretical analysis is interesting in its own right and the authors fixed some technical issues and improved some explanations, so I raised my score from 6 to 8.

### Summary
This paper studies regression problems in indusctive and transductive settings. The authors establish that if the target function space satisfies a multiscale smoothness assumption, then its reproducing kernel can be represented using a spectral transformed kernel (STK) of on the original space.  Under inductive settings when the spectral transformation function is known, they arrive at convergence guarantees of the learnt model to that of the true one, and the approximation guarantees for using an estimated kernel. Algorithm(s) SKTR-prop estimate the parameters \alpha when s(\lambda) or s^{-1}(\lambda) is analytical, which are in turn used for the prediction. They also show convergence and approximation bounds when s(\lambda) is not known, while constraining the space using regularized inverse laplacian kernel or top-d components from kernel PCA. They illustrate on node classification tasks comparing well against label prop and kernel ridge regression.

### Strengths
- As the authors mentioned, though STK, STKR are known before, the theoretical results seem original (to the understanding of the reviewer). 

- The regularized laplacian and kernel pca strategies makes good illustration for the applicability of the results, along with the experimental results.

### Weaknesses
 - Though the flow of the paper is neat, the presentation may be improved which may help with reading such dense set of results. For instance, the definitions of the (target)-smoothness may be done clearer.

 - Though the authors mention that the theoretical results seem original, it is not entirely clear how the inductive setting results differ from existing spectral kernel methods. The connection to prior work such as label propagation is not sufficiently delineated, especially in terms of the specific assumptions made and the resulting performance differences.

 - The practical implications of using the regularized Laplacian and kernel PCA for choosing transformation functions are not fully explored. While these methods are known, the paper doesn't provide sufficient guidance on when one should be preferred over the other, or the specific conditions under which they would be expected to perform well.

### Questions
- The laplacian kernel and kernel PCA are known in the literature. In terms of final application, how exactly this work exactly differs in applying them for the problems? Are there other recommendations for choosing the transformation functions for practical use cases ?

- Notation: p is an integer in eqn 7, while a real number in eqn 10. Are they consistent ?

### Summary
The paper presents a universality type result in the context of Spectrally Transformed Kernel Regression (STKR): They show that any target smoothness that preserves multiscale smoothness can be encoded by a spectrally transformed kernel (theorem1).

The goal of the work is use unlabelled data in encoding the target smoothness and then perform (ridge) regression over labelled data. Accordingly, in the case the spectral transform is known, they propose to perform a montecarlo estimation of the STK using labelled as well as unlabelled examples and perform STKR using labelled samples. For this methodology both estimation and approximation errors are bounded (theorem2,3). Implementation details are also discussed.

For the case the transform is not known, they propose following a commonly used two stage process: self-supervised learning using unlabelled samples to learn a d-dim representation. Then, perform ridge regression using the labelled examples under the learnt representation. Again, theorem4,5 provide the estimation and approximation errors. Interestingly, the approximation is shown to be tight (theorem 5& prop5), proving that this methodoloy is no worse than the original proposal of STKR.

Simulations results on few benchmarks are provided.

### Strengths
1. I think theorem 1 is insightful and provides perhaps a first universality kind of result connecting smoothness and RKHS.

2. Theorem 5 is also interesting and seems to improve over current bounds i.e., Zhai et.al. 2023.

### Weaknesses
questions section

1. Proposition 1 assumes functions extended to \bar{X}. But what if X itself is a vector space? then this extension basically means we are considering only linear functions over X. So proposition 1 would be restricted to linear functions over X. Am I missing something? Since prop1 is used in theorem 1, perhaps this is an issue?

Minor comments:
1. pg3 "p" is used as exponent as well as likelihood.

### Summary
This work stands at the crossroads of kernel learning and regression, in close connection with manifold learning. The contribution is presented as a novel theory to incorporate both unlabeled and labeled data into the resolution of the regression task (see our comments).  The authors propose to address an inductive regression estimation problem with the additional assumption that the target function satisfies a smoothness constraint defined with respect to a given Mercer kernel-induced metric. A key result of the paper is that the target is proved to be attainable within a RKHS based on a spectrally transformed kernel (say $H_{K_s}$).
Empirically this problem can be handled with the choice of a single regularization term that writes as a variance term in the RKHS H_{K_s}.
The authors then propose two novel (closed-form) estimators that rely on both kernel and representation coefficients learning. In the first setting, the user is supposed to know exactly the spectral transformation of the eigenvalues at work in the spectrally transformed kernel built from the eigenvalues of the original base kernel. A computable kernel $\hat{K}_s$ is recursively built and a closed-form solution is provided for the empirical ridge regression problem in the RKHS associated with the approximate kernel. This novel estimator comes with an minimax optimal excess risk bound. In the second setting, a (two-step) transform-agnostic estimator is proposed with $K_s$ defined as the inverse Laplacian and a finite feature map representation based on kernel PCA applied on unlabeled data. The novel estimator is also studied at the lens of an excess risk bound. Numerical experiments complete the picture with a comparison of  the STKR different variants to Label-Propagation.

### Strengths
*Overall, the paper proposes a rich framework that tackles both representation learning and regression estimation within RKHSs. It follows a long line of research linked to manifold learning in a transductive or inductive way and a spectral approach to kernel learning. The works presented here are substantial with a solid theoretical back up and extensive discussions. I appreciate the elegance of the approach that inherently incorporates into the joint choice of the regularization term  (variance) and the kernel choice the smoothness contraints without leveraging the two regularization terms usually at work in manifold learning. It is a pleasant paper to read, even if it is dense.

*The proposed framework can be naturally applied to transductive or inductive setting, the latter being the most interesting.
Overall the work shed slight on how kernel learning can be considered in a systematic and powerful way for a general regression problem leveraging unlabeled and labeled data.
* The work appears as original and rather well written even if the writing can still be improved.

### Weaknesses
 * Please note that my score is currently 7
* Claims: it is stated in the abstract and in the paper many times, that this contribution provides a unifyied theory for learning with unlabeled data and a base kernel. I think this message does not hold and is misleading for the reader. I consider that the paper provides a novel class of regression estimators able to exploit labeled and unlabeled data by considering that the right space to work in is the RKHS associated to a Spectrally transformed kernel or its approximation.
*I am surprised that the discussion in page 3 takes classic kernel ridge regression as a reference method while manifold learning with Laplacian regularization (in addition to $\ell_2$ norm ) would be more interesting to discuss here : see Belkin et al. 2006 JMLR to be cited (other papers of Belkin are cited, though)
Belkin, M., Niyogi, P., & Sindhwani, V. (2006). Manifold regularization: A geometric framework for learning from labeled and unlabeled examples. Journal of machine learning research, 7(11).
In particular, the example discussed in figure 1 could have been solved with manifold learning. 
at this stage of the paper, I see the advantage of defining the right regularization term with the right kernel to empower the RKHS with the good smoothness properties. However I am a bit confused then by example 1 given in page 7.
* In Example 1 page 7 (Inverse laplacian), I am interested in a discussion about the pros and cons of the proposed method where $K_s$ is defined as a combination of two kernels with a hyperamater eta that seems to play a similar  role that the weight controlling the importance of $\ell_2$ norm and the Laplacian smoothness penalty. Here, I don't see how one can take into account the dependency of the excess risk on this "hidden" parameter.
* originality: the paper resembles a bit to the recent work of Zhai et al. (2023) and it should be interested to highlight the differences; I will advise the authors not to go to far in the direction of data augmentation to strengthen the differences.
* the paper is very dense and clarity can be improved. Some suggestions:
Please provide a table (can be in the first page of the supplements) with a reminder of all the notations for the various kernels, $K_s$, $K^p$, \tilde{f}, \hat{f}, ..
* clearly state when you introduce the intuition and then formally state the theoretical results, there is a mix of evreything all along the paper which makes the paper sometimes difficult to read
* in experimental results (last page): complete the legend so that the reader can see what is the used criterion here (accuracy with a post-processing of the regression estimation outputs).

### Questions
* There is no discussion about the base kernel K upon which the spectrally-transformed kernel is built. How to choose it ?
* finally to improve the clarity of the paper: 
- please clearly state when you introduce the intuition and then formally state the theoretical results, there is a mix of evreything all along the paper which makes the paper sometimes difficult to read?
- express more clearly Theorem 1: how is defined r_t prior to the conclusion: only a function from $L^2(P_X)$ to $\mathbb{R}$ ?
- explain the importance of centering the functions or alternatively using a "variance term" as a penalty.
- give the analytic complexity in time of the algorithms
- in the experiments provide the behaviour of Mainfold learning (Belkin et al. 2006), especially the closed-form with ridge and laplacian regularisation.

I have read the author's rebuttal and am satisfied the answers. I increase my score from 7 to 8.
