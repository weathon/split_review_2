- Decision: Reject
- Scores: 5, 3, 5

## Abstract
{Identifying relations between objects is crucial for understanding the semantics of a visual scene. It is also an essential step in order to bridge visual and language models. However, current state-of-the-art computer vision models still lack the ability to perform spatial reasoning well. Existing datasets mostly cover a relatively small number of spatial relations, all of which are static relations that do not intrinsically involve motion. In this paper, we propose the \textbf{S}patial and \textbf{T}emporal \textbf{U}nderstanding of \textbf{P}repositions \textbf{D}ataset (\textbf{STUPD}) -- a large-scale video dataset for understanding spatial and temporal relationships derived from prepositions of the English language. The dataset contains 150K visual depictions (videos and images), consisting of 30 static and dynamic spatial prepositions, in the form of object interaction simulations generated synthetically. In addition to spatial relations, we also propose 50K visual depictions across 10 temporal relations, consisting of videos depicting event/time-point interactions. To our knowledge, no dataset exists that represents temporal relations through visual settings. In this dataset, we also provide 3D information about object interactions such as frame-wise coordinates, and descriptions of the objects used. The goal of this synthetic dataset is to help models perform better in visual relationship detection in real-world settings. We demonstrate an increase in the performance of various models over 2 real-world datasets (ImageNet-VidVRD and Spatial Senses) when pretrained on the spatial STUPD dataset, and over the Kinetics-400 dataset on the temporal STUPD dataset, in comparison to other pretraining datasets.}

### Summary
This papers proposes STUPD dataset, which addresses the lack of diversity in prepositions in existing datasets and the absence of dynamic prepositions that involve motion. It consists of 150K images and videos capturing 30 spatial relations and 50K video sets depicting 10 temporal relations, all with 3D info and bounding box annotations. Authors claim that pre-training on STUPD can significantly improve performance on real-world visual reasoning tasks.

### Strengths
1. Addresses a gap in existing datasets by including a wider variety of prepositions and introducing dynamic prepositions.
2. Provides a synthetic dataset with both spatial and temporal relations, which is crucial for a more holistic understanding of visual reasoning.
3. Demonstrates the real-world applicability of the dataset through pre-training improvements on visual reasoning tasks.
Weaknesses:

### Weaknesses
1. The synthetic data may not fully capture the complexity of real-world scenarios. Specifically, the controlled nature of the simulation might not account for the variability in lighting, object appearance, and occlusions present in real-world images and videos. The physics engine, while ensuring natural interactions, might not replicate the full range of physical phenomena that can influence spatial and temporal relationships.
2. The paper could benefit from a more extensive validation of the dataset's efficacy across a broader range of models and tasks. The current evaluation primarily focuses on pre-training for visual reasoning tasks. It would be beneficial to see how models trained on STUPD perform on other tasks such as action recognition, video captioning, or even tasks that require more fine-grained understanding of spatial relationships, such as robotic manipulation.

### Questions
1. How well do models trained on STUPD perform when applied to real-world data, considering the dataset is synthetic?
2. How does STUPD handle ambiguous or context-dependent prepositions where the spatial or temporal relationship might not be clear-cut?
3. What measures are in place to ensure that the synthetic data in STUPD is diverse and representative of real-world scenarios?

### Summary
Identifying temporal relationships, compared to the spatial relationship counterpart, has less attention in the field of computer vision so far. Thus, the authors are focused on generating a dataset that focuses on both spatial and temporal reasoning. Though the motivation sounds great to the researchers in this community, it is hard to understand why the temporal relationship should designed in the way the author presents. Also, it is hard to find how the temporal dataset could be used for other real-world tasks.

### Strengths
The main motivation for the dataset creation, which focuses on both spatial and temporal reasoning, is clear, and the dataset comparison table (Table 1) helps the readers understand the landscape of the field. Also, applying the dataset to two spatial real-world tasks with multiple baseline models also well-represents the effectiveness of this dataset. Lastly, visualization of the dataset helps the reader understand what the dataset looks like.

### Weaknesses
Although this dataset (partially) focused on temporal relationships, it is hard to understand why such categorization (in Figure 2) is valid. Also, I failed to find any experiment employing the STUTD dataset to improve the performance on real-world *temporal* relationship tasks. Apart from the main content, this manuscript may violate Sections 2 and 4.1 of the ICLR 2024 author's guidelines.

[Major]

A. Lack of use of the STUPD dataset as a temporal reasoning pretraining set. Unlike what the authors mentioned at the end of Section 4.2, there is a lot of video-based work that focuses on temporal reasoning. For instance, many datasets [1,2,3,4] exist in the video question-answering domain. It would be better to employ some models that try to resolve the tasks suggested by such datasets.

B. Reason for splitting the temporal relationship into ten categories. Based on what the author said, "before" is a subset of "by," "while" is a subset of "during," and "since" is a subset of "at" (from 1st para of Sec 3.4.2). Also, I don't think "by" (which implies a deadline) is used to describe the timing of two events in general. At least from my end, it is natural to say, "Turn in the assignment by midnight" instead of "Cut off the corners of the bread by the time you apply jam on the bread," for example. The author also mentioned 'redundant representation' in Section 2.1; in this regard, I failed to find any reason for keeping potentially redundant classes. Isn't it more natural to compress the classes into 7 instead of 10? If the author firmly believes a 10-class setting is much more meaningful, then I think it would be better to have an experiment in A but present the result with 7-class pretraining and 10-class pretraining.

C. Clarity. In the #1 callout in Sec 3.4.1, the author pointed out that 'track' and 'tunnel' have fewer relationships than other object types. Why did such a case happen? Is it because of the limitation of the Unity3D platform, or is it because all the relationships came from another dataset?


[Minor]

A. Formatting
- \citet and \citep are different. Please carefully check the ICLR 2024 author's guidelines; It is improperly used in over 80% of the manuscript.
- The author frequently used  "<" and ">" without any escape character. Thereby, those symbols are repeatedly presented as flipped '!' and '?' characters throughout the text.

B. Typo
- 2nd line of 2nd para of Intro (...in space of time" **pre**. Examples of...): I cannot understand what **pre** is for.
- 50,000 uses the middle comma, but 5000 doesn't (always?) throughout the text.

### Summary
The paper proposes a new synthetic dataset: the Spatial and Temporal Understanding of Prepositions Dataset (STUPD). It is a large-scale video dataset for understanding spatial and temporal relationships. The dataset contains 150K visual depictions consisting of 30 static and dynamic spatial prepositions and 50K visual depictions across 10 temporal relations.
The synthetic dataset helps models perform better in visual relationship detection in real-world settings, verified on 2 real-world datasets: ImageNet-VidVRD and Spatial Senses.

### Strengths
The proposed dataset STUPD makes contributions to relation reasoning: 
- It covers diverse spatial and temporal relations: 30 spatial prepositions and 10 temporal prepositions
- It elaborates on the spatial relations that intrinsically involve motion
- It is a large-scale dataset

Experiments show that pretraining on STUPD increases performance on real-world visual reasoning tasks.

### Weaknesses
1. Details missing about the evaluation of  STUPD pre-training. From the suppl Sec.A.8.2, the SpatialSense/ImageNet-VidVRD experiment only covers 6/10 spatial relations.
    - I have not found details about which relations have been conducted experiments on. ImageNet-VidVRD defines 132 predicates. Some of them are "static"  but not "dynamic" spatial relations. Also, the spatial relations are connected with verbs e.g., swim_behind, and fly_behind. It is not clear howto handle the different definitions of spatial relations during pre-training. Specifically, it's unclear if the model is trained to distinguish between 'behind' as a static spatial relation and 'swim_behind' as a dynamic one, or if they are treated as the same relation during pre-training. The paper should clarify how these verb-specific relations are mapped to the 30 defined spatial prepositions, and whether the model is learning a general 'behind' concept or a more specific 'swim_behind' concept.
    - There are some uncovered spatial prepositions among the 30 defined spatial relations. It seems that they have been collected but not evaluated. Since STUPD is a synthetic dataset that suffers from huge gaps with real-world images. It is important to verify its effectiveness on real-world tasks. The lack of evaluation on all 30 spatial prepositions raises concerns about the generalizability of the findings. It's crucial to demonstrate that the pre-training benefits extend to all the relations defined in STUPD, not just a subset. The paper should include experiments that evaluate the performance on all 30 spatial prepositions to fully validate the dataset's utility.

2. I wonder about the necessity of prosing a new task of temporal relations. Their definition is detailed in Fig.2. Instead of a specific model to reason these temporal relations, it seems that we can directly apply temporal segmentation of each event and then compare the two segmented time stamps. For example, to judge ”A before B”, we first get the temporal segmentation A: $[t_1, t_2]$, B:$[t_3,t_4]$; if $t_2 \textless t_3$, then we say “A before B”. The paper does not adequately justify why a dedicated model is needed for temporal relation reasoning when a simple time-stamp comparison could suffice. The proposed temporal relations seem to be easily solvable with basic temporal segmentation, and it is not clear what additional value the proposed model brings beyond this.
