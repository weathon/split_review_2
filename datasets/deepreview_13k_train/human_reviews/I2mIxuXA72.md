# Understanding Domain Generalization: A Noise Robustness Perspective

- Decision: Accept
- Scores: 5, 3, 6, 5

## Abstract
Despite the rapid development of machine learning algorithms for domain generalization (DG), there is no clear empirical evidence that the existing DG algorithms outperform the classic empirical risk minimization (ERM) across standard benchmarks. To better understand this phenomenon, we investigate whether there are benefits of DG algorithms over ERM through the lens of label noise.
Specifically, our finite-sample analysis reveals that label noise exacerbates the effect of spurious correlations for ERM, undermining generalization. 
Conversely, we illustrate that DG algorithms exhibit implicit label-noise robustness during finite-sample training even when spurious correlation is present.
Such desirable property helps mitigate spurious correlations and improve generalization in synthetic experiments. 
However, additional comprehensive experiments on real-world benchmark datasets indicate that label-noise robustness does not necessarily translate to better performance compared to ERM. 
We conjecture that the failure mode of ERM arising from spurious correlations may be less pronounced in practice

### Summary
As many previous studies have numerically demonstrated, no domain generalization method clearly outperforms the empirical risk minimization in general. This study investigates when and why DG methods better generalize than the empirical risk minimization and vice versa, through the lens of label-noise and subpopulation shifts. Particularly, the authors demonstrate the empirical risk minimization's tendency to learn spurious correlations (or domain-specific features) rather than invariant features for overparameterized models determined by both degrees of spurious correlation and label noise. Moreover, the authors also investigated that some domain generalization methods can learn invariant features over spurious correlations, resulting in better generalizability in the presence of noisy labels. Extensive numerical experiments were provided.

### Strengths
- Theoretical analysis on when and why the domain generalization methods perform better or worse than the empirical risk minimization has rarely been studied. This paper provides a concrete and interesting one.
- Well-written and easy to follow. Assumptions for the analysis have been made clear.

### Weaknesses
 - The analyses provided in this study are based on a linear setting, assuming that we have disjoint sets of invariant, spurious, and nuisance predictors. This seems to be a reasonable assumption for theoretical analysis. However, in real-world cases, we might not be able to have such disjoint sets of predictors. For example, in the computer vision tasks given in the experimental study, it is not straightforward that we have such predictors unless a neural network learns such appropriate representations, which I think is hardly possible.
- Even for tabular data, we might need a proper transformation to have such ideal sets of predictors.
- So, such difficulty in having an appropriate representation might be responsible for the failure of the noise robustness to translate to better generalizability in the experimental study.
- In short, the theory is sound, however, the conclusion from the experimental study is not fully convincing, and seems to need further exploration.

### Questions
- I think a simpler simulation scenario, such as the linear case given in Section 4.1, might be more appropriate to demonstrate the theory. As mentioned in the weaknesses, the computer vision scenarios presented in the experimental study, require an ideal feature extractor that can provide invariant, spurious, and nuisance features. However, there is no guarantee that such representations were learned. 
- The authors might need an ideal feature extractor that provides the disjoint sets of invariant, spurious, and nuisance predictors or a proxy of such extractor to demonstrate the hypothesis. 
- It seems like the overall problem setting is also relevant to the fairness problem. Is there any relevant study from algorithmic fairness literature that the authors know of?
- Is it possible to extend the discussion in Section 4, which is focused on subpopulation shift, to analyze the domain shift? Particularly, for the cases where the ERM or DG might fail.

### Summary
This paper explores whether the Domain Generalization (DG) algorithm outperforms the classic Empirical Risk Minimization (ERM) algorithm in the presence of labeled noise, and why.

### Strengths
S1. The writing expression of this paper is relatively clear, but it is still not standardized enough, such as Eqn 1 should be written as Eqn (1).

S2. The research motivation of this paper is to explore the effectiveness of DG compared to ERM under labeled noise settings. This is positive for the study of DG, after all, there is no clear empirical evidence that the existing DG algorithms perform the classic ERM across standard benchmarks.

### Weaknesses
W1. The failure of validation on real data is pessimistic, which seriously reduces the importance of the settings discussed in this paper, as real data does not fit well with simple noise settings. Specifically, the paper's analysis focuses on a simplified noise model, such as uniform label noise, which may not accurately reflect the complexities of real-world label corruption. The lack of strong empirical support on real-world datasets raises concerns about the practical applicability of the theoretical findings. It is unclear how the insights gained from the controlled synthetic experiments translate to more realistic scenarios with complex, non-uniform noise distributions.

W2. The main theoretical results of this paper have poor readability. The conclusion described in Theorem 4.2 is not very intuitive. It is difficult to associate this principle with the main contributions described in the abstract of this paper. The theorem's statement and proof lack clear connections to the high-level claims about label noise and spurious correlations. The paper does not adequately explain how the mathematical conditions in the theorem relate to the practical behavior of ERM and DG algorithms under noisy labels. The link between the theorem's formalisms and the intuitive understanding of the problem is weak, making it hard to grasp the significance of the theoretical result.

### Questions
Q1. I would like to know the relationship between Theorem 4.2 and "Specifically, our finite-sample analysis reveals that label noise exacerbates the effect of spurious correlations for ERM, undermining generalization. Conversely, we illustrate that DG algorithms exhibit implicit label-noise robustness during finite-sample training even when spurious correlation is present." in the abstract? How does this theorem reflect label noise?

### Summary
This study offers a thorough exploration, both theoretically and empirically, to ascertain the situations where Domain Generalization (DG) algorithms outperform Empirical Risk Minimization (ERM) counterparts. The findings reveal that DG algorithms exhibit greater resilience in the presence of label noise during subpopulation shifts. On the other hand, ERM approaches tend to be susceptible to capitalizing on spurious correlations, particularly in overparameterized models. The study backs these observations with a blend of theoretical insights and empirical evidence.

### Strengths
S1 -The paper upholds a commendable level of clarity in its exposition, effectively conveying intricate ideas in an easily comprehensible fashion. Its tone is suitably professional, aligning with the subject matter, which contributes to a satisfying reading experience. The structural organization into subsections facilitates navigation and swift access to specific information. Furthermore, the notation employed is consistently precise, enabling readers to grasp the mathematical elements of the paper with ease. Notably, the theoretical statements are  thoughtfully elucidated through illustrative examples and substantiated by empirical findings.

S2 - The claims presented in the paper are substantiated through a combination of theoretical and empirical evidence. 

S3 - The paper's commitment to reproducibility is highly commendable. The detailed and transparent presentation of the experimental setup, data sources, and code availability significantly enhances the reliability and trustworthiness of the research findings.

S4 - This paper thoroughly explores different scenarios for empirical validation and uses a diverse set of datasets (i.e, classification tasks). The authors have selected datasets that are commonly featured in the existing literature on this research topic.

### Weaknesses
W1 - The section discussing related work appears somewhat limited. Domain generalization is a machine learning technique designed to train models for effective performance on unfamiliar data originating from multiple domains or distributions. As such, it covers a broad and diverse research landscape, accommodating various scenarios and types of data shift. To enhance reader comprehension and provide a more thorough context, it would be beneficial for the authors to initiate with a comprehensive overview of domain generalization before delving into the specific scenario they focus on, which involves challenges such as label noise, spurious correlation, and subpopulation shifts. This approach can mitigate potential misunderstandings and offer a more holistic understanding for the readers.

W2 -  The paper primarily presents an empirical analysis, and it is commendable that the authors have incorporated a diverse set of datasets, which enhances the generalizability of their findings. However, it's worth noting that the diversity observed in the choice of datasets is not reflected in the selection of Domain Generalization (DG) methods considered for the analysis. In order to strengthen the general statements proposed in the paper, it would be valuable to expand the range of DG algorithms under examination. This broader inclusion of methods can further validate and reinforce the claims made in the paper, offering a more comprehensive view of the research landscape.

W3 - The experiments of the paper are limited to tasks related to image classification, with no inclusion of other types of data, such as tabular data. This focus on image classification tasks allows the authors to delve deeply into this specific domain and gain insights relevant to this context. However, it's important to note that the findings and conclusions may not be directly applicable to other data types or domains, and this limitation should be kept in mind when interpreting the results.

W4 - Section 5 only provides a description of IRM, but it would be valuable to have a more extensive discussion about other methods as well.

### Questions
Q1 - Can your theoretical framework comprehensively explain all domain generalization methods that address subpopulation shift and spurious correlations, or are there any inherent limitations?

Q2 - What motivated the selection of the methods used in the experimental section? Why were these particular methods chosen?

### Summary
This paper theoretically analyzes the benefits of the DG algorithm over ERM from the perspective of noise robustness. Label noise increases the model’s dependence on the spurious features of ERM. In contrast, DG algorithms have better label-noise robustness with the regularization which prevents capturing spurious correlation.

### Strengths
1. The authors theoretically analyze the benefits of the DG algorithm over ERM from the perspective of noise robustness.
2. Experimental results show that DG algorithms are more robust to label noise memorization.
3. The authors provide discussions about why noise robustness couldn’t lead to better performance of the DG algorithm in practical scenarios.

### Weaknesses
1.	My primary concern relates to the assumption of linear separability, as it can be challenging to meet this condition in real-world settings, especially when the invariant features are sparse. The assumption that the data is linearly separable in the absence of noise is a strong one, and the paper does not adequately address how deviations from this assumption would impact the theoretical results. Furthermore, the assumption of orthogonal invariant and spurious features is also a significant limitation. In real-world scenarios, these features are likely to be correlated, and the analysis should consider the impact of non-orthogonal feature spaces. The paper needs a more general analysis that accounts for non-linear separability and non-orthogonal features to support the main idea.

2.	In practical scenarios, the minimum-norm classifier may not be the most suitable choice, which implies that Thm4.2 may not be applicable. The theoretical analysis relies heavily on the implicit bias of gradient descent towards minimum-norm solutions. However, practical training often involves early stopping, regularization techniques, and non-linear models, which can deviate from this bias. The paper should discuss the limitations of this assumption and provide a more robust analysis that accounts for these practical considerations.

3.	The theorem does not sufficiently prove the ideas presented in this paper. Thm4.2 only suggests that the ERM algorithm favors spurious features over invariant ones, which leads to poor generalization performance. However, for the DG algorithm, the authors only incorporate a regularization term and analyze the gradient with varying lambda. No formal theorem is there to demonstrate the superior performance of the DG algorithm. The analysis of the DG algorithm is incomplete, and a more rigorous theoretical justification is needed to support the claim that it is more robust to label noise.

4.	The crucial information is not expressed clearly. In page 4, how comes "the classifier become either $w_spu$ or $w_inv$"?  Is it an assumption or is it a mathematically grounded result? I think the authors should justify such an extreme claim. The paper lacks clarity in explaining how the classifier is forced to choose between spurious and invariant features. The transition from the general classifier to either $w_{spu}$ or $w_{inv}$ needs a more detailed explanation with clear mathematical backing.

5.	The description of the Lemma C.1 is unclear. The Lemma measures the cost of memorizing a mislabeled or non-spuriously correlated sample. Based on the derivation process, it should be a conclusion that holds with high probability, but the lemma presents it deterministically. The deterministic presentation of Lemma C.1 is misleading, and the paper should explicitly state that the result holds with high probability, as suggested by the derivation process. This lack of precision undermines the rigor of the analysis.

6.	The absence of mathematical symbol definitions in this paper reduces its readability. Some of the symbols are not described (just mentioned) in this paper. If possible, give their mathematical definitions. The paper's readability is hampered by the lack of clear definitions for all mathematical symbols. The authors should provide a comprehensive list of symbol definitions to ensure that the paper is accessible to a wider audience.

7.	The experiments do not effectively support the theorem. In the experiment section, I recommend that the authors discuss the values of the weights' norms, such as $w^{(inv)}_{inv}$, $w^{(spu)}_{spu}$, $w^{(inv)}$, and $w^{(spu)}$, to further support the proof of Thm4.2. The experimental section lacks a thorough analysis of the weights' norms, which is crucial for validating the theoretical claims. The authors should include a detailed discussion of these norms to provide empirical support for their theoretical findings.

### Questions
1.	In all tables in experiments, the authors should add references to Mixeup, GroupDRO, IRM, VREx.
2.	The author should provide another theorem to illustrate that the classifier with a smaller norm becomes more favored by the model.
3.	The authors should provide further explanations on the regularization term in the practical surrogate. This should include an explanation of why it has this specific form and why it incorporates first-order derivatives.
