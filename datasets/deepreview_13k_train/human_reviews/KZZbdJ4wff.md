# PRO: Pseudo-label Regularized Optimization on Unlabeled Test Data

- Decision: Reject
- Scores: 6, 3, 3, 3

## Abstract
Web-scale foundation models like CLIP have impressive zero-shot capabilities on many downstream classification tasks, but they still underperform target domain-specific supervised classifiers. This inspired researchers to investigate adaptation strategies that take advantage of unlabeled data, often via pseudolabeling. However, previous methods for adaptation can be difficult to train; poor hyperparameter choices can result in catastrophic collapses in accuracy, and absent target labels, there is little to guide the search with. In this paper, we propose Pseudo-label Regularized Optimization (PRO), which addresses the collapses in test-time adaptation without any label peeking for hyperparameter tuning.  On the 18 datasets addressed in our experiments PRO improves the accuracy of ViT-B-32 by 2.5\% on average and in the best case by 6.1\% from tuning the textual encoder. Our code is available at \url{https://github.com/anonWAEWA/PRO}.

### Summary
The paper introduces PRO (Pseudo-label Regularized Optimization) as a solution to the common problem of model accuracy declines during test-time adaptation using pseudo-labeling techniques. PRO combines ideas from test-time training and semi-supervised learning, offering an effective approach to improve model adaptation without the need for hyperparameter tuning. Specifically, PRO employs a combination of a pseudo-label based surrogate loss and a standard surrogate loss, with a regularization parameter, to guide the model's adaptation. Experimental results on 18 datasets demonstrate that PRO enhances the accuracy of the ViT-B-32 model by an average of 2.5% and up to 6.1%, showcasing its practical utility in addressing this challenge.

### Strengths
Originality:

The proposed method, PRO, attempts to address the typical decline in model accuracy during test-time adaptation by using heavily regularized pseudo-labeling methods which I see as a novel solution.

Quality:

The paper conducts rigorous experiments with 18 datasets to illustrate the challenges of model adaptation and demonstrate the effectiveness of the PRO method in preventing model accuracy collapses by utilizing different existing methods related to effective pseudo labeling that are marginal consistency, test entropy minimization, and label accumulation.

Clarity:

The paper is clear in presenting its problem statement, proposed method, and experimental findings, with nice plots that highlight the research's key insights and contributions.

Significance:

This research holds significant practical value for real-life applications where acquiring labels is expensive but acquiring unlabeled examples is cheap. This work addresses a critical issue in the adaptation of large pre-trained models towards specific domains given few labeled examples.

### Weaknesses
- My biggest concern is the lack of mean and standard deviation in the reported results to see if the results are significant. This would require repeating the experiments multiple times.

- My other concern is the novelty seems limited as it simple utilizes multiple existing methods for regularizing pseudo-labeling marginal which are consistency, test entropy minimization, and label accumulation.

- Another concern is the lack of generalization to other tasks like image segmentation and text-related problems which have become high in demand these days.

- An additional concern is that the authors are using ImageNet pretrained model which has been pre-trained on millions of images that share similar classes as the ones given by the unlabeled set - to me it doesn't seem like this work would strictly fit within the low-data learning framework.

### Summary
Considering that a pre-trained model performs poorly in an unknow test environment, practitioners hope to use these unlabeled test data to improve model performance in this specific domain, also called **test-time training (TTT)** task. 
The core of this TTT task lies in how to performhigh-quality pseudo labelling, that is, while improving the performance of the target domain, we must get rid of these following constraints: *1)-the hyperparameters of the method*, *2)-the type of pretrained models*, and *3)-the nature of the distribution shifts*. 
For this purpose, this paper proposed **pseudo-label regularized optimization (PRO)**, a strategy that comprise of a set of regularization method for TTT to avoid catastrophic collapse and improve model performance. 
Experiments on VIT-B-32 and ViT-L-14-336 models confirmed the success of the method.

### Strengths
[1] The **starting point** of this research is **great**. 
Especially now that the pre-training paradigm is popular, how to use unlabeled data to improve the zero-shot capability of the model in the target domain is deemly important to the AI ​​community. 

[2] The entire paper is **well laid out** and **easy to understand**. 
The formulas and diagram in the *Sec 3. Problem Setup* allowed me to quickly understand the problems that the TTT task wanted to solve. 

[3] The **experiment** appears to be **well designed** and **executed**.

### Weaknesses
1. Pro is a combination of existing mature methods, with **incremental originality**. 
The methods described in Sec.4 are all existing methods and seem to be background descriptions. 
I did not find a detailed description of PRO. As the authors write in the methods and conclusions, PRO is a cherry-picked combination of existing heuristic methods through ablation experiments. 

2. The **experimental results** of the paper are **not convincing enough**. 
First of all, PRO-CLIP in Figure 3 has little performance gains on commonly used image datasets. 
Secondly, PRO is a cherry-picked combination of existing methods. Without the support of convincing experimental results, it is difficult to verify its effectiveness. 
The authors could consider performing extensive experiments in additional text modalities, which I believe is fully achievable with a CLIP-based approach.

3. This article seems to be a relatively complete **experimental report**. 
The author can choose to submit it to the official-themed workshop. 

4. Some trivial tips: 
    
    - You can consider displaying the experimental results in the form of figures and tables to facilitate readers to understand more quickly what the experiment is trying to express/prove.

    - The sketch of PRO in Fig.2 is not intuitive enough. Let people understand the composition of the entire method as soon as possible.

    - ‘’Text Tower'' needs a clear explanation.

### Summary
The authors note that prior approaches to test-time adaptation, which involve training on unlabeled test data, are often challenging to execute due to the sensitivity to hyperparameter selection, with suboptimal choices potentially leading to reductions in accuracy. To alleviate this issue, this paper introduces Pseudo-label Regularized Optimization (PRO), a strategy that combines various established techniques to mitigate the mentioned difficulties.

### Strengths
- This paper is well-written and easy to understand. It highlights the existing challenge where a neural model could fail due to the selection of suboptimal hyperparameters in test time training settings.
- The proposed PRO method is simple and demonstrates its efficacy in tuning CLIP models for visual data tasks.

### Weaknesses
 - My primary concern is with the novelty of the proposed method PRO. The issue that the paper addresses was initially noted in [1], and it appears that PRO is essentially a combination of several pre-existing approaches.
- The authors have neglected to benchmark PRO against other related test-time adaptation methods employing semi-supervised learning strategies, such as self-training [2]. 
- The efficacy of PRO seems limited to specific architectures; it yields noticeable improvements when applied to VIT models but is virtually ineffective with ResNet architectures, resulting in a marginal improvement of only 0.1% (See Appendix B).

### Summary
This paper studies test time training methods, which may catastrophically collapse sometimes. This paper empirically tests various existing test time training methods that try to prevent collapse and re-evaluate their effectiveness and validity. By combining those methods based on the extensive insights for several datasets, experiments show that the proposed method can safely improve performance with test time training in most of datasets.

### Strengths
- Related works are re-investigated thoroughly and lessons from them are provided.

### Weaknesses
 - Just combining existing methods, by trying everything and finding a good combination, might not be considered novel.
- While this paper empirically validates which setups/parameters are useful for test time training, it does not provide theoretical understanding on why they do not collapse.
- Details of algorithm (PRO) are missing. It is unclear how the loss functions are combined.

### Questions
- Can all experiment/analysis results of section 5 be included in appendix? While Section 5 contains various insights from experiments, full experiment setup and results are omitted.
- What’s the failure mode of the suggested method other than class imbalance?
- Can it be shown that PRO is effective in setups other than CLIP?
