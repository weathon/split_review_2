# A Change of Heart: Backdoor Attacks on Security-Centric Diffusion Models

- Decision: Reject
- Scores: 6, 5, 6, 5

## Abstract
Diffusion models have been employed as defensive tools to reinforce the security of other models, notably in purifying adversarial examples and certifying adversarial robustness. Meanwhile, the prohibitive training costs often make the use of pre-trained diffusion models an attractive practice. The tension between the intended use of these models and their unvalidated nature raises significant security concerns that remain largely unexplored. To bridge this gap, we present DIFF2, a novel backdoor attack tailored to security-centric diffusion models. Essentially, DIFF2 superimposes a diffusion model with a malicious diffusion-denoising process, guiding inputs embedded with specific triggers toward an adversary-defined distribution, while preserving the normal process for other inputs. Our case studies on adversarial purification and robustness certification show that DIFF2 substantially diminishes both post-purification and certified accuracy across various benchmark datasets and diffusion models, highlighting the potential risks of utilizing pre-trained diffusion models as defensive tools. We further explore possible countermeasures, suggesting promising avenues for future research.

### Summary
This paper discusses the security associated with using pre-trained diffusion models. Diffusion models are commonly used to enhance the security of other models by purifying adversarial examples and certifying adversarial robustness. The authors propose a novel backdoor attack called DIFF2, which guides inputs embedded with specific triggers towards an adversary-defined distribution. The diffusion model, after being attacked, can generate adversarial examples that mislead the classifier. Comprehensive studies show the effectiveness of the proposed method.

### Strengths
1. The paper is well-structured and easy to understand.
2. Previous works use diffusion model to defend the adversarial attack. For this work, they use poisoned diffusion model to generate adversarial input which is able to mislead the classifier. 
3. Transferability of the proposed attack method is also provided. 
4. From the experiments, the propose attack effectiveness and utility perform well.

### Weaknesses
1. I'm not concern about the technical part but the practical scenario. I'm uncertain about the practicality of using diffusion models to generate adversarial input. 
2. Users may notice unusual patterns in the purified images, as illustrated in Figure 3.
3. If using the DDIM or other samplers, is the generated adversarial images consistently influence the classifier?

### Summary
This article describes how to add a backdoor to the Diffusion models, so that the image with trigger will become an adversarial sample of a network after the diffusion and denoising process.

### Strengths
The attempt to add backdoor to diffusion models is new, this demonstrates a possible threat in the diffusion model.

### Weaknesses
The method of embedding a backdoor is straightforward. I have such questions (maybe some questions I asked have an answer in the article but I didn't see it, if so, I hope the author can explain it again):

1: Is the noise on the trigger image after passing through the diffusion and denoising a little too big (3 and 4 row of figure 3) to be easy to seen? Generally speaking, budget L_\infty=8/255 is enough to generate adversarial samples to Cifar10 on ResNet18. Why use 16/255? The visual prominence of the trigger after diffusion raises concerns about its stealthiness and practical relevance. A smaller perturbation budget, such as 8/255, might be more realistic and challenging, and it's unclear why the authors chose a larger value without sufficient justification.

2: By 2 row of figure 3, it is not difficult to find that the trigger is basically retained after adding noise. Is it the main reason why the backdoor can be produced? The observation that the trigger is largely preserved after the diffusion process suggests that the method relies heavily on this characteristic. It would be beneficial to analyze the extent to which the trigger's persistence contributes to the backdoor's effectiveness and whether the method would still work if the trigger was less prominent after the diffusion process.

3: About trigger design, I see that the author random selects a 5*5 trigger and adds it in the lower right corner of the image. May I ask whether the author has considered the design method of trigger？For example, considering the invisibility of the trigger, is it possible to select a trigger with L_\infty norm 8/255 (in this case, trigger can be added to the whole picture but not only a corner)? In other words, is there any advantage in selecting the trigger as described in this article? The choice of a fixed 5x5 trigger in the corner seems arbitrary. Exploring alternative trigger designs, such as those with a smaller L_\infty norm distributed across the image, could enhance the stealthiness of the backdoor. The authors should justify their specific trigger design choices and discuss the potential trade-offs between trigger visibility and attack effectiveness.

4: About the way to generate backdoor, Algorithm 1 requires very high privileges during the training process, including having the victim network f, arbitrarily adding dirty training data, changing loss function (Mixing loss). There is no doubt it works, but it is too straightforward (Directly training the Diffusion models to correspond to the trigger picture and adversarial picture), lacks innovative, which limits its usefulness. Should we consider more practical ways of adding backdoors? At least, it should be stated that adding less poison data and little modification to the training process will enable the backdoor attack. The proposed method requires substantial modifications to the training process, including access to the victim network and the ability to inject a large amount of poisoned data. This is not a realistic threat model, and the authors should explore more practical attack scenarios, such as those involving less data poisoning and minimal changes to the training process. The current approach is overly simplistic and lacks the subtlety required for real-world applications.

5: In theorem 1, authors show that KL(q_T,p_T) has a downward trend in relation to T. What I understand ‘diff(x,T)’ is that: adding noise on x with T steps. If so, my question is: Let x_c be the clean image. When T is big, will diff(x_c,T) close to p_T (I think so, that is why we can use diffusion against the adversarial sample)? If so, is it true that q_T≈p_T≈diff(x_c,T) when T is big? Do you have any instructions about the comparison between KL(q_T,p_T) and KL(q_T,diff(x_c,T))? The theoretical analysis regarding KL divergence and the diffusion process needs further clarification. Specifically, the relationship between KL(q_T, p_T) and KL(q_T, diff(x_c, T)) when T is large is not well explained. The authors should provide a more detailed discussion of the behavior of these KL divergences and their implications for the backdoor attack.

### Summary
This paper is focused on the security threat raisen by difffusion models when they are employed as defense tools. In details, they propose DIFF2, a novel diffusion-specific backdoor attack to guide the poison input torwards the malicious distributions. The effectiveness of DIFF2 is evaluated on the Adversarial Purification and robustness certification task.

### Strengths
1 This paper is well-written.

2 The experiments are relatively solid.

3 The proposed methods are technically sound.

### Weaknesses
1 DIFF2 could bring a significant negative impact on the benign acc.  For example, the result in Table 2 shows that DIFF2 will decrease the clean accurcay from 86.4% to 70.5% (-15.9%). This will largely impact the usuage of the diffusion model.

2 The effect of DIFF2 to robust acc can not be ignored. In addition to Clean ACC, I also notice that the performance of DIFF2 on robust acc is even worse, e.g. the robust acc of SDE decreases from  85.6% to 60.3% (-25.3%). It demonstrates that DIFF2 will increase the vulnerability of the diffusion model.

3 All experiments are performed on the small datasets. Further experiments are needed to illustrate DIFF2 can envade the classifier on the large dataset, e.g. ImageNet.

### Questions
1 The stealthiness of the attack can be further improved. Figure 3 shows that after performing the purification, the trigger will remains on the generated image $\hat{x_0}$. Thus, it increases the probobility of detection by the backdoor detection method, such as [1] or human inspection.  Thus, I would suggest use $x_a$ (the adversarial sample of $x$) to substitute $x_a^*$ (Line 6 of Algorithm 1).

2 Can the existing backdoor defense, e.g. ANP [2],  be used to defend DIFF2? Your can refer to [3] on how to implement ANP on the diffusion model.

### Summary
The paper discusses the security concerns of using pre-trained diffusion models, which are often employed as defensive tools against adversarial attacks. Due to their high training costs, many resorts to pre-trained versions, potentially compromising security. The authors introduce DIFF2, a backdoor attack for these models. DIFF2 manipulates the diffusion-denoising process, guiding certain inputs towards a malicious distribution. Results show that DIFF2 significantly impacts the effectiveness of these models in adversarial defense. The study also explores countermeasures and suggests areas for future research.

### Strengths
This is a trailblazing effort in backdooring security-centric diffusion models. Given the widespread adoption of diffusion models in recent studies, this paper addresses a pertinent and timely topic.

### Weaknesses
1. The paper lacks a comprehensive review of backdoor methodologies. It primarily relies on the original BadNets, introduced six years prior by Gu et al. (2017). Contemporary and more innovative backdoor attack techniques warrant discussion. Additionally, the trigger mechanism inherent to BadNets is susceptible to detection, as evidenced by [1].

2. In the main experiments, the surrogate and target classifiers are depicted as identical. This assumption appears unrealistic, especially since adversarial examples are tailored to specific classifiers. When pretraining a backdoored diffusion model, it's implausible to assume knowledge of the exact classifier a user will deploy. The experimental setup in Section 4 contrasts with the experiments, indicating a lack of consistency. A deeper exploration of transferability is imperative; the experiments described in Section 5.4 appear insufficient.

### Questions
1. I've observed a possible inconsistency in Table 4. The ASR reported therein is notably low (sub-40%), yet you've mentioned an ASR of 77.1% in the accompanying text. Could you please clarify this discrepancy?

2. Regarding Figure 3, post-purification images display visible distortions discernible to the human eye. Given that Algorithm 1 targets adversarial examples that remain imperceptible to humans, why do the post-purification images manifest these discernible perturbations?
