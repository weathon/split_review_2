- Decision: Accept
- Scores: 6, 6, 6, 8

## Abstract
We introduce \name, a physics-based differentiable tactile simulation system designed to enhance robotic manipulation with dense and physically accurate tactile feedback. In contrast to prior tactile simulators which primarily focus on manipulating rigid bodies and often rely on simplified approximations to model stress and deformations of materials in contact, \namespace emphasizes physics-based contact modeling with high fidelity, supporting simulations of diverse contact modes and interactions with objects possessing a wide range of material properties. Our system incorporates several key components, including a Finite Element Method (FEM)-based soft body model for simulating the sensing elastomer, a multi-material simulator for modeling diverse object types (such as elastic, elastoplastic, cables) under manipulation, a penalty-based contact model for handling contact dynamics. The differentiable nature of our system facilitates gradient-based optimization for both 1) refining physical properties in simulation using real-world data, hence narrowing the sim-to-real gap and 2) efficient learning of tactile-assisted grasping and contact-rich manipulation skills. Additionally, we introduce a method to infer the optical response of our tactile sensor to contact using an efficient pixel-based neural module. 
We anticipate that \namespace will serve as a useful platform for studying contact-rich manipulations, leveraging the benefits of dense tactile feedback and differentiable physics. Code and supplementary materials are available at the project website\footnote{\url{https://difftactile.io/}}.

### Summary
This paper presents a differential simulator for tactile sensors which work on the principle of light reflection from coloured deformable surfaces. The deformable surface is simulated by a finite element model, with contact forces based on penetration penalty. Surface normals of the deformed tactile surface are used by a neural network to predict the RGB colour of the reflected light. All these operations are differentiable

The paper presents experiments about system identification, grasping, and various manipulation tasks - all in simulation. The differential nature of the simulator allows gradient-based trajectory optimization for these tasks. Experiments show that this outperforms CMA-ES and RL.

### Strengths
- Tactile sensors provide highly useful sensing streams for fine manipulation tasks. However, they have been difficult to simulate. This hampers the training of policies with tactile observations in simulation. The differentiability of the proposed simulation system can enable data-efficient system identification. Gradient-free methods can also be used for system identification, but they usually require more data, including real robot data synchronized to sim, which can be expensive.
- Multiple experiments with multiple tasks show the general applicability of the proposed system.
- The paper is well written and easy to understand.

### Weaknesses
 - It is difficult to judge the accuracy of system identification based on the MSE in tactile markers location alone. Small errors can lead to large drops in downstream task performance. Therefore, system identification algorithms are usually evaluated by sim2real task performance [1, 2]. This paper lacks sim2real task performance experiments.
- Is CMA-ES not applicable to the system identification task (Section 4.1)? If it is, please discuss why it was not used as a baseline.
- A lack of discussion of computation time, especially the FEM-based deformation module.
- A lack of implementation details like RNN structure for parameter identification, optical prediction network architecture (Section 4.2), mathematical formulations of the reward functions used for the manipulation tasks (Section 4.4).

### Questions
- What is the computational runtime of the proposed method, and how does it affect the intended applications?
- Which simulation parameters are used for the manipulation experiments in Section 4.4? Are they the parameters identified from the real robot system?

### Summary
This paper is about creating a differentiable tactile stimulator that supports contact rich tasks. Having such a simulator is important to learn robust policies using tactile. The simulator consists of 4 components: 1) sensor deformation through FEM 2) Optical simulation model that maps sensor deformation to rgb reflected color. 3) Objects are modeled using least square material point and position based dynamics. 4) penalty based contact model which goes from deformation, represented by SDF, to forces. They evaluated the simulator in 3 tasks: system identification which basically tries to estimate the sensor params from a set of collected real sensor data. The second task is grasping fragile objects and finally manipulating non-rigid objects such as straightening a cable.

### Strengths
- Having differentiable simulator for contact-rich tasks unlock a lot of new capabilities. 
- The paper covers experiments in wide range of applications.

### Weaknesses
I would have liked to see application of the method for a contact-rich manipulation task in the real world.

### Summary
The paper presents DiffTactile, a simulator that uses FEM to simulate soft tactile sensors such as Gelsight, supports elastic, rigid, elasto-plastic, and cable-like objects, and is differentiable. The authors demonstrate the use of the simulator for three tasks. First, in system identification, the goal is to use real-world tactile observations to optimize the simulator’s physical parameters, and then compare the tactile marker and force reading to that of real data. In optical simulation, the visual quality of the optical simulation is examined. In grasping, the task is to use a parallel jaw gripper equipped with tactile sensors to see if tactile feedback is helpful. Finally in manipulation, four tasks are performed: surface following, cable straightening, case opening, and object reposing.

### Strengths
- Developing accurate simulation for tactile sensors is quite challenging, particularly for optical tactile sensors. However, the demand is quite large, as it can be expensive or challenging to work with real tactile sensing hardware. This simulator has many features including simulation of many object types and optical simulation, which are not present in existing works and may make it valuable for the development of robotic tactile sensor applications.
- The optical simulation results look quite impressive and match well with the real readings. 
- The introduction of the manipulation tasks is a nice demo of the types of tasks that can be modeled and learned in this simulator.

### Weaknesses
 - In the system identification task, it seems like the pixel-wise tactile marker mean squared error is extremely high for the real to sim setting, or at least, the standard deviation or standard error (which one is it? It’s not labeled) is much larger than the differences between the different methods, including the random method. This is rather concerning, as it seems to indicate that the system identification method is not very effective at reducing the sim-to-real gap.
- Rather than a comparison between using or not using tactile sensing for grasping, which has been validated in prior works, or comparison between different methods for optimizing policies to solve the manipulation tasks, I wish the paper focused more on evaluating how realistic and accurate the tactile sensing simulation is, as well as sim to real applications. I think those are the things that will really impact whether or not practitioners can rely on this simulator to generate conclusions that will hold in the real world.
- The organization of the paper is slightly confusing: I think it would be easier to understand if the tasks were introduced closer in the text to where the results are presented. In general I think the clarity of the writing could be improved, for example, to be more explicit about when tactile signals are real or simulated (for example, in Section 4.2, is the training data real?)


### Questions
Please see my points in "weaknesses". In addition: 
- What differentiates the “grasping” task from the “manipulation” tasks? I think that the manipulation tasks are nice demonstrations of the types of tasks that can be simulated using DiffTactile, but I don’t quite understand what the “grasping” task is trying to show that is not being illustrated by the “manipulation” tasks, as it seems to me that it could easily become the fifth “manipulation” task.
- Can you provide some intuition or qualitative visualization for why the baselines like PPO and SAC don’t perform well on the manipulation tasks? What are the failure modes?
- (nit): I recommend adding periods after paragraph section headings or otherwise distinguishing them from the following text.
- (nit): For the “experimental results” on page 9: “For case opening and object reposing, we define the metric as the opened angle of the lid and the orientation of the object.” I think it’s not quite accurate to refer to the orientation of the object as a metric.

### Summary
The paper presents a new tactile simulation framework for soft optical sensors applied on robotics manipulation tasks. This fully-differentiable pipeline is then used for system identification of sensor properties, and gradient-based trajectory optimization. This framework is the first differentiable simulation that supports both soft optical sensors and soft object interaction.

### Strengths
The authors positioned the framework well in context to the state of the art, and it is clear what improvements the new simulation offers. The experiments show why the differentiability is beneficial and how the optical simulation compares to previous work and on real-world experiments. A wide range of tasks were tested to verify the results for the optical sensors, and show a significant advantage of using differentiable tactile simulations.

### Weaknesses
1. While the accuracy of the optical sensor model is verified, the simulation itself would benefit from having a comparison to real-world experiments as well. Questions such as how well the dynamic behavior of soft objects match reality (bouncing objects), or how well the contact model applies to objects sliding/being pushed under friction. These would be more of a benchmark on the FEM-MPM-PBD simulation, but this could nevertheless broaden the applicability of the framework. It is unclear how the simulation handles complex contact scenarios, such as rolling or pivoting, which are crucial for many manipulation tasks. A more thorough validation of the simulation's dynamic fidelity is needed, beyond just the sensor readings.
2. How does the simulation compare when simulating articulated bodies? For example the lid-opening task, is the hinge a soft body or a joint? How well does this compare to modeling real-world objects? The description of the articulated body simulation is vague. It is unclear if the hinge is modeled as a soft, deformable connection or as a kinematic joint with constraints. The implications of this modeling choice on the simulation's accuracy and realism should be discussed. Furthermore, how does the simulation handle the accumulation of errors in the articulated body over time, especially with multiple degrees of freedom?
3. Adding some runtime reports, at least in the appendix, would be appreciated from a practitioner's perspective, since the choice for using FEM only for the sensor likely stems from high accuracy but high computational complexity as well. Hence MPM or PBD was used to simplify object simulation, is this correct? If so, it would be interesting to see how expensive each part of the simulation is, where simplifications are necessary when used in practice. Were any of the learned grasping or manipulation policies applied on the real robot? The computational cost of each simulation component (FEM, MPM, PBD, contact model) needs to be quantified. This is crucial for understanding the trade-offs between accuracy and efficiency. It is also unclear if the learned policies are directly transferable to a real robot, or if any sim-to-real adaptation is necessary.
4. Continuing on the topic of runtimes, for the trajectory optimization tasks in manipulation, it would be interesting to see how many iterations/computational resources each method was given to converge, was it the same for each, or was each method run until convergence?

### Questions
1. Were the constraints applied to the reinforcement learning methods for trajectory planning also applied to the gradient-based optimization? 
2. In Table 1, should the Tacchi method not also be differentiable since they are implemented in Taichi?
3. How efficient is it to simulate rigid objects as elastic using MPM and then applying rigidity constraints? Are there any plans on extending the simulator to use rigid-body or articulated-body solvers?
4. Are the results found from the SysID parameters used for the follow-up tasks?
