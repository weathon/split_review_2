- Decision: Accept
- Scores: 5, 8, 6, 8

## Abstract
Pretrained large language models (LLMs) are general purpose problem solvers applicable to a diverse set of tasks with prompts. They can be further improved towards a specific task by fine-tuning on a specialized dataset. However, fine-tuning usually makes the model narrowly specialized on this dataset with reduced general in-context learning performances, which is undesirable whenever the fine-tuned model needs to handle additional tasks where no fine-tuning data is available. 
In this work, we first demonstrate that fine-tuning on a single task indeed decreases LLMs' general in-context learning performance. We discover one important cause of such forgetting, format specialization, where the model overfits to the format of the fine-tuned task.
We further show that format specialization happens at the very beginning of fine-tuning. To solve this problem, we propose Prompt Tuning with MOdel Tuning (ProMoT), a simple yet effective two-stage fine-tuning framework that reduces format specialization and improves generalization.
ProMoT offloads task-specific format learning into additional and removable parameters by first doing prompt tuning and then fine-tuning the model itself with this soft prompt attached. 
With experiments on several fine-tuning tasks and 8 in-context evaluation tasks, we show that ProMoT achieves comparable performance on fine-tuned tasks to standard fine-tuning, but with much less loss of in-context learning performances across a board range of  out-of-domain evaluation tasks. More importantly, ProMoT can even enhance generalization on in-context learning tasks that are semantically related to the fine-tuned task, e.g. ProMoT on En-Fr translation significantly improves performance on other language pairs, and ProMoT on NLI improves performance on summarization.
Experiments also show that ProMoT can improve the generalization performance of  multi-task training.

### Confidence
3: You are fairly confident in your assessment. It is possible that you did not understand some parts of the submission or that you are unfamiliar with some pieces of related work. Math/other details were not carefully checked.

### Summary
The paper proposes to use a two-step finetuning approach to reduce forgetting when the finetuned model is applied to other tasks. This is done by prompt tuning the model for some number of steps while freezing the rest of the model and then freezing the prompt while tuning the rest of the model in the subsequent steps. The hope is that the initial prompt tuning learns the format and the rest of the tuning learns the task. The performance is evaluates on a set of NLP tasks where the authors show competitive on task performance and better out-of-task performance.

### Strengths
- The idea to separate format learning and task learning is interesting.
- The paper is easy to follow.
- The experiments show improvements in out-of-task performance.

### Weaknesses
 - I am not sure if there's practical utility to the proposed setting. Improving transfer to other tasks which are data limited could be a use case but I found the multi-task section of the paper very underwhelming. Multi-task training was done on only 2 tasks while it would be more informative to do it on a lot more tasks, results over multi-task 1-shot baseline are very mixed and is also missing 4-shot comparison.
- Prefix + Parameter tuning baseline seems to be missing. What happens if you do both prefix and parameter tuning but don't use the prefix embedding for other tasks. This should be done in both single task and multi-task setting.
- It would be good to include a prefix-tuning column. This would have some performance for the source task and same performance as the pre-trained model on other tasks.
- It is hoped that the prefix-tuning stage learns the format. It would be good to empirically test this hypothesis. One simple experiment is to check if the prefix embedding outputs the source task format on other tasks.
- Results on Palm 8B in the appendix don't look as promising and they should not be in the appendix but in the main paper. The approach seems to show worse performance than pre-trained model on other tasks after using the proposed approach. Would also be good to include 4-shot results here.

### Summary
This paper proposes an innovative fine-tuning method that preserves the model's general in-context learning ability. The method involves absorbing task-specific format knowledge into prompt tuning parameters and finetuning the main model. During evaluation, the prompt tuning parameters can be optionally dropped depending on dataset similarity.

### Strengths
1. The method is "strange". It furthers our understanding of param-efficient fine-tuning methods by showing and leveraging a unique property of prompt tuning.
2. Evaluated on a diverse set of datasets.
3. Ablation experiments showing the necessity of some design details.

### Weaknesses
1. Only on one model.
2; Finetuned on only two datasets.

### Questions
1. In Table 3,4, It may be worthwhile to put more highlights on the most relevant datasets, e.g. CB and WiC for RTE, WMT16 en>de, en>ro for WMT14 en>fr.

### Summary
The work focuses on solving the issue of performance decrease after applying single-task finetuning for T5 and PaLM models. The paper proposes a two-stage finetuning: 1) model frozen with soft prompt tuning 2) model tuning with soft prompt tuning frozen. They conduct experiments on 10+ NLP tasks, and the proposed approach achieves similar supervised performance. The paper explores a variety of experimental settings, single-task, and multi-task finetuning, and provides comprehensive insights showing the generalization ability of the model.

### Strengths
- The proposed method is shown to be very effective in preserving the model generalization with single-task fine-tuning while it slightly reduces the specialization, which is very beneficial for LLMs.
- Comprehensive evaluation on multiple tasks, and the authors run multiple runs on the few-shot setting to better show the model performance variance. 
- The experimental setting comprises many interesting settings (single-task vs. multi-task).
- It is a well-written paper with good clarity on the technical experimental details.

### Weaknesses
 - The limitation of the paper is only evaluated on encoder-decoder models. It would be interesting to also evaluate the approach on decoder-only models.

### Questions
- Do you have any difference trends on different base models? and also different model types (e.g., decoder-only models)?

### Summary
This work introduces PROmpt Tuning with MOdel Tuning (ProMoT) to address the issue of “format specialization”. This problem occurs when Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs) lose their in-context learning abilities after being fine-tuned for a specific task. To elaborate, PLMs are initially fine-tuned for the task using soft prompt tuning, wherein only the soft prompt is tuned for that specific task. Then, all parameters, excluding the trained soft prompt, are fine-tuned for the same task. Experimental results show that ProMoT not only prevents the format specialziation but also enhances the performance on the target task.

### Strengths
- **Reasonable problem setup and simple approach;** The proposed method, ProMoT, is demonstrated to be effective in preventing format specialization using a straightforward two-stage fine-tuning approach. Additionally, this paper reveals the cause of format specialization by analyzing the changes in gradient similarity between the data from both the randomized and original RTE datasets.
- **Notable Experimental Results;** The authors conducted extensive experiments across diverse types of tasks including Natural Language Inference (NLI), closed book QA, translation, and summarization. Furthermore, experimental results show that the proposed method is effective in alleviating the issue of format specialization after being fine-tuned on the classification (RTE) and translation (WMT14 En-Fr) tasks.
- **Clear Presentation;** This paper is well-written. Therefore, it is easy to understand the problem setup and the proposed method.

### Weaknesses
 - **Limited Evaluation;** While the experimental results include diverse evaluation tasks, the fine-tuning datasets are limited to just two tasks: NLI and Trnaslation. Why did the authors limit their experimentation to only these two tasks? Is it implied that format specialization does not occur in other tasks, such as question answering and summarization? I couldn’t find a satisfactory explanation in the paper regarding the absence of experimental results from fine-tuning on other tasks.

### Questions
