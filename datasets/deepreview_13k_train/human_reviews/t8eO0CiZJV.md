## Abstract
Large language models (LMs) are capable of %these days are immensely proficient at generating fluent text; in turn, we can use this capability to enhance an LM's usability on tasks, by prompting the LM to
generating \textit{free-text rationales} to aid question answering. 
However, prior work 1) suggests that useful self-rationalization is emergent only at %100B+ scale has been mostly seen in LMs that scale to exorbitantly large parameters
significant scales
(e.g., 175B parameter GPT-3); and 2) focuses largely on downstream performance, ignoring the semantics of the rationales themselves, e.g., are they faithful, true, and helpful for humans?
In this work,
we enable % the rationale generation of
small-scale LMs ($\sim$200x smaller than GPT-3) to generate rationales that not only improve downstream task performance, but are also %along three quality axes which are necessary for rationales to be deemed of \textit{good quality}:

Our method, \method\ (\textbf{M}ulti-rew\textbf{A}rd \textbf{R}at\textbf{IO}nalization), is a multi-reward conditioned self-rationalization algorithm that % ability of LMs on multiple fronts,

### Summary
In this work, authors contribute to the task of rationale’s generations in question answering tasks. In previous work, rationalizers are at significant scale,  and ignored the semantics of the rationales themselves. In this work, authors invented the MARIO algorithm for much smaller scale LM's to generate higher quality rationales, with multiple rewards for different quality properties of generated text rationales. Besides, generations from the algorithms seem to be more perferred for human experts.

### Strengths
This paper is well-written. The novelty and contribution is clear to me. The authors try not to take advantage of the scalability of large language models and instead use a much smaller distilled version of GPT.  Furthermore, the rewards’ design is aiming at generating rationales with better semantic qualities rather than scoring better at the specific downstream task. I think this is a really good design philosophy for training algorithms.

### Weaknesses
I believe the improvement of two versions of Marios compared to baselines is not really significant, considering that all the baseline models have equal number of parameters with the Mario agent model. I’m wondering whether the extra efforts on training on multiple rewards are indeed worth it to improve the generations.

### Questions
In the paper, the authors mentioned that there is an initial supervision phase where GPT-3 provides the generation labels. I’m wondering what’s the relationship between this initial supervision process and the distillation of GPT-3? Is it before, after, or exactly the distillation process?

### Summary
This paper introduces MARIO, a multi-reward approach that enhances the self-rationalization quality of small LMs and the performance of downstream tasks. The authors conducted experiments on three QA datasets and compared the results with several baselines, finding that MARIO can effectively train small LMs to generate rationales, which satisfy multiple distinct properties such as plausibility, diversity, and consistency, while also improving the performance of QA tasks. Additionally, human evaluation was carried out, confirming that the rationales generated by MARIO are more preferred by humans compared to the baselines. Furthermore, the paper discusses the importance of selecting appropriate rewards and preventing MULTI-REWARD HACKING.

### Strengths
The author presents an interesting and valuable research question, namely, how to enhance the self-rationalization quality of small LMs. Building upon the basis of quark, the paper effectively extends its application, utilizing multi-reward conditional generation to optimize both the rationale quality and the performance of downstream tasks. The article clearly explains the criteria for measuring three key aspects of a rationale's properties.

### Weaknesses
 - The details of the MARIO algorithm are not adequately explained, such as how to determine the settings of control tokens, and the description of how to quantize samples under the quark framework is unclear (is it a comprehensive consideration of multiple attributes for ranking, or is it ranked based on a single attribute?).
- The description of the MARIO method is overly simplistic, and it lacks the necessary explanation of the thought process behind the development of this method.
- In relation to self-explaining rationalization, besides the generative rationales discussed in this paper, there is a series of extractive rationale works (such as Lei et al. 2016, Liu et al. 2023, and so on). Beyond the difference between generative and extractive approaches, the basic framework of these two types of work is very similar. Both require ensuring that the generated/extracted rationale is meaningful to humans while maintaining high performance in downstream tasks. Therefore, the related work section should also include this series of works.

   - Liu et al. 2023, Decoupled Rationalization with Asymmetric Learning Rates, KDD-2023
- Although Figure 1 and Figure 2 contain a considerable amount of text, the information conveyed is limited.
- The experiment used multiple baselines, but in reality, it involves two baselines and their multi-reward forms of extension, lacking a comprehensive comparison with other works.

### Questions
Although the model utilizes the quark framework, it should clearly present the learning objectives in a multi-reward scenario. Since quark is a single-reward algorithm, its objective function under the extension of multi-reward goals is not intuitive. Could you provide a more detailed and clear explanation of MARIO and the corresponding multi-reward loss?

### Summary
In this paper, the authors presented MARIO, a method for training small LMs to generate rationales for question answering. The method is an extension to Quark. While Quark only allows optimizing towards one reward, MARIO allows learning from multiple-reward, allowing the LM to be trained with rewards for Plausibility, Consistency, Diversity and Task-correctness at the same time. The authors evaluated their method on 3 tasks: Strategy QA, QuaRel, and OpenBookQA, and the training rationales are sampled from InstructGPT outputs. The authors showed that their method outperformed baselines on similar-sized small LMs both on automated evaluation metrics and human preference, and can be comparable to some larger LMs on certain tasks.

### Strengths
1. The authors tackle an important problem: rationale generation for question answering on small LMs. It is known that rationalization and chain-of-thought can work better on very large language models, but fine-tuning small LMs to correctly rationalize in question-answering tasks has been very challenging.

2. The authors' proposed method allows learning towards multiple rewards, which can be very useful because often we want a model's generation to satisfy multiple desirable properties, and training towards a single property reward can often lead to complete loss of other desirable properties.

3. The authors comprehensively evaluated their method against several baselines on similar-sized LMs, and showed that their method is superior on 3 different QA tasks, both on automated metrics and human preference.

4. The presentation of the paper is generally quite clear. The figures and tables are very well made and they really help make the paper easier and better understood by the reader.

### Weaknesses
Overall this is a good paper. Below are a few weaknesses that prevented the paper from getting a "10":

1. The paper's main contribution is extending an existing method (Quark) from single-reward to multiple rewards. So while the results are nice and the extension is valuable, the contribution is not revolutionary.

2. While the description in text and Figure 2 are very helpful for readers to understand MARIO, the full picture of MARIO can still be a bit hard to grasp (especially to readers who are not already familiar with Quark). Maybe including an algorithm block for the entire training process will make the full picture a lot more clear.

### Questions
(1) Is there any way to rank/weight/balance different objectives in MARIO? (For example, if I found that the resulting model is weak in Consistency, is there a way to weigh Consistency reward a bit more in the training?)

### Summary
This work studies the problem of generating plausible, consistent, and diverse rationales that also improve the downstream task performance while using small-scale LMs. The proposed method, called MARIO, is a multi-reward conditioned self-rationalization algorithm that optimizes multiple properties. Extensive evaluation show that produced rationales are plausible and improve performance.

Mario works a follow. First, it trains a small LM to self-rationalize, with the help of GPT-3. Then, it casts the problem into a multi-reward conditioned rationale generation problem. The key is to leverage a multi-reward setup, where the dimensions to optimize are plausibility, diversity, consistency, and task accuracy. Each reward is based on an automated metric. At the end, the propose method only extend Quark [Lu et al. 2022], which limits the novelty (the proposed method is 3 paragraphs).

The experiments focus on QA datasets. The two variants of Mario don't seem to significantly outperforms the baselines, Classical underperforms on StrategyQA and Mario on the others. However, the human evaluation show more promising results, showing that automated evaluations are not enough on their own. Other datasets than QA ones should be used to show the generalization of the proposed method. For example, beer, hotel, or amazon datasets. The analysis on reward hacking and optimizing solely on task performance is very interesting.

Overall the work is clear, well-written, and well-structured. It is a bit weird that the related work is put in the appendix. I would highly encourage the authors to move it back into the main paper. My concerns remain the novelty of the method - that seems to extend QUARK for multi-reward steup - and the lack of datasets that are not QA, especially when we are talking about rationalization.

POST-REBUTTAL:
Thank you for your answers; I am willing to increase my score.

### Strengths
- Good human evaluation and results
- Interesting method to make self-rationalization work with small LMs

### Weaknesses
 - Other datasets than QA ones should be used to show the generalization of the proposed method.
- Small improvement in Table 2
- Limited novelty

### Questions
- How would you adapt your method for other rationalization tasks that are not QA?

### Summary
The authors extend an existing LM control mechanism to work for controlling multiple attributes simultaneously, and following this mechanism they train T5-Large to do reasoning that is more plausible, non-repetitive, and consistent with the predicted answer. On some challenging QA tasks they get a small bump in accuracy, but a much bigger gain in human evaluations of the quality of the reasoning produced by the model to justify the answer.

### Strengths
--tackles a challenging task (making LMs output reasoning for their answers that is more reliable on a couple of different axes) which is highly topical

--impressive human eval results showing that their final rationales are much better than baselines'

--interesting discussion of reward hacking

### Weaknesses
--Methodologically, this multi-attribute control setup seems to be a straightforward extension of Quark, and the idea of finetuning an LM to use tags to provide control i think is pretty well-explored in other work such as [1], and doing it for multi-attribute with different tags is used as a baseline in [2]. i feel that your main contribution is not so much the new algorithm in a general sense, but rather the interesting application (with convincing human eval results) to the important and currently relevant task of making LM reasoning more reliable.

--some of the models you use to evaluate/filter the individual qualities, e.g. VERA, are way bigger than the model you're finetuning, which arguably gives you extra signal that the SFT baseline doesn't have? what was the data used for training those? on a related note, this raises some concerns that your method might not be scalable to larger LMs, unless we have e.g. an even larger version of VERA to provide supervision?

### Questions
--Is there any particular reason to think additive or classic might be better than the other in any particular setting? Otherwise, it kind of seems like you're just giving yourself "multiple tries" at your benchmark, in some sense.

--Is GPT3 = text-davinci-003 throughout?

--does adding the finetuning for consistency fix the problems in 5.2? or is this not exactly the same?

--the reward hacking discussion seems important and i'm glad you included it - there are a lot of potential hacks, e.g. a degenerate "rationale" could just be the answer itself or restating that in some way, right? do you get around this issue by starting with distillation so that the supervised rationales are initially reasonable, rather than doing e.g. some RL? i'm wondering how you would be able to go about this if you didn't have access to a much stronger model to distill from initially - it seems like so far you've only showed in a distillation-like setting, from GPT3 to a vastly smaller model.
