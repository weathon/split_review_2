## Abstract
vspace{-2mm}
    Chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting for language models demonstrates impressive performance across reasoning tasks, but typically needs labeled exemplars of the reasoning process. In this work, we introduce a new prompting approach, \textbf{\methodname}, designed to automatically guide the reasoning process of large language models. Inspired by analogical reasoning, a cognitive process in which humans draw from relevant past experiences to tackle new problems, our approach prompts language models to self-generate relevant exemplars or knowledge in the context, before proceeding to solve the given problem. This method presents several advantages: it obviates the need for labeling or retrieving exemplars, offering generality and convenience; it can also tailor the generated exemplars and knowledge to each problem, offering adaptability. Experimental results show that our approach outperforms 0-shot CoT and manual few-shot CoT in a variety of reasoning tasks, including math problem solving in GSM8K and MATH, code generation in Codeforces, and other reasoning tasks in BIG-Bench.

### Rating
5

### Rating Number
5

### Confidence
3: You are fairly confident in your assessment. It is possible that you did not understand some parts of the submission or that you are unfamiliar with some pieces of related work. Math/other details were not carefully checked.

### Summary
The authors proposes a new prompting paradigm, which has three phases: 
1. Related knowledge retrieval
2. Exemplar generation
3. Answer prompting. 

With this paradigm, the prompting on math and reasoning required tasks has an average accuracy gain of +4%.

### Strengths
Originality: 3/5 

This paper aims to solve the problem that the few-shot prompting schema requires manually collected examples via a template-based method. 
Although there are quite a few previous works on prompt templates and knowledge retrieval, such as recitation-augmented models, this work focuses more on reasoning-based problem-solving. 

Quality: 2.5/5

This work has performed studies on quite a few benchmarks, including GSM8K and MATH, code generation in Codeforces, and other reasoning tasks in BIG-Bench. However, the experiment setup is a bit weird, as some of the studies include the in-context demonstration of generating examples, some do not; some adopt with knowledge paradigm, and some do not. A minor concern is that this study does not include the GPT-4 performance. 

Clarity: 3.5/5

Overall the paper is well written and easy to follow. The examples are quite illustrative but may be a bit repetitive, as Figure 3 seems to already include all the information that Figure 2 contains. 

Significance: 3/5

This method proposes a new prompting schema for leveraging the language model as a knowledge base. However, this exemplar generation procedure does not provide an in-depth guarantee or study on the quality of generated examples.

### Weaknesses
1. The experiment setup could be better.

### Questions
1. It would be nice to conceptually compare the work against the neural symbolic method [1].

### Summary
The authors propose the use of analogical prompting to enhance reasoning performance. This method requires LLMs to first self-generate relevant examples or knowledge before attempting to solve a problem. Then, the model provides a response based on the generated concepts.

### Strengths
1. The paper is well-organized and easy to understand. And the proposed method is intuitive.
2. The experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods across diverse datasets, while the ablation study indicates that the method outperforms the baseline approaches.

### Weaknesses
1. Will the language model be easily distracted when the generated examples are irrelevant or incorrect? The experiments in section 6.6 should provide more details. For instance, it should specify how many problems in MATH fail due to incorrect and irrelevant generated examples.
2. Can current LLMs generate helpful examples for challenging questions? The authors are encouraged to include more examples in the paper.
3. Can this method be integrated with self-consistency decoding? For instance, could the majority voting result from multiple reasoning chains with the generated knowledge, lead to better outcomes?
4. The authors are encouraged to include more qualitative examples to compare the behavior between reasoning with a 0-shot prompt and reasoning with generated examples.

If the paper aims to demonstrate better automatic prompt engineering, then you need to provide more comparisons with existing works, such as "Large Language Models Are Human-Level Prompt Engineers" and its follow-up. Or you need to include experiments to demonstrate when LLMs are analogical reasoners and when not. **At this time, the paper is not strong enough to get in.**

1. I'm interested in separate analyses for GSM8K and MATH.

2. Regarding the table:
50 correctly solved problems:
(6/50) Generated exemplars are irrelevant
(9/50) Generated exemplars are relevant but incorrect
(35/50) Generated exemplars are relevant and correct
50 incorrectly solved problems:
(10/50) Generated exemplars are irrelevant
(12/50) Generated exemplars are relevant but incorrect
(28/50) Generated exemplars are relevant and correct

This indicates exemplars are useful in 56% of unsolved problems and 70% of solved ones. However, in 30% of solved problems, LLMs disregard the exemplars. Additionally, LLMs fail to benefit from exemplars in at least 56% of unsolved problems. This suggests difficulty in altering LLMs' reasoning from their trained biases. Thus, I am not confident that the current LLMs are already good analogical reasoners.

### Questions
The most important questions are mentioned in the "Weaknesses" section. Here is an additional question I am interested in, which may not necessarily be included in this paper.

Can a verification stage be added to filter out incorrect or irrelevant examples to further improve performance?

### Confidence
5: You are absolutely certain about your assessment. You are very familiar with the related work and checked the math/other details carefully.

### Summary
This paper introduces the analogical prompting method. It's a method similar to CoT, but instead of just plaining "let's think step by step", it first prompts the model to automatically generate some knowledge and exemplars for solving tasks. Experiments on mathematical reasoning, code generation, and big-bench confirm its validity.

### Strengths
- This paper is well-written, with a detailed depiction of the design principles and implementation details for the proposed analogical prompting method. Experiment results on GSM8K, MATH, codeforces, and a bigbench subset show moderate improvement compared to few-shot CoT, and a noticeable boost compared to other zero-shot prompting methods.

- The analogical prompting method is well-motivated and intuitive enough to follow. Some ablation studies on the scalability, w/o knowledge, and the number of exemplars are good.

### Weaknesses
 - Limited technical contribution. Although I think this paper is a good example of how to perform prompting engineering when solving zero-shot mathematical reasoning and code generation tasks, it is still more like a trick to an existing method (analogous to CoT->zero-shot CoT, in this case is retrival few-shot -> self-generated few-shot).

- The codeforces dataset only contains 50 questions; perhaps it is too small to make claims on the improvements (~2% is only one more solved question). Any experiments on larger code generation tasks, e.g., HumanEval?

### Questions
There is error analysis for incorrectly solved tasks, how about correctly solved questions? How many generated exemplars are wrong, but the solution to the new question is correct (i.e., it is known that sometimes LLMs can few-shot generalize from wrong exemplars)?

### Summary
This work presents a novel prompting method inspired by the concept of analogical reasoning in cognitive science. The method is shown to outperform few-shot chain-of-thought methods, while not requiring any few-shot examples.

### Strengths
- The proposed method involves an interesting take on concepts from cognitive science, and yields consistent improvements across reasoning benchmarks.
- The proposed method is simple to implement, and does not require any task-specific prompts or training examples.
- A qualitative analysis is performed of the generated exemplars and their relationship to downstream performance.
- The code dataset is limited to recently published problems, thus addressing test set contamination concerns.

### Weaknesses
 - The paper emphasizes the importance of instructing the LLM to generate *distinct* exemplars, but there is no ablation performed for this specific aspect of the method.
- It seems unlikely that the generated exemplars are literally retrieved from memory in the sense that they are in human reasoning. It seems more likely that these are novel problems generated by the LLM, based on general statistical knowledge. I don't think this really undermines the usefulness of the approach, but it might be worthwhile to briefly discuss this issue.
- The caption for Table 1 mentions that an in-context demonstration was used for the davinci models, but I couldn't find any explanation of this description (e.g., does this include an in-context training example, or merely a demonstration of the formatting?).

Minor comments:
- The authors might consider citing work that analyzes the analogical reasoning ability of LLMs [1,2] (though I should note that I don't think this undermines the contribution of the present work). There are also a few references that would be good to include when introducing the general concept of analogical reasoning and its role in the psychology literature [3,4].

### Questions
I am curious to hear the authors thoughts regarding whether the generated exemplars are genuinely retrieved from memory, or are novel problems based on general statistical knowledge. The latter case seems more consistent with the memory mechanisms in LLMs (and with their tendency to generate fabricated but plausible sounding information), but it is not something that has been considered much in the psychology literature on analogical reasoning, and it is somewhat more difficult to understand how it could improve performance.
