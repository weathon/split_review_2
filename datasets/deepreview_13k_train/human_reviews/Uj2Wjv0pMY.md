## Abstract
Following step-by-step procedures is an essential component of various activities carried out by individuals in their everyday lives. These procedures serve as a guiding framework that helps achieve goals efficiently, whether assembling furniture or preparing a recipe. However, the complexity and duration of procedural activities inherently increase the likelihood of making errors. Understanding such procedural activities from a sequence of frames is a challenging task that demands an accurate interpretation of visual information and an ability to reason about the structure of the activity. To this end, we collected a new ego-centric 4D dataset comprising 384 recordings (94.5 hrs) of people performing recipes in kitchen environments. This dataset consists of two distinct activity types: one in which participants adhere to the provided recipe instructions and another where they deviate and induce errors. We provide 5.3K step annotations and 10K fine-grained action annotations for 20% of the collected data and benchmark it on two tasks: error recognition, multi step localization and procedure learning.

### Summary
This paper introduces a new dataset for Error Recognition in procedure videos. The dataset consists of 384 videos (~94.5 hours) capturing 8 subjects on 10 kitchens, while the subjects are cooking 24 different recipes. The dataset is provided with other modalities such as depth, IMU, camera trajectories, however, baseline experiments use only RGB. The paper provides 3 sets of baselines: Error Recognition (supervised and early prediction), Multi-Step Localization, and Procedure Learning. In term of dataset contribution, the proposed dataset does not provide anything significantly different from previous ones (see detailed explanation in weakness). In term of experiments, the provided baselines do not bring any interesting insights about the new datasets. Written presentation is fair, but not great, some parts are unclear.

### Strengths
- The paper dedicates efforts to build a new benchmark for procedural videos, any effort in dataset building is a great contribution to the community.

### Weaknesses
1. The proposed dataset has nothing standing out from previous ones. By looking at Table 1, the proposed dataset are bucked in small or medium compared with the existing ones in terms of number of videos or number of hours, and even number of tasks. The only difference may be that the proposed dataset provides more modalities. However, experiments shown in the paper only used RGB so far. Another claim made by the paper is that it has more error instances (compared by error:normal ratio) than Assembly101, which is true. However, the ways of capturing error videos have some problems: in three scenario of capturing error videos (sec 3.1.2), the first twos were scripted, the last one is instructed. Although it helps providing more error videos, however, those error videos will be intentional (the mistakes won't look realistic). In practice, the unintentional mistakes or errors are more relevant and often happened in reality.
2. The baselines provide not much insights.
- For Error Recognition (Table 2 & 3), the observation is Omnivore is the best backbone / embedding for error / normal video classification. The early prediction problem is still formulated as classification with partly-observed data. The same finding is confirmed (Omnivore works best for this, this brings no surprise as both are technically the same problem, the later one is a bit harder).
- For Multi-Step Localization, the problem is formulated as supervised TAL and the same set of features are used and a ActionFormer head was use for localization. The same finding is that Omnivore works best.
- For procedure learning: Two baselines (Dwibedi et al. 2019 and Siddhant et al. 2022) were used and provided similar performance. No real insights were observed in this experiments.
- Since this paper is about the new dataset which is claimed to focus on error recognition, however there not much new insights about the significance of bringing more error videos to procedural video dataset: neither in the way data is captured or significant baselines, experiments to demonstrate why it matters?

3. Writing is not clear in some parts
- In 4.2, is the supervised TAL trained task-agnostically or task-specifically, meaning TAL is trained for all or per tasks (24 recipes)

### Summary
The paper proposes an Egocentric 4D (RGBD) dataset, for understanding step by step procedural activities and the error recognition. The dataset intends to tackle the problem of fine-grained error detection in activities, also anticipating them. The end goal is to mimic activities error in various activities like medical operation or chemical operation. The dataset consists of kitchen recipe videos (384 videos) for 24 tasks, by 8 different actors. The annotation of the datasets ranges from coarse-grained: correct vs error (binary classification) to fine-grained errors on various time stamps of error. The paper also proposes 3 baseline performance metrics : binary error classification, multi-step localization (TAL) and procedural learning.

### Strengths
•	Paper is very written in simple terms, easy to follow language.

•	Proposed errors like technique error, and measurement error will test models fine-grained understanding of activities

•	The work is definitely a constructive work towards Coarse grained & Fine grained errors understanding problem, which definitely seems like relatively new field.

•	Extensive fine-grained annotation would greatly benefit future works. 

•	Higher ratio of error to normal videos, establishes superiority of the work.

### Weaknesses
•	Compared to Assembly 101 (error detection), the paper seems like an inferior / less complicated dataset. Claims like higher ratio of error to normal videos needs to be validated.

•	Compared to datasets, the dataset prides itself on adding different modalities especially depth channel (RGB-D). The paper fails to validate the necessities of such modality. One crucial different between assembly dataset is use of depth values. What role does it play in training baseline models? Does it boost the model’s performance if these weren’t present. In current deep learning area, depth channels should be reasonably be producible via the help of existing models. 

•	I’m not convinced that the binary classification is a justifiable baseline metrics. While I agree with the TAL task is really important here and a good problem to solve, I’m not sure how coarse grained binary classification can assess models understanding of fine-grained error like technique error. 

•	Timing Error (Duration of an activity) and Temperature based error, does these really need ML based solutions? In sensitive tasks, simple sensor reading can indicate error. I’m not sure testing computer vision models on such tasks is justifiable. These require more heuristics-based methods, working with if-else statement. 

•	Procedure Learning: its very vaguely defined, mostly left unexplained and seems like an after thought. I recommend authors devote passage to methods “M1 (Dwibedi et al., 2019)” and “M2 (Bansal, Siddhant et al., 2022)”. In Table 5, value of lambda? Is not mentioned. 

•	The authors are dealing with a degree of subjectivity in terms of severity of errors. It would have been greatly beneficial, if the errors could be finely measured. For example if the person uses a tablespoon instead of teaspoon, is still an error? Some errors are more grave than others, is there a weighted scores? Is there a way to measure level of deviation for each type of error or time stamp of occurrence of error. Is one recipe more difficult than the other recipe.

### Questions
1.	Please validate claims like higher ratio of error to normal videos 

2.	Please provide the utility of depth channels in error detection tasks or provide baseline performances. 

3.	I feel like binary classification section can be minimized, and instead procedural activity section needs to be emphasized and described in much more detail. 

4.	Show baseline results for each type of errors. A measure of how difficult certain error would help future work. 

5.	Some form of comparisons of errors needs to be there, or a severalty level of errors.

Post Rebuttal

-------------

1.	In terms of statistics, still not convinced if the proposed dataset is better than Assembly 101. None of the baseline models have been shown to be have any adverse impact of these proposed added difficulties : “Shape and color changes ingredients”, “real-kitchen environments”. Higher ratio of error to normal videos (not validated). Reviewer I weakness-1 pointed out the same issue. 

2.	Added additional modality of Depth is still not resolved. As a reviewer, I’m not sure what role depth channel plays in the error detection task. The authors have mentioned again in the rebuttal of presence of depth channel as a superiority over Assembly 101 dataset, but no proof how it’s useful with the task at hand (i.e. error detection) or does Depth channel play any role in this dataset. Reviewer I weakness-1 & Reviewer 3 weakness-1 (&2) pointed out the same issue.

3.	Binary classification of the as an error detection baseline metrics is not justified. (Similar issue pointed out by Reviewer I weakness 2). I fully agree that the baselines do not provide many insights.

4.	I’m not entirely convinced metrics based (Time / Temperature) errors are the right metrics to measure error detection capabilities of via Commuter Vision or Machine Learning algorithms. (Similar issue pointed out by Reviewer I weakness 2)

### Summary
This paper presents a new dataset for error recognition in procedure videos. Table 1 compares this new dataset to existing datasets. The process of data collection is described. Baselines are provided for the two tasks of "Error Recognition" and "Multi Step Localization".

### Strengths
The paper is well presented: (1) the motivation is clear (2) the data collection process is clear.

The paper provides baseline methods for the proposed two tasks: (1) error recognition (2) multi-step localization.

### Weaknesses
1. The additional benefit of this new dataset is unclear. Looking at Table 1, the added benefit compared to existing work "Assembly 101" seems to be limited to adding "depth" channel. However, it is unclear whether the "depth" channel is really useful in the context of error recognition. The authors need to provide more evidence on why this new dataset is significantly more useful than "Assembly 101".

2. The collected sensor data such as "depth", "camera trajectory", and "hand joints" are not used or analyzed by the baselines provided.

3. The AUC score between Table 2 (Error Recognition) & Table 3 (Early Error Prediction) looks surprisingly similar. Shouldn't the task of "Early Error Prediction" be much harder than the typical "Error Recognition" task?

### Questions
1. In Figure 4, Table 2-3, can you highlight the best performing model?

2. It's better to present the the distribution of different error categories in the main paper, e.g., Figure 16-17?
