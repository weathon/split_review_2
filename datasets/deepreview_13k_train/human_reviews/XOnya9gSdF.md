- Decision: Accept

## Abstract
We consider the optimization of complex performance metrics in multi-label classification under the population utility framework. 
We mainly focus on metrics linearly decomposable into a sum of binary classification utilities applied separately to each label with an additional requirement of exactly $k$ labels predicted for each instance. 
These ``macro-at-$k$'' metrics possess desired properties for extreme classification problems with long tail labels. 
Unfortunately, the at-$k$ constraint couples the otherwise independent binary classification tasks, leading to a much more challenging optimization problem than standard macro-averages. 
We provide a statistical framework to study this problem, prove the existence and the form of the optimal classifier, and propose a statistically consistent and practical learning algorithm based on the Frank-Wolfe method. 
Interestingly, our main results concern even more general metrics being non-linear functions of label-wise confusion matrices. 
Empirical results provide evidence for the competitive performance of the proposed approach.

### Summary
Paper presents an approach for multi-label classification with a budget using so called macro-at-k metrics which are linearly decomposable into a sum of binary classification utilities, and could be useful in the case of extreme classification with large number of imbalanced labels. This leads to challenging optimisation problem which is tackled using Frank-Wolfe method on label-wise confusion matrices. Theoretical underpinnings of producing consistent classifier are analysed, and performance improvement of macro-at-k against top-k strategies are shown on four different multi-label benchmark datasets with different number of labels and label distribution.

### Strengths
The proposal is theoretical sound, and detailed analysis of the properties of proposed metrics as well as how to build the consistent classifier based on confusion matrix measure and tensor representation, are shown. One practical solution for optimising the classifiers with proposed macro metrics, is derived. In empirical evaluations, four benchmark dataset with two base classifiers (MLP, Sparse linear model) are used to compare macro-at-k metrics with more straightforward top-k heuristics. In most cases, proposed approach could improve the precision and recall (and F1 score) in different k-budget levels, whereas on the largest dataset more simple baseline heuristics seems to work better. To my knowledge, the setting of considering budgeted macro-at-k in multi-label classification is novel, providing interesting approach and new knowledge to extreme multi-label problems.

### Weaknesses
Although paper shows good theoretical background and promising results, it lacks some of the detailed analysis and discussion of the results, especially in a broader sense. For instance, the discussion which of proposed metrics and macro-at-k approach should be chosen for different problems from practitioners perspectives, would strengthen the presentation. Also, manuscript is missing the analysis of computational complexity and computational times (of optimising the classifiers) and how these relate to size of the budget and other chosen parameters, as well as how these compare between different heuristics.

### Questions
- What would be the conclusions or "rule of thumb" of selecting particular heuristics from the practitioners' point of view for certain applications or multi-label classification problem?
- What are the computational costs of proposed approach and how these relate  the size of k?

### Summary
This paper aims to find consistent algorithms for macro-at-k metrics, which is widely-used in many long-tailed multi-label classification problems. For the multi-label problem, the author shows such optimal classifiers can be derived by selecting top-k scoring labels based on an affine transformation of the marginal label probabilities (which is unknown in practice). They further presents a Frank-Wolfe algorithm to empirically find the optimal classifiers.

### Strengths
- The technical derivation of this paper seems solid

### Weaknesses
 - The writing of this paper is not easy to follow
- Some baseline methods are missing in experiments


### Questions
- Q1: From the results of Table 2, the proposed method seems to greatly sacrifice instance-wise metrics to trade for gains in macro-average metrics. Is it possible for the proposed method to optimize a interpolated version of the objective that flexibly control the performance tradeoff between instance-wise metrics and macro-averaged metrics?

- Q2: Some baseline methods that claim to also perform good on tail-labels are not discussed in related work, or compared in the experiment section. For example [1] and [2], to name just a few.

- Q3: To improve the clarity of the proposed methods, the author may consider a toy synthetic dataset where data distributions are known, and show derivations of the proposed method, and verify the consistency property through simulations.

- Q4: This submission also seems highly related to [3]. The author should discuss what's the difference, and compare it empirically.

### Summary
In the paper "Consistent algorithms for multi-label classification with macro-at-k metrics", the authors propose a framework of consistent multi-label learning algorithms for targeting macro-averaged metrics that are however budgeted for a k-subset of labels. The presented approach is based on the Frank-Wolfe algorithm and represents a principled extension towards multi-label classification with corresponding theoretical guarantees. An empirical study confirms the consistency with the targeted metric.

### Strengths
- Theoretical sound and underpinned approach for targeting macro-averaged at k metrics for multi-label classification.
- An empirical study confirms the theoretical findings for four datasets and various metrics.
- The overall presentation and language of the paper are very good.

### Weaknesses
 - The empirical evaluation is relatively limited as only four datasets are considered. However, the main focus should remain on the theoretical findings here.
- The theoretical results could be accompanied by an intuition to ease understanding of the results. Specifically, the connection between the Frank-Wolfe algorithm and the optimization of macro-averaged at-k metrics is not immediately clear and could benefit from a more intuitive explanation. For instance, elaborating on how the linear approximation within the Frank-Wolfe algorithm relates to the structure of the targeted metrics would be helpful.
- A comparison to something like binary relevance learning treating each label independently for demonstrating also empirically that these measures cannot be sufficiently tackled by such an approach would be desirable. It would be beneficial to show how the proposed method outperforms binary relevance when the macro-averaged at-k metrics are the target, particularly highlighting the cases where the independence assumption of binary relevance fails.

### Questions
- In https://doi.org/10.1007/s10994-021-06107-2 an @k metric interpolating between  Hamming and subset 0/1 loss is presented. To what extent would this relate to the considered @k-metrics in this paper?

### Summary
The manuscript studies the problem of multi-label classification with budgeted (top-k) prediction metrics. The problem is very well established by now, and of much practical relevance. The paper is overall well motivated, well-written, and the contributions are par for the venue.

I see two key contributions: 1) formalizing the empirical uitility maximation notion of '@k' metrics as that of optimizing over certain classes of confusion matrices, which decomposes over individual labels, but the optimization problem itself doesn't decompose easily because of the constraint that any classifier in the hypothesis space must output exactly k labels per instance; 2) deriving a neat form for the Bayes optimal, which yields interpretable closed form solutions for well-known metrics like recall and balanced accuracy; the most-general closed form solution is not very useful because it depends on the optimal values --- this observation by itself is not novel, as pretty much every paper that talks about non-decomposable losses for binary/multi-label classification problems (several of which are clearly cited in the paper) have developed similar results.  

Given the form of the Bayes optimal, Frank-Wolfe based algorithm for estimating the classifiers can be written down, following the work of Narasimhan et al. (2015). The empirical results demonstrate the effectiveness of the algorithm, and the consistency between optimal Bayes rule and the algorithmic convergence for certain measures, compared to several natural baselines.

Overall, I like the work and I am inclined to accept. I've some minor concerns which I outline under 'weaknesses' section. It would be good to hear from the authors on these questions in their rebuttal.

-- Post rebuttal --
Most of my concerns are addressed. I'm more positive about the paper now.

### Strengths
1. Clearly formulated problem -- it's non-trivial to set up the problem, and I really like the simplicity of the formulation in terms of confusion matrices/tensors, and the authors have done a great job of presenting notation-heavy material with careful development of ideas. 
2. Technical rigor -- the theoretical results are well established, and the supporting key lemmas are included in the main paper, which is very helpful.

### Weaknesses
The intro neatly positions the problem in the context of several closely-related work in this space, but I felt those connections didn't surface as much as I'd have loved to see in the main paper.

For instance, the first main result in Theorem 4.1. Just looking at the constants a_j and b_j, one can see, not surprisingly, that these are the same constants one would see for weighted binary classification problems, see Lemma 2 of https://www.jmlr.org/papers/volume18/15-226/15-226.pdf (of course, there's no top-k notion here in binary classification). It would be good to draw these connections, position the main results in the context of known results, and tease apart new observations and insights.

Similarly, with respect to, Theorem 4.4, it would be good to see some form of the result, say special cases, that can be dotted lined to known results for multi-label problems.

### Questions
It would be good to address the points raised in the weaknesses section. And a note on the challenges or novelty in the proofs for Thm 4.4 over and above known work.

It's nice to see the consistency between Macro-R_prior and Macro-R_FW in the experiments for the recall metric. Did the authors also experiment with balanced accuracy in the experiments, where the closed form solution is also easy to compute?
