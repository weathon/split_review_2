## Abstract
Diffusion-based image editing methods have achieved remarkable advances in text-driven image editing. The editing task aims to convert an input image with the original text prompt into the desired image that is well-aligned with the target text prompt. By comparing the original and target prompts, we can obtain numerous editing pairs, each comprising an object and its corresponding editing target. To allow editability while maintaining fidelity to the input image, existing editing methods typically involve a fixed number of inversion steps that project the whole input image to its noisier latent representation, followed by a denoising process guided by the target prompt. However, we find that the optimal number of inversion steps for achieving ideal editing results varies significantly among different editing pairs, owing to varying editing difficulties. Therefore, the current literature, which relies on a fixed number of inversion steps, produces sub-optimal generation quality, especially when handling multiple editing pairs in a natural image.
To this end, we propose a new image editing paradigm, dubbed Object-aware Inversion and Reassembly (OIR), to enable object-level fine-grained editing. Specifically, we design a new search metric, which determines the optimal inversion steps for each editing pair, by jointly considering the editability of the target and the fidelity of the non-editing region. We use our search metric to find the optimal inversion step for each editing pair when editing an image. We then edit these editing pairs separately to avoid \concept. Subsequently, we propose an additional reassembly step to seamlessly integrate the respective editing results and the non-editing region to obtain the final edited image. To systematically evaluate the effectiveness of our method, we collect two datasets called OIRBench for benchmarking single- and multi-object editing, respectively. Experiments demonstrate that our method achieves superior performance in editing object shapes, colors, materials, categories, \textit{etc.}, especially in multi-object editing scenarios.

### Summary
The paper proposes object-aware inversion and reassembly for image editing. The motivation is that the inversion steps vary from the editing of different objects. Therefore, we need to choose different inversion steps for different objects. Also, for different objects in one image, we need to merge the editing results. Then the reassembly strategy is introduced. The proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance.

### Strengths
1) The paper is well-organized and easy to follow.

2) It makes sense to use different diffusion steps for different objects when performing the image editing.

3) The paper proposes a reassembly strategy to merge the editing results.

4) The proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance.

### Weaknesses
1) To determine the optimal inversion steps for image editing, we need to inverse the image to all steps and then edit them accordingly. It is time-consuming and not automatic.

2) The two contributions are more like the engineering stuff. However, admittedly, they do bring a lot of performance gain.

### Summary
This paper discovers that various editing pairs exhibit differing levels of editing complexity. Additionally, it is observed that neglecting the varying difficulty levels of different editing pairs in multi-object editing tasks results in the problems of concept mismatch and poor editing. To address these issues, the paper introduces a novel training-free image editing approach called OIR. This method follows the approach of assembly first and then reassembly. 1) In the assembly strategy, the paper introduces a novel search metric. This metric automatically identifies the optimal inversion step for different editing pairs, enabling automatic control of editing difficulty. This approach allows different editing pairs to undergo separate denoising, preventing concept mismatch issues. Moreover, employing the search metric to find the optimal result represents a new paradigm in single-object editing. 2) In the reassembly strategy, the article suggests merging the editing regions and non-editing region during the reassembly step. This operation takes place in the denoise latent space. The reassembly process incorporates a re-inversion strategy, enhancing the image editing's edge smoothness, improving image editability, and enabling interaction across regions. 3) To assess OIR's capabilities, the authors collect two datasets, which are employed to evaluate both the single-object editing proficiency of the search metric and the multi-object editing capability of OIR. Numerous experimental results indicate that the search metric performs on par with existing state-of-the-art editing methods in single-object editing tasks. Moreover, in multi-object editing tasks, OIR demonstrates strong performance, outperforming the previous SOTA methods

### Strengths
1.	This paper identifies a fundamental challenge in multi-object image editing tasks. Previous methods typically treat an entire image as a whole entity during multi-object editing, without considering that editing pairs may have varying levels of editing complexity and therefore require different optimal inversion steps.
2.	The new search metric introduced in this article is simple yet effective. The approach of adding the two evaluation indicators makes sense, and visual verification confirms that the search metric aligns with the editing effect. In single-object editing tasks, employing the search metric yields promising results, comparable to other image editing methods.
3.	The OIR introduced in this article is novel and effective, presenting a new solution for the multi-object editing task. Unlike previous approaches, which treated the entire image as a whole, OIR breaks down the task into editing pairs. The experimental comparisons with other methods are extensive and thorough.
4.	The paper's structure is well-organized and easy to follow. The figures are well-designed, effectively illustrating the ideas and claims presented.

### Weaknesses
1.	In [a], it is mentioned that the inversion step can be considered as a fixed hyperparameter. However, the author only presents the results of the optimal inversion steps for example images, without demonstrating the overall distribution trend of the optimal inversion step across the entire dataset. This makes it difficult to assess the generalizability of the proposed search metric. It is unclear whether the selected examples are representative of the broader dataset. Furthermore, the paper lacks a detailed analysis of the characteristics of editing pairs that require larger or smaller optimal inversion steps. Without this analysis, it's hard to understand the underlying factors that influence the optimal inversion step, limiting the interpretability of the proposed method.
2.	In the reassembly strategy of OIR discussed in this paper, both reassembly step and re-inversion are mentioned. The paper indicates that both methods can smooth the edges of images and enable global information interaction. Re-inversion first inverts the spliced latent and then denoises it, essentially increasing the denoise step. The paper does not provide a clear justification for why re-inversion is necessary, and it is not clear if simply increasing the reassembly steps could achieve similar results. The paper should provide a more detailed analysis of the differences between these two approaches and the specific benefits of re-inversion over simply increasing the reassembly step.

### Summary
This paper introduces advancements in text-driven image editing using diffusion-based methods. Existing techniques involve a fixed number of inversion steps to edit images aligned with a target prompt, but the optimal number of steps varies for different editing pairs. The paper introduces a new approach called Object-aware Inversion and Reassembly (OIR) to enable fine-grained, object-level editing. The object-level fine-grained editing is achieved by segmentation from SAM. It uses a search metric to determine the optimal inversion step for each editing pair and combines them for the final edited image, demonstrating superior performance, especially in multi-object editing scenarios.

### Strengths
1. The paper is well written, and the idea is clearly demonstrated through figures.

2. Although it is natural to do some grid search on the inversion steps when doing image editing, this paper introduces a systematic and principled way to do the search with a quantitative metric.

3. The idea of working on each object separately and reassemble is a interesting way to do multi-object editing.

4. Results are competitive compared to other inversion based editing techniques.

### Weaknesses
1. The method introduces significant computational overhead. For each input image, it has to run a search for optimal denoising steps for  each edit pair. The search process can be very time consuming. as it requires denoising from each inversion step, plus a metric calculation step. The overall amount of computation for a single image editing task can thus be very large.

2. It relies on SAM to do fine-grained segmentation of the input image to localize the object, and then do localized editing followed by resembling. However, it has some limitations. For example, the segmentation may not work well for small object. In addition, using SAM constrained the edit to object-level, while the applicability of more global change is questionable (e.g., change the style of an image from spring to winter, change the background to Mars, etc.). It may not be able to change the location of an object. 

3. Related to above point, the competitive method, such as null-text inversion, does not involve segmentation and localization, therefore it is a bit unfair to compare with them, as in principle they can only benefit from the segmentation and localization. This is independent from the main innovation of this paper, which is searching for optimal inversion step.

4. Overall, it is a method that combines multiple existing component, with significant increase in compute. Therefore, the contribution and significance of the method is limited.

### Summary
This paper achieves high-quality object-level image editing through a simple yet effective method. Authors find that the editing for different parts requires different noising levels used to inverse the given image to latent space. As such, they search for optimal inversion steps for different parts based on a search metric for both the edited and non-edited regions respectively. In order to produce a natural final result, the results of different parts are seamlessly blended, which yields a harmonic and globally coherent editing output. Albeit its simplicity, the proposed method outperforms competitive works when editing real images and shows promise in real usage.

### Strengths
- This paper identifies an interesting and useful phenomenon that the structure of different objects corresponds to a different level of latent as modeled in the diffusion process. To achieve the optimal trade-off between semantic preservation and text-based editing, the optimal number of inversion steps can be determined based on a quantitative measure. 

- The image editing results are indeed impressive, as shown in the main text and the appendix. Both the quantitative and qualitative results demonstrate the advantage over strong prior works. 

- Since the denoising process of different image parts is disentangled, the proposed method supports fine-grained multiple object editing, which is not featured in prior works.  

- The parallel denoising strategy effectively reduces the search speed.

### Weaknesses
 - One major drawback of the method is the search speed. Since the inversion steps of each editing part should be comprehensively searched, this may pose a challenge when editing for multiple regions. It would be interesting to conduct a coarse-to-fine search strategy for speedup. Moreover, in the paper, it is suggested to report the image editing speed for different methods since some other baselines, like prompt-to-prompt, can edit images in a feed-forward manner.

 - Some writing parts can be improved for better clarity. For example, what's the detailed formulation of min-max normalization? It is suggested to better rephrase the term "concept mismatch".

 - Since the re-inversion step is always set to 20% of the total steps, the non-edit regions will inevitably be affected. Such subtle change is particularly apparent for faces and small objects.

### Questions
The proposed method determines the starting point in the latent space to deviate the semantics of the objects. I think this search strategy is orthogonal to other editing methods that manipulate the latent based on the textural prompt. Hence, I wonder whether the proposed method is compatible with other editing methods, like null inversion. I would like to hear the authors' feedback regarding this.
