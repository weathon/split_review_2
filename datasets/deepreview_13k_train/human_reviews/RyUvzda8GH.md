- Decision: Accept
- Scores: 6, 6, 6, 3

## Abstract
Predictive coding networks are neuroscience-inspired models with roots in both Bayesian statistics and neuroscience. Training such models, however, is quite inefficient and unstable. In this work, we show how by simply changing the temporal scheduling of the update rule for the synaptic weights leads to an algorithm that is much more efficient and stable than the original one, and has theoretical guarantees in terms of convergence. The proposed algorithm, that we call incremental predictive coding (iPC) is also more biologically plausible than the original one, as it it fully automatic. In an extensive set of experiments, we show that iPC constantly performs better than the original formulation on a large number of benchmarks for image classification, as well as for the training of both conditional and masked language models, in terms of test accuracy, efficiency, and convergence with respect to a large set of hyperparameters.

### Confidence
4: You are confident in your assessment, but not absolutely certain. It is unlikely, but not impossible, that you did not understand some parts of the submission or that you are unfamiliar with some pieces of related work.

### Summary
Predictive coding presumably uses an EM-like algorithm for learning representation and for making inferences. The authors of this paper proposed a method called incremental predictive coding that allows all computations involving learning and inference to take place locally, simultaneously, and autonomously. The results speak for themselves. iPC achieves accuracy comparable to BP and even lower calibration error than BP.

### Strengths
It is rather impressive that iPC can achieve accuracy comparable to BP, and lower calibration error than BP.  If this unsupervised learning algorithm can run as fast as BP, it could be fairly significant.

### Weaknesses
Even though the work could be important and the paper is well-written, the authors have archived the paper in public,  revealing their identities. Hence, this review is no longer double-blinded. This is perhaps an unfortunate oversight.

The intuition of WHY the algorithm works is not clearly explained.

### Summary
This paper proposes iterative predictive coding (iPC) a predictive coding algorithm aims to be faster and more scalable than traditional predictive coding approaches. The key algorithmic innovation is that both intermediate layer activations and weights are simultaneously minimized (well, alternating training every step) rather than allowing hidden state activations to equilibrate as in previous models. In a series of experiments using Gaussian models, iPC outperforms competing approaches.

### Strengths
- Advances the state of the art for predictive coding, which remains a highly promising idea without a commensurately performant implementation.
- Extends PC results beyond the small-scale experiments in previous work.
- Brings PC algorithms closer to biological reality, where computations run simultaneously in real time. 
- Strong set of experiments against comparison models.

### Weaknesses
 - I came away with the impression that the key algorithmic innovation is simply to alternate weight and hidden layer activations every step (without running either to convergence). It's quite hard to believe this hasn't been tried before. Is there something new here that makes this work?
- The analysis is limited to Gaussian networks, which limits the range of applicability of the learning rules in (6) and (7). 
- While the experiments are good, there is not much insight provided as to *why* this new approach works better.

### Questions
- The analysis in the paper is focused on feedforward Gaussian networks, but can these ideas be extended to networks with substantial recurrence? In the original PC formulation, it's these recurrent inputs that carry error signals, but I'm curious as to whether the "out of equilibrium" method proposed here would also be able to dynamically balance multiple kinds of feedback. 
- Put another way: how much biological plausibility is lost if the Gaussian and feedforward assumptions are relaxed to mirror more cortical-like networks.

### Summary
The paper introduces the incremental Predictive Coding (iPC) framework, a more biologically-plausible version of PC networks. It addresses the update locking problem in standard PC algorithms by parallelizing neural dynamics and learning steps using Neal \& Hinton's incremental expectation maximization. This advancement eliminates the need for a global control signal to switch between inference and learning steps. The paper evaluates the proposed method on image classification tasks and language models, comparing it to standard PC and backpropagation (BP) algorithms.

### Strengths
* The paper addresses an important problem in the field of biologically-plausible learning and is generally well-written.
* The efficiency gained by iPC is a notable contribution.
* The numerical experiments showcase improved results compared to standard PC and comparable results to BP.
* The experimental descriptions in the appendix and code availability enhance reproducibility.

### Weaknesses
The paper has some clarity issues in my opinion. Please see the following items and the questions section.

* Regarding the following sentence in the page 3: "For a detailed formulation on how this energy function is derived from the variational free energy of Eq. 2, we refer to ..., or to **the supplementary**", which supplementary section includes this derivation? I do not see it. 

* The caption of Table 1 should specify whether these are train or test accuracies.

* The sentence preceding the "Comparison with BP" section in page 6 seems redundant (seems to repeat the previous sentence); consider removing it if not necessary.

* Could you clarify which dataset the statement "reported the highest accuracy obtained" in Figure 3 refers to (train or test set)?

* The statement about iPC performing better on standard CNN than on AlexNet contradicts Table 1. According to Table 1, CNN accuracy is around 72\% whereas AlexNet accuracy is around 80\%. Therefore, iPC does not perform better on standard CNN than on AlexNet.

* The proposed method has one aspect that is not bio-plausible: it suffers from the weight transport problem, i.e. Eq. 6 requires the transpose of the forward mapping. I think this limitation can be discussed in Appendix section A (A Discussion on Biological Plausibility).

* There is an artificial empty space in the top right of page 19 caused by the caption of Figure 6.

* I think the plots in Figure 7 should include y-axis labels. Are they accuracy? energy? loss?

* I think the captions of Figure 7 and 8 should include more explanations.

### Questions
* It is not really intuitive  to me why PC with smaller T values converges faster (in terms of Energy in Figure 2). Could you give an insight about it, or elaborate it? 

* What is the meaning of the notation $\mathcal{O}(\text{max} n^l, n^l)$ on page 17?

### Summary
The paper proposes incremental predictive coding. At a high level, predictive coding is the idea that one way to see brain function is that there is a top down generative model whose parameters are updated based on discrepancy between model output and stimulus received from the environment. More specifically, this paper talks about a specific generative model: a hierarchical Gaussian generative model where the means are passed thru non-linear functions from layer to layer of a generative neural network, with the covariance held fixed at identity. The optimal solution to the generative model (given data) is of course intractable and the next best is the standard expectation maximization update algorithm. The authors point out that this is generally very slow since the expectation step takes a very long time to converge when you have multiple layers in the neural network/hierarchical model. The authors propose to overcome the speed issue with incremental expectation maximization ala Neal and Hinton where gradient steps are taken with the expectation and maximization step either interleaved or in parallel.

### Strengths
The paper does an excellent job of introducing the topic of predictive coding. For the particular case of a hierarchical Gaussian generative model, (which is the generative model this paper is concerned with), the paper meticulously works out the details of the EM objective function. And finally, the paper has comprehensive experiments demonstrating that incremental EM does better than EM timewise, when implemented for the neural network modeling the h-Gaussian generative model.

### Weaknesses
Unfortunately, all of the results are derivative of Neal and Hinton's incremental EM where they showed that both the expectation and the maximization step can be done at the same time and is a theoretically sound way of doing decent for model parameters. There is nothing that this paper contributes conceptually beyond this well known result. The hierarchical Gaussian generative model is also very well known. All in all, the paper lacks sorely in novelty of contribution.
