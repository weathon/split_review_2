- Decision: Reject
- Scores: 6, 5, 5, 5

## Abstract
\label{sec:abstract}
The extreme multi-label classification~(XMC) task involves learning a classifier that can predict from a large label set the most relevant subset of labels for a data instance. 
While deep neural networks~(DNNs) have demonstrated remarkable success in XMC problems, the task is still challenging because it must deal with a large number of output labels, which make the DNN training computationally expensive.
This paper addresses the issue by exploring the use of random circular vectors, where each vector component is represented as a complex amplitude.
In our framework, we can develop an output layer and loss function of DNNs for XMC by representing the final output layer as a fully connected layer that directly predicts a low-dimensional circular vector encoding a set of labels for a data instance.
We conducted experiments on synthetic datasets to verify that circular vectors have better label encoding capacity and retrieval ability than normal real-valued vectors.
Then, we conducted experiments on actual XMC datasets and found that these appealing properties of circular vectors contribute to significant improvements in task performance compared with a previous model using random real-valued vectors, while reducing the size of the output layers by up to 99\%.

### Summary
This paper is about improving the representative power of embeddings in Extreme Multi-label Learning (XML) with ideas from Holographic Reduced Representations (HRR). Typical XML approaches, which leverage a large linear classifier layer to map an input to a label set, have limitations: the linearity constraint restricts the modelling power while the enormous number of classifiers blow-up the time and space complexities. Several approaches have been proposed to mitigate the complexity issues, e.g. tree-search based and negative label mining based approaches. This paper alternatively proposes to use HRRs which learn classifiers in the Fourier-transformed space instead of the original linear embedding space, thus resulting in more powerful, non-linear classifier learning. The proposed approach also brings down the training complexity by leveraging loss functions that depend only on the positive labels (which are typically sparse).

The paper largely exploits the key ideas from earlier papers [HRR in Plate '95, HRR for XML in Ganesan et.al. '21]. In addition, it generalizes  [Ganesan et.al.'21] through Complex-valued HRR representations. Experiments demonstrate that, keeping other factors constant, the accuracy with CHRR > HRR > naive fully connected XML classifier layer.

### Strengths
* The paper introduces the innovative idea of complex-valued holographic reduced representations (CHRR) for XML tasks which can significantly improve the XML prediction accuracy over and above that achieved by real-valued HRR

* Experiments demonstrate the efficacy of proposed approach on several moderately large-scaled XML datasets in terms of P and PSP gains

### Weaknesses
 * The contributions of this paper are rather limited. The key ideas behind adapting HRR to XML, such as unitary normalization and HRR XML loss, have been borrowed from [Ganesan et.al. '21]. The main novelty lies in generalizing real to complex HRR. While this is useful, its efficiency-accuracy trade-offs relative to original HRR have not been well established.

* The experimental validation of proposed approach is weak. 
- Datasets involve moderate scale XML datasets and none from >1 million scale
- Datasets considered are bag-of-words based whereas contemporary XML literature has shifted focus to transformer-learnt representations
- Model architecture considered is based on fully-connected layers whereas contemporary XML literature has shifted focus to transformers
- No comparison is provided with existing schemes to reduce training complexity such as tree, hashing or negative label sampling based approaches
- Even though the main claim of this paper is to reduce training complexity, no training time comparisons have been reported
- Due to all these factors, the real utility and impact towards XML field due to this paper is hard to evaluate. A substantial amount of additional work is needed in this direction

* The proposed approach only improves training time and does not appear to reduce prediction time or memory requirements which are also important requirements in XML

### Questions
* What are the cost-accuracy trade-offs of CHRR vs HRR with cost measured in wallclock time and ram requirements?
* How does CHRR fare relative to FC and HRR on BERT based architectures and on datasets with much larger quantity of labels?
* What are the relative advantages and disadvantages of CHRR versus tree, hashing or negative label sampling based approaches to reduce XML training and prediction complexities ?

### Summary
Existing DNN methods for XMC problem often consist of a large output label matrix where each column corresponds to a trainable label vector. This paper proposes the use of random circular vectors as non-learnable label vectors, which significantly reduce the trainable model parameters. The author proposed Circular-HRR (CHRR), which represents random circular vectors in complex domain, and designs a model architecture that predicts a low-dimensional circular vector. On moderate-size XMC datasets, the proposed CHRR method performs better than the fully-connected baseline as well as the previous method HRR.

### Strengths
1. The overall presentation of the paper is clear and easy to follow

2. Using circular vectors with complex amplitude is technically sound

### Weaknesses
1. CHRR do not reduce model parameters at the inference stage, compared to the FC baseline.

2. The inference time complexity of CHRR is as high as `O(L)`  while FC and HRR can be `O(log(L))`. The similarity computation in CHRR involves complex operations (cosine calculation), which prevents the use of fast approximate nearest neighbor search methods, unlike FC and HRR which can leverage these techniques for efficient inference.

3. The experiment results are not very comprehensive. see detailed questions below.

### Questions
1. The proposed method (CHRR) reduces the "trainable" model parameters by using a non-learnable label matrix at the training stage. However, CHRR do not reduce the model parameters at inference stage, because it still need to store the non-learnable label matrix for finding top-k most relevant labels, given the model-predicted output random circular vector. What's the model parameters used at inference time, compared to HRR and FC?

2. At the inference stage, to compute similarity between the label matrix and the model predicted random circular vector, CHRR seems to involve more complex computations (Table 1) that is non-standard euclidean distance metric. This suggests CHRR can not enjoy the advantage of fast/approximate nearest neighbor search methods that reduces the inference time complexity from `O(L)` to `O(log(L))` where `L` is the number of labels. On the other hand, HRR can actually leverage ANN search methods at the inference stage. Any analysis on the inference time complexity and the actually inference latency? 

3. The experiment results are not very comprehensive:
(1) There should be a table comparing the model size at training/inference stage, and the detail hyper-parameters such as `h` and `d`.
(2) Compared to the FC baseline, It is not clear whether the performance gain of CHRR is from larger model size (including the non-learnable label matrix). 
(3) The proposed method did not compare with more advanced XMC methods, such as Transformer-based encoders.

### Summary
This paper proposes a new strategy to mitigate the large computational and resource expenses of deep neural networks in the context of the extreme multi-label classification task. The authors advocate using random circular vectors as the prediction of the final layer of classifiers, where each vector component is represented as a complex amplitude. The authors claim that the proposed method helps to decrease the scale of output layers and improve performance. The provided experiments confirm this assertion.

### Strengths
- The authors proposed an approach to improve the ability to represent data instances that belong to many classes.

 - The authors provide extensive experiments to prove that the proposed approach outperforms its counterpart.

 - The proposed approach (CHRR) involves double output nodes in comparison with HRR, however, experiments show that by halving CHRR nodes into two groups, CHRR-Half is able to maintain similar performance while mitigating the scaling problem.

### Weaknesses
 - The variances of the proposed model (CHRR-sin, CHRR-tanh) show minimal empirical improvement in the provided experiments. The motivation of it is also ambiguous. The authors are recommended to provide more details to explain or reconstruct this part.

 - Specifically, the absolute value of CHRR appears to be comparable between Figure 5(a)/6(a) and Figure 5(b)/6(b), but this consistency is not reflected in Figure 5(c)/6(c), even though they exhibit very similar trends. It is advised that the authors thoroughly review their figures and tables to eliminate any potential errors or misuses. If this is not the case, the authors are encouraged to provide a clear explanation of the notable performance improvement.

-  The authors give less-than-convincing explanation on the problem of `Wiki10-31K P@1` performance. The increase `Wiki10-31K P@5` and `Wiki10-31K P@10`  would not be as dramatic as it is if the explanation is valid. The authors are recommended to provide a convincing explanation of this problem.

- The authors underscore that the proposed methods reduce the size of the output layer, but few details are provided. On what criteria do the authors conclude that the output size is reduced by 59%~97%? What is the figure for each experiment? 

- The details of network FC are not provided. The authors claim that they adopt the code provided by Ganesan et al 2021 but no further information is available.  The authors should provide a clear setting for it.



### Questions
- Can authors provide any insight on the performance degradation in Fig 7(a, b) other than section5.4?
