# Out-of-Distribution Detection with Hyperspherical Energy

- Decision: Reject
- Scores: 5, 5, 6, 3

## Abstract
The ability to detect if inputs are out-of-distribution (OOD) is essential to guarantee the reliability and safety of machine learning models that are deployed in an open environment. Recent studies have shown that an energy-based score is effective. However, unconstrained energy scores from a model trained with cross-entropy loss may not necessarily reflect the log-likelihood. To address this limitation, we introduce a novel hyperspherical energy score that connects energy with hyperspherical representations. By modeling hyperspherical representations using von Mises-Fisher distribution, our method provides a more accurate interpretation from a log-likelihood perspective, making it an efficient OOD detection indicator. Our method consistently achieves competitive performance on popular OOD detection benchmarks. On the large-scale ImageNet-1k benchmark, our method is more than 10 times faster than the KNN-based score, while simultaneously reducing the average FPR95 by 11.85%.

### Summary
The authors study out-of-distribution (OOD) detection for classification problems.

They propose hyperspherical energy, an OOD detection method that combines energy-based OOD detection (Liu et al., 2020) with recent hyperspherical-based approaches such as CIDER (Ming et al., 2023). Compared to CIDER, the proposed method utilizes a parametric score function (instead of a kNN-based one).

The proposed method is evaluated with CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100 and ImageNet-1k as ID datasets, and SVHN, Places365, LSUN, iSUN and Textures as OOD datasets. It achieves better (CIFAR-100 and ImageNet, Table 3-4) or similar (CIFAR-10, Table 6) FPR95/AUROC compared to CIDER and other common strong baselines.

### Strengths
The proposed method makes sense overall. Combining hyperspherical-based and energy-based methods intuitively seems like a good idea.

The proposed method achieves good performance compared to both the hyperspherical-based and energy-based approaches.

### Weaknesses
The paper could be a bit more well-written overall (see "Minor things" in Questions below).

I found it somewhat difficult to follow Section 3.1 and 3.2, I think that the proposed method could be described more clearly. I think it would help if more background on CIDER (Ming et al., 2023) was provided before Section 3.

The experimental results are not analyzed in much detail. The OOD detection performance (FPR95/AUROC) is evaluated _relative_ to other methods, but nothing is said about the performance in _absolute_ terms. For example in Table 3, is an average FPR95 of 38.5 actually good? Why is there such a big performance difference between Places365 and LSUN? In which cases does the model fail to distinguish between ID and OOD examples? Why?

### Questions
1. What can be said of the _absolute_ OOD detection performance of the proposed method? For example in Table 3, is an average FPR95 of 38.5 good? Does the method actually perform well? In the Introduction you write _"The ability to detect OOD samples is crucial for ensuring the reliability and safety of machine learning models, especially in real-world applications where the consequences of misidentifying OOD samples can be severe"_, does the method perform well enough for this important task?

2. Can anything be said about common failure cases? For example, why is there such a big performance difference between Places365 and LSUN?

3. Does the proposed method have any limitations?

4. Could the proposed OOD detection approach be extended to regression problems (I am mostly just curious)?


Minor things:
- In equation (13), is $\mathcal{L}$ the loss from equation (12)? ($\mathcal{L}$ is not really defined anywhere?)
- I was confused by how $\cdot$ is used both to multiply scalars (e.g. in (1) and (5)) and vectors (e.g. $\mu_c \cdot z$ in (6) and (7)).
- Introduction, "Hyperspherical energy vs. energy" bullet point, "Liu et al. (2020) employ cross-entropy loss and derive energy from the unconstrained Euclidean space": cross-entropy loss --> a/the cross-entropy loss?
- Introduction, "Hyperspherical energy vs. energy" bullet point, "constrained hyperspherical distribution": distribution --> distributions?
- Introduction, "Hyperspherical energy vs. energy" bullet point, "our method enjoys ... theoretical property": This sounds a bit odd?
- Section 2, "EBM (Lecun et al., 2006) captures...": EBM --> An EBM?
- Section 2, "a connection between EBM and discriminative models": EBM --> EBMs?
- Section 2, "Limitation of Liu et al. (2020)" paragraph: This description is perhaps a bit too short/condensed?
- Section 3.3: "SupCon loss’s formulation" --> "SupCon's loss formulation"?
- Section 3.3: Add a reference for SupCon?

### Summary
This paper addresses the critical challenge of Out-of-Distribution (OOD) detection in machine learning models. It introduces a novel framework known as "Hyperspherical Energy" for OOD detection, which connects energy with hyperspherical representations, offering a rigorous perspective from a log-likelihood standpoint. The method is designed to provide a reliable and theoretically justified OOD detection indicator, addressing the limitations of energy-based scores derived from models trained with cross-entropy loss. Hyperspherical energy operates on latent embeddings, modeled as hyperspherical embeddings with constant norm, and is based on the negative log partition function of the Gibbs-Boltzmann distribution. The paper includes theoretical derivations and optimization techniques. Notably, the proposed method demonstrates competitive performance on OOD detection benchmarks, outperforming some baselines. The paper highlights the key distinctions and advantages of Hyperspherical Energy compared to conventional energy-based methods and non-parametric density estimation techniques. It is shown to achieve both strong empirical performance and theoretical soundness.

### Strengths
The proposed idea in this work is both novel and intriguing. The paper is commendably well-written, with a clear problem statement and easy-to-follow presentation. The authors not only provide solid theoretical proofs but also back their claims with experimental studies that demonstrate the promising performance of the proposed method.

### Weaknesses
The literature review in this paper exhibits a notable limitation as it primarily concentrates on a subset of OOD detection methods, while omitting recent approaches like [1,2,3,4]. Additionally, the experimental evaluation appears to lack comprehensiveness as it does not encompass recent OOD detection methods. Furthermore, a critical point of consideration is that the proposed method involves a training phase, whereas several OOD detection techniques necessitate minimal or no training, rendering them more practical and applicable in real-world scenarios. The paper also lacks a detailed analysis of the computational cost associated with the proposed method, especially when compared to simpler, training-free alternatives. This is a crucial aspect for practical deployment, as the overhead of training could outweigh the benefits in resource-constrained environments. The performance variations across different datasets also need further investigation, as the method's effectiveness seems inconsistent, with significant improvements on some datasets but marginal gains on others.

### Questions
The paper would benefit from a more elaborate discussion that highlights the distinct advantages of the proposed method compared to recent OOD detection studies, such as references [1,2,3,4]. Specifically, it would be valuable to clarify what sets this approach apart, especially considering the promising performance of ASH[4], which is both fast and does not necessitate any training.

In light of the growing interest in training-free OOD detection methods, it would be intriguing to explore the possibility of customizing your approach to require minimal or no training, enhancing its real-world applicability.

Including density plots that demonstrate the OOD and in-distribution densities using your method and the baseline approaches would provide a more comprehensive visual understanding of the results.

Additionally, it would be beneficial to delve deeper into the reasons behind the observed variations in your method's performance compared to the Energy score (Figure 2), particularly when it significantly outperforms the Energy score on datasets like SVHN and LSUN but demonstrates marginal improvements on other datasets such as Places 365. This elucidation would enhance the paper's clarity and insights.

### Summary
This paper tackles the problem of ouf-of-distribution (OOD) detection by learning a representation that follows a
mixture of Von Mises-Fisher distributions. Then, on test time, they compute the Helmholtz free energy or the negative log partition function of the reconstructed logits with the class conditional prototypes and the embedding of the test sample. They run experiments on common image classification OOD detection benchmarks on CIFAR
and ImageNet datasets.

### Strengths
They propose a theoretically grounded parametric similarity score based on the representations learned under an energy-based model.

They achieve good experimental results on CIFAR and ImageNet for a ResNet model.

The paper is well-presented and easy to follow.

### Weaknesses
Their method requires special training that might be hard to transfer to any domain or any scale 
(e.g., how to pick the best temperature parameter, etc). On the ImageNet dataset,
they are obliged to fine-tune only the last residual block of a pre-trained ResNet to achieve good results. I wonder if there are instabilities on the training of the entire network or if the generalization error is elevated.

Sufficient empirical investigation is lacking to justify some claims of the paper. How does the model perform on vision transformers for instance? Are the learned representations still useful for OOD detection?

Their contribution seems incremental w.r.t previous work, especially CIDER and SIREN. Differences w.r.t SIREN 
are not discussed in Section 3.3.

Discussion on the limitations of the method is missing.

### Questions
1. Why did the authors freeze the first blocks of the backbone? If I understood correctly,
the network was first trained with a supervised contrastive objective and then trained with the loss function of Eq. (13). 
2. I suggest the authors better discuss the differences of their method w.r.t SIREN.
3. I suggest running experiments with vision transformers to strengthen your empirical contributions and the relevance
of the proposed method. Or adjusting the claims accordingly.
4. Could the authors provide experimental details to obtain the results in Table 2? 
Additionally, error bars and the number of tries on the results would be appreciated.
5. Could the authors provide error bars for their results by training on multiple random seeds? I believe this would strengthen their
empirical contributions.

### Summary
This paper formulates hyperspherical embedding to enhance out-of-distribution (OOD) performance. From the training perspective, the authors train a hyperspherical embedding based on the von Mises-Fisher distribution based on the MLE objective. Then, they use the hyperspherical free energy as a test objective. The authors show the efficacy of the proposed method in out-of-distribution detection benchmarks with varying sizes. Furthermore, as the evaluation metric does not rely on the nearest neighbors, the method significantly excels in computational speed compared to alternative out-of-distribution methods that rely on the test scores.

### Strengths
(1) The method itself is simple and easy to understand.\
(2) The method is computationally appealing since it does not use nearest-neighbor search.

### Weaknesses
Although I am fond of the simple and efficient out-of-distribution detection algorithm as a baseline for further research, I have various concerns about this paper, including novelty, clarity, and significance.

Originality
(1) Authors train the hyperspherical embedding via MLE loss, as done in previous papers [1,2]. 
(2) Authors focus on novelty in testing measures but this is just a proxy term for the negative log-likelihood. Although the perception of novelty is subjective, I also do not find this high-level concept of applying likelihood for OOD detection surprising or novel.

Clarity
(1) While this paper's concept is simple, the paper lacks details.
(2) For example, I found it confusing to directly compare CIDER, SIREN, and the proposed loss function since CIDER and SIREN impose additional regularization terms. 
(3) Or a basic specification for random variable z.

Significance
(1) The paper frameworks the work as cross-entropy vs hyperspherical embeddings. But I do not think the comparison is fair. Classifiers trained by cross-entropy loss are widespread and easily collected in the wild. A strategy tailored to output OOD detection statistics from pre-trained classifiers via CE loss gets its merit due to its ubiquity. However, I do not feel the same applies to the hyperspherical embeddings. Instead, this is a pre-training strategy like [3,4]. Hence, I feel like the method should be **compared against various state-of-the-art** OOD detection methods when (image, label) information is given.
(2) I find the gain of this method as a postprocessing strategy is limited. For example, [5] scores 94.28%, [6] scores 95.06%, and greatly outperforms the performance of this method despite being trained on the CE loss. While this method can benefit its performance by combining such methods, it is not sure in the current experiment results and should be verified via extra experiments.
(3) Furthermore, I am also skeptical of hyperspherical embedding as a training strategy that learns better representation **in general**. A recently proposed benchmark of [7] compares CIDER [2] (which originates from the same training framework as this paper) to other strategies and shows its deficit in Near-OODs (e.g. SSB-Hard, NINCO) even compared to a simple rotation prediction strategy [8]. Moreover, it scores the worst among all compared to pretraining strategies. I think the bold assumption of this paper of showcasing hyperspherical embedding as an effective training loss should be verified by comparing other strategies (e.g. AugMix, RandAugment, RegMixup) on such challenging OOD, instead of comparing against only easy ones.
(4) While I mainly focused on criticizing on ImageNet-1k dataset, the same reasoning can be applied to CIFAR-100 given the low scores in Table 1. of [7].

In summary,  given that this work is outperformed by various works that perform OOD detection on a classifier trained by CE or other strategies, I do not find any reason why should we train the classifier on hyperspherical embeddings (which is a very time-consuming task, especially for larger real-world datasets) and then perform OOD detection. Furthermore, I feel like this paper proposes a straightforward combination of existing works: hyperspherical embedding for training and energy function for OOD detection. Hence, I lean towards rejection.

### Questions
Questions\
(1) Are the training loss function of CIDER and the paper the same in the experiment? ID Acc of two is exactly the same in Table 5 but the loss function in the CIDER paper is different.\
(2) Does the proposed loss show efficacy in detecting near-OOD datasets? (e.g. SSB-Hard, NINCO in [7])\
(3) How does the proposed method perform against the common corruption?


Suggestions\
(1) To show the efficacy of the proposed method as the training strategy to learn **better representations**, consider comparison against training methods mentioned in the OpenOOD 1.5 [7] benchmark in more various OOD datasets not resorting to easier Far-OOD ones.\
(2) To show the efficacy of the proposed hyperspherical energy as a post-hoc inference strategy, consider comparison against Post-hoc inference methods mentioned in the weakness section and the OpenOOD 1.5 [7] benchmark.\
(3) Please specify z before use in the introduction section.
