# DEEP NEURAL NETWORK INITIALIZATION WITH SPARSITY INDUCING ACTIVATIONS

- Decision: Accept
- Scores: 6, 8, 6, 6

## Abstract
Inducing and leveraging sparse activations during training and inference is a promising avenue for improving the computational efficiency of deep networks, which is increasingly important as network sizes continue to grow and their application becomes more widespread.  Here we use the large width Gaussian process limit to analyze the behaviour, at random initialization, of nonlinear activations that induce sparsity in the hidden outputs.  A previously unreported form of training instability is proven for arguably two of the most natural candidates for hidden layer sparsification; those being a shifted ReLU ($\phi(x)=\max(0, x-\tau)$ for $\tau\ge 0$) and soft thresholding ($\phi(x)=0$ for $|x|\le\tau$ and $x-\text{sign}(x)\tau$ for $|x|>\tau$).  We show that this instability is overcome by clipping the nonlinear activation magnitude, at a level prescribed by the shape of the associated Gaussian process variance map. Numerical experiments verify the theory and show that the proposed magnitude clipped sparsifying activations can be trained with training and test fractional sparsity as high as 85\% while retaining close to full accuracy.

### Summary
The paper studies the effect of sparsity on the activation function for deep neural network initialization using the existing dynamical isometry and edge of stability theory. In particular, the authors compute the so-called variance map and correlation maps for sparse activating functions, namely, shifted ReLU and soft thresholding, and interpret the shape of these maps, in particular, the values $V'(q^*)$ and $V''(q^*)$ to explain the failure. Then they propose magnitude clipping as a remedy and empirically show that with these magnitude-clipped sparse activation functions, it is possible to train the deep net without losing test accuracy and with high test fractional sparsity.

### Strengths
The paper introduces two natural classes of activation functions with a tunable parameter $\tau$. I think understanding what activation function works better for which purpose is an active and fascinating area which I also believe is to appeal to general interest. Sparsity is particularly an important goal to achieve for modern large deep learning. Making sure that the network has non-exploding or non-vanishing gradients at initialization is indeed a sufficient condition for the applicability of an activation function.

The introduction is well-written. 

On the flip side, I am not entirely sure why sparse ReLU fails to train. Table 2 only shows results for magnitude clipping for CReLU and the usual ReLU with $\tau=0$.

### Weaknesses
I have three major questions that I wasn't able to resolve by reading the main text only.

1. What is the criterion on $V_\phi$ for successful training? For example, let's see Figure 2. Which of the shapes are good and expected to train well vs which are the ones that are expected to fail? I see that for $\tau=1$ the curves have higher curvature. In particular, the blue curve intersects the line $x=y$ at one point where the derivative is non-zero but the curvature is positive. Is this expected to fail because the derivative is non-zero? I found the explanations in the text somehow repetitive and hard to parse. Can the authors explain the criterion on $V_\phi$ in words just from Figure 2? 

2. Can the authors please provide experiments with CReLU $m=0$ as well and also for ReLU in Table 2? Why is there only one row for ReLU?
As the table stands now, I am not convinced that sparse activation functions without magnitude clipping fail to train. Is the 'unstable training dynamics' reported in the paper for very large $s$ and small $m$ as claimed in the conclusion?



### Questions
Also, I do not understand the heuristics given in Section 3.1 for how to choose $m$. I understand the dependence of $V'(q^*)$ and $V''(q^*)$ on the magnitude value $m$ is non-trivial from Figure 4. Still, the curves follow regular shapes so maybe it is possible to give simple heuristics based on Figure 4?

I will consider increasing my score based on the author's response to my questions.

### Summary
The paper aims to encourage high sparsity in the activations of neural networks with the motivation to reduce computational cost. To this end, the authors study the activation dynamics induced by common sparsity inducing nonlinearities such as ReLU and Soft-Thresholding (ST) under random initialization. The authors, via the large width Gaussian process limit of neural networks, discover a training instability for ReLU and ST nonlinearities. They show that the instability can be resolved by clipping the outputs of these nonlinearities. The authors validate the theory through experiments and show that the modification allows training MLPs and CNNs with very sparse activations with no or little reduce in test accuracy.

### Strengths
* The writing is very clear and easy to follow.
* The theory is elegant.
* The theory works in practice and the authors effectively demonstrate being able to train neural networks while maintaining high activation sparsity.

### Weaknesses
Minor weaknesses:
* There could have been a study of the computational efficiency since that is the main motivation of the work.

### Questions
Questions:
- Is this the first time that the variance map equations are being derived for these non-linearities?

Minor:
- Plots of Figure 2 are missing axis labels and the plot legends are not readable on printed paper.

### Summary
The authors study sparsity inducing non-linear activation functions in neural network training. They provide a theoretical analysis of the instability effects for using shifted ReLU and SoftThreshold when training FeedForward networks and CNNs, motivating their clipped versions of these functions. The authors use the previously introduced EoC initialization and show why training is stable, and becomes unstable with the introduction of a modified ReLU activation function that should induce sparsity.
To remedy the instability in training a further modification (clipping) is introduced and proven to be theoretically stable. They then demonstrate the feasibility of their CReLU and CST activation functions for training deep and wide networks on MNIST and CIFAR10, showing only minor degradation in prediction accuracy with tunable levels of activation sparsity.

Overall, the paper is nicely written and relatively easy to follow, despite the math-heavy theoretical section. The argumentation on instability of the shifter ReLU and SoftThreshold seems valid, and the experiments, though not extensive, provide a proof-of-concept of the author’s claim. The idea of clipping the activation functions to achieve stability is as simple as it is effective, providing a valid contribution that can be actually translated into application.  However, a bit more in-depth evaluation of certain aspects would be nice. The findings are interesting, though presentation is lacking, as well as more exploration of the introduced concept.

### Strengths
- The proposed clipped functions are an easy and natural extension of already existing activation functions.
- The introduced parameters tau and m are able to control sparsity and training stability as shown theoretically and experimentally.

### Weaknesses
 - The stddev in table 2 are a bit odd to me, either a higher numerical precision is needed, or it needs to be explained why the are many cases of zero std.
- Results on ST are only shown in the appendix. They should be shown and discussed in the main paper, given that they are an essential part in the rest of the manuscript.
- the higher sparsity regime in table 2 (s=0.85) needs to be explored/explained more, there are interesting things happening.
- There is no comparison to existing methods, but the authors clearly describe the lack of related research.
- No source Code provided, implementation details on experiments only in the appendix
- I don’t fully understand the meaning of Figure 4 and it is not sufficiently discussed in the manuscript.
- The important EoC concept is not motived and explained enough.

### Summary
The paper studies how very deep neural networks, including densely connected and convolutional networks, behave at initialization when using sparsity inducing activation functions. The two natural sparsity-inducing functions studied in the paper are the shifted ReLU activation, which is just a ReLU with a fixed bias, and the soft thresholding function, an activation that evaluates to zero in some fixed interval. The main result shows that these activations make the initialization unstable for very deep networks. This instability can be fixed by using a clipped version of these activation functions. The authors show some experiments, demonstrating that deep networks can be trained with a clipped version of the above activation functions, with minor drop in accuracy.

### Strengths
Using sparse networks, with sparse activations and/or sparse weights, is an important field of study, and it seems that the paper gives some contributions on how the activation function of the network should be adapted to support training networks with sparse activations. This work can potentially serve as a basis for future works on building sparse neural networks.
The theoretical analysis of sparse activation functions, their problematic behavior at initialization of deep networks and the solution of clipping the weights is to my understanding novel.

### Weaknesses
The main weakness I find in the paper is that while the motivation for the paper comes from a practical perspective, namely building neural networks with sparse activations that can be implemented more efficiently in practice, it seems that the applicability of the results is not clear. To my understanding, the results only apply for very deep neural networks (the experiments use 100-layer networks). The authors should clarify whether or not their results apply to networks of reasonable depth. Specifically, it would be good to show some experiment for networks of reasonable depth and show how the activation choice affects the behavior. It seems that in this setting depth is only hurting performance, so while it is in theory interesting to analyze how such deep networks should be trained, it seems that the applicability of this method is limited.

The authors should also discuss the effect of adding residual connections on the stability of the network training. As residual-networks has been the main solution for training very deep networks, the authors should clarify whether their results also apply for residual networks.

Additionally, it seems that some of the experiments were left out of the main paper, and only appear in the appendix (for example, studying the CST activation and comparing the clipped activations with non-clipped ones). These are key experiments in the paper and should appear in the main text.
