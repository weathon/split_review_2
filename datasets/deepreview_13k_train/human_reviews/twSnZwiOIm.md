- Decision: Accept
- Scores: 6, 6, 6, 6

## Abstract
We consider the general class of time-homogeneous stochastic dynamical systems, both discrete and continuous, and study the problem of learning 
a representation of the state that faithfully captures its dynamics. This is instrumental to learning the transfer operator or the generator of the system, which in turn can be used for numerous tasks, such as forecasting and interpreting the system dynamics.
We show that the search for a good representation can be cast as an optimization problem over neural networks. Our approach is supported by recent results in statistical learning theory, highlighting the role of approximation error and metric distortion in the learning problem.
The objective function {we propose} is associated with projection operators {from the} representation space {to the} data space, overcomes metric distortion, and can be empirically estimated from data. 
In the discrete-time setting, we further derive a relaxed objective function that is differentiable and numerically well-conditioned. We compare our method against state-of-the-art approaches on different datasets, showing better performance across the board.

### Summary
This paper proposes a method for learning a representation of continuous and discrete stochastic dynamical systems that achieves state of the art results on many datasets.

### Strengths
1. The paper identifies the learning problem as an optimization problem and provides an efficient way to solve it. To overcome singularity, they have a relaxed score function and they also prove that the relaxed score has theoretical guarantees. The proof is mathematically solid.

2. Many experiments are done to verify their claims with impressive results.

### Weaknesses
1. The computation for covariances for $\psi_{w_j}$ and $\psi'_{w_j}$ might be costly. How does this computation cost compare to the previous methods? Is there a way to speed up?

2. For the continuous-time dynamic, the score function might be unstable. Have you observed this in experiments?

### Summary
This paper presents a relatively new approach to learning the operator for dynamical systems. Instead of one-step modeling of the neural operator, the authors suggest first learning the invariant representations, and then leveraging these learned representations to perform operator regression. The authors assessed their results on various datasets, including an ordered MNIST, a 2D fluid flow, and a molecular dynamics simulation, primarily using metrics such as spectral error and RMSE.

### Strengths
This paper provides a new way of learning invariant representations of dynamical system.
The authors provide theoretical justifications for the derivation of their objectives functions.

### Weaknesses
W1. The pipeline design suggests that there might be a possibility of error accumulation from the first phase of learning representations to the second phase of learning dynamics. It would be beneficial if the authors could provide empirical justification to show that their design is comparable to or better than learning the neural operator in a single step. Specifically, the paper lacks a direct comparison against established methods like FNO or DeepONet, which are designed for learning solution operators of PDEs and could serve as strong baselines. The absence of such comparisons makes it difficult to assess the relative performance of the proposed two-step approach, particularly in scenarios where end-to-end training might be more effective.

W2. Tying in with W1, the efficacy of the proposed method, particularly the operator regression in the second part, remains uncertain when applied to chaotic systems where acquiring accurate representations in the initial phase may prove challenging. The paper does not adequately address how the method would perform in highly sensitive systems where small errors in representation can lead to significant divergence in long-term predictions. This is a critical point that needs further investigation, as the method's robustness to chaotic dynamics is not clearly established.

W3. It would be great if the authors could evaluate the performance on insightful metrics like the Lyapunov spectrum, which is crucial for characterizing chaotic systems. The current evaluation focuses primarily on spectral error and RMSE, which might not fully capture the dynamical properties of the learned operators. Furthermore, including a discussion on recent related works, particularly those focusing on deep learning methods for deterministic systems based on the Lyapunov spectrum approach, is necessary to contextualize the contribution of this paper. For example, a discussion of how the proposed method compares to approaches that directly learn Lyapunov exponents would be beneficial.

W4. If the primary goal is representation learning, I feel that discussions and comparisons related to popular representation learning methods (e.g., contrastive learning) should be discussed and included. The paper does not adequately explore how the learned representations compare to those obtained using contrastive learning techniques, which have shown promise in capturing invariant features. A more thorough investigation of the representation space and its properties, using techniques from representation learning, would strengthen the paper.

### Questions
Q1. I am curious about the empirical performance of the results concerning different hyperparameters, particularly the value of $r$.

Q2. Additionally, what would be the loss for the OLS estimator of the transfer operator across different datasets? It would be concerning if the performance is highly sensitive to the value of $r$.

Q3. For the dynamical data, i.e., the 2D fluid flow and the molecular dynamics, it would be beneficial if the authors could provide the visualizations of the dynamics.

### Summary
In this paper a particular representation of a state space of a dynamical system is learned. 
The representation is intended to correspond to the subspace of highest singular values of the transfer operator of the system, of a fixed predifined dimension. It is learned from the observed trajectories of the system and parametrised by neural networks. 

The corresponding optimisation objective can be expressed in terms of the covariance matrices of the data (in the representation space).  While the direct involves matrix inversion and is computationally difficult, a proxy objective, which is proven to be a lower bound, is proposed. The proxy objective has better computational properties. 

Once the representation is learned, the transfer operator can be learned using standard approaches based on operator regression.  Experiments are performed to demonstarte a competitive performance of the approach.

### Strengths
This paper is clearly written and the topic of modeling dynamical systems is important. 
The proposed representation space is very natural.

### Weaknesses
This is mainly an empirical paper, as it proposes to model a certain space using neural networks with gradient descent optimsed objective.  However, the empirical evaluation of the method is not completely convincing, and some points are not clear.  


In addition, even the relaxed objective introduced in the paper is computationally heavy. It involves 
computing the covariannce matrices as _differentiable functions_. This means the computation graph involves summing $n$ matrices of size $r \times r$, each coordinate of which is a differnetiable function. 
As noted in the paper, minibatches could be used but would introduce bias. Even with minibatches, the 
representation dimension $r$ would have to stay low, and appears to be low in all experiments (in which it was specified). 


A more detailed notes on experiments:

**Ordered MNIST:** My understanding is that this example is new in this paper. Is there an explanation/intuition why other methods fails here? Are convolutional networks used to model the 
respresentation? I assume the non NN methods fail simply since representing images is easier with convolutions. Why do other methods fail? I believe explaining the difference here could make the paper considerably stronger. 


**Logistic Map:** The takeaway here is not clear.  DPNets has the worst spectral error among all methods. 
In addition, there appears to be no theoretical reason why DPNets-realxed should perform better on this metric, as it was introduced as a computational relaxation. Do the suggest it has properties allowing it to be a better estimator in general? 

**Continuous dynamics:**
The scale of Fig. 2 lower pane is that of 200. This makes is very hard to understand whether the smaller 
eigenvalues are estimated accurately and what is the order of magnitude.  Displaying ratios estimated/true would be more informative. Also, are there other ways to estimate the eigenvalues? 


**FlowRMSE:**
The general magnitude of the quantities in this experiment is not clear.  If the quantities are of order 10, then the difference between errors of order 0.1 and 0.001 is less impactful, and all methods perform well. 
What are the typical values of the quantities for which RMSE is computed? Again, percentage ratios would be much clearer than absolute values. 



**Chignolin Experiment:**
 In Table 2, describing the Chignolin experiment, while estimated quantities are somewhat closer to the reference values than the true quantities, they still look quite far. It is thus not clear what is the point of this part of the experiment.  
The second part of that experiment, involving Fig.4, unfortunately can not be understood from the main text. (what is the free energy surface, what is known about its proper minima, why matching the results of Bonati et al   is of interest? ).

### Questions
In addition to the points above:

Is the relaxation objective (9) a new contribution of this paper, or were similar relaxations employed in previous work (for instance VAMPSNets, DeepCCA)?

### Summary
The authors provide a method to learn an invariant representation for dynamical systems helps give an approximation of the transfer operator. They do this while also alleviating weaknesses of previous approaches, such as metric distortion. To do this, the authors show that the search for a good representation can be cast as an optimization problem over the space of neural networks. They provide and an objective function, and tractable approximations to it. They compare their method to other state-of-the-art approaches.

### Strengths
- The approach seems novel and interesting enough.
- The authors list the weaknesses of previous approaches (e.g. the weaknesses of previous methods on page 3, under "Learning transfer operators") and show how their method attempts to alleviate them.
- While the authors don't optimize over the main objective, equation (4), they provide tractable approximations, and also qualify and quantify when these approximations are good (e.g. Theorem 1, Lemma 3 in Section C of the supplementary materials).

### Weaknesses
 - The organization and the explanation of the method could be more straightforward. For example, Algorithm 1 is rather terse, and a more expanded version would be instructive to the reader. It's hard to get birds-eye view of the method because the explanation is spread throughout the text. Perhaps a separate section in the supplementary materials that gives a more direct explanation of the method would help the reader.
- The method requires computing covariance matrices of neural network outputs, which could affect the computation if the output dimension is high.
- I have some reservations about the experiments:
    - In the beginning paragraph of section "5 Experiments", the authors state they only optimize over the learning rate to keep things fair, but I can't seem to find the set of learning rates that were optimized over.
    - On the previous point, the authors state at the top of page 7 that the mini-batch size should be sufficiently large to mitigate the impact of biased stochastic estimators. But, some neural network models benefit from the mini-batch stochasticity of SGD, as opposed to full-batch normal gradient descent. In this case, I would have liked to have seen optimizing over the batch sizes as well, and not just the learning rate.
    - I'm also not sure if optimizing over just the learning rate this is completely fair. I would have liked to see optimizing over more hyperparameters, or at least in addition to the current experiments, to also provide the performance evaluation of the original model implemented in the paper, if possible. For example, in the fluid flow example, Azencot et al. (2022) has a similar fluid flow example, but uses a different architecture and I would have liked to see this one in comparison to the author's method.
    - In the molecular dynamics example, I see Ghorbani et al. (2022) have done similar experiments, but at a smaller scale. Even though the authors performed their experiment at a larger scale, I would have liked to have seen a comparison with Ghorbani et al. (2022) at the smaller scale, or even at the larger scale. This would allow comparing accuracy and training times.

### Questions
**Questions:**
- It seems in most experiments, the output dimension of the neural networks, $r$, is low. Would this be the case for most practical applications?
- On page 7 in "Downstream tasks", in order to make predictions of the next step, the authors need to compute: $(\hat{\Psi}_{w}^\top)^\dagger$, i.e. the pseudo-inverse, is that right? If so, it seems this would slow down the computation of the predicted next steps, so how do the computation times compare with other methods for predicting next steps? Any numerical instabilities?
- In Algorithm 1, the authors use $\hat{\mathcal{S}}^\gamma_m$, implying this is the relaxed version, is that right? If so, this isn't stated anywhere in Algorithm 1. Perhaps the authors should have two Algorithms that gives the regular DPNets and also DPNets-relaxed.
- When training the unrelaxed DPNets, how was $\mathcal{P}^\gamma$ evaluated? It is stated in page 5 that in general the covariances are non-invertible and thus $\mathcal{P}^\gamma$ is non-differentiable during the optimization. Also, as the authors state, the use of the pseudo-inverse can introduce numerical instabilities. How much of a problem is this, in your experience? I see that some experiments were unable to use unrelaxed DPNets because of this.
- For Figure 3, in the upper panel - "Ordered MNIST accuracy", I'd imagine that the "Reference" (dashed-line) is just random guessing, i.e. $1/5 = 0.2$? I don't see this stated anywhere, and would like it explicitly stated.
- For Figure 3 in the lower panel, "Fluid Flow RMSE", how many prediction steps were taken? Namely, what are the values of the $x$-axis?

**Remarks:**
- On page 5, on the line above equation (8), the authors say "we show in Lem. 3 in App. B", but I think you mean Section C in the appendix/supplementary materials.
- On page 6, in "Learning the representation", might also need to state that we are also given $\psi'$, i.e. " In practice,given a NN architecture $\psi$ and $\psi$'. "
