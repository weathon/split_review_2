# Adapting Retrieval Models to Task-Specific Goals using Reinforcement Learning

- Decision: Reject
- Scores: 5, 5, 3, 3

## Abstract
Given an input query, retrieval models are trained using user feedback data (e.g., click data) to output a ranked list of items. However, it is difficult to optimize task-specific goals  using supervised learning because the goals often correspond to non-differentiable losses. For example, we may want to optimize recall or novelty of the top-k items for a recommendation task or optimize accuracy of a blackbox large language model (LLM) for the retrieval-augmented generation task. To optimize arbitrary task-specific losses, we propose a reinforcement learning-based framework that applies to any pretrained retrieval model. Specifically, our solution uses policy gradient and addresses the key challenge of large action spaces by reduction to a binary action space, given both the query and the retrieved item. Our formulation also allows for exploration based on auxiliary retrieval models.  We empirically evaluate the proposed algorithm on improving recall for a query-ad retrieval task on two datasets with 4K and 1.9M actions respectively. We also show the benefit of the proposed algorithm on improving a custom metric---novelty of the retrieved items w.r.t. existing algorithms---for a commercial search engine.

### Summary
In this paper, the authors propose a reinforcement learning method to fine tune an existing bi-encoder retrieval models. The proposed method, PG-Ret, considers query-document pair as state and binary [relevant/not-relevant] action space. The lower bound of convergence rate is given and the reduction of action space can have higher convergence rate. Empirical analysis on the QADSM public dataset and a keyword recommendation e-commerce private dataset show PG-Ret can improve recall and top-k diversity than the original bi-encoder model.

### Strengths
* The paper presents a novel method to conduct task-specific fine-tuning of embedding based retrieval models. The presentation of the paper is clear and easy to follow.
* The theoretical analysis seems correct and justifies the reduction of the action space.
* Empirical studies show the proposed method can improve the retrieval models without fine-tuning.

### Weaknesses
 * The author claims the proposed method is applicable to general retrieval models yet only the InfoNCE with random negatives are used as baseline in the empirical study. It is know the negative sampling plays a very important role in the retrieval model training. Therefore the beselline supervised model could have a significant gain if the author train the supervised model with the three sources of positive/negative samples described in section 4.3 paragraph 2.
* The datasets seems to be toy-sized. More empirical results is needed to show the method actually works. Please consider add comparisons with SOTA retrieval method on more widely used retrieval benchmarks.
* The paper utilizes other pre-trained LLM models as relevance oracle which introduces additional supervision. I am not sure if the gain in recall comes from the reinforcement fine-tuning or simply from getting more supervision from a stronger model. Please consider add ablation study to validate the contribution from each part.
* From section 4.3, seems it is required to compute all query-document pairs in order to sample the states. This is computationally intensive and probably infeasible for most real applications. The space to store such dense query-document score matrix could be astronomical. That being said, I don't think this method can scale to real e-commerce applications as the author claims.

### Questions
* For the keyword recommendation experiment, why is the k set to be very small? That seems to be too small a match set to be judged for diversity.
* What's the prompt to get relevance judgement from GPT-3.5?
* How does the method improve upon SOTA retrieval models on other widely used retrieval benchmarks, such as MSMARCO/NQ?

4: You are confident in your assessment, but not absolutely certain. It is unlikely, but not impossible, that you did not understand some parts of the submission or that you are unfamiliar with some pieces of related work.

### Summary
* This paper studies the problem of optimizing retrieval models such that it optimizes for a more direct goal rather than typical self-supervised genetic objectives.
* Since the downstream performance is not differentiable and annotation ground-truth data is limited, the approach is based on using LLM reward estimators or evaluators to generate supervision signal.
* The idea is to build model to assess relevance of a certain item to context i.e. binary action space, rather than much larger space of ranking relevant items given a query; therefore it is more approachable from the RL learning and LLM reasoning perspective.

### Strengths
- The method is scientifically sound, intuitive, and useful for real-world applications

### Weaknesses
1- The discussion of large-action policy gradient in Section 4 (especially before 4.1) can be summarized or moved to appendix. It is a baseline but not the proposed method here. I think the saved space is better utilized if we could discuss the reward modeling method more clearly (e.g. how is it prompted, any key findings, etc).

2- Section 4.3 and Algorithm 1 is not clear. For example, it is not clear where the relevance oracle is coming from is it small set of annotations, or an LLM reward/relevance estimator?

3- For QADSM, the reward model seems rather small, especially compared to typical embedding models used for the retrieval. My understanding is that the reward model can/should actually be orders of magnitude larger and more capable to generate best supervision signal for the embedding model training. Any reason authors decided to use a variation of T5-base?

4- On the same topic, I see GPY-4/3.5 is used for the other dataset, isn’t it more intuitive to finetune an LLM for the specific relevance estimation task? any results/experiments to support using a strong but generic model?

### Questions
(see above for more questions)

About the usecase, I was wondering if authors could share any findings/experiments or thinking on how to apply such technique when new items are being added to the index. It is easy for an offline fixed dataset to build such relevance models or finetune embeddings but how would this work when new items are added? Do we need to retrain the models each time or we are claiming generalization in the learned embeddings

2: You are willing to defend your assessment, but it is quite likely that you did not understand the central parts of the submission or that you are unfamiliar with some pieces of related work. Math/other details were not carefully checked.

### Summary
The paper tackles the problem of using an oracle (in this case an LLM) to augment an existing dataset for the purpose of learning to rank items, particularly for tasks where the optimal ranking for a given query is not as obvious as the top K items according to their relevance (for instance, when novelty is a criteria). The paper proposes using an LLM as a reward oracle for an additional reinforcement learning stage that would fine tune a model trained on labelled data, and further aligns the ranking model with the task at hand, more so than it would be able to learn from just the offline training data.

The performance of the new algorithm is highlighted on two datasets,  one publicly available, the other proprietary. The experiments show the fine-tuned algorithm exceeding the performance of the supervised model, but falling short of reaching the performance of the model used as an oracle (in this case the LLM)

### Strengths
The paper is fairly well written and tackles a relevant practical and widespread problem: misalignment between the learning to rank objective and the objectives supervised learning algorithms can actually use for training (which need to be differentiable).

The paper provides experiments on real world data and on open datasets (not just proprietary datasets).

### Weaknesses
I do not believe the significance of the approach presented here is substantial enough to warrant acceptance into the venue. Fine-tuning supervised models with a reinforcement learning phase is a well-known approach. Once it has been established that LLMs are suitable for labelling data for this sort of problems relatively reliably, using RL for fine-tuning does not feel like a novel contribution. It is also unclear how good the LLMs are at aligning the fine-tuning objective to the objective we are actually aiming to solve. For instance, if the criteria is diversity etc.

The reframing of the problem as having two action spaces is a bit unclear to me as to how it alleviates the complexity of the setting. I also fail to see how the problem is still cast as an MDP for the theoretical results to hold. This should be clearly articulated in the main body of the paper.

### Questions
Once we have an oracle, potentially other avenues of improving the performance appear. For instance, framing the problem as a bandit problem (for example contextual linear cascading bandit [1,2] where item vectors can be generated with the LLMs), considering the problem an example of Positive-Unlabelled [3] or Active learning, where we can augment the initial dataset based on weaknesses the model uncovers in its own predictions. In light of all these possible alternatives, what are the reason to believe using the REINFORCE algorithm for the fine-tuning step is an impactful approach and not just another approach?

Can you better describe the intuition why the convergence speed of the algorithm is substantially increased from framing the problem as having the states being pairs <state, item> and having binary actions?

In addition to the above explanation, I would also like to see a detailed formal description of the resulting MDP and the application of the Theorem in Mei et al. (2020) to the resulting setting. It is unclear to me what this MDP would look like and how the theorem applies.

Can you provide an interpretation of how impactful the $0.2\\%$ increase in the click yield is?

### Summary
The submission studies the problem to optimize task-specific metrics in retrieval systems via reinforcement learning. The topic itself is standard and has a lot of literature. The main contribution of the paper is the proposal to treat query-item as the state which can address some disadvantages of large action space. Some theoretical analysis is provided. The paper also use LLMs as the reward model. For experiments, one public dataset and one internal dataset is used. Basic baselines are compared against and the proposed method shows some performance benefits.

### Strengths
S1: Though RL for information retrieval has a rich literature, the formulation to model query-item as the state looks interesting to the reviewer, though the reviewer does not have the expertise to comment on the theory part. 

S2: It is interesting to see two different objectives, including recall and a novelty metric.

### Weaknesses
W1: The experiments are quite weak and non-standard. This weakness itself may warrant rejection in a top venue. There are numerous retrieval datasets and strong baselines and it is not clear why the authors selected the datasets (1 public dataset that is not commonly used) and an internal dataset, and pretty much without any sensible baselines. Especially for the recall metric, it is standard so it’s not clear why no standard baselines or datasets are used. The internal dataset does not add much value to the paper, as the details are unclear, will not help reproducibility, and the real-world impact is not clear given no online experiments. There are many ways to compose a task that do not optimize recall metric so it is not clear why such task is chosen. The authors implemented the basic base models themselves. The choices also look arbitrary, such as the choice of certain model architectures, the LLMs used (while assuming they are reliable which is not the case - despite recent papers on the popular topic, they hardly beat previous tuning methods). All these will make the impact of the work hard to be measured and the reproducibility of the proposed method extremely difficult.  

W2: RL in information retrieval has a very rich literature, and optimizing arbitrary metric is inherited from RL, so the novelty/story from this perspective is limited. The major contribution is really the algorithm mentioned in S1, but the significance of the proposed method is unclear.

### Questions
See weaknesses.

How valid is the assumptions made on LLMs? Using LLMs as rater is a promising area, but not solved problem.
