## Abstract
Machine learning techniques for predicting Alzheimer's disease (AD) progression can substantially help researchers and clinicians establish strong AD preventive and treatment strategies. However, current research on AD prediction algorithms encounters challenges with monotonic data form, small dataset and scarcity of time-continuous data. To address all three of these problems at once, we propose a novel machine learning approach that implements the 4D tensor multi-task continual learning algorithm to predict AD progression by quantifying multi-dimensional information on brain structural variation and knowledge sharing between patients. To meet real-world application scenarios, the method can integrate knowledge from all available data as patient data increases to continuously update and optimise prediction results. To evaluate the performance of the proposed approach, we conducted extensive experiments utilising data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). The results demonstrate that the proposed approach has superior accuracy and stability in predicting various cognitive scores of AD progression compared to single-task learning, benchmarks and state-of-the-art multi-task regression methods. The proposed approach identifies structural brain variations in patients and utilises it to accurately predict and diagnose AD progression from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data alone, and the performance of the model improves as the MRI data increases.

### Summary
The manuscript proposes 4D Tensor Multi-Task Continual Learning to predict Alzheimer's disease progression. The method shows improved prediction performance across multiple time points compared to previous baselines.

### Strengths
- The manuscript compares the proposed approach with multiple baselines
- Interesting and exciting approach overall. However, I have a lot of questions.

### Weaknesses
As a continual learning algorithm:
- The experiments have been performed only with one neuroimaging dataset. Hence, the impact and empirical evidence are pretty limited, considering the general broader focus of the ICLR community. Furthermore, this experimental setup is relatively novel. Hence, it is tough to understand the significance of the proposed approach to the continual learning domain.
- it is unclear if the compared baselines apply well to the solved question. For example, in the survey of continual learning (Wang et al. 2023), there are eight continual learning scenarios. I think the manuscript has to be a bit more specific. While the related work only discussed Multi-Task Learning.

As a neuroimaging research:
- The biomarkers from Section 5.2 have not been checked with the literature. I do not see the hippocampus as usually damaged early compared to other regions (Rao et al., 2022). Specifically, the correlation analysis lacks validation against established findings in neuroimaging, particularly regarding the temporal progression of atrophy in regions like the hippocampus. The manuscript needs to justify why certain biomarker correlations are considered significant and how they align with known patterns of neurodegeneration. The absence of hippocampal involvement, a hallmark of early AD, raises concerns about the biological plausibility of the identified correlations.
- The related work for Alzheimer's and longitudinal studies is minimal and old (max up to 2013). For example, there exist more classical recent approaches (e.g., Marinescu et al., 2019). Also, ADNI was used for the TADPOLE challenge (Marinescu et al., 2018) with its leaderboard (https://tadpole.grand-challenge.org/Results/). The lack of engagement with recent literature, particularly the TADPOLE challenge, is a significant oversight. The manuscript should contextualize its approach within the existing landscape of AD progression modeling, especially considering the availability of benchmark datasets and established methodologies.


### Questions
- Have you ensured that all the models have the same data available at each moment? Otherwise, the updated parameters in the proposed model will preserve the history, which might be unfair to the standard models learned only from the available data. How do you prepare features for the baselines? Do you treat new time points as additional features or different samples? Do you use scores from the previous time-point as input features to predict scores in the next time point? It will be great to clarify the experimental setup for the baselines. I also wonder if better feature engineering can achieve better performance with XGBoost / CatBoost Regression (instead of Lasso Regression).
- How does the algorithm scale computationally with the number of biomarkers?
- How many time points can the knowledge base preserve? Will the performance degrade over time and with respect to past?
- I do not see ablation for model parameters ($\lambda$, $\beta$ and $\theta$) and hyperparameters ($\alpha$ and $\eta$).
- The abstract claims that the model improves as the MRI data increases, but I do not see ablation for the training dataset size. But if you meant it increasing by having data from new time points, could it be just the case of having more data explaining the improved performance rather than an effect of continual learning?
- Figure 4 and Figure 5 do not show the variability of the approaches.
- Table 2 and Table 3 do not have a statistical comparison of the model's performances.

### Summary
The authors proposed an approach to address challenges in predicting the progression of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) due to issues with the data form, small dataset, and time-continuous data scarcity. The 4D tensor multi-task continual learning algorithm is used to quantify multi-dimensional information on brain structural variation and facilitate knowledge sharing between patients, continuously updating and optimizing prediction results as patient data increases. The proposed approach outperforms other methods in predicting AD progression using data from the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative and accurately identifies structural brain variations using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data alone.

### Strengths
+ Tackling the continual learning problem in medical longitudinal data

### Weaknesses
 - It is not clear how the biomarkers are generated for the modeling.
- The proposed method is limited to structured data of biomarkers. It may not be generalized to other data format.
- The multi-task learning is not clearly defined and introduced in the presented work
- It is not clear how M12 ... M60 is composed. Are they overlapped with each other?
- what exactly is W_t in Eq. 2? What's the model parameter matrix as introduced?
- The dataset ADNI used in the experiments is not clearly introduced. What's the data split used? How many data samples are really used in the experiments?
- what is the trained disease progression predictive model? What's the model architecture?
- It will be helpful to see the performance of models trained for each task alone instead of one model for all the multi-tasks.
- The experimental setting and presented results seem to avoid the problem of "data form, small dataset, and time-continuous data scarcity" raised by the authors by introducing the structured data (unknown biomarkers), a single dataset (without details), a fixed longitudinal dataset with regular follow-up timescales (12:12:60, every 12 months)

### Summary
The authors claim that some challenges in predicting the progression of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) are monotonic data form, small dataset and scarcity of time-continuous data. To tackle these challenges, the authors propose a novel approach with 4D tensor multi-task continual learning. It is claimed that the proposed method integrates information from all available data and gets updated in a continual-learning fashion. The authors further argue that their method can achieve better accuracy and stability than single-task learning and SOTA multi-task regression methods in the prediction of several cognitive scores of AD progression.

### Strengths
1.	The idea to construct a 4D tensor representation of disease progression for multivariate spatiotemporal information aggregation is an intuitive idea for this particular task.
2.	The biomarker correlation analysis (Table 4 – 8) is quite thoughtful. With that said, it would have been better if more insights can be provided that relate these biomarkers and existing literature.

### Weaknesses
1. In the second paragraphs of the Introduction section, the authors described the “three main problems” with existing models for AD progression. The first claimed problem is “data on neurological diseases such as AD are difficult to obtain”, but this claim sounds erroneous without additional context. It would be better if the authors specify the data modalities with limited availability or accessibility. Just as a reference, T1-weighted MRI data seems to be abundant --- I can name a few datasets with moderate-to-large scale with AD patients: the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) which the authors used in this paper, Anti-Amyloid Treatment in Asymptomatic Alzheimer’s (A4), and Open Access Series of Imaging Studies (OASIS).
2. While I appreciate that the authors attempt to illustrate the 4D tensor data in Figure 1, under the current form it is still unclear how the first two dimensions are constructed. It seems like a 2D matrix, so what do the rows and columns represent? From the Introduction section it seems to be two distinct biomarkers, but suppose the matrix is $ M \times N $, what will the M and N feature dimensions represent? This seems a bit unclear from the figure.
3. Figure 2 needs to be improved. The text over colored arrows is hard to read and looks unpleasing.

### Questions
1.	The authors seem to be using the terms “second-order matrix” and “third-order tensor” to refer to “2D matrix” and “3D tensor”. Would it be better to use “two-dimensional” and “three-dimensional” instead?
2.	There are a few grammar issues. I would recommend having additional rounds of proof-reading and paraphrasing. ChatGPT might be a valuable resource, though you may need to use with caution as it can easily change the meaning.
3.	In Section 3.3, where is $C$ defined?

### Summary
This work tackles prediction of Alzheimer's disease progression from small, scarce time-continuous and dynamic form of data. They propose 4D tensor multi-task continual learning algorithm, which utilises a tensor-based MTL algorithm to integrate and share spatio-temporal information. They evaluate this on the data from the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). The authors identified and analysed important relative structural variation correlations between brain biomarkers in the prediction of AD progression, which could be utilised as potential indicators for early identification of AD.

### Strengths
+ Very relevant research question. 
+ The authors puts effort to interpret the results and understand the biomarkers.

### Weaknesses
 - The paper is quite hard to follow. E.g the authors introduce in section 3.2 amalgamated magnitude-direction. Afterwards, for me it is puzzling to know what happens with that or where it is used. Because in section 3.3 the authors talk about the learning and regression problem. It's unclear how the amalgamated magnitude-direction representation is incorporated into the subsequent learning process. Specifically, the connection between this representation and the tensor-based multi-task learning (MTL) algorithm is not clearly established. The reader is left to guess how this intermediate representation is leveraged in the final prediction task, making it difficult to assess the validity of the approach.
- The methods section is also quite hard to follow with the equations. I would re-iterate or breakdown section 3.3 and eq. (2). The description of the optimization process, particularly in relation to equation (2), is insufficient. The role of each term in the equation is not clearly defined, and the overall objective of the optimization is not well-explained. The reader struggles to understand how the different components of the model interact and how the optimization procedure leads to the desired outcomes. A more detailed breakdown of the equation and its components is needed, along with a clear explanation of the optimization goal.
- Overall I feel lost in the details and I am missing the high-level info on how the data and task looks like. The paper lacks a clear and concise explanation of the data used and the specific prediction task being addressed. The reader is left with an incomplete understanding of the input data, including the nature of the MRI scans and the biomarkers extracted from them. The lack of a clear description of the task, such as whether it's a classification or regression problem, and the specific targets being predicted, makes it difficult to assess the relevance and impact of the proposed method. A high-level overview of the data and task is needed to provide context for the technical details.

### Questions
- How do you get the MRI brain biomarkers? Until the point of the biomarkers explained on p6 (which I guess are the features) the reader wonders what it is. Although it has been mentioned since p.4 section 3.2. So I would recommend the authors to reiterate this. 
- Eq. 2: what is C_t? The description is missing
- Tables arrive earlier than mentioned, which makes it harder to follow. Please change it. 
- What is the number of MRI scans? Short intro on ADNI would be helpful to follow.
