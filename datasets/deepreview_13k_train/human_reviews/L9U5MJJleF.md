# Concept Bottleneck Generative Models

- Decision: Accept
- Scores: 6, 6, 6, 6

## Abstract
We introduce a generative model with an intrinsically interpretable layer---a concept bottleneck layer---that constrains the model to encode human-understandable concepts. The concept bottleneck layer partitions the generative model into three parts: the pre-concept bottleneck portion, the CB layer, and the post-concept bottleneck portion. To train CB generative models, we complement the traditional task-based loss function for training generative models with a concept loss and an orthogonality loss. The CB layer and these loss terms are model agnostic, which we demonstrate by applying the CB layer to three different families of generative models: generative adversarial networks, variational autoencoders, and diffusion models. On multiple datasets across different types of generative models, steering a generative model, with the CB layer, outperforms all baselines---in some cases, it is \textit{10 times} more effective. In addition, we show how the CB layer can be used to interpret the output of the generative model and debug the model during or post training.

### Summary
The paper proposes a concept bottleneck (CB) based approach to make generative models interpretable. Specifically, it proposes to insert a CB layer into generative models to constraint (most of) their internal representation to a certain concept set, making it quantifiable with respect to the concepts. The key challenge the paper highlight is that features to perform generative modeling may not be always interpretable. To address this, the paper propose to extend previous Concept Embedding Models (CEMs) to additionally encode an "unknown" concept that is meant to be orthogonal to any other concepts. The experimental results show that the proposed approach achieves better accuracy on steering concepts compared to other conditional generative modeling approaches, and providing additional features such as interpretability and debugging of the individual models.

### Strengths
- The paper addresses an important yet under-explored problem of interpreting generative models.
- I found the idea of introducing unknown concept vector is interesting and novel. 
- The proposed method is widely applicable for diverse model families, including VAEs, GANs, and Diffusion models. 
- The paper also partially demonstrates the scalability of the method with a LAION subset on Diffusion model, following contemporary practices.
- The effectiveness of the method is clearly validated through experiments.

### Weaknesses
 - The paper claims at Abstract and Introduction that the proposed method is model agnostic, but I am not certain on that. For example, it seems to me that applying the CB layer to other types of generative models can be non-trivial, e.g., to normalizing flows and invertible models. 
- Although the paper presents some scalability experiments, the other parts of the experiments can be seen as somewhat limited in their scale. For example, the paper only explores simple GAN architectures not covering modern ones such as StyleGAN-2. I am also wondering why more recent methods such as GAN inversion could not be a baseline. If these point can be addressed, it will be also beneficial to support the model-agnostic aspect of the method. 
- More qualitative comparisons could be added and highlighted for the steerability experiments, given that the quantitative results are dependent on the pre-trained concept classifiers. 
- (minor) The definition of concept orthogonality loss, Eq (5), is written in somewhat confusing manner - e.g., the index j is not used in the definition.

### Questions
- The paper mentions Platt and Barr (1987) regarding hyper-parameter optimization. Does it mean that the paper actually applied that method for tuning in the experiments? If so, it may be good to provide an overview on the method in the paper as well. 
- It seems making sure the minimal concept orthogonality loss is crucial for the soundness of the method, otherwise there can be an overlap between the given concepts and the "unknown" concept. One immediate ablation one can try is to check whether the loss is minimized is to strictly project the learned unknown context vector to be orthogonal to other vectors and see if there is degradation in performance. Or I think this kind of procedure can be even incorporated into the training phase to guarantee the minimal concept orthogonality loss. Any discussion regarding the actual orthogonality of the learned unknown context vector would be helpful for the readers.

### Summary
This paper studied concept bottleneck on a number of generative models, like VAE, GAN, and Diffusion. The work shows using concept bottleneck enables steering generative models and debugging better.

### Strengths
1. The idea of introducing a concept bottleneck layer to generative models is very interesting. While this has been studied in discriminative models, this is the first time that the reviewer see concept bottleneck been used in generation, which provides explanation and control over the model generation.
2. It shows better steerability than existing methods, like InfoGAN. Based on Table 1, CB-GAN has higher accuracy of the concept classifier. InfoGAN was a distangled GAN that allow control over concept in an unsupervised way.
3. Experiments are conducted on three types of generative models, which shows the method is general.

### Weaknesses
Lacking baseline comparison with SOTA model. Without concept bottleneck, exiting work can also control concept, like text-image diffusion, GANSpace, StyleGAN, and others.

Like one can find a direction in StyleGAN that control specified concept, which is also very effective.

Similarly, show comparison to stable diffusion, GANSpace.

### Questions
1. How does the method tackle unseen concepts? Can this be extended to open-world concepts?

2. How long does diffusion training take? Do you train all generative models from scratch?

### Summary
This paper proposes to introduce a "concept bottleneck" layer to generative models, allowing for better control and introspection of the generative process. The is demonstrated to work with several generative models - VAEs, GANs and diffusion models. In all method the encoded latent is fed to a set of "concept networks" - one for each conceptual property like colour, gender etc. - which are trained to project the latent on an embedding and predict the presence or absence (learned seperatly) of a specific context (with ground truth data provided as targets, i.e supervised). The generative model is trained in conjuction with the concept layers by using a linear combination of the concept embeddings weighted by their presence (or absence) probabilitliies. as input to the decoder (instead of the original latent). There is an additional orthogonality loss which constrains the concept embeddings to be orthogonal to an "unknown" concept embedding.

Controllability is achieved by constraining the presence or absence probabilities to a specific value and feeding the resulting combination to the generative process. Interpretability is achieved via inspecting the resulting presence / absence probablilites for different concepts.

The method is evaluated on several datasets with ground truth concept data and is shown to improve on baselines.

### Strengths
I think the paper has an interesting premise and good motivation - interpretability and controllability of generative models are important subjects and structured approaches to this can be useful.

I enjoyed reading the paper and it is largely well presented and written.

### Weaknesses
Unfortunately the paper suffers from several weaknesses:

* The concept bottleneck layer requires ground truth data - this is fine for small-ish scale data, but we can't hope to obtain this kind of data for large datasets. This puts some doubt to the usefullness of the model.
* The model requires a *separate network* for each concept - this is fine as long as there is a small number of concepts but I doubt this is a scalable approach going forward.
* Because the model is supervised it will only learn about concepts provided through the labels - there could be an argument that concepts should be learned from the data unsupervised as we don't necessarily always know what are the underlying factors.
* Evaluation is a bit weak in the paper - Table 1 which is arguably the main quantitative result of the paper is not well explained. If I understand correctly these are the prediced concept presence probablilites after the model has been constrained to include them. This is problematic because a) we don't know the accuracy of presence classifier and b) measuring only the probablitiy doesn't tell us if the output actually contains the desired concept (i.e - there are no visualizations).
* In absolute terms, the results in Table 1. are quite poor - I would expect much higher accuracies.

### Questions
* How does the method scale with the number of concepts? does it affect performance of the generative model?
* Are all concepts equal? are there ones that affect the output of the model more than others?
* What is the role of the "unknown" concept in generation? what happens if you steer it towards "presence" (if possible?)

### Summary
The authors propose to introduce a concept-bottleneck layer into deep generative models, including GANs, VAEs, and diffusion models.  The bottleneck is encouraged to encode interpretable concepts using dense annotations.  Furthermore, it is paired with an unsupervised side-channel conveying information that is constrained to be orthogonal to the concepts in the bottleneck.  The resulting generative model, CBGMs, can be steered by controlling the concepts themselves and admits investigating its behavior by intervening on the concepts.  The experiments evaluate steerability, interpretability, debuggability, and generation performance against a selection of conditional generative models.

**Post-rebuttal update**: I have increased my score based on the rebuttal.

### Strengths
**Originality**: The specific architecture (or family of architectures) proposed here is novel.

**Quality**: The idea is sensible and the writing is good.

**Clarity**: The narrative (excluding the experimental section, which lacks some details, see weaknesses) is very clear.  

**Significance**: At a high level, this paper fills a clear gap in the CBM literature, showing how the concept bottleneck idea can be extended beyond discriminative models.

### Weaknesses
 **Originality**: The idea of using concepts for steering generative models is by now somewhat familiar tho, as this is what VLMs implicitly do, and what conditional generative models have done for a while (the whole motivation for investigating disentanglement stems precisely from this problem, although I agree disentanglement does not guarantee interpretability).  The idea of integrating VAEs in concept-bottleneck classifiers has also been explored (as mentioned in the related work), but not for the purpose of steering generative models.

**Quality**: The critical issue with this paper is that the experiments are lacking.

For instance, the experiment in Section 4.2 measures steerability only by turning concepts on (but not off).  It is not clear how to understand steerability:  it is defined as the accuracy of a pre-trained concept detector on generated images after turning on a concept that originally was predicted to be off.  Why the accuracy?  Why not the percentage of images in which the concept is predicted to be on?  What would be the ideal value, 100%?  If so, the numbers reported in the able are (better than the competitors but) quite far from this goal.  Also, the validation accuracy of the concept classifiers used to evaluate steerability is not reported, so how do we know they are high quality?

Unless I missed something, interpretability is only assessed qualitatively (Section 4.3.1, Figure 4).

Generation quality (Section 4.4) is only measured for a single data set.  Same for debuggability in Section 4.3.

Overall, the choice of research questions is okay, but taken individually the experiments leave something to be desired.  Evidence is provided for individual data sets or even selected examples.  This makes it difficult to assess the true limitations of CB-* models.

**Significance**:  What is not entirely clear to me is what niche of problems CBGMs help with that VLMs cannot to some extent already deal with.  The other issue is that concept annotations -- as readily admitted by the authors -- is difficult to acquire.  This is why, recently, researchers have started defining concepts using VLMs like CLIP.  Mind you, I am not an LLM enthusiast -- but I feel there is something anachronistic about the proposed setup.  Still, I am a fan of concept bottleneck models and I like the idea of broadening their applicability.  The only serious issue is with the experimental evaluation.

### Questions
Please see my doubts about the experimental setup in the **Quality** paragraph above.  I'd appreciate if you could clarify what motivated the limited choice of data sets, for instance.  Also, please let me know if I got it wrong and missed results that are in fact reported in the paper.

**Score**: I graded the paper 3/10, but I think of it as a 4/10 (there is no such option in openreview).  I *am* willing to increase the score if solid motivations are provided for the interpretability, debuggability, and FID score of CB-* models on data sets besides those reported here, or any other solid indication that CB-* models hold their promises beyond the few data sets considered here.
