- Decision: Accept
- Scores: 6, 8, 5

## Abstract
With the rising tide of large language models (LLMs), there has been a growing interest in developing general-purpose instruction-following models, e.g., ChatGPT. To this end, we present LLaMA-Adapter, a lightweight adaption method for efficient instruction tuning of LLaMA. Using 52K self-instruct demonstrations, LLaMA-Adapter only introduces 1.2M learnable parameters upon the frozen LLaMA 7B model, and costs less than one hour for fine-tuning. Specifically, a zero-initialized attention mechanism is proposed. It adopts a learnable zero gating to adaptively inject the instructional cues into LLaMA within self-attention layers, contributing to a stable training process and superior final performance. In this way, LLaMA-Adapter can generate high-quality responses to diverse language instructions, comparable to Alpaca with fully fine-tuned 7B parameters. Besides language commands, by incorporating an image encoder, our approach can be simply extended to a multi-modal LLM for image-conditioned instruction following, which achieves superior multi-modal reasoning capacity on several popular benchmarks (MME, MMBench, LVLM-eHub). Furthermore, we also verify the proposed zero-initialized attention mechanism for fine-tuning other pre-trained models (ViT, RoBERTa, CLIP) on traditional vision and language tasks, demonstrating the effectiveness and generalizability of our approach. Code and models are released at https://github.com/OpenGVLab/LLaMA-Adapter.

### Summary
This paper proposed LLaMA-Adapter, a light-weight prompt based adapation method for LLaMA models, a zero-initialized attention mechanism for learning the adaptation prompts is also proposed.
Experiments extend LLaMA-Adapter not only to instruction-tuning, but also to multi-modal instruction tuning.
It is shown that the proposed method could adapt a LLaMA to a certain task with a small number of parameters to save.
Additionally, it is shown that the proposed zero-initialized attention could also help tuning of vision or text transformers on some tasks.

### Strengths
1. Overall, I think the proposed method is simple to implement, and yields good results. The proposed zero-initialized attention could be helpful for future prompt-tuning based research.
2. The extension to multi-modal is also a good use case of the proposed technique.

### Weaknesses
1. I would say the comparison is rather limited, newer and better base LLMs are available, adding comparison or applying the proposed method to models such as MPT, Falcon, or LLaMA-v2 could make the paper stronger.
2. Evaluations are a bit narrow, I would recommend adding things like counterfactual reasoning [R1,R2] or object hallincations [R3].
3. While the main argument is the efficiency of the proposed method, the scalability of the proposed method is not tested, adding results of using 13B/33B parameter models could demonstrate this.

### Questions
1. What would happen if the base model is larger? Does the proposed method scales with the base model size?
2. Also, Does the proposed method scales with the number of instruction data used to tune the model?

### Summary
This manuscript proposes an adaption method for efficient instruction tuning of LLaMA-style models. 
To be specific, the key idea is introducing a zero-initialized attention mechanism for learnable zero-gating to adaptively inject the instructional cues into LLMs within self-attention layers. 
Extensive experiments showed the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed method in various domains, including language, vision-language, and vision.

### Strengths
- The writing is clear and easy to understand.
- The manuscript showed the efficiency of the proposed method in terms of data, learnable parameters, and training time for instruction tuning upon the LLaMA 7B model. Compared to the closest baseline, the Alpaca, the proposed method is more effective yet efficient on the same training data and the same LLM (LLaMA 7B).
- The proposed method has the potential to be used in various domains, including vision and vision language. For example, the zero-initialized attention mechanism can be incorporated with transformer-based vision models like ViT or CLIP, instead of full finetunuing. 
- The manuscripts contain extensive qualitative examples compared to various language and multi-modal models.

### Weaknesses
 - I think a number of baselines and performance of the proposed method on multi-modal evaluation are weak to convince the proposed method is more effective than full finetuning LLMs or other efficient methods. I understand there are a lot of recent multi-modal models but many of them are concurrent works. However, I think BLIP2 [1] can be treated as a baseline, which is also a prior work of reported baseline, mini-GPT4. Based on this, I think the reported performances in Table 3 are weak compared to others. For example, the proposed method achieved a 973 score on the MME benchmark, while BLIP2 did 1293. Furthermore, a recent multi-modal model LLaVA-1.5 [2], which fully fine-tunes LLMs, achieved the 1510 score using the Vicuna 7B model. Therefore, I think this manuscript should include empirical backups to show the proposed method is still effective and efficient in the multi-modal domain.
- I think the most important baselines on instruction following evaluation are Alpaca and Alpaca-LoRa. However, the manuscript only provides qualitative comparisons and brief comparisons in Figure 2. I think it would be great if more quantitative comparisons could be included in the manuscript.
- The proposed method has a sensitive hyperparameter of "a number of insertion layers". In particular, Section 3.2 emphasizes the risk of early insertion layers, while the ablation study in Section 4.3 emphasizes the importance of increasing the number of insertion layers. I think the manuscript could provide more explanation on the choice of the hyperparameter.

### Questions
- In equation 7, what happens on softmax outputs when g grows bigger than 1? Why does not need additional normalization steps?
- The proposed method has few learnable parameters. So, I am curious about the possibility of learning large amounts of data or a large number of tasks.
- Adaption prompts are randomly initialized, not zero-initialized. If so, is it possible to use full insertion layers in LLaMA?

### Summary
This paper introduces the LLaMA-Adapter, a new parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) method for large language models. The authors pre-append word tokens with a few learnable adaption prompts and employ a zero-initialized attention mechanism to seamlessly integrate these new instructional cues, while retaining its pre-trained knowledge. LLaMA-Adapter delivers performance on par with fully-finetuned or LoRA-finetuned Alpaca and generalizes well in multi-modal scenarios.

### Strengths
The paper is very well-written and easy to follow. The clarity and high visual quality of the figures, especially Figures 1, 2, and 3, effectively showcase the proposed method. Technically, the proposed method is sound and achieves on-par performance with fully-finetuned or LoRA-finetuned baselines. The authors provide ample technical details, facilitating replication by other researchers and enabling further development on their methods.

### Weaknesses
My primary concern with this paper is the limited technical innovation and marginal performance improvement it presents. The concept of zero-initialized attention closely mirrors the zero-initialized convolution in ControlNet [Zhang et al., ICCV 2023]. This seems more like an engineering design rather than a groundbreaking technical contribution. Of the four main characteristics highlighted by the authors in the introduction, both (1) parameter efficiency and (3) plugin with expertise are attributes already provided by LoRA. Regarding (2) training efficiency, the improvement over LoRA is incremental: a reduction from 1.5 hours to 1 hour (in Table 1), while achieving comparable accuracy (in Figure 5). Also, reducing the rank of LoRA can further reduce the number of trainable parameters and potentially speed up the training. I suggest the authors include an additional ablation study on this. Based on these, I am not confident whether the technical contributions and empirical performance of this paper meet the publication standards of ICLR.

### Questions
My primary concerns are outlined in the weaknesses section. Beyond these points, I have several additional questions/comments:

* In Equation 7, the rescaled attention scores no longer represent a probability distribution. Would it be more appropriate to rescale it as [softmax(a) · g ; softmax(b) · (1-g)]?
* The authors claim that "LLaMA-Adapter enables fine-tuning of large-scale language models on mobile devices." However, this claim lacks empirical support. While LLaMA-Adapter may reduce memory usage, it doesn't necessarily reduce computation, a potential constraint on mobile devices.
* The learnable adaptation tokens have been prefixed to the last 30 of 32 layers. What might the implications be if applied across all transformer layers?
* The second example presented in Figure 4 is not quite correct. The output program seems to produce repetitive numbers.
