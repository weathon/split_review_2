## Abstract
Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in open-ended text generation tasks. However, the inherent open-ended nature of these tasks implies that there is always room for improvement in the quality of model responses. To address this challenge, various approaches have been proposed to enhance the performance of LLMs. There has been a growing focus on enabling LLMs to self-improve their response quality, thereby reducing the reliance on extensive human annotation efforts for collecting diverse and high-quality training data. Recently, prompting-based methods have been widely explored among self-improvement methods owing to their effectiveness, efficiency, and convenience. However, those methods usually require explicitly and thoroughly written rubrics as inputs to LLMs. It is expensive and challenging to manually derive and provide all necessary rubrics with a real-world complex goal for improvement (e.g., being more helpfulness and less harmful). To this end, we propose an imPlicit self-ImprovemenT (PIT) framework that implicitly learns the improvement goal from human preference data. PIT only requires preference data that are used to train reward models with no extra human efforts. Specifically, we reformulate the training objective of reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) -- instead of maximizing response quality for a given input, we maximize the quality gap of the response conditioned on a reference response. In this way, PIT is implicitly trained with the improvement goal of better aligning with human preferences. Experiments on two real-world datasets and one synthetic dataset show that our method significantly outperforms prompting-based methods.

### Summary
The paper introduces the PIT framework, an innovation aimed at enhancing the quality of text generation in LLMs. PIT offers a novel twist on RLHF by reformulating its objectives towards increasing the gap in quality between a generated response and a original reference response. This work bypasses the need for costly and complex explicit rubrics. The paper demonstrates the superiority of PIT over conventional self-refinement methods across various datasets.

### Strengths
The paper's main contribution lies in its innovative approach to reformulating the objectives of RLHF, particularly within the context of supervised fine-tuning reward model training, and reinforcement learning. It is particularly notable for introducing a novel reward model that prioritizes the quality gap between two responses from LLMs. This unique angle encourages the model to continually refine its output by comparing it to a reference response. The method has the potential to shift the paradigm in how LLMs are self-improved for better alignment with human preferences without the designing rubrics or prompts.

### Weaknesses
1. The framework may not incorporate new information or data during the self-improvement cycle, potentially limiting the scope of learning to alignment with initial human preferences.
1. The iterative nature of the proposed self-improvement process could result in increased computational time and cost in inference.

### Questions
1. Can you clarify if the three models depicted in Figure 1, i.e. LLMs, PIT, and PIT Reward Model? Are they distinct or the same model?
1. How to train with objectives (4) and (5)? An algorithm block is easy to illustrate. 
1. The paper lacks a detailed algorithmic flow for training with objectives (4) and (5). Could you provide an algorithmic block to illustrate the training process?
1. How to determine the number of iterations for the self-improvement process for inference?

### Summary
This paper proposes a novel framework, implicit self-improvement, to learn from human preference data. Instead of optimizing the response quality, their method maximizes the gap of the pair of responses. The experiments on three datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of their method.

### Strengths
1. The paper proposes a novel method to implicitly self-improve from data. In this way, PIT can iteratively improve responses by repeating the self-improvement process.
2. The authors find a practical way to implement their ideas for maximizing the gaps between responses for implicit self-improvement. They conduct experiments and analyses to verify PIT's effectiveness.

### Weaknesses
1. In the experiment, the authors compare PIT with prompt-based methods (self-refine), while there is a lack of comparison with other reinforcement learning related methods like [1]. Can other RL methods help to self-improve the response?

### Summary
This paper proposes an RLHF-style fine-tuning routine to allow large language models (LLMs) to self-improve. The authors propose PIT that modifies the RLHF routine in all three stages: at the supervised fine-tuning stage, PIT maximises the likelihood of the better response conditional on both the instruction and the worse outputs (instead of the instructions only). In the reward model training stage, PIT encodes 4 pairwise relations between good and worse outputs instead of simply optimising the reward gap between better and worse responses. In the RL stage, instead of defining reward only in terms of supervised finetuned models and the RL model, PIT utilises multiple stages of RL to improve both over the annotated examples and iteratively improve over its previous responses (thereby achieving self-improvement). Experiments are done on 3 RLHF datasets, and the authors show that their proposed methods compare favourably both over the original response and over self-refine, a prompt-based self-improvement method.

### Strengths
- I found the paper’s motivation of implicitly self-improving from preference data instead of explicit rubrics construction to be well thought out, convincing and likely of interest to the community. 
- The execution is largely reasonable and intuitive and I like the pairwise relation encoding in the methodology, although there is room for improvement in this area; see weaknesses. The idea of curriculum RL to iteratively and continuously improve on LLM outputs is also intriguing.
- The experimental section is largely thorough, and the improvement over baseline and prompting-based self-refine seems largely convincing. Experimental support is also provided for some (but not all) of the critical designs, such as the use of two (or more) stages of reinforcement learning and the indispensability of each stage. 
- The paper is generally well-written and clear.

### Weaknesses
 - The computational cost and the execution difficulty should be more clearly stated: while the method seems to lead to a stronger gain than self-refine, such an improvement is not always significant and sometimes self-refine seems to be stronger by some metric (e.g., in terms of GPT-4 evaluation), although the authors have given possible explanations as to why they occur. On the other hand, self-refine as a prompting-based method is much easier to execute and cheaper I think the paper would benefit if the authors would give more detailed account on the computational cost, including a comparison with the baseline methods. 
- Some claims are qualitatively argued rather than empirically validated. An example is the use of pairwise relation training in Eq (2), a key component of the algorithm’s design. The authors largely provide intuitive explanations against the simpler alternative in favour of the more complicated design the paper adopted, but no empirical validation is provided.

### Questions
- Address my concerns in weaknesses.
- It seems to me that PIT is run on top of an RLHF-finetuned model (i.e., the model generating “original” outputs in experiments)? if so, this point should be more clearly stated. If not, why not? In that case, RLHF should be an obvious baseline to compare against given that PIT is closely formulated based on the original RLHF (I gave the benefit of the doubt in the preliminary review on this point, pending clarification in rebuttal).
- Do you observe that the reward model remains discriminative after multiple rounds of improvements? It seems to me that the reward model is trained on the original y_w and y_l annotated responses only, but the new outputs should be even better than y_w after a few iterations.

-- **Post-rebuttal** --

I thank the authors for the detailed feedback, which largely addressed my concerns. I also read other reviews, and I will stick to my rating that recommends acceptance. I think the discussion regarding prompting methods might be better qualified, though, as even if the proposed method uses fewer tokens, prompting-based methods have the strength that they do not require model weight adjustments, and only forward passes are required. As discussed in the original review, the results compared to baselines can be occasionally somewhat mixed, so I am unable to give an even higher score. Nonetheless, I believe this paper is of value to the community and can be accepted at ICLR.

### Summary
The paper proposes a framework, PIT, that trains an additional model that improves the output of an LLM with RLHF. The reward is set to be the preference gap between the improved output and the original LLM output, i.e. implicitly trained with the improvement goal of better aligning with human preferences.

### Strengths
1. The paper introduces an interesting framework, PIT, that can learn how to improve the LLM output in a RLHF way, which does not require a significant amount of human annotation and prompt design.
2. Instead of updating the original LLM as the original RLHF, PIT proposes to update the model that targets improving the output for the original LLM, which is a novel technique.
3. The paper evaluates the PIT technique with the previous self-refine method that also tries to improve the LLM output, and demonstrates a better result. It also shows a set of ablation studies that show the effectiveness of each component.

### Weaknesses
1. The paper motivates why using RLHF in output improvement is better than just prompting the LLM to give feedback, but it is unclear why we should apply RLHF for the improvement, instead of directly applying RLHF to the original LLM. It would be better to see the comparison in the evaluation.
2. Comparing PIT with Self-Refine seems unfair as PIT requires more human annotation as it requires additional human preference labels.
3. The description of PIT is a bit unclear as the model used in each component of the method is not clearly stated.
