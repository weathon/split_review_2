# Addressing Loss of Plasticity and Catastrophic Forgetting in Continual Learning

- Decision: Accept
- Scores: 6, 6, 3, 6

## Abstract
Deep representation learning methods struggle with continual learning, suffering from both catastrophic forgetting of useful units and loss of plasticity, often due to rigid and unuseful units.
While many methods address these two issues separately, only a few currently deal with both simultaneously.
In this paper, we introduce Utility-based Perturbed Gradient Descent (UPGD) as a novel approach for the continual learning of representations. 
UPGD combines gradient updates with perturbations, where it applies smaller modifications to more useful units, protecting them from forgetting, and larger modifications to less useful units, rejuvenating their plasticity.
We use a challenging streaming learning setup where continual learning problems have hundreds of non-stationarities and unknown task boundaries.
We show that many existing methods suffer from at least one of the issues, predominantly manifested by their decreasing accuracy over tasks.
On the other hand, UPGD continues to improve performance and surpasses or is competitive with all methods in all problems. Finally, in extended reinforcement learning experiments with PPO, we show that while Adam exhibits a performance drop after initial learning, UPGD avoids it by addressing both continual learning issues

### Summary
This paper proposes Utility-based Perturbed Gradient Descent(UPGD). A modification to the vanilla gradient descent update rule that helps the model to operate in a more challenging scenario of streaming learning. The authors introduced their utility function as an importance weight for each parameter of a neural network. The authors show the effectiveness of their contribution compared to common importance assignment methods in the continual learning literature.

### Strengths
**Clear Structure and Writing:** The paper benefits from a clear structure and concise writing style.

**Addressing a Complex Issue:** The authors tackle an underexplored yet challenging problem, and I appreciate their efforts to address online continual learning.

**Mathematical Foundation:** The definition of utility introduced in the paper is based on simple and sound mathematical derivations. 

**New metric:** The introduction of a new plasticity metric is a nice contribution to the relatively uncharted territory of streaming learning.

### Weaknesses
 **Unscaled perturbations:** My main point of issue is the reasoning behind the perturbations in the update rule. The authors claim that by adding the perturbation we are making the unimportant weights more plastic however I am not really convinced by this explanation I believe it requires elaboration both in the rebuttal and in the paper. 

Another related issue with the proposed perturbation is the fact that all of them are getting drawn from the same standard normal distribution. This design choice is strange to me since the parameters of a neural network usually differ in magnitude from layer to layer. By adding an unscaled random perturbation to all of the weights we are ignoring this scale difference which I believe is sub-optimal. I know that in the unprotected version, they are getting weighted by different values but this particular scaling is more correlating with changes in the loss value rather than the parameter magnitudes.

Highly relevant to the above issue, I believe it is also necessary to have an additional ablation study, investigating the role of having and not having the perturbations in the update rule. I also want to disentangle the effect of weight decay. The only time that UG is added in the ablation is in the presence of WD. More specifically I am curious about the following scenarios in Figure 8: 

* Added ablations:
    + SGD + UG + WP + WD (present in the paper)
    + SGD + UG + WP 
    + SGD + UG + WD
    + SGD + UG

    
**Including more diverse experiments:** Moreover, in the experiments section I believe the authors need to include more diverse experiments. All of the streaming tasks are permutations of the same task. Whether in the label or in the input space. It is not as obvious as the authors' claim that after the permutation of the input space the previously learned representations are not relevant anymore (end of page 6). In the input-permuted scenario, only the first layer needs to have significant change. This is especially true for the label-permuted tasks as the network does a good job of clustering the data up to the final FC layer. I encourage the authors to use the Cifar100 superclass dataset (or any similar sequence of tasks that does not simply rely on the permutation).

**Visualization:** Finally, I believe the visualization needs several improvements: the legends on the plot are very hard to read (Fig 2, 3, 4, 5). Some colors are similar to each other and the width of the lines in the legends is too thin. (Especially in figure 4). In Figure 7, some numbers in dark blue cells are almost impossible to read.

### Questions
**Q1:** Have the authors tried to use an scaled version of the perturbation that takes the magnitude of the parameters into account? (Other than the unprotected version). Also I would appreciate the if you could elaborate on the effect of perturbations.

**Q2:** Could you also explain about the average online accuracy? it is stated that "The average online accuracy is the percentage of correct predictions within each task." I cannot see the average part here. Is it calculating the accuracy on each task separately then averaging over the number of tasks?

### Summary
The paper proposes a measure of weight utility of weights in neural networks for given loss and using it to modify a gradient-based weight update in networks to alleviate the problem of catastrophic forgetting.  The authors identify two fundamental aspect of catastrophic forgetting - the forgetting aspect (not losing what the network already know) and plasticity aspect (ability to learn new concepts).  The proposed method is meant to address two problems at the same time, preseving high utility weights with no modifications (to prevent forgetting) while randomly perturbing low utility weights to "encourage" them to participate in the computations related to new tasks (plasticity).  Empirical evaluations show solid performance of the proposed method according to the forgetting and plasticity metrics newly defined by the authors.

### Strengths
The proposed rule is straight forward.  

Computational complexity of the evaluation of true utility is well addressed making the method practical.

Empirical evidence provided shows the proposed rule is effective for alleviation of catastrophic forgetting.

Decomposing the catastrophic forgetting problem into two aspects: forgetting and plasticity, seems very sensible.

Proposed measures of plasticity and forgetting seem sensible.

The paper is well written.

### Weaknesses
Though empirical evidence provided in the paper suggest it does (in that it works), I am not sure that the proposed definition of weight utility make sense.  The power of neural networks (and the problem of the interpretation of its computation) is its distributed computation.  Utility of an individual weight is almost always nothing - in fact, quite often any particular weight, sometimes even large number of weights, can be taken out of the network, with little impact on performance.  So, it's more about combinations of weights working together...and the proposed utility doesn't measure that.  I understand that evaluating utility of combinations of weights is intractable, but I worry that this simplification, of judging utility of each weight in isolation, is encouraging less distributed representation, which might come with a penalty in performance.

Fundamentally, on the forgetting front, the proposed method is just another weight consolidation method, and it's a bit hard to believe it beats Elastic Weight Consolidation.  It am not 100% sure that the proposed method doesn't favour plasticity over forgetting nor that the forgetting evaluation isn't biased towards methods that favour plasticity (see questions below).

Though I understand (and like) in principle what the utility-based update is supposed to do, I can't quite understand why it actually works.  The proposed measure of the utility of parameters is a measure with respect to the loss on the new input/output pair.  If this pair comes from a new task, how does measuring utility of the model parameters with respect to the loss of this new task have bearing on the utility of the parameters for the old tasks?  Just because utility of a given weight is, say, low for the current sample, it doesn't mean it's low for previous samples.  It seems to me that the proposed method would score high on plasticity (it finds available weights for new task)...but I don't see how it protects against forgetting, in principle, though if we are to talk about empirical evidence...  I don't understand how 4.3 measures catastrophic forgetting.  Permuting labels of CIFAR10 with the new tasks suggests to me that it's all about plasticity again.  Shouldn't it be an experiment, where labels are kept intact, but new tasks are added...and previous tasks examples are not used?  Am I missing something about how experiments reported in 4.3 are done?

Why are the accuracy results of training on CIFAR-10 and EMNIST so poor in Figure 6?  State of the art CIFAR-10 is close (or above) 90%.  Something close to 80% would be probably still acceptable...but 60% is quite poor.  I am not exactly sure what EMNIST variant entails, but is 70% accuracy a good accuracy for this dataset?  It is often easy to shown improvements of something at the low end of the models' performance, but that doesn't always translate to same effect at the high (or close to) end of the models' performance...and in the end, the latter is what we really care about.  So, does the proposed method prevent forgetting at the high end, when model is performing at or reasonably close to state of the art?

This is not a massive issue, but does the per batch normalisation of utility make the performance of the method variable with different  mini-batch size settings?

### Summary
This work proposes to modify stochastic gradient descent (SGD) to overcome forgetting and promote plasticity in continual learning. These goals are achieved by masking out the parameters with high utility and perturbing gradient direction by Gaussian noise. For utility computation, the authors propose an approximate but efficient scheme based on second-order Taylor expansion of the loss. Experiments demonstrate that (i) the proposed utility approximation is more accurate than simple baselines such as weight magnitude, (ii) it maintains plasticity, (iii) plasticity and accuracy are in general correlated, (iv) the method tends to forget less than baselines, and (v) it simultaneously promote plasticity and prevents forgetting.

### Strengths
This paper is written well. The notation is okay and the mathematical derivations seem correct. The baseline methods are clearly outperformed and the experiments verify the central claim of the paper.

### Weaknesses
Although continual learning is an important machine learning challenge, I feel the paper suffers from significant weaknesses:

  - First and foremost, I do not think this paper makes a significant contribution. The methodology is incremental in that it combines two well-known ideas (perturbed gradient descent + keeping active neurons unchanged). Specifically, the use of perturbed gradient descent has been explored in the context of masked training, for example as seen in "Masked Training of Neural Networks with Partial Gradients", and the idea of masking gradients to increase plasticity is presented in "Learning where to learn: Gradient sparsity in meta and continual learning".
  - Second, it is tested on very toy setups. The experiments are not convincing enough to show the applicability of the method to interesting real-world setups. For instance, I am not sure the networks achieve similar plasticity if tested on, e.g., webcam data instead of MNIST, where the feature space is a lot richer and hence plasticity is much more difficult.
  - Third, theoretical properties/implications of the method should be carefully examined.
    - For instance, the Taylor expansion would only hold if $W_{l,i,j}$ are infinitesimally small. We do not know in general if this holds or not. I suggest the paper should include a (preferably rigorous) discussion on this.
    - Likewise, gradient descent is no longer steepest descent but some approximation to it. Investigating why it works is important. As shown by the results, no collapse occurs but again, I wonder how this translates into more challenging settings where utilities of most parameters are high.

### Questions
Here I list my questions as well as suggestions:

- It would be better if Label-Permuted EMNIST was described before the results are discussed in paragraph 5.
- _Although a few methods address both issues simultaneously, such methods expect known task boundaries, maintain a replay buffer, or require pretraining, which does not fit streaming learning._ <--- reference needed for this claim.
- What does "a Hessian diagonal approximation in linear complexity" mean? Linear in the number of parameters?
- It would be better if the main text included details on the "utility propagation theorem".
- It would be better if the descriptions of the tasks/datasets (e.g. Input-Permuted MNIST in section 4.2) were given before the details.
- Does "each learner is trained for 1M samples, one sample each time step" mean gradient descent using one sample only? Is this realistic?

### Summary
This paper introduces a novel approach called Utility-based Perturbed Gradient Descent (UPGD) to address catastrophic forgetting and loss of plasticity in neural networks. UPGD combines gradient updates with a mask to protect useful weights from being forgotten and reuse less useful weights. The paper also proposes metrics to evaluate loss of plasticity and catastrophic forgetting. Empirically, the method outperforms existing methods in streaming learning problems in terms of retaining plasticity and avoiding catastrophic forgetting.

### Strengths
**Originality**
Conceptually, the problem addressed by the authors of avoiding forgetting while retaining plasticity in streaming learning settings remains underexplored. The specific method proposed by the authors is relatively straightforward and conceptually similar to prior approaches; however, it empirically outperforms prior methods as the experimental results demonstrate.

**Quality**
The convergence guarantee results are valuable. The experiments are generally comprehensive and well-conducted. Assessing the quality of the approximated utilities in section 4.1 is 
of critical importance, and the results are convincing. Conducting miniImagenet scale experiments is a solid addition to the experimental section. The ablation study in Figure 8 is also insightful.

**Clarity**
The writing is generally clear and the figures are well-illustrated.

**Significance**
Overall, the paper addresses a major issue in the field of streaming learning. Given that the paper doesn't investigate the theoretical properties of UPGD, the significance of the paper hinges on the strength of the empirical results.

### Weaknesses
Since the proposed method lacks theoretical performance guarantees, its empirical performance is critical. The authors have generally done a good job demonstrating that UPGD avoids forgetting and maintains plasticity; however, a few concerns remain:

- It appears that S-EWC does not have too much of a gap with UPGD judging from figure 7: it entirely avoids catastrophic forgetting, and the only setting where it loses plasticity where UPGD does not is on MNIST
- S-MAS outperforms UPGD on miniImagenet at the end of training, and does not have a large gap overall
- The ablation of figure 8 checks the contribution of each component of UPGD sequentially as they are added to regular SGD. Ideally, the ablation would study how each component affects UPGD when they are *individually* removed (e.g. UPGD without WP).

**Minor comments**
Figure 7 is referred to before Figure 6; ideally, their order would be swapped.
I see in Section 4 that the results are averaged over 20 trials, but the meaning of the error margins in some of the figures is not made clear (e.g. figure 2). I would also suggest increasing the number of trials to smooth out the curves if possible.

### Questions
Is it possible to show theoretical performance guarantees for UPGD? For instance, can the approximation error of equation 2 be bounded? Alternatively, if the true utilities are used in equation 3, is it possible to derive some guarantees against forgetting or loss of plasticity?

How much more significantly does UPGD improve upon baselines S-EWC and S-MAS?

How does UPGD-W perform with WP and WD removed individually?
