# Vibroacoustic Frequency Response Prediction with Query-based Operator Networks

- Decision: Reject
- Scores: 6, 5, 5, 6, 8

## Abstract
Understanding vibroacoustic wave propagation in mechanical structures like airplanes, cars and houses is crucial to ensure health and comfort of their users. To analyze such systems, designers and engineers primarily consider the dynamic response in the frequency domain, which is computed through expensive numerical simulations like the finite element method. In contrast, data-driven surrogate models offer the promise of speeding up these simulations, thereby facilitating tasks like design optimization, uncertainty quantification, and design space exploration. We present a structured benchmark for a representative vibroacoustic problem: Predicting the frequency response for vibrating plates with varying forms of beadings. The benchmark features a total of 12,000 plate geometries with an associated numerical solution and introduces evaluation metrics to quantify the prediction quality. 
To address the frequency response prediction task, we propose a novel frequency query operator model, which is trained to map plate geometries to frequency response functions. By integrating principles from operator learning and implicit models for shape encoding, our approach effectively addresses the prediction of resonance peaks of frequency responses. We evaluate the method on our vibrating-plates benchmark and find that it outperforms DeepONets, Fourier Neural Operators and more traditional neural network architectures.

### Rating
6

### Rating Number
6

### Confidence
3: You are fairly confident in your assessment. It is possible that you did not understand some parts of the submission or that you are unfamiliar with some pieces of related work. Math/other details were not carefully checked.

### Summary
This paper has two contributions: a dataset of vibroacoustic frequency responses from metal plates and learning models addressing the problem of predicting such responses. Numerical computation of such responses is expensive, so a learning model may be able to approximate the computation and directly predict responses at different frequencies. The dataset contains 12k plate geometries and their responses computed from the numerical method. The work has also proposed a list of evaluation metrics for a prediction model. It provides two models and tests them on the datasets.

### Strengths
The problem is interesting. It represents another application that uses neural networks to approximate numerical computations. 

The model choices are also reasonable. It uses convolutional neural networks or ViT to extract a compact representation of the plate and then make predictions from there. The experiment results are sufficient.

### Weaknesses
Considering that this work is applicational and has little contribution to methodology, I do worry that this work does not have enough audience in the ICLR community.

### Questions
How do you distinguish different methods as baselines and proposed methods? I feel that they are all applications of existing models with minor changes.

### Rating

### Rating Number

### Confidence
2: You are willing to defend your assessment, but it is quite likely that you did not understand the central parts of the submission or that you are unfamiliar with some pieces of related work. Math/other details were not carefully checked.

### Summary
This paper introduces a dataset of 12,000 plate geometries and their associated frequency responses for a frequency prediction problem. A metric is introduced to evaluation the quality of the response. An operator model is also introduced for solving the frequency prediction problem. Numerical results show the competitiveness of the model.

### Strengths
- This paper focuses on the frequency response prediction problem, which currently has no structured benchmark
- The data is simulated based on a plate theory differential equation, and solved using FEM which has theoretical guarantees on its convergence
- A throughout literature review on related work is given
- Overall, it is a clearly written paper and easy to follow 
- The limitations of the paper are discussed

### Weaknesses
 - It seems that in the numerical experiments, there is no noise added to the data. Predicting data without noise is not a difficult task from a data-fitting perspective, especially with large models like deep networks.
- The details of the finite element method and linear solver are missing, which is crucial to the generation of the data. Specifically, the type of element used (e.g., shell, solid), the number of nodes per element, the order of the interpolation functions, and the specific linear solver algorithm (e.g., direct or iterative) are not specified. This makes it difficult to assess the accuracy and computational cost of the data generation process.
- It seems that in the calculation of the aggregation frequency response, the paper only describes how it is done, but no justification is given. Are there any references which can justify the calculation steps? Specifically, the paper should clarify why the mean squared velocity is chosen as the aggregation method, and whether this is the standard practice in the field.
- In the results, it seems that the the sizes (e.g., number of parameters) of the model are not reported. This is important because the proposed model is outperforming because it uses larger networks. Also, it does not mention how the parameter tuning is performed. It is important to understand the computational cost of the proposed method and how the hyperparameters were selected.

### Questions
- In the dataset generation, the displacement is set to 0, which means that a term in the plate theory differential equation is set to 0. Does it mean that the plate is static? Is it a common setting in existing work?
- Also, it assumes that the vibration comes from a single point. Is this setting also used in related work? Are there any references to it?
- The data is generated by solving the differential equation use FEM and a linear solve to (1). Thus, the accuracy of the solution is crucial here. What is the error to equation (1) after applying the linear solver? How well does the generated data satisfy the differential equation?
- How does the proposed method perform on frequencies that it is not trained on? Since one strength of the proposed operator model is that it can be evaluated at any frequency values, it is important to show that it can empirically generalize to other frequencies well.

5: You are absolutely certain about your assessment. You are very familiar with the related work and checked the math/other details carefully.

### Summary
This paper mainly proposes a PDE observer task that asks to predict the internal field information given the observation of plate geometry. The main contribution is the code and dataset, while it proposes a novel model of FQ-Operator. The proposed method outperforms the DeepONets and FNOs on the proposed dataset.

Post rebuttal comments: today, I held a long discussion with the AC to discuss this paper. The major concern is that this paper did not fit into the machine learning conferences very well. Senior ACs also suggest that authors should make efforts to help reviewers and the audience know the paper better. I wish to give the authors the following suggestions to improve their paper:

1. It is better to submit to a corresponding physics venue to find more suitable reviewers. I'm not an expert in wave propagation, and I cannot give a full assessment of this paper.

2. The title and abstract need to be revised to let machine learning people know what this paper is doing. For example, the title may be changed to "Query-based Operator Networks: Learning to Model Wave Propagation with Neural Operators".

3. In Table 1, kNN needs to be changed. kNN is a general methodology and it's better to be more specific.

4. In the introduction, 'geometry is represented with a neural network' is not rigorous in the eyes of a machine learning expert.

5. It's better to clarify the contribution of the proposed module against previous modules. More rationales need to be given.

6. It's better to work on a real physics dataset as well, or demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed module on exisitng datasets.

7. It's better to introduce this work from a machine learning perspective, rather than focusing the task.

Based on above concerns, I need to decrease my score at this moment. However, I wish to encourage the authors, regardless of whether they wish to submit to ML conferences again or to physics journals.

### Strengths
Excellent paper! 
1. I'm working on a similar task in this domain, and I appreciate and endorse the effort of this paper. My experience on these tasks convinced me this is a good application of machine learning in science. This paper will hold a unique position in this domain.
2. The construction of the proposed benchmark is well-motivated. I believe that the proposed frequency-domain problem is worth investigating. Also, I believe that this is also an important area for operator learning.
3. This paper is easy to follow, and many different lines of work in this domain are well-cited and discussed. This is another strong merit of this paper.
4. The proposed model is reasonable, and I believe it has some sort of novelty, although the major contribution of this work is in its formulations.
5. The limitations are well-discussed.

### Weaknesses
In general, I believe this paper's strengths outperform its weaknesses. And I believe this paper is certainly above the bar of this conference. My concerns are:
1. How easy the plate geometries can be acquired? The proposed beading patterns may not be easily gotten, and probably frequency or speed is probably easy to get. This discussion is required and is essential in this paper.

2. What's the distance between the simulations and the data collected in the real world? If the authors can conduct some experiments on real-world equipment, it would be very great.

3. The mesh geometries in this paper are not represented in vector form, and they are blurred. This should not happen and should be fixed in the rebuttal phase.

4. Why does Table 3 not have baselines' performances? It's better to test baseline methods on the transfer learning setup as well, and this is very critical.

5. It seems that the visualization of Figure 6 is not very good because (b) and (d) are not very similar. Also, I think it's better to add baseline comparisons or even videos (videos can be provided in the supplementary or the anonymous link).

6. The mechanical model should be put into the main text and linked to the dataset construction or methodology. This is very essential in the PDE domain.

7. What do grid-based models mean, and why is FNO not based on grids? I think FNO should have an option to work in regular grids. If grid-based methods are stronger, then FNO should also be put in the similar mode.

### Summary
Dear Area Chair,

I'm sorry that I'm not familiar with vibroacoustic wave propagation. Thus I'm not able to review this paper.

### Strengths
None.

### Weaknesses
1. The anonymous repository's documentation would benefit from some improvement. For example, it seems to be using Weights & Biases for logging but no explanation on how to use it is provided. Furthermore, the command in the README under "Train a model" section is not correct as the paths do not correspond to the folder structure. The setup script does not provide specific versions for the packages being installed (except for pytorch's cuda version) and, thus, this will impact the reproducibility of this work. Specifically, the lack of explicit versioning for libraries like numpy, scipy, and the deep learning framework can lead to inconsistencies in numerical results due to subtle changes in these libraries' behavior across versions. This is particularly critical in scientific computing where numerical precision and reproducibility are paramount.
2. The experiment results are conducted in what it seems to be a single test set, and not through some sort of cross validation procedure to understand the variation and relevance of the results depending on the datasets' splits. This is a significant concern as it is difficult to assess the generalization capability of the proposed method without understanding how the performance varies across different data splits. The reported results might be overly optimistic due to a fortunate choice of the test set, and a more robust evaluation using k-fold cross-validation or repeated random sub-sampling validation would provide a more reliable estimate of the model's true performance.
3. The datasets are synthetic, and do not seem to come from real-world measures. I understand from the paper that this is cost prohibitive, and that is why this new dataset is relevant, but I got the impression that this applied domain has implications in the real world, and therefore I'd guess and experiment in a real-world dataset, even if small, would be relevant. While the use of a synthetic dataset is understandable given the cost of real-world data acquisition, the lack of any validation on real-world data limits the practical relevance of the proposed method. The paper should at least discuss the potential domain shift between the synthetic and real-world data and how this might affect the performance of the proposed method.

1: You are unable to assess this paper and have alerted the ACs to seek an opinion from different reviewers.

### Summary
This paper seems to introduce a novel benchmark dataset to explore vibrating plates frequency response, evaluate existing method on this new benchmark, and a propose a new architecture based on operator learning that outperforms existing methods in the literature.

Unfortunately, I do not feel capable to review this paper. I do not have a background on mechanics, physics, vibrating plates and acoustics; at the same time, I have never worked with operator learning, Fourier neural operators, and frequency domains in the context of artificial intelligence. Therefore, I lack the literature knowledge and experience from both the applied and methodological domain explored in this paper, making it impossible for my review to be useful for a proper evaluation at a conference like ICLR.

I have alerted the ACs to seek an opinion from a different reviewer.

----------------------
UPDATE: At the author's rebuttal, I was provided to an answer to what was a key weakness I've understood from the paper (seemingly only one test set). Instead, I was given results based on a cross validation procedure that I believe to be reasonable. Based on this, I change my rating from 6 to 8 (accept).

### Strengths
1. The code seems well organised overall, with a good folder/module structure.
2. The Related Work section seems specific and relevant for all the methods and applied area of the paper. It also seems to motivate well the paper.
3. The experiments (as, for example, seen in table 2) include one more "traditional" machine learning model (i.e, kNN). This is quite positive in the context of a area that sometimes forgets to compare new developments with simpler methods that might provide similar results. Although, from what I could understand in Appendix, this is based on an low-dimension embedding from a deep learning autoencoder model.
4. The paper provides an ablation analysis in Appendix.

### Weaknesses
1. The anonymous repository's documentation would benefit from some improvement. For example, it seems to be using Weights & Biases for logging but no explanation on how to use it is provided. Furthermore, the command in the README under "Train a model" section is not correct as the paths do not correspond to the folder structure.
