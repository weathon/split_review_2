- Decision: Accept
- Scores: 5, 6, 6, 5, 8

## Abstract
The reasoning performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) on a wide range of problems critically relies on chain-of-thought prompting, which involves providing a few chain of thought demonstrations as exemplars in prompts. Recent work, e.g., Tree of Thoughts, has pointed out the importance of exploration and self-evaluation in reasoning step selection for complex problem solving. In this paper, we present Boosting of Thoughts (BoT), an automated prompting framework for problem solving with LLMs by iteratively exploring and self-evaluating many trees of thoughts in order to acquire an ensemble of trial-and-error reasoning experiences, which will serve as a new form of prompting to solve the complex problem. Starting from a simple prompt without requiring examples, BoT iteratively explores and evaluates a large collection of reasoning steps, and more importantly, uses error analysis obtained from the LLM on them to explicitly revise prompting, which in turn enhances reasoning step generation, until a final answer is attained. Our experiments with GPT-4 and Llama2 across extensive complex mathematical problems demonstrate that BoT consistently achieves higher or comparable problem-solving rates than other advanced prompting approaches.

### Summary
The paper proposes a new framework Boosting of Thoughts (BoT) with large language models (LLMs) for task-specific prompting. It provides how to construct prompts and use the trial-and-error reasoning approach to interact with the LLM to generate the final responses. The experiments show the effectiveness of the proposed method.

### Strengths
- Prompt engineering is a non-trivial task, and crafting effective prompts may require specialized training for human experts. The paper introduces an innovative framework for iterative prompting, leveraging LLM's feedback on its own reasoning, thereby reducing the need for human prompt engineering.

- Addressing complex problems is crucial in LLM applications. This approach effectively demonstrates the power of prompt engineering and expands the capabilities of LLMs without the need for retraining or fine-tuning. Experiments conducted on multiple datasets show competitive performance compared to other prompting approaches.

### Weaknesses
 - I agree that prompt engineering is crucial for LLM applications. However, it's worth noting that prompt engineering is often model-dependent, and the techniques may evolve as LLM capabilities improve. This may not offer long-term guidance for research unless it uncovers fundamental insights. This distinction is critical in differentiating academic research from practical production. Therefore, while the paper does offer valuable techniques for prompting the model and achieving good results on evaluation sets, it lacks in-depth discussion of the underlying reasons. This makes the paper better suited for application-oriented conferences rather than ICLR.

- LLMs can be unstable and prone to hallucination, which could result in bad or incorrect feedback when using the Boosting of Thoughts (BoT) iterative prompting framework. Is there analysis on the impact of "bad" LLM feedback? Further, as the iterative produces are automatic, spurious feedback could get amplified over iterations. Some discuss may be necessary.

-  Details are lacking on key components like aggregation strategies and generating edge weights for trees. More analysis or ablation studies are also helpful.

### Questions
- In Section 3.2, it is not quite clear how to calculate the weights for the weighted binary tree.

### Summary
The paper presents an extension of the Chain of Thought (CoT) and Tree of Thoughts (ToT) method, named Boosting of Thoughts (BoT). BoT refines the problem-solving process in large language models (LLMs). BoT harnesses error analysis to improve the LLM's problem-solving accuracy iteratively. The "Boosting of Thoughts" (BoT) procedure is a two-step process that first generates a diversity of reasoning paths from a Large Language Model (LLM) in the form of a weighted binary tree, enhancing problem-solving by creating a hierarchy of potential solutions. Then, it employs a novel aggregation strategy that iteratively refines and combines these paths. Through best-first and greedy aggregations, BoT selects and optimizes the most promising chain of thought, using iterative feedback to progressively improve the LLM's performance on complex problem-solving tasks. The paper reports improved performance on complex mathematical problems when tested with GPT-4 and LLAMA2, compared to CoT and ToT.

### Strengths
1. This is an innovative extension of the Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and Tree-of-Thought (ToT) methods. Compared to CoT and ToT, the author adopts the idea on leveraging error analysis to refine the LLM. This can be a limitation of CoT and ToT, as they do not conduct error analysis and more importantly, learn from errors. The motivation is intuitive and clear.

2. Unlike ToT, which expands multiple reasoning tree branches, the BoT method iteratively refines a single line of thought. This focus on iteration rather than expansion allows for a more concentrated and efficient improvement of the reasoning path. The computation moves from exploring the tree into learning from erroneous trials. 

3. The Boosting of Thoughts (BoT) concept shows a clear advancement in problem-solving methodologies within large language models. It effectively combines generation and evaluation steps to progressively enhance reasoning, demonstrating a significant leap in the model's ability to handle complex tasks. 

4. The experiments are clear, the results are effective. And all experiments are classic experiments from CoT and ToT, so it is clear to compare BoT’s performance over CoT and ToT.

### Weaknesses
The mauscript need polished in their figures' presentation, e.g., the authors need give more detailed examples in Fig1.

### Questions
Q1: In the prompt, I wonder whether the “error input” are included, or only the “experience” is included? From figure 1, I only see “error report” like “step 1 is not closer to 24”, no “error input” like what is step 1, 2, 3. How the LLM know what step 1 mean, and how can LLM learn from error, if LLM does not know specific input?
Q2: How about you consider the entire (input, error analysis) as an In-context Learning example? Then the entire method is similar to CoT, meaning that you can manually construct an exemplar consisting of (input, error analysis) pair. Then use the CoT idea to follow the strategy to generate analysis and think about the correct answer.

### Summary
The paper proposes a Boosting of Thoughts (BoT) framework, which aims to achieve the boosting mechanism that embraces aggregation and experience, thereby enabling the progressive refinement of unreliable reasoning steps (weak thoughts) by learning from errors to solve various problems, eventually.

### Strengths
This paper reiterates their proposition that a simple prompt can be enhanced by gradually accumulating error analysis on its generated thoughts to address complex tasks.  The authors present a novel framework, the Boosting of Thoughts (BoT), to implement such progressive prompt enhancement for effective thought generation with an experience-driven iteration process. Iteratively exploring and self-evaluating the generated simplistic trees of thoughts enables a simple initial prompt to be gradually enhanced by an ensemble of trial-and-error reasoning experiences, resulting in accurate solutions. 
This work seems like a quite comprehensive investigation with well-structured and easy to read sections.

### Weaknesses
 The paper is based on the motivation that starting with a simple prompt without human annotations for LLMs, BoT may get weak thoughts. However, with aggregation, BoT is capable of deriving a more logical and effective thought chain from them, thereby guiding the subsequent refinement.

Could the authors expand on this statement "Experience consistently leads to thought revision, but too much can have the opposite effect."? If one is looking to recreate the study, are there any guidelines or steps one could adopt to as where should be the stopping point?

Very interesting findings, however Experimental results reported are limited. The authors evaluated LLM models only on a single testing procedure. However, the analysis doesn't seem concrete due to the smaller sample set considered and it would truly be insightful if the analysis was done on a larger dataset to infer results.
Further experiments should be performed using statistical metrics, and statistical distribution of the results should be extracted. These outcomes help better support the conclusions' claims.
The paper would be greatly strengthened if the proposed algorithm would outperform state-of-the-art methods

### Summary
This paper proposes a new framework called Boosting of Thoughts (BoT) for complex problem solving with large language models. BoT aims to iteratively explore many possible trees of thoughts and learn from ineffective thoughts/errors to progressively refine the prompt and elicit effective reasoning from LLMs. It aggregates the best reasoning chains from the trees and analyzes them with the LLM to gain experience on errors and revisions. Experiments on mathematical reasoning show BoT matches or exceeds previous SOTA approaches without needing human annotations.

### Strengths
1. The paper proposes a novel framework, Boosting of Thoughts (BoT), that utilizes an iterative trial-and-error approach to refine prompting and elicit complex reasoning from LLMs. The key idea of learning from errors/ineffective thoughts is creative and mimics human problem-solving.
2. Authors involve interesting techniques like weighted binary trees and heterogeneous growth strategies to generate diverse, shallow thought structures from a simple prompt.
3. Evaluations on mathematical reasoning benchmarks demonstrate effectiveness of BoT. It matches or exceeds state-of-the-art methods without needing human annotated prompts. Also, the authors conduct ablation studies to further explain the mechanisms.

### Weaknesses
1. Although this article proposes several practical strategies, its reasoning framework remains inherently reliant on the Tree-of-thoughts model, thereby limiting its novelty. BoT's structure is restricted to binary trees. Expanding to more complex graph structures will further improve reasoning but is not explored.
2. For analysis, the prompts used to seed BoT could introduce biases and variances. More evaluations on OOD data would be useful to assess the robustness and generalizability of the improvements.
3. The evaluations are mainly limited to mathematical reasoning. For generality, testing BoT's performance on other domains like commonsense reasoning or symbolic reasoning is needed.
4. In the 'Competitors' paragraph, authors mentioned incorporating CoT-SC and Complex CoT as  baselines, yet CoT-SC is not shown in the 'mathematical reasoning' part. I hold the view that comparing the proposed method with prevailing baselines like SC(5) or SC(10) will offer a more direct reflection of BoT's efficacy. If it can outperform Complexity-based SC with fewer resources, it would make the work more solid.

### Questions
1. As for the statement on page 3, 'Our paper embraces ToT due to its high ability and leaves GoT and BoT for future work,' is 'BoT' a typo error here? Or you mean combining BoT method with GoT? Regardless, I believe that including GoT in the comparison would make this work more interesting and informative.
2. In the 'Competitors' paragraph in experiments, could you clarify how many reasoning chains are sampled for Complex-CoT and PHP respectively?
3. The study conducts experiments based on GPT-4, which can lead to substantially high experimentation costs. Have the authors considered or utilized more cost-effective options like GPT-3.5-turbo? I'm aware of the recent variability in performance of this model. However, if there are experimental results showing that GPT-3.5 combined with BoT can outperform GPT-4 with CoT/CoT-SC, it would render the study's findings more convincing.

### Summary
The paper looks at optimizing prompting for GPT-4 and Llama2 for solving mathematical problems. They provide an iterative strategy to prompting models for complex problems. The key challenges are SVAMP (1000 tasks), GSM8K (8500 tasks), AQUA (100 000 tasks), and MATH (12 500 tasks). The BoT, especially when enhanced with CoT, outperforms alternative methods.

### Strengths
When we reach the limits by simply increasing language models, optimal interaction becomes increasingly interesting. Exploring new ways of pushing the models to do more complex tasks can get more value out of existing LLMs and is highly relevant. 

The paper provides code that is easy-to-read (although a Readme would be a nice addition).

The method shows that BoT and CoT perform above the comparisons.

### Weaknesses
The use of the term 'boosting' in the context of refining 'weak thoughts' introduces some ambiguity. In traditional machine learning, boosting involves the iterative enhancement of quantifiably weak learners. In the BoT framework, the concept of a 'weak thought' is more abstract, and its "weakness" is not as straightforward to measure. This led me to perceive the process more as a 'pruning of weak thoughts' rather than 'boosting' in the conventional sense. It would be beneficial for the paper to clarify how the model aggregates and refines these thoughts in the tree structure, and how the "weakness" of a thought is determined and improved upon.

I think the paper comes across unnecessarily complicated, compared to the code the text is hard to fully grasp. The figures all depict Game of 24, adding examples from both a successful and a failed example of BoT for the other tasks would be beneficial.

For complete reproducibility and clarity, it would be beneficial to provide the full codebase, including modules like 'llmpebase’s residual_tree_of_thoughts', which is referenced several times but not included.

The title suggests a general problem-solving approach using Large Language Models. However, the content is specifically focused on mathematical problems. It might be beneficial to make the domain-specific nature of the research clearer in the title or early in the abstract to set accurate expectations for readers.

### Questions
Do I understand correctly that T 10 was maximum 10 prompts and M 15 consisted of 15 instances that generated binary trees that you then averaged over?
