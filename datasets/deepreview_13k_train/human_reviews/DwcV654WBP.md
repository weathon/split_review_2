# TVTSv2: Learning Out-of-the-box Spatiotemporal Visual Representations at Scale

- Decision: Reject
- Scores: 5, 8, 5, 8

## Abstract
The ultimate goal for foundation models is realizing task-agnostic, \ie supporting out-of-the-box usage without task-specific fine-tuning.
Although breakthroughs have been made in natural language processing and image representation learning, it is still challenging for video models to reach it due to the increasing uncertainty of spatiotemporal signals.
To ease training, existing works leverage image foundation models' prior knowledge and equip them with efﬁcient temporal modules.
Despite the satisfactory fine-tuning performance, we empirically find they fall short of out-of-the-box usage, given the even degraded performance in zero-shot/linear protocols compared to their baseline counterparts.
In this work, we analyze the factor that leads to degradation from the perspective of language supervision distortion.
We argue that tuning a text encoder end-to-end, as done in previous work, is suboptimal since it may overfit in terms of styles, thereby losing its original generalization ability to capture the semantics of various language registers.
The overfitted text encoder, in turn, provides a harmful supervision signal, degrading the video representation.
To tackle this issue, we propose a degradation-free pre-training strategy to retain the generalization ability of the text encoder via freezing shallow layers while enabling the task-related semantics capturing in tunable deep layers.
As for the training objective, we adopted the transcript sorting task in TVTS~\cite{TVTS} incorporated with masking techniques~\cite{FLIP} to enable scalable training.
As a result, we produce a series of models, dubbed TVTSv2, with up to one billion parameters.
We achieve new state-of-the-arts on various video benchmarks with a frozen backbone, surpassing the recent ImageBind, InternVideo, \textit{etc}.

### Rating

### Confidence
4: You are confident in your assessment, but not absolutely certain. It is unlikely, but not impossible, that you did not understand some parts of the submission or that you are unfamiliar with some pieces of related work.

### Summary
In this paper, the authors focus on building large-scale robust video models for out-of-the-box usage, which means the learned features can be used directly for novel tasks.

The authors have conducted detailed experiments and found that tuning text encoder end-to-end causes overfitting, thus losing generalization ability. To fix the issue, they propose to tune the text encoder partially.

Finally, they adopt the transcript sorting task and masking techniques to scale up pretraining. The 1B model achieves new SOTA results on out-of-the-box tasks.

### Strengths
- The paper is well-written and organized, with clear figures and tables.
- The logic is clear and easy to follow.
- Extensive ablation studies and analysis demonstrate the authors' statements.

### Weaknesses
Overall, I appreciate the simple yet effective techniques in this paper. However, considering the differences between TVTSv2 and TVTSv1, the current paper may not be suitable for a conference but a journal as an extension:

1. Different tuning: The key difference between the two versions is how to tune the text encoder. It is an interesting finding but may not be a qualified novelty for a new conference paper. And the poor performances caused by the weak initialization (Appendix D)?
2. Same objectives/architecture/masking: The transcript sorting task and masking techniques have also been used in TVTSv1, though the masking strategies are different. And the architectures are the same (as Frozen[1]), where the residuals are skip-connected.

Considering the minor difference, I suggest the authors submit the paper as an extensive journal paper, but not a novel conference paper.

### Questions
1. For DiDeMo, the code shows that it was tested on test split. Should it be tested on validation split?
2. In Table 2, why the single-stream models are de-emphasized? 
3. In Table 2, should the authors list the size of the pretraining data for a clear comparison? It seems that the results for UMT are on a small 5M data, but others are on larger data.
4. In Table 2, why the authors do not consider ViT-L and directly scale it to ViT-H?
5. In Table 3, do those models good at retrieval also perform well, like OmniVL, CLIP-ViP, and UMT?

### Summary
The paper presents TVTSV2, an ambitious attempt to create a task-agnostic foundation model for spatiotemporal visual representations. The authors extend the dual-stream framework of CLIP and introduce a degradation-free pre-training strategy to maintain performance. While the work shows promising results in text-to-video retrieval tasks, it could benefit from a deeper evaluation of generalizability across various downstream applications. Furthermore, the paper's focus on scalability is commendable but lacks an in-depth computational and memory usage analysis, which is vital for high-dimensional video data. Robustness against noisy or incomplete data remains unexplored, posing questions on the model's applicability in real-world scenarios. Overall, the paper makes a notable contribution but requires further scrutiny in these areas to substantiate its claims fully.

### Strengths
- Task-Agnostic Focus: The paper aims to create a foundation model that is task-agnostic, addressing a significant need for models that can generalize across various applications without requiring fine-tuning.
- Novel Pre-training Strategy: The introduction of a degradation-free pre-training method is a notable innovation. It suggests a way to train complex models without losing performance, which is particularly challenging in the realm of video data.
- Extension of Existing Architectures: The paper builds upon well-established models like CLIP but adapts them for spatiotemporal data. This approach leverages existing successes in the field while pushing into new domains.
- Initial Empirical Success: The paper demonstrates promising results in text-to-video retrieval tasks, indicating that the model is not just theoretically sound but also empirically effective.
- Scalability: The paper addresses the important issue of scalability, which is crucial for the practical application of machine learning models, especially for high-dimensional data like video.
- Comprehensive Evaluation: The paper seems to include a variety of evaluation metrics and comparisons with state-of-the-art models, adding credibility to its claims.

The idea seems to follow the surgical fine-tuning [1]  idea by freezing shallow layers during the fine-tuning.

### Weaknesses
The paper primarily focuses on text-to-video retrieval tasks for its empirical evaluation, which may not sufficiently support its claim of being a task-agnostic foundation model. To fully establish its task-agnostic capabilities, the model should be rigorously evaluated on multiple downstream tasks such as action recognition, video summarization, and anomaly detection. Assessing performance on these additional tasks would provide a more comprehensive view of the model's adaptability and generalizability

The paper discusses scalability but falls short of providing a detailed computational and memory complexity analysis. This is crucial for practical applications involving high-dimensional video data. The authors should include empirical evaluations that quantify the model's computational time and memory usage during both training and inference.

### Questions
Could you elaborate on the choice of tasks for empirical evaluation? How do you envision the model's performance on other types of spatiotemporal tasks like action recognition or anomaly detection?

How does the model perform under conditions of noisy or incomplete data? Have you considered evaluations that specifically test the model's robustness?

While the paper discusses scalability, it lacks specific metrics on computational and memory requirements. Could you provide more detailed analyses on these aspects?

### Summary
This paper, TVTSv2, is the second version of TVTS paper. It focuses on the foundation model of video representation learning. Specifically, this paper first points out the so called degradation issue existing in video representation field. Based on this degradation observation, this paper proposes a hypothesis that such degradation is from the noisy text data. Accordingly, it freezes the shallow layers of text encoder while training the deeper layers to alleviate this issue. In this way, the zero-shot performance is significantly improved to show the great generalization ability of the proposed training strategy. Very comprehensive experiments empirically validate the model effectiveness.

### Strengths
1. Video representation learning is a very challenging task, especially for large-scale scenario. I recognize such an exploration in this field.
2. The stated degradation issue is interesting observation. Proposing solution based on it is well-motivated.
3. The large-scale experiments are definitely an advantage of this work. They cover several evaluation scenarios.

### Weaknesses
I mainly concern about the technical contribution. As mentioned in the draft, the proposed degradation-free training strategy freezes the shallow layers while tuning the deeper layer of text encoder. This training strategy is more like an engineering trick by tuning parts of the large-scale model, which can be commonly used for practical large-scale training. Specifically, the method lacks novelty in its approach to fine-tuning the text encoder. Freezing shallow layers and tuning deeper layers is a common practice in transfer learning and doesn't represent a significant technical advancement on its own. The paper needs to demonstrate a more profound contribution beyond this relatively straightforward adaptation of existing techniques. The core idea of addressing degradation by freezing layers is not inherently novel and requires more justification to be considered a substantial contribution.

### Questions
Please refer to above sections for details. As mentioned in the weakness part, I mainly concern the technical contribution. On the other hand, I recognize the other parts of contribution of this paper. I would like to encourage the author to further emphasize the technical contribution of this paper for discussion. In addition, I am also willing to check other reviewers' comments for my final decision.

### Summary
The paper proposes a video foundation model called TVTSv2 for learning out-of-the-box spatiotemporal visual representations.
It aims to solve the issue of performance degradation compared to image foundation models when adapting them to video.
The degradation is attributed to distortion in language supervision from end-to-end tuning of the text encoder on noisy ASR transcripts.
A partially frozen text encoder is proposed, freezing shallow layers while tuning deep layers, to retain generalization and learn new semantics. The authors state that SOTA results were achieved on zero-shot action recognition and text-to-video retrieval: TVTSv2 surpasses recent methods like CLIP-ViP, ImageBind, and InternVideo on several metrics. Ablations showed partially frozen text training avoids degradation and enables knowledge transfer. Masking was shown to improve efficiency for large models without sacrificing too much performance. Fine-tuning performance was also competitive, suggesting the approach does not hurt downstream training.

### Strengths
The strengths of the paper include:
- Produces strong out-of-the-box spatiotemporal representations for zero-shot usage and surpasses recent state-of-the-art methods substantially in zero-shot action recognition, including models trained on more data.
- Achieves new state-of-the-art results on multiple video understanding benchmarks.
- Provides an effective strategy for pre-training on large, noisy video transcript datasets as it retains performance on downstream fine-tuning, unlike some other self-supervised methods.
- The approach facilitates scaling up to large models by incorporating masking techniques. It avoids catastrophic forgetting of language knowledge via partially frozen training
In conclusion, the paper strongly suggests potential for pre-trained models to support out-of-the-box video applications.
The claims seem reasonably well supported by the results, as the proposed TVTSv2 models clearly surpass prior state-of-the-art in zero-shot action recognition and retrieval across multiple datasets. The ablation studies also provide evidence for the benefits of the partial freezing strategy and incorporation of masking techniques.

### Weaknesses
Limitations:
The paper is a bit disorganized. THe architecture is followed by the empirical study followed by further description of the model (trainig objectives etc.). It would read better if the approach description was in one place. If the empirical degradation study calls for rmodification of the training objective, that should be spelled out more explicitly.
The attention masks in hte figures are used as an argument for good performance. However, it is not clear what woud be the ground truth atteniton mask. COuld it be that in the video clips the objeects/actions of interest were the only moving parts in the scene causing the attention grab?
The joint attention module is not described clearly. Is it the same as in CLIP?
Fine-tuning performance was not extensively benchmarked on more diverse downstream tasks, so the claims about out-of-the-box task-agnostic approach could be substantiated better.
The largest model studied is still limited compared to huge image models, so scalability past 1 billion parameters is unvalidated.
Potential societal impacts of large foundation models were not addressed.

### Questions
Was any experimentation done with different freeze ratios or objectives for the text encoder?
How much performance gain was directly attributable to the partially frozen text training versus other modifications?
The narrative around the attentional maps could be stronger.
What can the authors say about model biases? Are actions of all sexes/races recognized at comparable accuracy?
More extensive evaluation of fine-tuning performance on diverse downstream tasks would be desirable for supporting the "out-of-the-box" claim.
