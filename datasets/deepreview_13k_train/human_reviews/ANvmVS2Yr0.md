## Abstract
vspace*{-1ex}
Deep neural networks (DNNs) trained for image denoising are able to generate high-quality samples with score-based reverse diffusion algorithms.
These impressive capabilities seem to imply an escape from the curse of dimensionality, but
recent reports of memorization of the training set raise the question of whether these networks are learning the ``true'' continuous density of the data.
Here, we show that two DNNs trained on non-overlapping subsets of a dataset learn nearly the same score function, and thus the same density, when the number of training images is large enough.  In this regime of strong generalization, diffusion-generated images are distinct from the training set, and are of high visual quality, suggesting that the inductive biases of the DNNs are well-aligned with the data density.
We analyze the learned denoising functions and show that the inductive biases give rise to a shrinkage operation in a basis adapted to the underlying image. Examination of these bases reveals oscillating harmonic structures along contours and in homogeneous regions. We demonstrate that trained denoisers are inductively biased towards these geometry-adaptive harmonic bases since they arise not only when the network is trained on photographic images, but also when it is trained on image classes supported on low-dimensional manifolds for which the harmonic basis is suboptimal. Finally, we show that when trained on regular image classes for which the optimal basis is known to be geometry-adaptive and harmonic, the denoising performance of the networks is near-optimal

### Summary
The authors study the issue of generalization and memorization in diffusion
models. Diffusion models have as a backbone trained denoisers, and it has been
observed that the use of powerful deep networks as denoisers can lead to
situations where diffusion models memorize their training data (rather than
being able to generate novel images from the high-dimensional data
distribution), whereas in other cases the models seem to generalize. The authors
study this for a specific class of deep network denoisers (bias-free CNNs) both
empirically and theoretically. Empirically, they show that training these
denoisers on CelebA and LSUN bedrooms for varying training set sizes witnesses a
clear transition (qualitative and quantitative) between "memorization"
performance of the trained diffusion model when the training set size is small,
and "generalization" performance when it is sufficiently large. The authors
hypothesize that the ability to generalize with relatively few samples from the
high-dimensional distribution is due to inductive biases in the deep network
denoiser, and in particular they make a connection with classical ideas on
denoising from harmonic analysis to posit that DNN denoisers are biased towards
"geometry-adaptive harmonic bases" (eg bandlets/wedgelets).  They test this
hypothesis empirically, demonstrating that these trained denoisers learn
bandlet-like bases in which to perform shrinkage on toy image classes where such
bases are optimal (horizon classes), and moreover that they persist in learning
these types of bases even for classes of signals where they are suboptimal
(image articulation manifolds).

### Strengths
- The paper presents detailed (but not overly technical/complex) background on
  diffusion models, to allow a broad audience to appreciate the experimental
  results. (I do wonder here if it might be helpful to present somewhere the
  functional form of the 'optimal' denoiser for the empirical risk, eg as it's
  done in Karras et al 2021, to ground the memorization issue a bit more -- I
  find this concept helpful to have in mind as I'm reading the background of the
  paper.)

- The core question the paper considers -- issues of generalization in diffusion
  models trained to generate samples from high-dimensional data distributions --
  is both important and currently without a completely satisfying
  conceptual/mathematical explanation, despite much concurrent work. The authors
  present a compelling empirical study of this issue under controlled
  conditions, showing (among other things) that it is indeed real, and give a
  plausible theoretical explanation for why it occurs.

- The theory of inductive bias that the authors put forth is nontrivial,
  involving, through equation (6), a specific representational formula for
  piecewise-linear denoisers, and thereby a connection to classical shrinkage
  estimators.

### Weaknesses
 - It seems that the theoretical framework
  posited in section 3 is specific to the particular denoiser architectures
  being studied in the paper (BF-CNN). For example, PixelNet++-type denoisers
  used in modern diffusion models do not seem to be amenable to a decomposition
  like equation (6), because they involve attention layers and positional
  embeddings (presumably with affine components) to implement different
  conditioning operations. It would be good if the authors could comment on this
  issue, and how they see the theory extending to this modern setting.

 - How robust the main empirical insights are to the
  specific training setup and model architecture being studied in the
  experiments? 
  For example, what if one used a modern noise-conditional diffusion model
  instead of training a single unconditioned model on multiple noise scales; what if one considered larger-scale training (eg on datasets of
  higher-resolution, photorealistic images, as one considers for modern
  diffusion models); what if one performed generation with an ODE/SDE-type
  sampling procedure, rather than Algorithm 1 used in the paper? It would be
  helpful to know how the authors see Figures 1 and 2 translating into these
  settings, whether they would expect changes, etc.

- Could you clarify behind the thinking behind the claim in the discussion that
  "deep networks are more adapted towards high-dimensional structures [than
  low-dimensional structures]"? Although I think I follow at a high-level --- eg
  in Figure 5, the adaptive basis at the noisy image is not exactly equal to the
  optimal 5-dimensional basis for the low-dimensional tangent space --- it still
  seems to me that there is a bias in what has been learned towards
  low-dimensional structure, because the correct basis for the true tangent
  space seems to be contained in the actual adaptive basis, and the eigenvalues
  of the Jacobian decay at a reasonable rate (making the spectrum overall
  "compressed", if not sparse/low-dimensional). Hence when I try to interrogate
  the claim at a lower level of detail, I cannot exactly 'compile' it.

### Summary
The authors address recent concerns regarding the memorization of denoising DNNs for generative image modeling by showing that two networks trained on disjoint datasets converge to the same score/density and hence generate similar images. Those experiments are supported by theoretical derivations clearly relating the inductive bias of the denoiser to that of the density. Leveraging recent work, e.g., (Monoho et al.,2020), the authors elucidate the sparse optimal basis, adapted to the geometry of the input image, along which denoising can be understood as a shrinkage operation. Furthermore, the authors validate and connect the results by evaluating the inductive bias on image classes with known optimal bases.

### Strengths
- Presents compelling empirical evidence, supported by plausible theoretical derivations, of the inductive bias of denoising DNNs.
- Explains with clear examples how they transition from memorization to generalization (even when trained on disjoint partitions of the datasets).
- Repeats the analysis on 2 datasets.
- Validates on image classes with known optimal bases.

### Weaknesses
Nothing stands out, just needs to finalize the text.

### Questions
**Presentation:**
- Abstract:
    - Please mention the empirical nature of those findings, while also highlighting the supporting theoretical derivations.
    - It would help to point to the newly highlighted GAHB as a particularly interesting topic for future work, as done on the very last paragraph.
- Section 2:
    - It would help to point to the figures within the main text.
    - Related to this: in many places the authors use figure captions the same way as main text, more so in the appendices. (understandable if that was wrapped up close to the deadline) I strongly recommend to add more supporting text, with pointers to parts in the main text to which each figure is most relevant. That is, to collect those pieces into a coherent narrative that's easy to follow.
- Section 3:
    - S3.1 seems to be largely based on (Mohan et al., 2020). If so, please state this clearly on the onset, or make it clear where the new contributions begin. One point where a citation seemed needed is the notion of projection below Eq.7.

### Summary
Diffusion generative models that use denoising DNNs have surpassed previous methods of learning probability models from images. The authors introduce a methodology to evaluate the properties of the trained denoiser and the density from which the data are drawn. They show empirically that diffusion models can converge to a unique continuous density model that is independent of the specific training samples. The convergence exhibits a phase transition between memorization and generalization as training data grows. They demonstrate that two denoising DNNs trained on non-overlapping subsets of a dataset learn nearly the same score function and, thus, the same density, indicating the existence of powerful inductive biases in the DNN architecture and/or training algorithm. The inductive bias of the network appears through the best basis, which is a geometry-adaptive harmonic basis (GAHB) when trained on photographic images. The DNN denoisers achieve near-optimal performance for the Cα class of images. They also investigate the inductive biases that enable this rapid convergence and show that DNN denoisers perform poorly for distributions whose optimal bases are not GAHB. For images drawn from low-dimensional manifolds, DNN denoisers achieve an accurate basis for the subspace and incorporate GAHB vectors in the remaining unconstrained dimensions. The denoiser performs a shrinkage operation on a basis adapted to the underlying image, which reveals oscillating harmonic structures along contours and inhomogeneous image regions. The paper leaves important open questions regarding the formal mathematical definition of this larger class of GAHB bases and how they result from the DNN computational architecture.

### Strengths
This is a well-written paper that puts forth a compelling hypothesis.  The hypothesis is presented in a clear and concise manner, and the paper's overall readability is very good. The authors suggest that, instead of attempting to learn a low dimensional structure, DNN denoisers learn a well-regularized geometry-adaptive harmonic basis (GAHB) with small coefficients. Hence, the denoising algorithm performs a shrinkage operation on an image-adapted basis, explaining some of the impressive results that have been observed recently in the literature. 

The authors provide a counter-example to argue that if the hypothesis were not true, the DNN denoisers should perform poorly for those images for which GAHB is not the optimal basis. They construct such an example dataset using images drawn from low-dimensional structures and show that the trained DNN denoiser is not perfectly aligned with the manifold, and the bias increases with increasing noise.  Similar results were reported by creating another dataset using shuffled versions of the CelebA dataset, which would also not have GAHB as the optimal basis.

### Weaknesses
The paper's results were obtained using a straightforward CNN architecture. However, prior studies have indicated that CNN architectures can effectively learn and utilize harmonic bases (https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.12136). In my opinion, the paper's only weakness lies in not acknowledging this perspective that has been previously established in the literature.

Specifically, while the paper highlights the emergence of a geometry-adaptive harmonic basis (GAHB) in the denoising process, it does not sufficiently discuss the connection between the learned filters in the CNN and the GAHB. The paper could benefit from a more detailed analysis of how the convolutional filters, which are inherently local operators, collectively approximate the global GAHB. Furthermore, the paper does not address whether the observed GAHB is a direct consequence of the CNN architecture or if it is a property of the training procedure. It would be valuable to explore if other network architectures, such as transformers, would also exhibit similar GAHB behavior or if this is specific to CNNs.

### Summary
The paper studies the inductive bias of the models which involve a denoising step, i.e., score-based diffusion algorithms. To do so, the authors take a spectral approach and analyze the eigenspace and eigenvalues of the corresponding DNN denoiser Jacobian. The authors conjecture that the DNN denoiser are implicitly biased toward so called geometry-adaptive harmonic bases (GAHBs). The authors first show that such biases emerge on a set of synthetic $C^{\alpha}$ images. Further strengthening a point,  the authors empirically show that the bias still emergences similarly even in suboptimal scenario (disk images and shuffled CelebA).

### Strengths
- the paper is easy to follow and elaborate
- a good set experiments which validate the main points of paper fairly, e.g., optimal PSNR for $C^\alpha$ images and slow eigenvalues decay on CelebA
- clean mathematical framework that is used as a foundation for the empirical part 
- indication of the fact that DNNs are adapted to the high-dim structures (with certain regularity) that allows to infer them from small portions of data

### Weaknesses
 - further validation on a more realistic data might be beneficial to strengthen the main points of the paper
- lack of any sort of description of more "general DNN GAHBs"
