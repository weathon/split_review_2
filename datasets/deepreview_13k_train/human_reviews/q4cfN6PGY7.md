# Towards Deep Viticultural Representations: Joint Region and Grape Variety Embeddings

- Decision: Reject
- Scores: 3, 3, 3, 3

## Abstract
The creation of embeddings, representations, or features for abstract or non-numeric variables is a prerequisite to utilize these variables in machine learning models; this is also the case for viticulture (growing grapes for wine). Viticultural regions and grape varieties are variables for which deep representations are currently not available. Regions are somewhat definable by their approximate longitude and latitude, average elevation, or averages of climate variables. Each of these ’raw’ features contributes valuable information about the region but it does not easily define a metric for agro-ecological proximity between regions. Grape varieties have much fewer ’raw’ features; one example may be their genetic markers, which, however, are still categorical in nature. Analysis of lineage is possible but does not necessarily provide useful features to the viticulturists as grape attributes are not necessarily inferable by their lineage such as dominant wine style or suitability for a particular region. Therefore, here we present a self-supervised approach to learning joint regional and varietal embeddings using joint variational autoencoder (VAE) networks. This is based on the assumption that regions that grow similar proportions of similar grape varieties are more similar to each other than those that do not, or that grape varieties that often occur together may have similar viticultural characteristics (e.g. climate requirements, aromas, disease resistance). We thereby overcome the lack of detailed data and create deep embeddings for 1557 grape varieties (e.g. Merlot, Riesling, Chardonnay etc.) and 595 viticulturally important regions (e.g. Piemonte, Bourgogne, Mosel etc.). We examine the embeddings, their usability for downstream tasks as well as whether the joint autoencoder network may be used as a varietal suitability ranking system. We show our embeddings to outperform ’raw’ features on downstream tasks and results indicating potential of the autoencoder networks as data-based recommender systems. This is also, to our knowledge, the first work to apply joint VAEs to purely categorical data.

### Confidence
4: You are confident in your assessment, but not absolutely certain. It is unlikely, but not impossible, that you did not understand some parts of the submission or that you are unfamiliar with some pieces of related work.

### Summary
The paper proposes to jointly learn continuous representations for viticultural regions and grape varieties, which can potentially be leveraged in downstream tasks for enhanced performance. Specifically, the paper first constructs a grape variety and region co-occurrence dataset, and then uses a variational auto-encoder (VAE) model to learn the low-dimensional representations. The model is trained using the VAE loss and a joining loss.

### Strengths
1. The idea of learning low-dimensional representations for viticultural regions and grape varieties to improve the performance of downstream tasks seems novel and interesting. 
2. The paper also conducted experiments to investigate the property of the latent representation space.

### Weaknesses
1. The writing of the paper could be improved as it is sometimes difficult to follow the paper. 
2. The paper is incremental since it simply applies VAE to learn the latent representations of grape varieties and viticultural regions. 
3. I think the joining loss is quite important in aligning the representations of regions and varieties. The paper introduces three different joining losses. However, the details of these losses are missing from the paper. 
4. The paper lists the weights of different losses in the paper. However, it is unclear how these weights are chosen. 
5. I find the Results & Discussion section difficult to follow. There is no explicit introduction to the datasets, baselines, experimental setups and research questions.

### Confidence
3: You are fairly confident in your assessment. It is possible that you did not understand some parts of the submission or that you are unfamiliar with some pieces of related work. Math/other details were not carefully checked.

### Summary
This paper presents a self-supervised approach to learning joint regional and varietal embeddings using joint variational autoencoder (VAE) networks, and examines the embeddings, their usability for downstream tasks as well as whether the joint autoencoder network may be used as a varietal suitability ranking system. The results demonstrate that the embeddings to outperform ’raw’ features on downstream tasks and results indicating potential of the autoencoder networks as data-based recommender systems.

### Strengths
This paper applies joint variational autoencoder (VAE) networks to the study of viticultural regions and grape variety, demonstrating that the embeddings in the paper outperform the "raw" features on downstream tasks. This paper examine whether the joint autoencoder network may be used as a varietal suitability ranking system.

### Weaknesses
1. The English of the manuscript must be improved. There are problems with context transition and logical cohesion, and there are errors in the use of proper nouns. The methods and framework employed in the paper exhibit limited originality and innovation.
2. Section 1.1 extensively discusses the current research status in the field of viticulture, which is less relevant to the research of this paper.
3. Section 1.2 introduces the development process of embedding in detail, lacking an introduction to related technologies and methods.
4. The section 1.3 on "REGION AND VARIETY EMBEDDING REQUIREMENTS" is excessively lengthy and lacks emphasis on key points. It occupies an entire page, which is excessive.
5. There are also some unclear and unreasonable statements in the article:
1) The formulas used in this paper are not numbered.
2) There are errors in the description of variable v_i.
3) The description of the variables in the formulas is unclear.
4) Confusing organization of content in the part of the paper that tests the model on downstream tasks.
6. The description of specific parameter settings in section 2.3 is excessively lengthy. It is recommended to provide these details in APPENDIX.
7. The authors should compare their methodology with existing approaches, both qualitatively and quantitatively, to demonstrate its advantages or innovations in the field.
8. The contribution, the authors claim, to overcome the lack of detailed data. But, quantitative comparison of the above argument is hard to find in the discussion about the effectiveness in the experiments. The authors are strongly suggested to show the strength of the article in overcoming the lack of detailed data. In addition, time complexity or computation overhead analyses need be discussed properly.

### Confidence
5: You are absolutely certain about your assessment. You are very familiar with the related work and checked the math/other details carefully.

### Summary
The paper conducts a study on producing representations for viticulture (the cultivation of grapevines). It uses a VAE approach with self-supervision. Specifically, it focuses on the creation of deep embeddings for viticultural regions and grape varieties. It created tons of features for grapes.

### Strengths
- Interesting application to viticulture

### Weaknesses
 - Novelty is limited on the methodological side since it aims to apply an existing method to tackle an application problem.
- No alternative baseline is used; it focuses on feature ablations of the proposed method

### Questions
- Can the authors formulate a machine learning challenge of this problem that is specialized for viticulture?
- Can the authors compare with other models? 
- Can the authors describe novel insights about viticulture that can be gained?

### Summary
In the paper "Towards deep viticultural representations: joint region and grape variety embeddings", the authors develop a VAE-based approach for learning representations of wine varieties and wine-growing regions. They use data on ~600 wine-growing regions with information on which of the ~1500 wine varieties they grow. The authors train two coupled multinomial VAEs, one encoding wine variety and another encoding wine-growing region. Then the authors argue that the resulting latent representations are meaningful and outperform existing alternatives in terms of representation quality.

### Strengths
I am a big fan of both, representation learning and wine, so I was very excited to read this paper. I am not familiar with prior literature on wine representation learning, but the authors say it is scarce, i.e. this paper is exploring a novel application area.

### Weaknesses
That said, I found the paper disappointing and not really publication ready. In particular, it seems to me to fall far below the threshold of importance, novelty, and rigour expected by ICLR. The main issues are: (1) lack of clarity in writing and presentation; (2) unclear motivation for a coupled region-variety representation; (3) insufficient and unconvincing evaluation; (4) insufficient benchmark comparisons, in particular using simpler non-deep-learning baseline models.

I found the presentation very confusing. After reading the first THREE PAGES ("Introduction"), I still did not know what the authors want to achieve. I would recommend to have a clear 1-page introduction that explains what the paper wants to do (what exactly is the input data, what is the output, what are the performance metrics). The rest can go into the "Related work".

The whole sampling approach and sampling-based evaluation are not very clear either... Does each variety (and each region) in the end get one embedding vector? Or does it get a whole distribution? Can this distribution be multimodal? All figures that I see in the Appendix contain multiple points per variety/region, but all very unimodal. Is this expected/desired?

Many technical details are unclear as well. E.g. what K is used for K-means clustering, and why? What are the A/B/C classes used for classification? Etc.

The premise of the paper is that they use *coupled* VAEs for joint representations of varieties and regions. This was not motivated clearly enough. Imagine there is one wine region that grows two very different varieties. What is the perfect joint representation of this data? The "coupling" only ensures that the entire latent spaces overlap, if I understand it correctly. What would make them overlap meaningfully? I don't understand the setup or the goals here.

Regarding evaluation. Tables 1 and 2 assess how clustered the representations are but tell us nothing about how meaningful they are. Table 3 shows that VAEs outperform an extremely simple model based only on 2 features (latitude + longitude). And they don't outperform it very strongly. Table 4 only uses dummy baseline, Table 5 shows that all wine/region parirings are not statistically significant. So the ONLY result that actually shows that the emebddings are meaningful is Table 3; and that result is reather weak.

I understand that quantitative evalutions may be difficult. But qualitative evaluations are lacking altogether. I would expect to see some visualisations of the latent space, but they are only shown in the Appendix and only using PCA. Moreover, they seem to make no sense! For example, in Fiture 1 in the Appendix, Alvarinho (white grape) is located close to Tempranillo (red grape), and similarly Riesling (white) is located close to Pinot Noir (red). How is this meaningful? Maybe PCA is misleading here, so why not use something like t-SNE? I feel like qualitative evaluation has not even started here.

Lack of proper baselines is a big problem. In Table 3, the comparison is to lon/lat model with 2 features. Why not using something that actually uses the A_ij matrix, but without deep learning? Some simple regression/classification models or maybe SVD/NNMF models applied to A_ij matrix? Same for Table 4. The authors use a relatively complex setup (coupled VAEs) for a relatively simple dataset (co-occurence matrix A_ij), so I would expect them to choose some reasonable baselines.
