# Competition Priors for Object-Centric Learning

- Decision: Reject
- Scores: 6, 1, 5, 3

## Abstract
Humans excel at abstracting data and constructing \emph{reusable} concepts, a capability lacking in current continual learning systems. 
The field of object-centric learning addresses this by developing abstract representations, or slots, from data without human supervision.
Different methods have been proposed to tackle this task for images, whereas most are overly complex, non-differentiable, or poorly scalable.
In this paper, we introduce a conceptually simple, fully-differentiable, non-iterative, and scalable method called \textbf{SAMP} (\textbf{S}implified Slot \textbf{A}ttention with \textbf{M}ax Pool \textbf{P}riors). 
It is implementable using only
Convolution and MaxPool layers and an Attention layer.
Our method encodes the input image with a Convolutional Neural Network and then uses a branch of alternating Convolution and MaxPool layers to 
create specialized sub-networks and 
extract primitive slots. 
These primitive slots are then used as queries for a Simplified Slot Attention over the encoded image.
Despite its simplicity, our method is competitive or outperforms previous methods on standard benchmarks.

### Summary
COP is proposed as a novel method for learning object-centric representations. COP is a simple baseline for abstraction models, using vanilla building blocks like CNN, MaxPool layers, and a modified Cross-Attention. COP is evaluated on standard Object-Centric benchmarks and shows competitive or superior performance compared to other slot attention methods.

### Strengths
1. Performance: Our COP model surpasses the commonly adopted Slot Attention method on the Multi-dSprites and Tetrominoes datasets, setting a new benchmark in performance as measured across all three datasets.
2. Efficiency: COP demonstrates improved efficiency, boasting superior time and space complexity metrics.
3. Simplicity: The COP framework operates non-iteratively, streamlining the processing pipeline.

### Weaknesses
1. Scope of Dataset Evaluation: The empirical validation of the COP model is confined to synthetic datasets. While the authors posit that COP's attributes render it highly scalable for larger datasets, the absence of real-world dataset assessments renders the claims of its object-centric representation less compelling. Specifically, the model's ability to handle the complexities of real-world images, such as variations in lighting, occlusion, and background clutter, remains untested. Furthermore, the reliance on datasets with clear object boundaries and limited variability may not accurately reflect the challenges associated with object-centric representation learning in more complex scenarios.
2. Contemporaneity of Baselines: The baselines utilized in the study are somewhat dated. A comparative analysis with more recent methodologies would be beneficial for a comprehensive evaluation, and such comparisons should be reflected in the results table. For instance, more recent methods that incorporate transformer-based architectures or alternative attention mechanisms should be included for a more rigorous comparison. The current baselines may not fully capture the state-of-the-art in object-centric learning.

### Summary
The paper presents COP, a method for unsupervised object-centric learning that builds on top of Slot Attention by replacing some of its components.
In particular, the queries are not initialized at random but obtained from the features by means of max pooling, and the iterative attention is replaced with a single attention layer.
The paper motivates these choices from the perspective of "competition" and evaluates the method on standard benchmarks for object-centric learning.

### Strengths
I appreciate the detailed description of the encoder and decoder architectures in the appendix, as well as the number of figures where the output of the model is visualized.

### Weaknesses
Section 3.1 is badly structured: if the encoder and the decoder are exactly the same as Slot Attention please just refer to the original paper to save space and avoid confusion. Then, use the extra space to explain better the novelty in the object-centric bottleneck (see paragraph below).

The mechanism of Soft-Winner-Takes-All (SWTA) is not explained clearly and the comparison with Slot Attention is misleading. Slot attention takes the softmax over the queries first and then normalizes over the keys by dividing each row by its sum. As I interpret the paper, SWTA seem to perform the first operation, i.e. the softmax over the queries, but skips the normalization. Therefore, what is the novelty? Skipping the normalization? Running a single iteration instead of multiple ones? In both Slot Attention and SWTA there is competition for the patches between queries: if a patch is assigned to one query/slot it can not be assigned to others.

I strongly disagree with the analysis performed in section 3.2 about the "competition through MaxPool layers". In particular, the discussion about "sub-networks" in the following sentences: "This results in sub-networks competing to have higher activations. During back-propagation, units that win and the subnetworks that are responsible for this will get updated. As a result, a winning sub-network is reinforced to win more if it predicts correctly." I'd like to point out the CNN layers before MaxPool share the same weights across locations therefore there are no sub-networks in competition, only one network. I would like the authors to provide references to the "sub-networks" interpretation to support their claim in the paper.

In the same paragraph, it is said that "A neuron has a higher chance of winning if it explains a different part of the input, rather than explaining the same feature as another neuron." I argue that the final "primitive slots" are diverse simply because they are pooled from different regions of the input image by means of local CNN filters and local max pooling as shown in Figure 2. This is a well-known property of CNNs and it also introduces an implicit bias on the shape and size of the objects which the authors do not discuss.

Other than the query generation process the discussion about competition in section 3.1 does not add much to the original Slot Attention paper: SWTA seems to be a slight variation of their competitive attention implementation and the decoder is identical. If other papers already discussed the importance of competition in those two mechanisms, why repeating the same arguments here?

The number of slots is hardcoded and manually tuned for each dataset. This is a limitation of this method that doesn't make it stand out compared to previous ones. If anything, creating the "primitive slots" by means of max pooling is even more limiting than the sampling mechanism of Slot Attention.

Experiment design:
- The experiments only include very basic datasets where even basic color-based clustering methods would suffice. Since a few years, the object-centric community has moved on to more challenging datasets such as ClevrTex and MultiShapeNet, where the proposed method would be more interesting to evaluate.
- Also, I disagree with the choice of evaluating only the FG-ARI metric, while segmentation is a good proxy for object-centric learning, it does not capture the full complexity of the task. Other works try to evaluate the quality of the slots by means of downstream tasks such as object tracking or property prediction.
- Finally, the ablation study is not very informative. The authors should have compared with vanilla Slot Attention where 1) the query generation step is replaced with their max-pooling-based method, and 2) the iterative attention is replaced with a single attention layer, while keeping the rest unaltered. This would have provided a fair comparison and a better understanding of the contribution.

The abstract claims "scalability" as a feature of the proposed method, which I can not agree with. See the related question below.

Public code: the code in the attached zip archive is broken. For example, `train.py` tries to call a non-existing function `read_cli_args_and_get_config`. This way, it's not even possible to check that the code reflects the method described in the paper because there are multiple implementations in the zip archive. I appreciate the effort of including the code in the submission, but it should be double-checked beforehand and possibly come with some instructions.

Overall manuscript quality: many sentences are poorly written and the text would require a thorough revision. A few examples:
- "Similar to the encoder, we build the CNN layers in such a way that they preserve the spatial dimension. But, the MaxPool layers reduce it."
- "Primitive slots" are capitalized in the figure captions but never in the text. Sometimes there is a dash between the two words, sometimes not. Also it's unclear whether "primitive slots" are a new concept and how they differ from the usual term "queries", the first mention in section 3.1 could be more explicit.

### Questions
What is the exact formulation of SWTA? A mathematical definition, an algorithm listing, or a code snippet would be helpful. Even better, a side-by-side comparison with Slot Attention would be great.

What is the difference between the ablation study number 1 and a simple autoencoder with a resolution bottleneck?

The abstract and the intro claim that COP is a "simple, scalable, non-iterative and fully-differentiable approach". While I agree on most adjectives, I can't agree on scalability and I don't think the arguments at the end of Section 3.3 are valid. While it's true that the proposed method performs grouping in a single step, scaling to larger and more complex images will require adjusting the number of slots and therefore the computation in the stack of CNN+MaxPool layers.

### Summary
This paper introduces a method called Competition Over Pixels (COP) that uses convolutional, max-pool, and cross-attention layers to learn object-centric representations. The convolutional and max-pool layers first learn a set of primitive slots, which are then used as queries in a single iteration of cross-attention where the softmax is done over the queries. COP is evaluated on several standard object-centric learning benchmarks, matching or outperforming several baselines in terms of FG-ARI.

### Strengths
The paper is generally well written and easy to understand. Using max-pooling as a mechanism to learn object-centric representations has not been done before, as far as I know. Their method also does not require multiple iterations of cross attention, which may speed up the training and inference time of this method compared to iterative refinement methods. I am encouraged by the result that COP w/o Attention can still perform well on the Tetronminoes dataset, although I would have liked to see more experiments in this direction.

### Weaknesses
1. The baselines used in the experiments are rather weak. The authors mention Implicit Slot Attention [1] in section 3.3 when discussing scalability, but do not compare against it in the experiments. Furthermore, the baselines lack diversity in terms of architectural choices, focusing primarily on variations of Slot Attention. A comparison against methods that employ different mechanisms for object discovery, such as those based on attention with transformers or iterative clustering, would provide a more comprehensive evaluation.
2. Along the same lines, it would be informative to compare with other methods that focus on slot initialization such as a version of Slot Attention using learned slot initializations or BO-QSA [2]. The current experiments do not sufficiently isolate the impact of the proposed max-pooling based slot initialization, making it difficult to assess its true contribution. It's unclear if the performance gains are due to the novel initialization or simply the overall architecture.
3. Section 3.3 uses Implicit Slot Attention [1] as an example of a model using up to 11 iterations, but this is misleading since the experiment on number of iterations from that paper was to show that Implicit Slot Attention is robust to increasing number of iterations when compared with Vanilla Slot Attention. While it can scale to more iterations, their method does not require more iterations to perform well. This point is not a direct criticism of the method, but rather a misrepresentation of the cited work.
4. Since vanilla Slot Attention already does quite well on the datasets used in the paper, it would be interesting to see how COP performs on a more complex dataset such as CLEVRTex. The current datasets might not be challenging enough to reveal the limitations or advantages of the proposed method compared to existing approaches. A more complex dataset would provide a better understanding of the method's scalability and generalizability.
5. It is not clear to me from the experiments the importance of max-pooling or if some other method to learn primitive slots from the input would also work well. This is a central part of the algorithm and it would strengthen the evidence for using max-pooling if this is compared with other ways of pooling such as average-pooling or strided convolutions. The lack of ablation studies on the slot initialization method makes it difficult to ascertain the contribution of max-pooling.
6. (minor) The original Slot Attention does not set the temperature to $\sqrt{n}$, but instead it uses the sqrt of the slot dimension.

### Questions
1. Do the results improve if we run multiple iterations of SWTA-Attention or Slot Attention after obtaining the primitive slots?
2. The result that COP w/o any cross attention on Tetrominoes is very interesting. Have you run this setting for any of the other datasets? Is there any noticeable difference in the segmentation masks for this setting?
3. Have you noticed significant wall-clock time difference between COP and Slot Attention?
4. What is L_comp in Table 1?
5. For the "COP w/ Attn as in Slot Attention" ablation, is the main difference the addition of the weight normalization after the softmax?

### Summary
This paper proposes COP, an object-centric learning (OCL) framework that does not involve interactive inference. COP differs from Slot Attention in that it runs Conv+Pooling layers to generate initial slots from the image feature maps. Experimental results on three simple datasets show promising results of COP.

### Strengths
- The non-iterative design leads to small memory consumption and runtime
- Results on simple datasets are good

### Weaknesses
### Novelty
- All components of COP are not new. The non-iterative attention operation is common. For example in SAVi, they also perform single iteration Slot Attention. The primitive slots come from image features, which are conceptually similar to the conditional initialization in SAVi, with the only difference that they are not from initial frame hints
- Is iterative attention a feature or a bug? To me, iterative Slot Attention enables OCL models to decompose complex data as seen in follow-up works such as STEVE [1] and LSD [2]. It is unclear to me if the non-iterative SWTA Attention can handle more complicated images (see Experiments below)

### Experiments
- The datasets used in this paper are too simple. OCL has witnessed tremendous progress in recent years, where OCL methods have proven effective on more complex datasets [3]. The simple images tested in this paper make it hard to assess the capacity of COP. A necessary experiment is to incorporate COP with better OCL models such as STEVE, and test it on complex datasets like MOVi
- The experiments in the paper mainly focus on object segmentation. While it is an important outcome of OCL, the quality of learned object slots is another important aspect. I would suggest the authors to at least perform an object property prediction experiment on CLEVR following the protocol of Slot Attention

### Questions
Apart from questions in Weaknesses, I have a few minor questions:
- Table 1 shows the theoretical runtime/memory complexities of COP and Slot Attention. I wonder what is the actual runtime comparison. For example, does COP improve the training speed by around the number of Slot Attention iterations?
- I do not really understand why the SWTA Attention is (significantly) better than the Slot Attention as shown in the ablation study. To me, Slot Attention applies Softmax over the slot dimension, which is a more natural way to induce slot competition
