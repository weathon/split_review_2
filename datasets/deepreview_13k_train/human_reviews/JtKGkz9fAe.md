# ReFusion: Improving Natural Language Understanding with Computation-Efficient Retrieval Representation Fusion

- Decision: Accept
- Scores: 8, 3, 6, 8

## Abstract
Retrieval-based augmentations (RA) incorporating knowledge from an external database into language models have greatly succeeded in various knowledge-intensive (KI) tasks.
However, integrating retrievals in non-knowledge-intensive (NKI) tasks is still challenging.
Existing works focus on concatenating retrievals with inputs to improve model performance. 
Unfortunately, the use of retrieval concatenation-based augmentations causes an increase in the input length, substantially raising the computational demands of attention mechanisms.
This paper proposes a new paradigm of RA named \textbf{ReFusion}, a computation-efficient \textbf{Re}trieval representation \textbf{Fusion} with bi-level optimization. 
Unlike previous works, ReFusion directly fuses the retrieval representations into the hidden states of models.
Specifically, ReFusion leverages an adaptive retrieval integrator to seek the optimal combination of the proposed ranking schemes across different model layers.
Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed ReFusion can achieve superior and robust performance in various NKI tasks.

### Summary
With an aim to inject external knowledge into language models (LMs) for performing non-knowledge-intensive (NKI) tasks, including sentiment analysis, opinion polarity analysis, grammatical judgment, natural language inference, etc., towards which retrieval-based augmentation has been struggling as a solution due to the incapability of LMs to handle long sequence during the process, this paper proposes "ReFusion" a computation-efficient retrieval representation fusion framework as a solution to handle the same. Towards this, at first, top-k similar sentences are retrieved using an online retrieval module; thereafter, based on the neural architecture search (NAS) optimal ranking scheme, several modules are replaced with either fusion module with the reranker-based scheme, the fusion module with the ordered-mask-based scheme, or the original module. Authors have conducted comprehensive experiments across 15 NKI tasks comprising 8 single-sentence tasks and 7 sentence-pair tasks. Experimentations are performed using the RoBERTa LMs where ReFusion achieves state-of-the-art performance on 5 tasks over 8 single-sentence tasks and also achieves state-of-the-art performance on 5 tasks over 7 sentence-pair tasks. The study of the averaged performance reflects ReFusion is unbeatable in any of the cases over all 15 NKI tasks. Authors have also performed an ablation study to understand the importance of the sub-components, and the results reported validate that combining different ranking schemes on different tasks is necessary. Moreover, ranking schemes are not always suitable for every layer in LMs. Therefore, ReFusion disables the fusion module at some layers, thus integrating all effective candidate fusion modules.

### Strengths
1. The authors claim to be the first to propose fusing the representations of retrievals directly into models to solve the performance and efficiency bottleneck of prompt-based techniques.
2. Ranking-based weighted representations are fused to LMs to enhance their performance over NKI tasks, which helps to overcome the issue of LMs' inability to handle long sequences during the retrieval-based augmentation processes.

### Weaknesses
1. The fusion of representation directly to LMs' layers is based on top-k sentence retrieval based on similarity. However, the authors need to study the impact of some more metrics while retrieving top-k similar sentences.
2. This approach is suitable for situations where adaptability is more important than time constraints.

### Questions
1. Have authors explored the work in ''Unlimiformer: Long-Range Transformers with Unlimited Length Input (Bertsch et al., 2023)'' where authors claimed that their LM can handle unlimited input sequences?
2. Authors should consider extending this study to other LMs except Roberta.

### Summary
The paper discusses an approach to enhance prompt-based fine-tuning techniques for language models by integrating retrieval-augmented methods. The main contribution is the introduction of the ReFusion framework, which fuses representations of retrieved similar texts directly into the model to address performance and efficiency bottlenecks in existing techniques.

### Strengths
1. ReFusion introduces a novel approach to combining retrieval information with model representations, which is a step forward in prompt-based learning.
2. The experimental results indicate that ReFusion achieves superior performance over other models, suggesting a better understanding capability of the language models.
3. Evaluation comprehensivenss: The paper conducts a series of experiments on 15 different natural language understanding (NKI) tasks, which is a broad evaluation of the ReFusion method.

### Weaknesses
1. Scope of Experiments: The research confines its experimentation to masked language models, leaving the effectiveness of the proposed ReFusion method on populr autoregressive language models unexplored. Clarification on its adaptability to such models would be beneficial for broader application.

2. Performance on Knowledge-Intensive Tasks: While the paper presents improved results for non-knowledge-intensive tasks using ReFusion, it remains unclear how this method stacks up against others in knowledge-intensive scenarios. Given that retrieval-augmented language models are often specifically leveraged for their prowess in knowledge-intensive tasks, a direct comparison in this primary use case would be valuable.

3. Compatibility with Current Language Models: Modern language models, such as GPT-4 and LongChat, are designed to handle extended sequences, which facilitates the use of context augmentation methods. However, the representation fusion approach proposed by ReFusion necessitates fine-tuning of language models. This requirement may not be compatible with the current trend of employing language models as 'black-box' functions, where fine-tuning is either not possible or practical due to access or resource constraints.

### Questions
1. The caption for Figure 2 is not clear. 
2. The discussion on related works in the paper does not appear to be exhaustive. For example, Important references, such as the context-augmentation method and retrieval representation fusion, are absent.

### Summary
Retrieval-augmented models have gained much attention for knowledge-intensive tasks, yet the core drawback is the increased computation brought by the augmented context. The paper proposes retrieval-augmented natural language understanding model that is computation-efficient. Specifically, the authors introduces three modules: 1) retrieval,  2) reranker, and 3) architecture search module. The retrieval module retrieves relevant sentences, then reranker reweighs retrieved representation, and finally, search module finds suitable fusion module for each layer. At inference, the search module simply picks a module with the highest score and utilizes the module for inference.

### Strengths
- The authors illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed model on 15 NLU tasks. 
- The proposed model is technically sounding. Injecting retrievals via representation fusion is reasonable.
- Experimental settings are well listed out for reproducibility
- Appendix covers meaningful discussions, such as the effect of retrieval with different k

### Weaknesses
 - Some terms are confusing. The authors use the term "neural architecture search" for the search module, but rather, the search module simply performs hard gate operation among the fusion modules. 
- Notations can be improved. When the authors write "h_y_{<cls>}", this seems like the output of the final layer. However, the authors perform fusion at every layer. Therefore, I suggest the author to denote layer with superscript l. 
- The authors stress "computation-efficient" part, but it would be interesting to see the actual throughput and speed compared to other baselines methods as the proposed method brings in multiple modules.
- The authors should add information on the number of parameters. It is not clear whether the empirical gains are obtained by simply adding more learnable parameters compared to that of LM-BFF.

### Questions
Q1. I don't get how section 3.2.1 works. The authors states that "reranker is a 1D learnable vectors of k dimensions". If so, each rank (decided by retriever) is assigned with a learned scalar. This means that the learned 1D vector is shared among all the retrievals. Could you clarify on this point?

### Summary
This paper develops a new method, ReFusion, for combining retrieved contextual representations with example representations to improve models of non-knowledge intensive tasks like sentiment and NLI. The approach adds a weighted average of retrieved passage representations into the CLS token representations. These representations can be ranked by a learned weighting scheme or a learned mask over dimensions. For ReFusion, this choice is made by a search module. Overall, ReFusion does well in evaluations, and the paper includes valuable ablation studies that help us understand which pieces contribute most. Those studies suggest that the search component is especially important.

### Strengths
This is a thoughtful paper that poses a well-defined, tightly circumscribed problem and addresses it in a creative and successful way. Assuming we are working with models with small window sizes, this seems to be a good way to handle lots of context. It's also valuable to have additional evidence that retrieval (in the form of additional similar examples) helps even for tasks like the ones addressed here.

### Weaknesses
1. The argument for keeping prompts short is growing less compelling as models can handle more and more context. The other savings from the current approach seem to be small, since we still need to create representations for every contextual element.

2. In terms of clarity: overall, the paper is good, and the methods are mostly easy to follow, but I am not sure how the architecture search works. Section 3.3.1 creates on set of expectations, and section 3.3.2 does not seem to meet those expectations, or even respond to them directly. In particular, we are led to believe that the search module will decide what method to use on a per-layer basis, but then it seems to turn out to be a global choice. But I many well simply not be understanding the description and its connection to the experimental results.

### Questions
Could you provide the details on how many train examples the various methods represented in Table 1 need, either as supervised examples or as demonstrations? I think this is a significant favor in how models perform on the chosen tasks. If all of them use all the train examples, that suffices as an indication that the playing field is level. (I am not asking for an efficiency analysis or anything here.)
