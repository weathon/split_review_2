# A Fast Framework for Post-training Structured Pruning Without Retraining

- Decision: Reject
- Scores: 5, 5, 5, 5

## Abstract
Pruning has become a widely adopted technique for compressing and accelerating deep neural networks. However, most pruning approaches rely on lengthy retraining procedures to restore performance, rendering them impractical in many real-world settings where data privacy regulations or computational constraints prohibit extensive retraining. To address this limitation, we propose a novel framework for rapidly pruning pre-trained models without any retraining. Our framework focuses on structured pruning. It first groups coupled structures across layers based on their dependencies, and comprehensively measures and removes the least important channels in a group.
Then we introduce a two-phase layer reconstruction strategy utilizing a small amount of unlabeled data to recover the accuracy drop induced by pruning. The first phase imposes a sparsity penalty on less important channels to squeeze information into the remaining components before pruning.
The second phase executes pruning and calibrates the layer output discrepancy between the pruned and original models to reconstruct the output signal.
Experiments demonstrate that our framework achieves significant improvements over retraining-free methods and matches the accuracy of pruning approaches that require expensive retraining.
With access to about 0.2\% samples from the ImageNet training set, our method achieves up to 1.73x reduction in FLOPs, while maintaining 72.58\% accuracy for ResNet-50.
Notably, our framework prunes networks within a few minutes on a single GPU, which is orders of magnitude faster than retraining-based techniques.

### Summary
This paper introduces an approach for quickly pruning pre-trained models without retraining. This method focuses on structured pruning, grouping dependent structures across layers and marking less significant channels for elimination. A unique two-phase layer reconstruction strategy is applied, leveraging a minuscule amount of unlabeled data to regain any lost accuracy from pruning. The first phase emphasizes sparsity on less vital channels to retain information in the remaining components pre-pruning. The subsequent phase involves pruning and recalibrating the pruned model's layer output to mirror the original model.

### Strengths
This paper is well-written and easy to follow.
It improves group-based structured pruning techniques with holistic approach.

### Weaknesses
-	The performance is mediocre compared to the SOTA data-free algorithms, such as RED++.

-	Pruning coupled structures is proposed by DepGraph. The remaining contribution is not significant, especially considering the limited performance improvement,

-	Retraining-based techniques for performance comparison should be chosen among more recent ones, not the naïve L1-norm. 

-	The experiments are limited in the diversity of datasets and models. 

-	Claiming this study as "no retraining" seems exaggerated, especially compared to genuine data-free methods since this research employs some training data.

### Questions
-	Is it possible to precisely control FLOPs and parameters of the pruned model?

-	In Section 3.2.1, what causes Equation 2 to over-optimize the earlier layers?

-	Could you compare the accuracy between calibration and the fine-tuning approach of standard pruning under the same group-wise pruning ratio settings? It can show the effectiveness of the calibration method.

-	Does the L1-norm in Tables 1 and 2 use all the training data? In that case, the accuracy seems too low. 

-	Why VGG-19 is used instead of VGG-16?

### Summary
This paper proposed a post-training framework using structured pruning by accessing a small amount of unlabeled data.

### Strengths
1. The framework achieves fairly good results compared with baselines.
2. The paper is written clearly and easy to follow.

### Weaknesses
[1] The novelty of this paper is limited. The weight importance has been widely used in pruning, and the formulation used in this paper seems pretty similar to previous work [*] (in an unstructured form). It's not clear why the group importance works so well in this paper, especially given that the core idea of using weight magnitude for importance is not new. The paper does not sufficiently explore why structured pruning with this specific group importance metric provides a significant advantage over unstructured methods or other structured approaches.

[2] Motivation. I'm not sure about the point of using unlabeled data setting. Since the unlabeled data are still from the original dataset (which violates the data privacy regulations) and a small amount of labeled calibration input data is already a realistic setting. The paper does not clearly articulate the practical scenarios where this specific unlabeled data setting is crucial, especially when compared to using a small labeled dataset for calibration. The justification for this choice is weak, and the paper does not explore the limitations of this setting.

[3] It's unclear why the group importance and two phases layer reconstruction strategy work so well in this paper. The paper lacks a detailed analysis of the interaction between the group importance metric and the two-phase reconstruction. It's not clear if the reconstruction is simply compensating for the information loss due to pruning or if there is a more fundamental reason for its effectiveness. I suggest the author provide a more comprehensive experiment report to help us understand that.

### Questions
Could authors provide a more comprehensive experiment report to help us understand the effectiveness of group importance and the two phases layer reconstruction strategy (compared with other baselines)?

### Summary
In this paper the authors propose a method to extend unstructured pruning approaches to induce structured sparsity. The method accomplishes this by adopting a 2 phase reconstruction strategy where the first step attempts to separate filters into 2 non-overlapping sets where 1 set contains the consolidated information of the original group of filters, with a large weight normalization, and another set that contains very little residual information, with a small weight normalization. After this decomposition a relatively straightforward second step prunes the newly formed filters with low weight normalization. The authors approach is predicated on the use of a small calibration dataset to perform the weight reconstruction during the first phase and another update during the pruning phase. The results provided demonstrate that the approach yields much better results compared to other competitive methods that are unable to scale favorably to large networks on large datasets. The results show much better performance on CIFAR10/100 and Imagenet datasets, in terms of model accuracy, while maintaining a structured pattern that may yield better performance compared to unstructured methods.

### Strengths
- The proposed method represents a natural extension of previously proposed methods to induce structured sparsity while maintaining accuracy.
- Compacting information across filters by considering the action of a group of filters prior to the pruning process seems to be a favorable direction for increasing sparsity.
- Minimizing the amount of data required for the training steps also makes the method attractive and interesting since the amount of data and the number of calibration steps are shown the be small.
- The strategy for transitioning the loss functions to account for the structural connectedness between filters and encourage sparsity is clever and naturally extends the work presented in previous papers.
- The authors proposed a balanced updating strategy to distribute the gradient updates across multiple layers.
- Results for applying the methods for sparsification on ResNet and VGG models demonstrate notable improvement with respect to a number of other competing implementations.

### Weaknesses
Major:
- While the connection between the input to equation (2) is the parameter set w the definition only uses the layer weights W and the accompanying activations X. Also the the indexing over i is described in the text but requires a bit of rereading for the reader to grasp what the authors are trying to convey with the equation. Overall the readability suffers and I would appreciate a bit more attention to the connectedness of the variables. Specifically, the equation lacks clarity on how the filter groups are formed and how the reconstruction loss is computed across these groups. It's unclear if 'i' indexes individual filters or groups of filters, and how the activations 'X' are associated with the original and reconstructed filters.
- Connected to equation (2), the authors mention "naive optimizing...induces imbalanced parameter updates...earlier layers being over-optimized". I'm not sure I understand what imbalanced updates and over-optimization actually mean. Empirically the authors attempt to support this statement using Figure 6 to illustrate that earlier layers are updated more aggressively than later layers so the proposed update attempts to smooth out these updates. When earlier layers are optimized too much does this negatively impact the reconstruction loss in equation (2) because the pruned output activations are not and should not be closely correlated with the unpruned activations? The authors should clarify what the negative consequences of this imbalance are and why it necessitates a balanced update strategy. Furthermore, it would be useful to understand how the magnitude of updates in earlier layers affects the reconstruction quality in later layers.
- Similar notational issues exist in equation (4) as mentioned in equation (2). The lack of clarity in the indexing and variable definitions makes it difficult to understand the exact computation being performed. The relationship between the sparse penalty and the filter groups is not clearly defined.
- "...to mitigate the side effect of the sparse penalty..." this sentence could use more explanation to ensure the reader understands what the authors are referring to as the side effect of the penalty. What specific negative impact does the sparse penalty have on the model's performance or training process, and how does the proposed method mitigate this?
- Algorithm 1 needs to be updating to fix issues with the definition with respect to the defined inputs. Although the pretrained model is defined as an input it isn't used anywhere in the actual definition. The algorithm should explicitly show how the pretrained model's weights are used in the filter reconstruction and pruning process.
- Table 2 in section 4.2 seems to be missing some information to delineate the first set of columns denoting the top-1, RP, and RF metrics from the second set. The table's presentation could be improved with clear column headers or visual separators to distinguish between the different sets of results.
- PSP yields similar results to AdaPrune in terms of RP and RF factors in Table 2 but with much better accuracy. I think a natural question would be the effectiveness of the structural pruning compared to the application of the calibration updating steps. It's possible the increased accuracy is due to the post pruning calibration steps, do any of the other non-training methods perform any post pruning calibration steps? It would be beneficial to understand the specific contribution of the calibration step to the overall performance gain.
- In Figure 5 the results for ResNet18 on CIFAR100 seem to be particularly bad for "w/o REC" compared to the other graphs even for a small number of pruned parameters. Is there a reason for this sharp drop-off? The authors should provide an explanation for why the reconstruction step is so critical for this particular configuration and dataset. It would be useful to understand if this is due to the specific architecture, dataset, or a combination of both.

Minor:
- The writing and presentation of the formulas during the main text could use more polishing before publication.
- Stylistically the font using for equation (1) and (2) is not consistent with the font used for W and X in the main text.

### Summary
The paper proposes a method to alleviate accuracy drops observed upon (structured) pruning a (complex multi-branched) network without finetuning / retraining. The main idea is a sample efficient way to reduce perturbations of intermediate layers before pruning via jointly minimizing the reconstruction errors of intermediate outputs and increasing regularization iteratively for channels that are to be pruned.  This ensures that representational capability of the channels to be pruned are not significantly hampered by transferring them to other unpruned channels during the reconstruction process.

While not being completely sample-free, the method demonstrates superior performance to other weight reconstruction / calibration methods. Thus this work makes progress towards suggesting that complete finetuning may not be required at all in structured pruning pipelines if reconstruction based methodologies are able to recover the lost accuracies.

The idea of transferring representational capacity via increasing regularization is not entirely novel [a]. Nor is the idea of reducing the reconstruction errors of intermediate outputs [b, c, d]. However, their combination is quite interesting here.

### Strengths
S1. The problem of recovering accuracy without finetuning is important and challenging.

S2. The method seems technically sound and straightforward in principle

S3. Empirical results demonstrate the strength of this approach.

### Weaknesses
W1. In section 3.2, the authors claim that the direct application of layer-wise reconstruction to minimize the discrepancy between original and pruned model to structured pruning does not produces satisfying results. However, there are no experiments or citations to justify this claim - weakening the justification of the proposed methodology.

W2. The authors do not report the FLOPs and wall-clock time required by the post training structured pruning framework. Also, a comparision of compute with finetuning methods is missing since this is a motivation provided behind the work.

W3. The retraining based pruning baselines selected are weak. Also, information is not provided as to how are those pruned models obtained. For example, it is not clear how the L1-norm pruned model has been generated in Table 2. Moreover, [a], [b], [c] show much superior performance with respect to the L1-norm pruned baseline chosen upon retraining.

### Questions
Q1. How were the callibration samples selected for plots in Fugure 4? How sensitive are these plots do different set of callibration samples? Would the accuracy of the models change if the callibration samples change?

Q2. In Algorithm 1, how are the layer-wise pruning ratios selected? (Please note the typo in the last weight update of Algorithm 1 (third last line). Do you intend to minimize the output layer's reconstruction loss here?)

Q3. In section 3.2, the authors state that "the sparsity of different layers is inconsistent in a pruning group". Can you please elaboarate. It is unclear what you intend to say here.
