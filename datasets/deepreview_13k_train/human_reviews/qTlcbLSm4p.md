# Relay Diffusion: Unifying diffusion process across resolutions for image synthesis

- Decision: Accept
- Scores: 8, 8, 6, 6

## Abstract
Diffusion models achieved great success in image synthesis, but still face challenges in high-resolution generation. Through the lens of discrete cosine transformation, we find the main reason is that \emph{the same noise level on a higher resolution results in a higher Signal-to-Noise Ratio in the frequency domain}. In this work, we present Relay Diffusion Model (RDM), which transfers a low-resolution image or noise into an equivalent high-resolution one for diffusion model via blurring diffusion and block noise. Therefore, the diffusion process can continue seamlessly in any new resolution or model without restarting from pure noise or low-resolution conditioning. RDM achieves state-of-the-art FID on CelebA-HQ and sFID on ImageNet 256$\times$256, surpassing previous works such as ADM, LDM and DiT by a large margin.

### Summary
This paper presents the Relay Diffusion Model (RDM), a new cascaded framework to improve the shortcomings of the previous cascaded methods. Contributions are (1) The difference of noise addition process between low-resolution and high-resolution image diffusion is analyzed from the perspective of frequency domain. Based on the analyzation, this paper further introduces the block noise to bridge the gap; (2)  By combing a low-resolution ordinary diffusion model and a high-resolution blurring diffusion model, RDM starts diffusion from the low-resolution result instead of pure noise, reducing the training and sampling steps; and (3) This paper also evaluates the effectiveness of RDM on unconditional CelebA-HQ 256×256 and conditional ImageNet 256×256 datasets.

### Strengths
1. For originality, this paper first combines a low-resolution ordinary diffusion model with a high-resolution blurring diffusion model. To some extent, this solves the problem of noise schedule in high-resolution diffusion. Besides, the analysis of the noise gap between low-resolution and high-resolution is interesting.
2. For clarity, this paper’s writing is well-structured, and the problem was presented and solved straightforwardly.

### Weaknesses
1. The transition from section 3.1 to section 3.2 is a little incomprehensible; why combining block noise and blurring diffusion model in the second stage needs further explanation. Besides, from the equation and algorithm, I can’t find an explicit connection between low-resolution diffusion and high-resolution diffusion; such an explicit statement may be necessary for reader to understand. Specifically, the role of the patch-wise blurring operation $D_T^p$ in connecting the low and high-resolution stages is not clearly articulated. It's unclear how this operation ensures that the upsampled low-resolution image is in a suitable distribution for the high-resolution diffusion process. The description lacks a clear explanation of how the blurring process aligns with the noise schedule of the high-resolution model, and how the block noise interacts with the blurring to achieve the desired effect.
2. Missing experiments: How does an end-to-end model for high-resolution images by introducing block noise in early diffusion steps perform? The author mentions it on page 5 but does not explain it. It would be beneficial to see a comparison of FID scores between a standard end-to-end diffusion model and one that incorporates block noise in the initial steps. This would help to isolate the impact of block noise on the final image quality and demonstrate its effectiveness in a simpler setting.

### Questions
1. On page 2, “Training Efficiency”, the author takes the cascaded method as a solution to mitigate memory and computation costs, but the cascaded method still needs to train and inference in the highest resolution.  How does such a setting mitigate memory and computation cost? For RDM, the problem still exists.
2. I can’t understand why, for Fig.2, the high-frequency period is meaningless, and the difference can be neglected. More explanation may be required.
3. How to choose $D_{T}^{p}$ to guarantee $VD_{T}^{P}V^{T}x_{0}$ in the same distribution as $x^{H}$; this is the key to connect low-resolution diffusion and high-resolution diffusion.
4. Adding the training iterations of each method in Tables 1, and 3 may make it more readable. The comparison may be a little unfair because RDM’s low-resolution diffusion model is pre-trained.
5. For the text description below equation (11), why blurring corruption and block noise corruption can be considered independently, i.e., why can we just replace $\epsilon$ with $\tilde{\epsilon}$? Is there any formal proof?
6. For Algorithm 1 in A.4, it seems that the sampling algorithm does not contain the process of the low-frequency diffusion model. Please clarify.
7. Some minor errors:
    * On page 4, two “the” in “the same noise level on a higher resolution results in a higher SNR in the (low-frequency part of) the frequency domain.”
    *  For equation (6), the denominator should be $s$ or $s^2$?
    *  Equation 8 may be not appropriate, the $\epsilon^{'}$ should be below the expectation symbol too.

### Summary
This work designs a diffusion framework for medium-resolution image generation and explores it on unconditional CelebA-HQ $256^2$ and class-conditional ImageNet $256^2$. The framework generally follows EDM and cascaded diffusion model and develops some novel contributions on top of them. First, it develops a novel diffusion/denoising process formulation, where the noise, added to an image, is locally correlated for the higher resolution images. Then, instead of concatenating the upsampled low-resolution images channel-wise, the diffusion process is unified for low and higher resolution images. As such, it does not need to train the low-resolution generator from scratch and uses the pre-trained EDM checkpoints. The framework achieves SOTA FID results on ImageNet $256^2$ and CelebA-HQ $256^2$. The paper also contains interesting analysis of the frequencies of noised/clean images in low/medium resolutions and also some curious insights about the cascaded diffusion models.

### Strengths
- The work sets a new state-of-the-art results on ImageNet $256^2$ for constant CFG.
- Analysing SNRs across frequencies is interesting and might inspire some subsequent works to explore this direction as well.
- The work has not only proposed the idea of block-wise locally correlated noise, but also derived the sampler for it (while the derivations are not particularly involved, they still require some carefulness).
- The exposition is very clear and the paper is easy to follow.

### Weaknesses
 - $256^2$ resolution is not "high-resolution" (as claimed in the paper), but rather "medium-resolution". Even the $512^2$ resolution can be fit with end-to-end architectures — e.g. simple diffusion [1] or VDM++ [2] (they can even fit 512x512 in the end-to-end fashion). In this way, it's no clear whether the method would easily scale for high-resolution generation without re-tuning the hyperparameters.
- Scaling Laws clearly demonstrated that the amount of compute spent on training the model has great influence on the final performance — just like the developed novel techniques or model size. However, there is no information about the training cost in the paper (only in terms of the amount of iterations). The paper mentioned that the $256^2$-resolution generator is ~10x more expensive that the $64^2$-resolution one, so I would guess that it might be way more expensive in terms of compute compared to the baselines. The lack of wall-clock training time makes it difficult to assess the practical cost of this approach.
- Figure 1 (and the accompanying claims about faster convergence in the text) seems misleading: the model is not trained from scratch, but compares the convergence with from-scratch trained models. The vanilla EDM was trained on 
- class-balanced FID is the known trick to improve the performance, and, since it's unclear whether prior works used it as well, shouldn't be used in the claims about SotA FID (having it in the table as a separate row is not an issue). The paper uses class-balanced FID (FID-CB) interchangeably with standard FID, which can mislead readers into thinking the standard FID is achieved. The paper also claims sFID is an improved version of FID, but lacks evidence for this claim.
- f-DM (Gu et ICLR'22) can also be seen as a "relay" diffusion, but it is not even mentioned in the paper.

### Questions
- Would the method work on $512^2$, $1024^2$ and/or higher resolutions?
- How does the method perform with from-scratch training? If the model cannot train well from scratch, then the claim about its simplicity compared to CDMs does not hold and should be removed. Also, it's not fair to claim the reduced amount of training steps for a non-from-scratch trained model.
- Can it be the case that the reduced amount of sampling steps is due to the 2-nd order sampler? For example, MDT uses DDPM sampler, which was shown by EDM to require more sampling steps.
- For a fair comparison, please report the training/inference costs of the developed model vs the baselines (where possible).
- Please, update the claims about the convergence speed (especially the teaser paper) to specify that the model is not trained from scratch.
- Please, update the claims about SotA FID based on the unbalanced FID instead of the class-balanced FID.
- Why not try dynamic CFG as well to further improve FIDs? Or it was tried and didn't work?
- It would be good to describe the differences with f-DM.

### Summary
This paper focuses on the task of using a diffusion model for high-resolution image generation. Specifically, the authors locate the issue in the SNR in the frequency domain and introduce the block noise to bridge the gap and build an RDM upon a cascaded pipeline to get rid of the reliance on the low-resolution condition. The authors show state-of-the-art FID on CelebA-HQ and ImageNet on 256x256.

### Strengths
1. this paper has excellent presentation quality and it is easy for readers to follow.
    
2. this paper provides a comprehensive analysis of the limitation of existing cascaded model for high-resolution image generation and locate the issue in the SNR of higher-resolution image. To address these issues, the authors introduce RDM to solve this issue. I think this highlight is insightful and could inspire others in the community.
    
3. the authors have shown extensive comparison in the paper to verify the effectiveness of the RDM.

### Weaknesses
1. This paper focuses on high-resolution image generation. However, the biggest image resolution used in this paper is only 256x256, which is much smaller than the existing definition of ‘high-resolution‘. I would expect an experiment result that has a resolution at least 512 or 1024 to see whether RDM still works. 
    
2. The authors claim that any artifacts in the low-res images can be corrected in the high-res stage, we expect some qualitative cases in experiments to verify such a claim.

### Questions
This paper is well-written and the proposal shows some impressive results in experiments. My major concerns are about the experiment on really high-resolution images and some experiments to verify the superiority of the RDM further. Please see more details in the Weaknesses.

### Summary
This paper proposes a Relay Diffusion Model (RDM) with the aid of block noise to overcome the drawback of the existing cascaded models. The proposed method is claimed to reduce the training and sampling steps. The experiments show that RDM outperforms other methods on FID and sFID on two datasets CelebA-HQ and ImageNet with resolutions of 256x256.

### Strengths
+ The finding that the same noise level can give a mismatch between low- and high-resolution images is interesting.
+ The design of the method can facilitate the training speed where it avoids the conditioning on low-resolution images.
+ Some improvements are sound

### Weaknesses
 + The paper mentioned that "most current models follow the linear (Ho et al., 2020) or cosine (Nichol & Dhariwal, 2021) schedule" and "an ideal noise schedule should be resolution-dependent (See Figure 2)" but looking into Figure 2, I cannot see which noise schedule is used there, either cosine or linear, making it very confusing to capture what the authors want to say. Again, the next sentence said "train high-resolution models directly with common schedules designed for resolutions of 32×32 or 64×64 pixels" but Figure 2 only shows the 64px and 256px (what about 32x32) --> What is the relationship between 32x32 or 64x64 pixels and the one shown in Figure 2 (64px/256px)?

+ The advantage of the proposed method is emphasized with training efficiency, however, it only considers the setting without CFG where some competitors do not yield the optimal output. I believe that it is better also more meaningful to compare all methods in the setting with CFG where the existing methods achieve the best performance (optimal setting). Furthermore, when claiming the efficiency, I would also expect the comparison of the inference time/steps of the proposed method with the existing ones in their best optimal regime (including sampling steps in Table 3.).

+ While the proposed method achieves slightly better sFID compared to MDT-XL/2-G on class-conditional generation ImageNet 256x256 (Table 3) (3.97 vs. 4.57, not really "a large margin" as stated in the abstract), however, most other metrics lag behind MDT-XL/2-G (such as FID, IS, and Recall). This indicates that to show its advantages over the existing approaches, it may need to present more evidence.

+ Section 4.2 talking about CeleA-HQ, mentioned fewer training iterations while it is given with 50M and 820M trained images, making it a bit confusing that the dataset contained a hundred million images or that is just the total training steps. I recommend revising it more clearly and putting a column on the side of that table about the total training iterations or total training images.

### Questions
1) What is the specific of each group in Table 3? It shows that the first column (Model) presents 5 groups (separated by \midrule) but unclear why is it divided like that.

2) I wondering if the number of data used in this paper is wrong, for example, Table 4 stated that 2500M training images were used for ImageNet64, is that 2.5 billion images? To my knowledge, ImageNet contains more than one million images, am I wrong? The same for all other datasets., does CelebA-HQ have 70 million images for training? Also, in Figure 1, is the horizontal axis the real number of images for training or it is just the iterations?
