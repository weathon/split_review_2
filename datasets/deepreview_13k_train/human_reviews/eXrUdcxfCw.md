# Continual Test-Time Adaptation by Leveraging Source Prototypes and Exponential Moving Average Target Prototypes

- Decision: Reject
- Scores: 5, 6, 5, 5, 3

## Abstract
Continual Test-Time Adaptation (CTA) is a challenging task that aims to adapt a source pre-trained model to continually changing target domains. In the CTA setting, the model does not know when the target domain changes, thus facing a drastic change in the distribution of streaming inputs during the test-time. The key challenge is to keep adapting the model to the continually changing target domains in an online manner. To keep track of the changing target domain distributions, we propose to maintain an exponential moving average (EMA) target prototype for each class with reliable target samples. We exploit those prototypes to cluster the target features class-wisely. Moreover, we aim to align the target distributions to the source distribution by minimizing the distance between the target feature and its corresponding pre-computed source prototype. We empirically observe that our simple proposed method achieves reasonable performance gain when applied on existing CTA methods. Furthermore, we assess the adaptation time between existing methodologies and our novel approach, demonstrating that our method can gain noteworthy performance without substantial adaptation time overhead.

### Summary
This paper studies the problem of continual test-time model adaptation, where training data is not accessible and only continually changing target domains are available. To keep adapting the model to the continually changing target domains in an online manner, they propose to maintain an exponential moving average target prototype for each class with reliable target samples. In addition, semantic alignment is achieved by matching the target feature to its corresponding pre-computed source prototype. Experiments on standard benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

### Strengths
- The problem of addressing continuously shifted target domains is a significant yet under-explored topic, especially in the context of test-time adaptation.

- The proposed prototype alignment with EMA target prototypes is simple and easy to implement.

- The experiments conducted in the manuscript provide a comprehensive comparison with the most closely related works, spanning across a broad array of Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) benchmarks and baseline methods.

### Weaknesses
 - My major concern is about the novelty. Prototypical alignment has been extensively explored in previous domain adaptation methods. The major difference between the proposed approach and those prior efforts seems marginal. I suggest that the authors provide detailed comparisons and showcase why their proposed approach is preferable when applied to test-time adaptation scenarios.

- The writing quality of the article is average, with unclear logical progression and lack of fluency in some parts. There are also numerous instances of imprecise word usage. I recommend that the authors have a native English speaker conduct a thorough proofreading to enhance the clarity, coherence, and overall readability of the manuscript. This will ensure that the paper meets the high standards expected of publications in this field and effectively communicates its contributions to the intended audience.

### Summary
This paper utilizes the idea of prototypes for the problem of continual test-time adaptation.
The proposed approach precomputes class prototypes for the source domain data and uses these to perform prototype matching with the target prototypes.
The target domain data is used to compute the target prototypes with the features of only the reliable low entropy samples.
Using the target samples provided at test time, the target prototypes are updated using the exponential moving average (EMA).
Experimental results on ImageNetC and CIFAR100C suggest the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

### Strengths
* Utilizing the prototypical learning approach for test-time adaptation
* Extensive ablation study to study the effect of EMA weight and different components on the overall objective

### Weaknesses
 * Computating the source prototypes requires the source domain data. So, the proposed approach will not work for any off-the-shelf pre-trained model without the source domain data
* Utilizing class prototypes is limited to classification tasks and not generalizable to other tasks
* Experiments are limited to ImageNetC and CIFAR100C, and CIFAR10C related experiments are missing

### Questions
1. Can the authors report the experimental results on CIFAR10C, since prior works report their performance for this benchmark?
2. Utilizing class prototypes is limited to classification tasks and not generalizable to other tasks. Can this approach be generalizable to other tasks, such as segmentation?

This approach seamlessly integrates with existing CTA methods, using source prototypes to reduce distribution discrepancies and target prototypes to cluster target features, which are updated via an EMA process during test-time. The research showcases improved model performance, reduced adaptation time overhead, and a mitigation of model bias, paving the way for future advancements in continual test-time adaptation techniques.

### Strengths
**Originality**: The paper innovatively combines prototypes from both source and target domains, offering a fresh perspective on continual test-time adaptation.

**Quality**: The rigorous methodology and in-depth experiments validate the efficacy of the proposed terms, demonstrating tangible improvements in model performance.

**Clarity**: The paper is well-structured and articulates its methods and findings with precision, making it accessible for readers familiar with the domain.

**Significance**: By addressing model bias and enhancing adaptation efficiency, this research holds potential to shape future work in the realm of continual test-time adaptation.

### Weaknesses
 (1) Compared to CoTTA, where unsupervised test-time adaptation methods function without relying on source domain data, this paper's reliance on pre-computed source prototypes from the source domain data seems to be an uneven ground. It raises questions about the comparability and fairness of the presented method relative to others, like CoTTA, which function without such dependencies. Specifically, the method requires a pre-training phase on source data to obtain these prototypes, which introduces an additional dependency not present in methods designed for a more purely unsupervised test-time adaptation scenario. This difference in setup makes direct comparisons potentially misleading, as the proposed method benefits from information not available to other approaches.

(2) The various loss components highlighted in the paper have previously been discussed in many other studies within the Domain Adaptation (DA) and Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) fields. This gives an impression that the proposed method might just be a combination of existing techniques, akin to piecing together different methods like A+B+C. For instance, the use of an Exponential Moving Average (EMA) for updating target prototypes, denoted as $L_{ema}$, is a common practice in unsupervised DA and does not represent a novel contribution on its own. The paper lacks a clear explanation of how these components are combined in a unique way to achieve the claimed improvements, and it is not clear what the specific innovation is beyond the combination of these known techniques.

(3) Figure 1 in the paper comes across as overly intricate and disorganized. A reader would need to invest significant effort to discern and correlate the various methods depicted, which hampers the immediate understanding of the paper's methodology. The diagram includes many different components and connections, making it difficult to follow the flow of information and the interaction between the different loss terms. The lack of a clear visual hierarchy and the density of information make it challenging to grasp the core methodology quickly.

(4) The $L_{unsup}$ seems to be inadequately defined in the paper. Even though the authors touched upon it in the "Problem definition" section, a more explicit formula or representation would have been beneficial for clarity and a more straightforward comprehension. The paper mentions that this loss can take the form of an entropy minimization or a distillation loss, but it does not provide a clear mathematical definition of either. This lack of specificity makes it difficult to understand exactly how this loss term is implemented and how it contributes to the overall objective.

### Questions
1. **Regarding Comparability:** One of the primary concerns raised revolves around the fairness of comparing the proposed method with traditional CTA methods. Given that the proposed method relies on pre-computed source prototypes from the source domain data, how do the authors justify the comparability of their method, especially when other methods like CoTTA operate without such dependencies?

2. **Concerning Novelty:** The various loss components presented in the paper seem to have been discussed in previous DA and TTA research. Could the authors elaborate on what sets their method apart, particularly concerning its novelty? How does the incorporation of these loss components enhance the uniqueness and effectiveness of the proposed method?

3. **On Clarity:** Figure 1, as mentioned, appears quite intricate. Is there a possibility to streamline or restructure the figure to make it more intuitive for readers? 


If the authors can address these questions and take into consideration the suggestions provided, it would greatly enhance the paper's clarity and relevance, and I will consider increasing my score.

### Summary
This work tackles the continual test-time adaptation problem. It proposes two enhancements that are orthogonal to several test-time adaptation methods. The first component as regularizing the feature extractor with a cross-entropy loss that leverages a moving average of  prototypical features from the target domain. Such features are initialized with the weights of the linear classifier and then updated using exponential moving average. The second component is to align the features of the target domain with a precomputed set of prototypical features from the source domain. Experiments are carried out on two datasets (CIFAR-100-C and ImageNet-C) where the proposed method showed performance gains when combined with 3 test-time adaptation methods.

### Strengths
The main strengths of this work are:

- The problem this paper tackles is both important and practical.

- The approach proposed in this work is simple and easy to implement. Further, the experiments show the applicability of the proposed enhancements when combined with different test-time adaptation methods.

- The online estimates of the prototypical features and the MSE loss makes the proposed approach efficient as demonstrated in Figure 2.

### Weaknesses
Despite the stated strengths of this work, there are several weaknesses that need to be addressed before accepting this work.

1- Methodology. While the proposed method is simple to both understand and implement, there are several caveats that need to be discussed:

(1a) How are the hyper parameters tuned? Is the source data used to initialize $P^s$ employing training data or validation data? Specifically, what is the process for selecting the optimal values for the exponential moving average weight and the weight of the source prototypical alignment loss? The paper mentions a grid search, but it would be helpful to elaborate on the search space and the criteria used to determine the best hyperparameter set. Furthermore, clarifying whether the $P^s$ initialization uses training or validation data from the source domain would add clarity to the methodology.

(1b) This paper needs to properly state its contributions over TTAC. Specifically, how does the proposed approach differ in terms of computational complexity and underlying assumptions? A more detailed comparison highlighting the advantages and disadvantages of each method would be beneficial.

(1c) It is unclear whether the predictions in Algorithm 1 line 5 are adjusted before the output phase (line Ensure) as the predictions $z$ are returned as $\hat y$. Further, the algorithm returns the set of predictions for all data-points and all domains rather than conducting the evaluation in an online manner (return the predictions batch by batch). A more precise description of how predictions are generated and returned, especially regarding the online nature of the process, is needed. Does the algorithm process each batch independently and produce predictions sequentially, or are predictions accumulated and returned at the end?

2- Experiments. The experimental analysis in the work show marginal performance gains of the proposed approach. Further, there are missing key experimental details and comparisons:

(2a) How is the hyperparameter search done for the proposed approach? Is a similar effort put into other baselines (e.g. EATA + TTAC)? A detailed description of the hyperparameter search strategy for both the proposed method and the baselines is crucial for ensuring a fair comparison.

(2b) It is unclear why the proposed components degrade the performance of EATA under small batch-sizes? This is a significant concern as it suggests potential limitations of the method in scenarios with limited data. A thorough explanation of the underlying reasons for this performance degradation is needed. Is it due to insufficient data for accurate prototype estimation or issues with the source alignment loss under small batch conditions?

(2c) While EATA does not regularize for its features to be clustered (unlike the proposed approach), they are still very competitive (better in discriminating different clusters) when the proposed components are absent. This observation raises questions about the necessity of the proposed components. A more in-depth discussion comparing the feature clustering behavior of EATA and the proposed method would be valuable.

(2d) Generally, I think the analysis and comparison of the proposed method should be against EATA+TTAC rather than EATA (e.g. in Figure s 4 and 5). This would provide a more direct comparison with a method that also incorporates clustering-based regularization.

(2e) Experiments with different and more powerful architectures that do not use batch normalization (e.g. ViT) layers are missing. This limits the generalizability of the findings. Including experiments with such architectures would strengthen the paper's conclusions.

3- Writing. The writing of this work should be vastly improved to enhance its readability. Here are a list of suggestion to be considered in the final version:

(3a) The problem definition is not clear. Both $k$ and $t$ are used to refer to time. Using distinct symbols or clarifying the meaning of these variables would improve clarity.

(3b) The introduction should state clearly the contributions this work provides. A concise and explicit statement of contributions would help readers understand the novelty of the work.

(3c) Algorithm 1 is unclear how the prediction is conducted and what predictions are returned (line 5 computes z while last line returns $\hat y$. A more detailed explanation of the prediction process within the algorithm is needed.

(3d) Captions of Tables 3 and 4 should be improved to elaborate what metric is reported and what to pay attention to. Clear and informative captions are essential for understanding the results presented in the tables.

(3e) The related work section is missing from the main paper and put in the appendix. It is essential to have this section to clearly position this work in the literature.

Overall, while I like the simplicity of the proposed approach, the performance gains are generally very marginal (with best choice of hyper parameters) questioning the usefulness of the proposed method.

### Summary
The objective of this paper is to address the challenge of adapting a pre-trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to distribution shifts during test time. These shifts stem from corrupted test images, which may include issues such as noise and blur.

To tackle this problem, the authors propose a method that penalizes abrupt changes in class prototypes by employing exponential moving average (EMA). By leveraging this technique, the authors aim to enhance the adaptability of the model in the face of distribution shifts caused by various forms of image corruption.

The authors conduct thorough evaluations of their approach on widely-acknowledged continual test time adaptation benchmarks, specifically Imagenet-C and CIFAR-100. Their results demonstrate that their method occasionally outperforms existing state-of-the-art test time adapters, namely EATA, CoTTA, and RMT.

Overall, the paper assembles a simple technique for addressing the challenges posed by distribution shifts, offering some insights into improving the adaptability of pre-trained CNNs under diverse test conditions.

---------------------------- Post Rebuttal --------------------------------------------------------------------------

I read through all the other reviews, as well as the rebuttal text. The rebuttal text re-approves the lack of technical contribution. I also notice that access to source data for adaptation is a major limitation (of the studied setting, not necessarily for this particular paper).

I keep my original score.

### Strengths
S1:
The paper addresses a crucial yet underexplored scenario: continuous adaptation to test time shifts.

S2:
The utilized approach is simple: it enforces gradual shifts in class prototypes instead of abrupt changes, achieved through the application of Exponential Moving Average (EMA).

S3:
The paper is well-written, and meticulously executed.

### Weaknesses
W1:
A significant concern regarding this paper is its lack of technical innovation. Despite being an application paper, the method merely applies EMA for continual test time adaptation, employing standard techniques for selecting reliable test exemplars, computing class prototypes, and calculating EMA penalties. These methodologies are well-established within the existing literature. The core idea of using EMA to stabilize model parameters during adaptation is not novel, and the paper does not introduce any new theoretical insights or algorithmic variations on this concept. The specific implementation details, such as the choice of the EMA decay rate or the method for selecting reliable exemplars, are not sufficiently explored or justified, making the contribution appear incremental rather than transformative.

W2:
The empirical evidence presented in the paper lacks persuasiveness. A substantial performance boost could have justified the paper's simplicity and application-oriented nature. However, the minor improvement over EATA and RMT, as indicated primarily in Table 1-2 (i.e., less than +0.5% accuracy), does not substantiate the approach's effectiveness convincingly. The reported gains are not consistently observed across all datasets and methods. For instance, the improvement on CIFAR100-C with RMT is marginal, suggesting that the proposed method's effectiveness is highly dependent on the base adaptation technique. Furthermore, the paper does not provide a detailed analysis of the cases where the proposed method fails to improve performance, which is crucial for understanding its limitations.

W3:
One notable omission in the paper is the absence of a comparison or reference against a significant baseline, namely NOTE [1], which is a robust continual test-time adaptation method designed to handle temporal correlations. This baseline is highly relevant to the authors' objectives and should have been included for a comprehensive evaluation. Furthermore, the paper missed an opportunity for greater depth by limiting its evaluation to simple, artificial distribution shifts induced by corruptions. It could have been more compelling if the authors had explored and evaluated the method against natural shifts or temporal correlations, thus enhancing the paper's overall impact and relevance. The evaluation should have included a more diverse set of benchmarks, including those with temporal dependencies and natural distribution shifts, to demonstrate the method's robustness and generalizability.
