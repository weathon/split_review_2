# Decoupled Actor-Critic

- Decision: Reject
- Scores: 6, 6, 6, 5

## Abstract
Actor-Critic methods are in a stalemate of two seemingly irreconcilable problems. Firstly, critic proneness towards overestimation requires sampling temporal-difference targets from a conservative policy optimized using lower-bound Q-values. Secondly, well-known results show that policies that are optimistic in the face of uncertainty yield lower regret levels. To remedy this dichotomy, we propose Decoupled Actor-Critic (DAC). DAC is an off-policy algorithm that learns two distinct actors by gradient backpropagation: a conservative actor used for temporal-difference learning and an optimistic actor used for exploration. We test DAC on DeepMind Control tasks in low and high replay ratio regimes and ablate multiple design choices. Despite minimal computational overhead, DAC achieves state-of-the-art performance and sample efficiency on locomotion tasks.

### Summary
The paper claims that there seems to be a conflicting demand in actor-critic architecture: the critic tends to overestimate so conservatism is needed when computing bootstrap target; however, the actor should act optimistically to improve sample efficiency/reduce regret. The authors propose dual actor-critic to reconcile the problem: there are both conservative actor and optimistic actor, and an ensemble of critics used to compute the lower/upper bound of value estimates. The basic idea is to let actor acts optimistically while the other actor act is used for maximize lower bound of the Q values. The algorithm also adds some heuristic designs such as minimizing the KL divergence between the two actors, learning the optimism control parameter and the KL divergence weight. Empirical results are provided to show the effectiveness of the algorithm.

### Strengths
1. The paper includes many experiments, which might provide heuristics for application-oriented tasks; 

2. The paper presents its algorithm clearly. 

3. The studied problem regarding balancing optimism and potential overestimation is interesting.

### Weaknesses
The proposed algorithm is mostly designed by heuristics and the implementation details are not theoretically justified. Although I do not think theoretical support is necessary for a good paper, I expect empirical evidence to verify the critical claims/algorithmic designs of this paper (see below).

Furthermore, since the proposed algorithm is basically a synthesis of different intuitive designs, a discussion of where the algorithm would converge to should be provided. Currently the paper is written in a way that different updating rules are introduced; I expect to see a clear objective function (maybe with constraints) of Algorithm 1, so readers can easily see what it is optimizing, can the authors write it down in the rebuttal?

When simultaneously maximizing both lower and upper bound of the Q values, would it squash all action values higher and still result in overestimation?

empirically: 
1. Verify the proposed method indeed mitigate overestimation comparing with an algorithm without using any correction, e.g., compare the estimate value and MC estimation; the current version of the paper directly using evaluation return as a performance measure, which, I think lacks justification, as it is unclear where the improved performance results from;

2. The added optimism is essentially an exploration strategy, some baselines aiming at exploration should be also compared.

3. Ablation study should be provided to justify the following design choices: the effect of ensemble (and do those baselines use ensemble too?), the necessity of optimizing optimism and KL weight (can you use some intuitive choices instead of learning them)?

Any comments how do you decide the order of the updating rules 10-15? And how their learning rates are chosen?

4. The algorithm introduces many more hyper parameters comparing with commonly seen SAC or TD3 due to the added components in the losses, I would not consider the comparison to be fair with other baselines, unless evidence of similar efforts have been made to thoroughly sweep baseline’s hyper-parameters is provided.

5. Eq 7, how do you calculate the gradient w.r.t optimistic actor parameters, it appears the gradient should be also propagated through/to the first two Q functions and these Qs are interdependent with actor.

6. The motivation of the paper is to avoid overestimation while keep good exploration. Isn’t it quite intuitive to combine some exploration method with methods that mitigate overestimation?  it shouldn’t be difficult to design such a baseline as mitigating overestimation typically require multiple critics and uncertainty estimate could be derived from the ensemble for exploration purpose. What is the proposed algorithm’s advantage?

7. The experimental design of studying replay ratio appears to disconnect with the primary motivation of this paper; this should be put in the appendix.

### Summary
This paper proposes the Decoupled Actor-Critic (DAC) algorithm that leverages two actors, one optimistic for efficient environment exploration and one conservative for stable learning. DAC further features a adaptive mechanism for setting the optimism trade-off to better account for the impact of reward scales. The performance of DAC is evaluated on a variety of tasks from the DeepMind Control Suite and compares favorably to the selected baselines.

### Strengths
-	The approach of combining optimistic exploration with conservative updating is very neat
-	Evaluation on 10 seeds with a multitude of baselines is great
-	Overall well written / structured paper that is easy to follow
-	Promising results, while some adjustments should be made regarding the experimental evaluation as discussed below

### Weaknesses
-	Dreamer results in Figure 11 are looking good, while harder tasks such as Quadruped Run and Humanoid Walk are missing – Dreamer-v2 is able to solve these tasks well even for visual-control, why not compare on tasks like Quadruped/Humanoid/etc. (or even extend to visual control)?
-	More complex Control Suite tasks (Figures 12 & 13) like Humanoid Walk/Run should be run for longer as they have not converged, yet, while recent papers have also evaluated on the Dog domain
-	SAC is in general a good baseline, however, it would be nice to also compare performance to a more “DMC-native” baseline such as D4PG or (D)MPO to provide another reference point
-	There are quite a few missing articles / words + typos that should be fixed
-	It would be good to extend the discussion to model-based exploration agents, e.g. the works in [1] and [2] leveraged Dreamer/RSSM-based agents for visual control that explored via ensemble disagreement over rewards, where [1] maintained an optimistic upper confidence bound exploration policy as well as a distinct exploitation policy. [3] also explores uncertain returns with access to the nominal reward functions.


### Questions
-	Could your provide an exemplary calculation of how the maximum average performance is calculated in Section F.1 – is the argmax over time? Why average over the tasks?
-	Fish and Swimmer are very stochastic tasks due to random goal placement, but the results in Figure 12 & 13 still look extremely variable with confidence intervals barely visible. Could you double check how the evaluations are computed? Do all runs use the same evaluation seed (e.g. same eval goal across all seeds)?
-	It might be worth briefly discussing the general impact of replay ratios across algorithm implementation, as the “low replay” regime with 3 gradient steps per 1 environment steps seems to be significantly higher than e.g., Acme’s MPO default of 1 gradient steps per 8 environment steps (or 1/1 for Acme’s SAC). The impact of replay ratios can be wild.
-	The caption of Table 2 mentions 10 HARD DMC tasks, while Pendulum Swingup and Cartpole Swingup Sparse would not be considered hard (arguably, Cheetah, Quadruped, Fish aren’t hard either)?
-	Have you also tried DroQ as an even more recent addition / alternative to REDQ?
-	Have you tried an ablation study on the number of critics? What patterns would you expect?

### Summary
The optimistic have different impact on actor and critic update, i.e., the overestimation of critic may result in sub-optimal policy while the optimistic policy can yield lower regret. Thus motivated, this work propose to decouple the actor-critic by using different actors for TD learning and exploration. The proposed method is tested on locomotion tasks with various replay ratio and achieve better performance than previous work.

### Strengths
1. This paper is well-motivated by the issues in the single policy regime in the conventional actor-critic.
2. The proposed method shows less sensitivity to the hyperparameter thanks to the adaptive adjustment of the optimistic level, which is different from the related work Optimistic Actor-Critic (OAC).

### Weaknesses
### weaknesses:

1. The visualization in Figure 2b and 2c, while intended to demonstrate critic disagreement, lacks clarity. Specifically, it is not immediately apparent how these figures effectively illustrate the divergence in critic evaluations for different actors. A more detailed explanation or alternative visualization approach might be necessary to convey this concept more effectively.

2. The paper proposes using a non-linear approximation of the Q-value, but it is unclear if this is feasible or practical in the context of Equation (6). Further elaboration on the specific type of non-linear approximation and its implications on the overall method would be beneficial. The feasibility of implementing such an approximation, given potential computational constraints or convergence issues, should be discussed.

3. The impact of the ensemble size, as mentioned in relation to Equation (4), is not thoroughly investigated. While the paper acknowledges the use of an ensemble, it does not provide a comprehensive analysis of how different ensemble sizes might affect the performance and stability of the proposed method. An ablation study or theoretical analysis exploring this aspect would strengthen the paper.

4. The notation used in the paper could be improved for clarity. Specifically, the use of  |\mathcal{A}| to denote action dimensionality is unconventional and potentially confusing, as this notation is typically used to represent the cardinality of a set. Adopting a more standard notation, such as dim(\mathcal{A}) or a similar alternative, would enhance readability.

### Questions
1. It is unclear how does Figure 2b and 2c shows the critic disagreement for different actors?
2. If it is possible to use non-linear approximation of Q-value in Eqn. (6)
3. What is the impact of the ensemble size as in Eqn. (4)
4. Some notations can be confusing, i.e., $|\mathcal{A}|$ is used to denote the action dimensionality where normally it is used as the cardinality of the action space.

### Summary
This is an empirical paper well-motivated by solving the conservative policy update and optimistic exploration problem that exists in deep RL. The proposed method achieves significant performance compared with the presented baselines.

### Strengths
The motivation is clear, and the method looks solid.
The authors provide extensive experiments and put great effort into enhancing reproducibility.

### Weaknesses
The paper does not compare against the ensemble-based methods [e.g., REDQ], which I believe is relevant and necessary.

On the general applicability of the idea, will this idea work with different value-to-policy generation rules? Specifically, how would this approach perform with policy parameterizations that do not directly output a mean and variance, such as implicit policy parameterizations or those using normalizing flows?

There is no text pointing to Figure 1 and Figure 2. Also, many of the abbreviations are used since the beginning of the paper but are introduced at very late stages. The overall presentation of the paper can be improved.

The authors do not disclose any pitfalls of the DAC algorithm. Is it consistently better than SAC/TD3/other baselines? This is a huge claim, and would definitely be a huge strength of the work if it is true.

It is known in the literature that off-policy learning can suffer from the [tandem problem]. How do you solve such difficulty when updating the conservative actor using the data generated by the optimistic actor?

What is the backbone of DAC? How do the authors explicitly model the variance and mean of the policy?
