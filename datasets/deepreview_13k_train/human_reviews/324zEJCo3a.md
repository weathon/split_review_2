# Local Vs. Global Interpretability: A Computational Perspective

- Decision: Reject
- Scores: 6, 6, 6, 6

## Abstract
The local and global interpretability of various ML models has been
studied extensively in recent years. However, despite significant
progress in the field, many known results remain informal or lack sufficient mathematical rigor. We propose a framework for bridging this gap, by using computational complexity theory to assess local and global perspectives of interpreting ML models. We begin by proposing proofs for two novel insights that are essential for our analysis:
	\begin{inparaenum}[(i)]
		\item a duality between local and global forms of
		explanations; and
		\item the inherent uniqueness of certain global explanation forms.
	\end{inparaenum}
	We then use these insights to evaluate the complexity of computing explanations, across three
	model types representing the extremes of the
	interpretability spectrum:
	\begin{inparaenum}[(i)]
		\item linear models;
		\item decision trees; and 
		\item neural networks.
	\end{inparaenum}
Our findings offer insights into both the local and global
interpretability of these models. For instance, under standard
complexity assumptions such as P $\neq$ NP, we prove that selecting
\emph{global} sufficient subsets in linear models is computationally
harder than selecting \emph{local} subsets. Interestingly, with neural
networks and decision trees, the opposite is true: it is harder to carry out this task locally than globally. %A similar pattern is also observed in the task of identifying redundant features.
We believe that our findings demonstrate how examining explainability through a computational complexity lens can help us develop a more rigorous grasp of the inherent interpretability of ML models.

### Confidence
3: You are fairly confident in your assessment. It is possible that you did not understand some parts of the submission or that you are unfamiliar with some pieces of related work. Math/other details were not carefully checked.

### Summary
The paper presents a series of results about several forms of explanations (sufficient reasons, redundant and necessary features and completion count) both in terms of properties of these explanation forms and in terms of their computation complexity. The work focuses on boolean functions.
Interestingly, the paper delves into some existent duality between local and global explanations and provides uniqueness of minimal global sufficient reasons.
The authors further propose a notion of c-interpretability (where c may stand for computational?) which may be used to compare and assess the 'level of interpretability' of classes of models. The authors study decision trees, linear models and MLPs.

### Strengths
- The paper is very clear and notation and clear definitions are helpful to follow the work throughout
- I believe this work is highly significant, even if a bit narrow in the scope. Table 1 (and the results obtained to fill it) seem a valuable reference for researchers in the field.  
- Overall, the content of the paper is of high value, and could serve to make some order (from a theoretical standpoint)  in the XAI field. 
- Quality of result of Sec 3 and 4 is high (although please see my comments in Questions). I haven't carefully checked results of sec 5 as they are outside of my expertise.

### Weaknesses
 - The work could be stronger if the connections to not-only boolean functions would be made clearer. 
- *Paper & Appendix:* I found the proof sketches of limited use, if not misleading (e.g. that of proposition 2, checking the full proof in the appendix, I do not understand where's the link to Th. 2, as mentioned in the sketch). Proposition 1 could report the function from the appendix. I personally think space could be used better to comment on implications and reasons why the result is interesting/important. 
Theorem 3 is not understandable given the lack of definition of hitting sets (in the paper); I'd suggest to either expand, or remove entirely. Global definitions of local counterparts could be suggested in a more straightforward way (as they all derive from local one by adding a 
- Related work could be more comprehensive, especially when introducing the concepts of various explanations; see e.g. [1] and references therein. 
- The introduced concept of the c-interpretability has unclear implications from a practical standpoint 

### Questions
- Regarding Sec 4. Are these sentences true? If so, maybe consider add as commentary for additional clarity.
    1. Global subset-minimal and cardinally-minimal sufficient reasons coincide (thus you can talk about *the* minimal global sufficient reason, and can drop the "subset/carinally" identifiers)
  2. The minimal global sufficient reason can be characterized as the complementary of the union of all global redundant features.
- Isn't Proposition 5 a direct consequence of the definitions? If so, I'd suggest to put the comment inline and remove the proposition.

### Summary
The authors analyze the computational complexity of obtaining local and global explanations for different ML models. They study local and global explanations for linear models, decision trees and neural nets to evaluate the computational complexity associated with four different forms of explanations. They find that computing global explanations is computationally more difficult than computing local explanations for linear models. They also find that this reverses for decision trees and neural networks, i.e., computing a global explanation is more tractable than computing a local explanation for these models.

### Strengths
The work takes on the very challenging and impactful task of quantifying and measuring interpretability across models and types of explanations.

### Weaknesses
This is a theoretical analysis paper that seems to rely heavily on subsets of features that can be tractably enumerated. I do not think that this can practically extend to deep neural networks or to input domains like images and text.

### Summary
This paper proposes a computational complexity theory perspective to evaluate the local and global interpretability of different ML models.
This framework examines various forms of local and global explanations and assesses the computational complexity involved in generating them.

### Strengths
As someone who primarily works in the field of explainability in machine learning, I have limited experience with computational complexity theory. However, I find the perspective of examining global and local interpretability through the lens of computational complexity both novel and interesting.

### Weaknesses
Due to my limited expertise in computational complexity theory, I have not delved deeply into the core aspects of the paper. My questions are high-level.

Could you clarify the claim that linear classifiers inherently possess local interpretability but lack global interpretability, whereas decision trees are acknowledged to have both local and global interpretability? In the XAI literature, a linear model is considered both locally and globally interpretable since it exhibits the same behavior everywhere. Could you clarify how this perspective on interpretability differs from yours?

Could you also highlight the differences between your work and the paper 'Model Interpretability through the Lens of Computational Complexity,' which seems to focus on local interpretability?

### Summary
The paper studies the computational complexity of different explainability queries on several classes of Boolean ML models. Since the picture for so-called "local" explaianability queries, that aim to explain the behavior of the model on a particular input, has been studied in depth in previous work by Barcelo et al, the paper focuses on "global" explainability queries, that aim to find the features that are most relevant for all inputs to the model. In particular, the paper aims to find whether there exists a correspondence between folklore claims on interpretability and the computational complexity of such problems.

### Strengths
- The paper is very well-written. 
- It deals with a timely topic. 
- Theoretical results unveil an interesting view on global explanations: sometimes they increase the complexity with respect to the corresponding local version of the explainability query, but sometimes they lower it. 
- The observation that there is a unique minimal global sufficient reason is simple, but interesting.

### Weaknesses
 - The paper lacks novelty, and as such I think it remains a notch below the acceptance threshold for ICLR. This is because the idea of correlating computational complexity and folklore claims on explainability of models has been proposed and studied before in a NeurIPS paper by Barcelo et al. So, while I liked the paper, I do not feel like championing it for a conference like ICLR.
- The paper lacks a unifying take-home message. In particular, it is never speculated or proposed a reason why for some models global explaianability is more difficult than local one, while for others is not. I could easily think of some potential reasons myself, so I am very surprised that the authors have not made it themselves.

### Questions
- Can you please propose a reason for why in some models, and for some queries, global explaianability is more complex than local one, while for others it's the opposite? This might be related to the characteristics of global explanations (an extra universal quantification in the definition of the notions vs a unique minimal global sufficient reason set) and on the nature of the models themselves (some problems being easily solvable on them). 

- I would have been more positive about the paper if the authors would have considered a more relaxed version of global explainability, which seems to be of more practical interest: instead of requiring that the condition holds for every input instance, it could hold for a large fraction of them: say, for 90%, for instance. Can you add something about how your complexity analysis would change if this relaxed notion of global explainability was considered instead?
