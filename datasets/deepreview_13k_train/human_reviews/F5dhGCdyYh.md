# Illusory Attacks: Information-theoretic detectability matters in adversarial attacks

- Decision: Accept
- Scores: 8, 6, 8

## Abstract
Autonomous agents deployed in the real world need to be robust against adversarial attacks on sensory inputs. 
Robustifying agent policies requires anticipating the strongest attacks possible.
We demonstrate that existing observation-space attacks on reinforcement learning agents have a common weakness: while effective, their lack of information-theoretic detectability constraints makes them \textit{detectable} using automated means or human inspection. 
Detectability is undesirable to adversaries as it may trigger security escalations.
We introduce \textit{\eattacks{}}, a novel form of adversarial attack on sequential decision-makers that is both effective and of $\epsilon$-bounded statistical detectability. 
We propose a novel dual ascent algorithm to learn such attacks end-to-end.
Compared to existing attacks, we empirically find \eattacks{} to be significantly harder to detect with automated methods, and a small study with human participants\footnote{IRB approval under reference R84123/RE001} suggests they are similarly harder to detect for humans. 
Our findings suggest the need for better anomaly detectors, as well as effective hardware- and system-level defenses. The project website can be found at {\small \url{https://tinyurl.

### Confidence

### Summary
The authors propose a novel attack on sequential decision-makers. In their attack framework, the authors introduce an information-theoretic detectability constraint, where they minimize the KL distance between the trajectory density of the victim’s observation process and the unattacked environment’s trajectory density. Thereby, they ensure that the difference in the distributions is below a specific detectability threshold that makes the attacks difficult or even impossible to detect. The authors propose a dual ascent algorithm to simultaneously optimize the adversarial reward and the detectability objective and demonstrate that their attack achieves a better detectability success trade-off compared to previous attacks for automatic detection methods and human assessment.

### Strengths
* Clear presentation of related work and positioning of the paper in the literature
* Concept is intuitively explained in Figure 1
* I found the information-theoretic approach to designing difficult-to-detect adversarial attacks convincing. While the proposed approach may not scale to complex real-world scenarios, it may be used as a baseline for more efficient variations of the proposed algorithm
* To the best of my knowledge, the detectability success trade-off of the proposed attack framework is considerably better than in previous work
* Diverse benchmarks with different robustification methods and an additional human study (although limited complexity of benchmarks)

### Weaknesses
 * (Minor) The paper introduces a considerable amount of notation. I feel like the main results could be conveyed with less mathematical notation, which could be moved to the appendix (a lot of basic RFL notation and concepts)
* (Minor) The evaluation is limited to simple simulated environments
* (Medium) I'm missing a runtime analysis to compare the efficiency of the different attacks. This would also highlight if the framework could be scaled to more complicated problems

### Questions
* Could the authors elaborate on the runtime of their attack and its scalability to more complex environments

### Summary
This paper considers adversarial attacks against deep reinforcement learning agents which work by directly modifying the observations input to RL policies. The authors point out a flaw of previous work in this area: the observations which are produced by attacks may be very unrealistic and thus detectable by the victim, which could lead to mitigation of the attack's effects. They aim to remedy this by constraining attacks to be illusory, a set of properties they introduce which mean an attack is in some way hard to detect. Illusory attacks are defined by placing a constraint on the KL divergence between the distribution over sequences of observations seen by the victim policy when under attack and when not under attack. This is a reasonable constraint because optimal hypothesis testing can be shown to become harder as the KL is lower, i.e., it becomes less and less feasible for the victim to detect an attack. The authors devise an algorithm to generate KL-constrained attacks and show that it works well in practice, evading a state-of-the-art anomaly detector and human detection.

### Strengths
The idea of undetectable attacks in the MDP setting is really nice and, to my knowledge, novel. It seems like a natural question to see what the information-theoretic limit of undetectable attacks is and look at how attacks can be made to approach this limit. The quality of the mathematical analysis and of the experiments seems generally good.

### Weaknesses
My main concern with the paper is the presentation, which is very dense and at times difficult to understand. For instance, many of the equations in Section 4 are presented without much motivation or intuitive explanation. It seems at some points that the authors include additional mathematical details which are unconnected to the main message of the paper (e.g., discussing nonparameteric density estimation on line 188); it might be best to omit these and devote the room instead to making other points more clear. I have listed some specific problems with the writing below.

Additionally, I found many of the figures had only limited explanation. I don't find Figure 1 to be so clear—there is a lot going on and I could only understand it completely after going through the rest of the paper. Figure 2 is presented with only high-level explanation in the paper, and it's not clear what all the arrows and lines mean. Algorithm 1 is confusing since $p(\emptyset)$ and $p(o_\text{old}, a_\text{old})$ seem to be undefined and there is no caption.

Specific issues:
 * Line 132: I believe it should be $\text{supp} \: \xi(\cdot \mid s) \subseteq \mathcal{B}(s)$.
 * The definition of additive perturbations on line 134 is a bit confusing. First, why are the perturbations themselves in the state space $\mathcal{S}$. Shouldn't they be in $\mathbb{R}^d$, where $\mathcal{S} \subseteq \mathbb{R}^d$? Second, the $\delta$ notation for a point mass is not previously introduced.
 * Line 225: I believe "relative entropy" is actually another term for KL-divergence, and what is mean is "cross entropy." The notation used of $H[X, Y]$ is standard for "joint entropy," though! So this is quite confusing—it would be best to clean up the notation.
 * In Algorithm 1, $\hat{D}_{\text{KL}}$ is not defined.

### Questions
* In Figure 5, it seems strange to the detection rate averaged across environments for human detection and automated detection when one is only evaluated on two environments and the other is evaluated on all four. Since the automated detection rate is already shown in Figure 4, why not just show the automated detection rate for the environments where human detection was tested in Figure 5?

### Summary
The authors propose an attack on RL called the illusory attack.  This is an observation-space attack which enforces that the attack is difficult to detect by enforcing that the unattacked trajectory density and attacked trajectory density is bounded by $\epsilon$.  The authors demonstrate that this attack is significantly harder to detect compared to former attacks on RL by both OOD detectors and humans.

### Strengths
- paper is clear
- illusory attacks are not as easily detected compared to prior attacks so they cannot be easily defended against by using an ood detector
- experimental scope is good, authors compare to prior attacks for multiple RL problems and demonstrate with both ood detection and human detection that illusory attacks are difficult to detect

### Weaknesses
 - the paper does not seem to give much guidance on how to design better defenses against these attacks/ how can illusory attacks allow us to design more robust RL techniques?


### Questions
- I'm a little confused by the definition of adversary score, what exactly is the normalization used to compute this value? The paper states that the value is normalized with respect to the "highest adversarial return in each class, as well as the victim’s expected return in the unattacked environment" but I don't understand what this means.
