# Overcoming bias towards base sessions in few-shot class-incremental learning (FSCIL)

- Decision: Reject
- Scores: 5, 5, 5

## Abstract
Few-shot class-incremental learning (FSCIL) with a more realistic and challenging problem setting aims to learn a set of novel object classes with a restricted number of training examples in sequence. In the process, striking a balance between not forgetting previously-learned object classes and overfitting to novel ones plays a crucial role. Meanwhile, conventional methods exhibit a significant performance bias towards a base session: excessively low incremental performance compared to base performance. To tackle this, we propose a simple-but-effective pipeline that achieves a substantial performance margin for incremental sessions. Further, we devise and perform comprehensive experiments under diverse conditions—leveraging pretrained representations, various classification modules, and aggregation of the predictions within our pipeline; our findings reveal essential insights towards model design and future research directions. Additionally, we introduce a set of new evaluation metrics and benchmark datasets to address the limitations of the conventional metrics and benchmark datasets which disguise the bias towards a base session. These newly introduced metrics and datasets allow to estimate the generalization of FSCIL models. Furthermore, we achieve new state-of-the-art performance with significant margins as a result of our study. The codes of our study are available at GITHUB.

### Summary
In this paper, authors find that conventional methods exhibit excessively low incremental  session performance compared to base session performance. To tackle this issue, authors propose a new pipeline and conduct comprehensive experiments explore various conditions, including pre-trained representations, classification modules, and prediction aggregation. This paper further introduces new evaluation metrics and benchmark datasets to mitigate bias towards the base session, allowing for a more accurate assessment of FSCIL model generalization.

### Strengths
1. Authors reveal the fact that current approaches cannot generalize on novel classes well.
2. Authors propose a novel pipeline, evaluation metrics and datasets for FSCIL.

### Weaknesses
Overall, though the paper might be useful, the paper lacks a clear motivation of the proposed methods and details of important parts of the model. This paper lacks the consistency between the efforts in the paper and conclusion. Meanwhile, the empirical results are not compelling enough to validate the effectiveness of proposed pipeline and evaluation metrics.

My questions and concerns are as follows:

1.	One important contribution of the paper is proposing the pipeline to mitigate the performance issue, however, there is no detailed analysis of the reason behind the phenomenon. Why the proposed pipeline is able to tackle this issue?

2.	The propose pipeline utilizes a pre-trained model to provide representations to aid FSCIL baseline. However, if the pre-trained model has already learned novel classes or similar classes, does it violate the incremental learning setting of learning novel classes?

3.	In section 3.1, the description of incremental sessions causes misunderstanding. N is used to represent both the number of incremental sessions and classes in each session.  

4.	In section 3.4, details are missing on how to aggregate the predictions. If the model is able to obtain the classification results of base and novel classes, why further aggregates the two prediction results to get the final predicition?

5.	In table 3, the performance of a_0 of compared methods are listed wrong.  SAVC achieves 81.85 at a_0; FACT reports 75.90 at a_0; ALICE reports 77.40, etc. Also, the comparison might not be fair since majority of current methods adopt backbones like ResNet-12, 18, 20.

6.	Though author constructs two additional benchmark datasets for investigation of the effectiveness of FSCIL methods, as one important contribution, there is no explanation on the choice of two dataset, or comparisons between the proposed datasets and  previous benchmarks.

7.	In section 4.2, what does IMB mean? Why the performance margin between the base session and each incremental session can measure the bias towards the base session? Also, session average is commonly used metric in previous works, this cannot be included as an contribution.

8.	 In conclusion, “we propose a simple pipeline and introduce a set of novel session-level    metrics as well as new benchmark datasets for meticulous analysis and evaluation of robustness to the target distribution shift ”. I fail to see any related efforts on the evaluation of robustness to the target distribution shift, it seems irrelevant with the work of this paper.

### Summary
This paper addresses the problem of Few-Shot Class-Incremental Learning (FSCIL). FSCIL consists of two stages: a base session involving training on a large-scale base dataset and incremental sessions with a few-shot setting. The evaluation metric used in previous methods is the mean accuracy of all test samples, where performance is dominated by the base classes due to their larger number of test samples. The performance in the incremental sessions alone is much worse than in the base session. To mitigate this bias towards the base classes and balance the two learning stages, this paper proposes an investigation into the knowledge of pre-trained models and classifier types. A well-pre-trained model is utilized and kept frozen, along with an updating base model. Three types of classifiers are explored, and those demonstrating superior performance in both the base and incremental sessions are combined for further improvement. Additionally, new evaluation metrics are introduced to separately assess issues like forgetting and incremental performance. Two new benchmarks are also proposed.

### Strengths
- The dominance of base class accuracy as an evaluation metric for previous FSCIL methods is indeed unfair. The proposed evaluation metrics provide a more intuitive benchmark for evaluation.
- A baseline method can be significantly improved by simply utilizing and aggregating a frozen pretrained model.
- Combining various types of classifier heads has also been shown to be beneficial.

### Weaknesses
 - The overall method seems less novel: utilizing the frozen pre-trained backbone to improve the forgetting issue is not new (e.g., [1]). The runtime increases for inference, while [1] does not as the knowledge merging happens in the parameter space; aggregating the prediction from multiple classifiers is an ensemble operation.
- Regarding lightweight network (LN), catastrophic forgetting is overcoming by replay the samples from previous classes? Such process violates the setting of FSCIL, where accessing the data from multiple incremental sessions is prohibited. 
- What is the rationale behind choosing ALICE as the baseline model over other options? Is this choice based on heuristics or specific reasons? 
- In the CUB200 benchmark, if the settings remain consistent with those in other papers, why do the previous methods listed in Table 3 exhibit significantly lower performance, even on the base classes (a_0), compared to their reported results in their original papers?
- The comparison with prior methods may not be entirely fair, as all of them exclusively use ResNet-18 or ResNet-20, which have significantly fewer parameters compared to ResNet-50 or ViT. Is the observed performance boost primarily attributed to the larger number of parameters?
- An essential baseline is missing: Would fine-tuning the pre-trained model on the base classes and using it as a new "frozen pre-trained model" lead to an overall performance improvement? In the current method pipeline, it assumes that the pre-trained model possesses knowledge highly correlated with each dataset. However, this assumption may be vulnerable. 

Dataset:
- The two proposed benchmarks, Flower102 and DCC, may not be entirely suitable for FSCIL. The fundamental concept of FSCIL involves a large-scale dataset in the base session, which is reasonable for offline data collection and training. However, Flower102 and DCC have relatively small scales, with only 20 and 80 images per class for the base sessions, totaling 1200 and 5360 images, respectively. This can pose challenges for algorithm development, particularly as models grow larger. Additionally, the limited number of test images can result in significant evaluation variation

A missing prior work: Liu et al. "Few-Shot Class-Incremental Learning via Entropy-Regularized Data-Free Replay." ECCV 2022.

### Questions
- In Table 8, are the experiments conducted excluding the baseline model as in Fig. 2?
- Should “Flowers102” be replaced by “Flowers100” as only the first 100 classes are used?
