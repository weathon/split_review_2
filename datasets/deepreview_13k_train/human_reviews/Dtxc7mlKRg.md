## Abstract
Classification tasks where data contains skewed class proportions (aka {\em imbalanced data}) arises in many real-world applications including medical diagnosis. Safe deployment of classifiers for imbalanced data settings require theoretically-sound uncertainty quantification. Conformal prediction (CP) is a promising framework for producing prediction sets from black-box classifiers with a user-specified coverage (i.e., true class is contained with high probability). Existing class-conditional CP (CCP) method employs a black-box classifier to find one threshold for each class during calibration and then includes every class label that meets the corresponding threshold for testing inputs, leading to large prediction sets. This paper studies the problem of how to develop provable CP methods with small prediction sets for the class-conditional coverage setting and makes several contributions. First, we theoretically show that marginal CP can perform arbitrarily poorly and cannot provide coverage guarantee for minority classes. Second, we propose a principled algorithm referred to as {\em $k$-Class-conditional CP ($k$-CCP)}. The key idea behind $k$-CCP is to restrict the candidate labels for the prediction set of a testing input to only top-$k$ labels based on the classifier scores (in contrast to all labels in CCP). Third, we prove that $k$-CCP provides class-conditional coverage and produces smaller prediction sets over the CCP method. Our experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that $k$-CCP achieves class-conditional coverage and produces smaller prediction sets over baseline methods.

### Summary
The authors propose a method to construct prediction sets using conformal prediction and the top-k predictions of a classifier. More specifically they chose to include in the prediction sets labels that satisfy the following a) have a conformal score below an class conditional quantile for a higher coverage than the target one, and b) have a classifier score ranking below a chosen threshold.
The objective of the proposed method is to achieve class conditional coverage guarantees and smaller size of the prediction sets. The authors evaluate their method on several datasets against conformal prediction with marginal guarantees and class conditional conformal prediction.

### Strengths
Imbalanced datasets are a significant problem that can have catastrophic consequences in the performance of predictive ML models. In this context, studying the problem of conformal prediction and aiming at robust methods with rigorous coverage guarantees are of great interest.

The experimental evaluation is on several datasets assuming different scenarios on the class imbalance during training. 

The authors provide the code for reproducibility.

### Weaknesses
 **Significance**

“Our proposed k-CCP algorithm (summarized in Algorithm 2) avoids scanning all class labels y ∈ Y by leveraging good properties of the given classifier f in terms of its top-k accuracy.” One of the advantages of conformal guarantees is that they do not depend on the classifier used to compute the prediction sets. Assumptions on the classifier make the method no longer applicable as a post-hoc procedure working with a black-box ML model. In addition,  in realistic scenarios it  may be hard to make valid assumptions on the top-k  accuracy of the classifier. Moreover, if a classifier is trained using an imbalanced dataset, one should expect the accuracy of the classifier to be higher for majority classes, which does not necessarily guarantee good performance on the top-$k$ accuracy. The method's reliance on the classifier's top-k accuracy for efficiency, specifically for achieving smaller prediction sets, introduces a dependency that undermines the black-box nature of conformal prediction. This is a significant limitation, as the method's advantage is contingent on an assumption that may not hold in practice, especially with imbalanced datasets where top-k accuracy may be skewed towards majority classes.

The computation of $\hat{k}$ depends on the hyper parameter $g$. One would expect that tuning such a hyper parameter would add a data and computation overhead. The authors do not elaborate on this overhead neither on the process of selecting  the hyper parameter as well as the implications that this process can have. Furthermore, it is not clear if the proposed $\hat{k}$ will never be such that it violates the target coverage $1-\alpha$. A definition of $\hat{k}$ in theorem 1 as well as guarantees that the error terms in theorem 1 are small or can be small with high probability for that $\hat{k}$  could strengthen the contribution. The method's reliance on a hyperparameter $g$ introduces a tuning overhead, and the selection process is not clearly defined. The lack of theoretical guarantees that the chosen $\hat{k}$ will always satisfy the target coverage is a significant concern. The granularity of the search space for $g$ and the size of the label space $C$ can significantly impact the computational cost, a limitation that should be explicitly addressed. Furthermore, even if empirical results show that $\hat{k}$ satisfies coverage, theoretical guarantees are needed to ensure the method's robustness.

The results of theorem 2 strongly depend on the assumption (10). This assumption seems to depend on the probability distributions that may be hard to safely evaluate and verify in practice without a significant data overhead. It would be very useful to provide insights, or data efficient method with which one could check if (10) is satisfied. The practical verification of assumption (12) (which is (10) in the original review) requires estimating probabilities for each class, which demands sufficient data per class for reliable estimates. Moreover, ensuring that these estimates are simultaneously close to their true values across all classes necessitates a multiplicity correction, such as a union bound, which is not addressed. While empirical results may show that (12) holds, theoretical guarantees are needed to ensure that (12) can be safely verified using data-driven estimators, especially in scenarios with limited data per class.

**Novelty**

If the paper was the first attempt towards class conditional coverage, a failure analysis for the standard split conformal prediction algorithm, would make perhaps more sense. However, given that there are already other algorithms to address class conditional coverage, showing that MCP does not necessarily provide class-conditional guarantees does not seem as a strong motivation  for the current work.  Existing prior work [2] has already provide evidence that MCP does not satisfy class conditional guarantees. Besides MCP was never designed or claimed to achieve class conditional coverage.  

Given that in the experimental results k-CPP and CPP seem to perform very similarly in terms of conditional coverage, it seems that the main advantage of k-CPP is the reduced set size. However, there is no comparison with CPP using the RAPS method [1] that improves over APS. It would be also important to investigate (theoretically and/or experimentally) how the proposed method compares to other approaches with conditional guarantees such as [3], or other approaches to improve the size of the prediction sets [4]. Were there results on how the proposed approach advances over such works, would make the contribution much stronger.

**Presentation/clarity**

The entire manuscript gives the reader the impression that it was written in a rush as, typos, grammatical errors and poor sentence structure appear very frequently.  These make the work cumbersome to read. Moreover, there seems to be quite some room fro improvement in terms of clarity, flow and cohesion. For example:
*   In the abstract it is very unclear what the authors mean by “inflated coverage and calibrated rank thresholds”
*   In the introduction in the 3rd paragraph in the middle  “To answer the main research question,”  should follow right after the main research question for a nice flow
*   In the last paragraph before contributions the way the authors are presenting the differences is quite confusing. Instead of stating the methods followed by CCP and then listing the methods of k-CCP, it would have been clearer to compare the two approaches point by point.   
*  The three bullets in the contribution are hard to read. They lack of proper sentence structure, especially the lack of any articles make the reader struggling to follow. They look more like incomplete notes, than proper text.
*  The definition of the top-k error for a class $c$ is confusing. $\epsilon_c$ seems to depend both on the constants $c$ and $k$. Perhaps using $\epsilon_{c}^{k}$ could make the definition clearer. 
*  In page 5, in the definition of the top-k error it the random variable $Z$ is not defined. Also, in the same paragraph it is not clear what is the distinction between $\hat{k}(y)$ and $k(y)$. Also $\hat{k}(y)$ is not formally defined the first time that it is introduced, which is confusing.
*  It is not clear why $\sigma_{y}$ is necessary in (10), as the denominator cancels out. One could directly state the condition in (10) using just the nominator of $\sigma_{y}$.

In the experimental evaluation, in table 1 the results for the Food-101 datasets on the UCR are not highlighted for CPP method wherever it achieves the lowest UCR among the baselines.  
 
The under coverage indicator in the Under Coverage Ratio  assumes a fixed calibration set. However, conformal coverage guarantees on $1 - \alpha$ are in expectation over the calibration set and the test sample. As a result the UCR definition appears incorrect.

### Questions
1.In the definition of $\epsilon_{c}$ is the probability over the samples X and the classes Y? It might be helpful to clarify that in the problem definition. 

2. In eq. 1 the authors define their class-conditional coverage objective. This objective includes the coverage probability on a population level. However the authors do not specify if the probability  is both over the calibration set and the test set as it is for CP. It would be helpful to clearly state over what is the coverage probability in eq. 1
 
3. Below eq 3. “good non-conformity scoring functions”, this term is rather vague for non experts in conformal prediction. It would have been clear if the authors mention what is a good non-conformity scoring function, (e.g., one that results in small prediction sets). The comment applies for the next line “effective conformity score function”. It is unclear what is effective, and if by effective, again the authors mean, resulting in smaller prediction set size.

### Summary
The paper theoretically proves that Marginal Conformal Prediction can result in over- or under-coverage for classes in imbalanced data settings. To address this, the authors propose the k-Class-Conditional Conformal Prediction (k-CCP) approach, which integrates inflated coverage with a calibrated rank threshold, derived from the top-k error of the classifier for each class. Supported by both theoretical proofs and experiments on various datasets, the authors shows k-CCP outperforms CCP on average prediction set size.

### Strengths
- The paper addresses the issue of imbalanced data under the conformal prediction framework, and provides a feasible way of optimizing class-specific coverage while achieving shorter prediction intervals. Both theoretical proofs and empirical evidence support the efficacy of the proposed method.
- The k-CCP algorithm is a novel approach that combines the strengths of CCP with additional refinements to handle imbalanced data more effectively.
- Overall, the paper is well-written and consistent.

### Weaknesses
 - The purposed method heavily relies on the ranking of candidate class labels by the classifier, which could be a limitation if the classifier's ranking is not reliable.
- Chapter 3 appears somewhat redundant. Using an overall score for each class in conformal prediction (MCP) would lead to marginal coverage rather than class-specific coverage seems evident. Previous works by (Lei, 2014; Sadinle et al., 2019) studied overall coverage and class-specific coverage separately.
- The empirical results could benefit from further enhancement (see questions below).

### Questions
- In Theorem 2, could assumption (10) be too strong to achieve? It suggests that kCCP algorithm should lead to a coverage that is less than or equal to the CCP and achieve a shorter length as a trade-off. Also, could you elaborate on how this assumption was validated?

- I might have overlooked this detail, but how can we choose $k$ by hyper-parameter $g$ in general?

- The Average Prediction Set Size (APSS) you presented takes the average prediction length evenly for each class. I wonder if you can present the comparison of the overall average prediction lengths. I'm curious if we will have a larger set-valued prediction for the ''majority'' classes.

### Summary
The authors introduce a new approach, based on conformal prediction, to obtain prediction sets with a fixed set size in the setting of multiclass classification. While ordinary conformal prediction only gives control over the coverage of prediction sets by carefully choosing the significance level, this new method allows to choose the set size by selecting labels based on their rank statistics and appropriately modifying the significance level of the ordinary conformal predictor as to preserve the validity guarantee.

In a simple experiment they show how their method consistently outperforms standard marginal and class-conditional (Mondrian) conformal prediction on a selection of datasets for various class imbalance degrees.

### Strengths
•	The lack of efficiency guarantees in conformal prediction is a huge drawback for imbalanced data, the method introduced in this paper circumvents this problem.

•	Since the authors give an explicit procedure on how to modify the initial significance level, the method is almost as easy to implement as standard conformal prediction methods.

### Weaknesses
•	The notations are sometimes a bit convoluted, e.g. in Proposition 1. Moreover, the terminology is sometimes somewhat non-standard. CCP from the paper is often called Mondrian conformal prediction in the literature, and CCP itself is also used as an abbreviation for cross-conformal prediction. 

•	A few minor errors:
- Equation (6) hay label y on the left-hand side but uses c on the right-hand side.
- In the proof of Lemma 1, in the equation with the Chernoff bound, a factor n is missing in the expression in the middle.

•	Proposition 1 feels a bit overly complex. Although technically sound, the content should be straightforward. E.g. if the coverage of two classes should average to 0.9 and one is larger than that, the other is going to be lower. This has also been discussed in a recent paper by Ding et al. "Class-conditional conformal prediction with many classes", Neurips 2023. 

•	I cannot see what Theorem 2 contributes. The theorem more or less assumes that the new method is better (the sigma factors), so obviously it will be better on average.

### Summary
This paper proposes a method for achieving class conditional coverage for conformal prediction. This method uses the top-k error to form thresholds for each class for Conformal Prediction. They empirically demonstrate that the length of the sets generated by existing class conditional CP methods is suboptimal compared to the proposed methods' prediction sets.

I have updated my score to a 6 to reflect the answers in the rebuttal. With adding more baselines, I feel this paper would be an 8. The theoretical contributions are currently strong, and the empirical contributions are fair.

### Strengths
1. The investigation into the over-coverage and under coverage is a good addition to demonstrate the need for class conditional coverage methods to be generated. 
2. The intuition of using the top-k classes to remove spurious classes is quite a nice and intuitive idea. Moreover, besides the choice of baseline, the experimental setup seems well done.
3. The analysis for Class Conditional Coverage seems quite thorough.

### Weaknesses
 1. The abstract is inappropriately long. The in-depth descriptions of the contributions should be reserved for the introduction to improve readability. 
 2. The notation of the paper is slightly confusing. For example, you use $r_f(X, Y)$ at the beginning of Section 4.2, where $X, Y$ are datasets. However, earlier, you use $r_f(X_{n+1}, y)$ correspond to a specific datapoint $X_{n+1}, y$. Which is it? Moreover, one uses $\epsilon_y$ to denote the top-k error but $\epsilon_{n_y}$ to denote a general constant. Using $\epsilon$ for a general constant definition is not a great practice, in my opinion, and greatly complicates the reading.
 3. The computation of $\hat{k}(y)$ that achieves sufficiently small $\epsilon_{y}$ seems very difficult. Indeed, the equation provided to calculate this calibrated class value seems very computationally expensive to find. Moreover, it seems that the quality of the generated sets is highly dependent on $g$. I believe two additional explorations should be included in this work. The first is an ablation oon how different values of $g$ affect the generated length of the sets. If the prediction sets' quality is only strong for different $g$, which vary greatly between different hyperparameters, then doing a hyperparameter search for different $g$ for every individual dataset is very expensive. Comparing a method for which the hyperparameters have been extensively tuned to another algorithm for which this is not the case is not a fair empirical comparison. Moreover, a detailed section on the computability of the calibrated class is in order. It seems that you need to do a linear search over the calibrated dataset many times, which is far more expensive than traditional Split Conformal Prediction. A breakdown here would be nice. 
 4. The assumption in Theorem 2, i.e., equation 10, is a very strong assumption. More proper detail should go into detailing when this assumption holds and how. It seems to me that the heavy lifting of the proof of this theorem is done by this strong assumption. It is not clear to me when this assumption should hold. 
 5.  I am surprised there is only one baseline for CCP. I believe a vast array of methods for CCP should be compared. This could include the methods from ("Class-Conditional Conformal Prediction With Many Classes", "Classification with Valid and Adaptive Coverage", "Improving Conditional Coverage via Orthogonal
Quantile Regression", "A Gentle Introduction to Conformal Prediction and Distribution-Free Uncertainty Quantification"). There is a vast array of CCP works, and comparing to the most basic method is insufficient, in my opinion.

### Questions
1. This notion of class conditional coverage is strictly weaker than the traditional conditional coverage often discussed in literature. Do existing conditional coverage methods such as those mentioned in "A Gentle Introduction to Conformal Prediction and
Distribution-free uncertainty Quantification" achieves suboptimal set length compared to this weaker notion of conditional coverage.
2. If the nominated coverage $\tilde{\alpha}$ is larger than $\alpha$, then why are the generated sets shorter? This is not immediately clear to me. Is it because this allows for the use of only the top-k classes, which shortens the intervals? 
3. In the experiments, how were the hyperparameters chosen? I don't see where values such as $g$ were chosen. Were the hyperparameters for the baselines chosen in a similar manner to that of the proposed method?
4. Do existing works guarantee that their method of CCP outperforms the naive CCP method in terms of the size of the prediction set, or is this unique to this work?

### Summary
This paper is motivated by multiclass imbalanced classification, where some classes are very rare. Often, classifiers optimizing for accuracy or similar metrics do not predict such classes ever. This paper proposes k-Class-Conditional Conformal Prediction (k-CCP). The main idea is to modify Class-Conformal Prediction by only considering the top k classes from the classifier. The main goal is to ensure that the prediction set is not too large. Theoretical and numerical results are provided.

### Strengths
* The paper provides three discrete contributions: (1) a theorem that standard conformal prediction (here, marginal conformal prediction), is insufficient for class conformal prediction (CCP), (2) the k-CCP algorithm, and (3) a theoretical analysis of k-CCP.
* The paper is fairly clear.

### Weaknesses
 * The value of the k-CCP contribution over CCP is unclear. It seems relatively modest to restrict to the top-k classes. The modification to CCP by only considering the top k classes appears to be a minor adjustment, and the paper doesn't adequately justify why this is a significant contribution. The core idea of focusing on the top-k predicted classes seems like a heuristic without strong theoretical grounding, and the paper doesn't convincingly argue why this approach is superior to simply using CCP with a more refined nonconformity score.
* Additionally, the importance of Theorem 2 and the numerical results are unclear to me. For the theorem, the condition is fairly unintuitive. The condition involving \(\sigma_y\) in Theorem 2 lacks clear motivation and its practical implications are not well-explained. It's not immediately obvious why this particular condition is crucial for the performance of k-CCP. For the numerical results, e.g., Table 1, I'm not sure that setting the UCR of k-CCP and CCP to be the same necessarily leads to a fair comparison. It seems like the comparison is forced by tuning the UCR to be the same, rather than showing that k-CCP provides a better trade-off between coverage and set size. The evaluation seems to artificially constrain the comparison by forcing equal UCR, which might not reflect the true behavior of the methods. At some point, it seems like you have to trade off class conditioned coverage and prediction set size.


### Questions
* A concrete real-world example would be better. Most of the experiments are on vision, but the only application mentioned in the abstract and introduction are general references to medical diagnoses.
* A concrete example instead of or combined with Proposition 1 would help. Intuitively, it seems like conformal prediction with imbalanced classes would suffer the same problems as accuracy optimization--the classes that have few samples in training/calibration data are unlikely to be predicted. It seems like a more intuitive example could be provided.
* The algorithms could be written out more clearly without referencing theorems, remarks, and equations in the main text.
* There are some typos ("pupulation" p. 3, "K" for the number of classes p. 6).
