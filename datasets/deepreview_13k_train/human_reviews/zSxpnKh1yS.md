- Decision: Accept
- Scores: 8, 8, 6, 8

## Abstract
Unsupervised reinforcement learning (URL) aims to learn general skills for unseen downstream tasks. Mutual Information Skill Learning (MISL) addresses URL by maximizing the mutual information between states and skills but lacks sufficient theoretical analysis, e.g., how well its learned skills can initialize a downstream task's policy. Our new theoretical analysis shows that the diversity and separatability of learned skills are fundamentally critical to downstream task adaptation but MISL does not necessarily guarantee them. To improve MISL, we propose a novel disentanglement metric LSEPIN and build an information-geometric connection between LSEPIN and downstream task adaptation cost. For better geometric properties, we investigate a new strategy that replaces the KL divergence in information geometry with Wasserstein distance. We extend the geometric analysis to it, which leads to a novel skill-learning objective WSEP. It is theoretically justified to be helpful to task adaptation and it is capable of discovering more initial policies for downstream tasks than MISL. We further propose a Wasserstein distance-based algorithm PWSEP can theoretically discover all potentially optimal initial policies.

### Summary
This paper analyzes unsupervised skill-learning through a rigorous mathematical lens, focusing on the properties of the learned skills and their usefulness for downstream tasks. Most existing works use mutual information as the skill-learning objective and Eysenbach et al. (2022) provides a mathematical analysis of the same. This work analyzes the mutual information-based skill learning paradigm with a focus on downstream task adaptability via worst-case adaptation cost. This work also introduces a complementary metric called LSEPIN to measure diversity of learned skills. The authors show that maximizing MI or LSEPIN is essentially optimizing the KL divergence between state distributions. As an alternative, they suggest using the Wasserstein metric owing to it being a proper metric, and propose a new skill learning objectives built upon Wasserstein distance.

### Strengths
There is a long line of work on unsupervised skill learning based on mutual information maximization between states and skills, most of the work being motivated by intuition and empirical performance. This work complements Eysenbach et al. (2022) by providing a rigorous understanding of the properties of the learned skills and provides useful insights. The analysis presented in this work is novel, to the best of my knowledge and comprises a fairly significant advancement of our understanding of this sub-area of RL. The quality of analysis and writing is satisfactory, with sufficient background and context provided before explaining the main results of the paper.

### Weaknesses
This is a fairly strong submission which checks all the boxes. The only minor complaint is that the empirical results in Appendix H should ideally be a part of the main paper, since including them makes the submission more well-rounded and gives empirical validation for the results presented in Section 3.

### Summary
The paper provides a theoretical analysis of learning skills using unsupervised reinforcement learning (URL), which serves as an initialization for learning a policy for a downstream task. The paper shows that Mutual Information Skill Learning (MISL) does not guarantee diversity and separability of learned skills, and proposes to replace the uniform distribution of skills objective with the Least SEParability and INformativeness (LSEPIN) metric to promote informativeness and separability. Moreover, the paper proposes to replace the KL divergence in MISL with Wasserstein distance that exploits better geometric properties. Finally, it proposes another Wasserstein distance-based algorithm (PWSEP) that can theoretically discover all optimal initial policies.

The authors show theoretically that LSEPIN bounds the Worst-case Adaptation Cost (WAC) and show that the Wasserstein distance has better geometrical properties (such as symmetry and triangle inequality) that leads to better skill separation. In addition, the authors provide experiments to validate the proposed theoretical results in the appendix.

### Strengths
The paper investigates an important topic and provides a rigorous analysis of the proposed ideas. In addition, it proposes a practical algorithm that was tested empirically and demonstrates superior results compared to existing MISL methods.

### Weaknesses
The paper is hard to read and follow, with lots of details.

Since most of the contribution of the paper is placed in the appendix, including all experimental results, it is hard to understand and assess its contribution without reading carefully the appendix.

### Questions
I would like to ask the following questions:

1. Is it possible to rigorously prove that adding a loss that promotes uniform p(Z_input) to objective (1) does not promote any diversity? Or promotes less diversity than the LSEPIN loss in all cases?

2. Is there a measure for adaptation other than Worst-case Adaptation Cost?

3. Is there any advantage to the KL divergence over the Wasserstein distance? theoretically or computationally?

4. What are the limitations of the PWSEP algorithms (specifically the WSEP objective)?

### Summary
This paper studies the geometry of state distributions learned with mutual information skill learning for the purpose of theoretical task adaptation analysis. The authors propose Least SEParability and INformativeness (LSEPIN) to measure the diversity and separability and show a relationship with worst-case adaptation cost (WAC). The authors theoretically prove the relationship between the optimization of LSEPIN and Similarly, the authors also propose Wasserstein based distance metric WSEP which is more suitable in symmetric polytope to measure the separability of skill. Similar to LSEPIN and WAC, the relationship between WSEP and Mean Adaptation Cost is studied.

### Strengths
* The geometry perspective of task adaptation is interesting.
* Studies on the geometry is promising and can motivate readers.
* The theoretical results are well justified.

### Weaknesses
 * Some Definitions of words are not defined well (diversity and separability).
* The flow of the paper is weakly organized and hurts readability (the first topic is LSEPIN and the second WSEP.) The paper have no discuss on other perspectives.
* The findings from the theoretical derivation are not surprising. WAC and adaptation cost.
* Most contents have high dependency with appendix. Although the authors studied various components, they are not well organized.
* The metric LSEPIN, which measures the least separable skill, may be problematic. An abundance of skills with high overlap could skew the calculation, and the paper does not adequately address how to ensure all skill codes are meaningful in the computation of LSEPIN.
* The worst-case adaptation cost (WAC) is measured with the worst state distribution. It is unclear why measuring the worst-case adaptation is meaningful or practical. Skill adaptation is typically applied to state distributions similar to the target skill's distribution, making the $\max_p$ part of WAC less persuasive. The paper does not sufficiently justify the need to consider the absolute worst-case scenario, rather than a more realistic adaptation scenario.
* The necessity of symmetry and triangle inequality for the Wasserstein distance is not well explained in the main paper, making it difficult to understand their importance in the context of the proposed WSEP metric. The paper should provide more intuition on why these properties are crucial for measuring skill separability.
* The limitations of WSEP are not clearly discussed. The paper should address the practical challenges and theoretical limitations of using Wasserstein distance for measuring skill separability, especially in high-dimensional state spaces.

### Questions
* Here are questions that we want to discuss with the authors.
* We might incorrectly understand the contribution of this work. Why the theoretical derivation of Theorem 3.1 is important for a task adaptation?
    * What can we additionally learn from the theorem 3.1 or how can we use the theorem for other task adaptation works? For my understanding, the relationship: increasing LSEPIN results in lower WAC.
    * Why measuring $\min_z I(S;z)$ can be used to measure diversity and separability? I guess two features should be computed among skills, but the $\min_z I(S;z)$ is just a mutual information for a single code.
    * In LSEPIN, the metric measures the least skill code. I guess an abundant skill code may hurt the calculation. Isn't it problematic? How could you ensure that all the codes are meaningful in the computation of LSEPIN?
    * WAC is measured with the worst state distribution. how this could be meaningful and practical? That is, why we need to measure the worst case adaptation? To the best of my knowledge,  skill adaptation is applied to the state distributions which are similar to the state distribution for the target skill. Therefore, the importance of $\max_p$ part in WAC is not persuasive.
    * Could you please additionally describe the necessity of symmetry and triangle inequality?
    * What is the limitation of WSEP?
    * Could this study can be combined with in-distribution and out-distribution perspective of task adaptations?

[Overall]
Although the authors conducted several theoretical derivations and analysis, the choice of metrics and the relationship between them have little meaning. Mostly because the task adaptation is might assume close state distribution $p$ for a skill $p(s|z)$. However, the authors study the worst-case adaptation. Additionally, the organization of the paper is not well constructed and hard to follow.*

### Summary
This work targets on the Information Geometry in unsupervised Reinforcement Learning, especially Mutual Information Skill Learning (MISL). On the basis of previous work, this work first considers the diversity and separability of learned skills. As MISL can not guarantee these properties, this work proposes LSEPIN to measure the disentanglement, and then shows the connection between LSEPIN and downstream task adaptation cost. Moreover, this work investigates the information geometry of Wasserstein distance based skill learning methods. Finally, this work proposes PWSEP and theoretically shows that it can discover all optimal initial policies.

### Strengths
- Definitely an important problem to be tackling! Previous work[1] has established the connection between skill-based unsupervised RL and information geometry. [1] has shown that KL-based metric can only find skills with the ''largest radius'' and how to find all vertices of the skill polytope is still an open challenge. This work has elegantly solved this challenge and I believe it will be of interest to researchers of Unsupervised RL.

- The description of the article is very clear, and the introduction to related work is very specific.

- I have basically read all the proofs of the theorems, which are well-written.

Thanks to the authors for putting in the effort in doing this work!

### Weaknesses
Overall, I think this paper is well written and its contribution is solid. I do not find clear weaknesses but I still have some questions (see Questions). I will adjust my score accordingly based on the author's response and other reviewers' comments.

- This paper claims that "it is possible for WSEP to discover all vertices of the feasible polytope". As the theoretical results can only show that all learned skills satisfy $p(z) > 0$ rather than WSEP can learn all $p(z) > 0$ skills, there is no direct evidence to suggest that WSEP can indeed find more skills than MISL (i.e., skills without maximum “distances”). Can authors show that WSEP can find more skills or even all skills? I think empirical results or theoretical results even in simple cases will be really helpful.

- All experiments are provided in the Appendix. It seems that providing the main experiments and analyses in the main text can help the readers to better understand this work.

- What will happen if we change the W-distance to other distance metrics in PWSEP(i)? In my opinion, it seems that the proof of Thm 3.5 holds for any distance metric (owns Non-negativity, Symmetry, and Triangular Inequalities). Is it right? Or are there some special properties of W-distance necessary for proving Thm 3.5?

- It's better to provide some proof sketch of theorems in the main text, like Thm 3.5.
