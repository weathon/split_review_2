- Decision: Reject
- Scores: 5, 8, 3, 3, 5

## Abstract
Mixed Integer Linear Program (MILP) solvers are mostly built upon a branch-and-bound (B\&B) algorithm, where the efficiency of traditional solvers heavily depends on hand-craft heuristics for branching.  Such a dependency significantly limits the success of those solvers because such heuristics are often difficult to obtain, and not easy to generalize across domains/problems.  
Recent deep learning approaches aim to automatically learn the branching strategies in a data-driven manner, which removes the dependency on hand-crafted heuristics but introduces a dependency on the availability of high-quality training data. Obtaining the training data that demonstrates near-optimal branching strategies can be a difficult task itself, especially for large problems where accurate solvers have a hard time scaling and producing near-optimal demonstrations.  This paper overcomes this obstacle by proposing a new offline reinforcement learning (RL) approach, namely the \textit{Ranking-Constrained Actor-Critic} algorithm, which can efficiently learn good branching strategies from sub-optimal or inadequate training signals. Our experiments show its advanced performance in both prediction accuracy and computational efficiency over previous methods for different types of MILP problems on multiple evaluation benchmarks.

### Summary
The authors propose an offline Reinforcement Learning (RL) framework for learning to branch (L2B) which reportedly exhibits superior performance with a sub-optimal dataset compared to existing methods that require extensive, high-quality datasets. This advantage is particularly notable in reducing the time to collect datasets for training the models. The reported performance on the MIP instances also indicates the effectiveness of the framework.

### Strengths
1. **Innovative Formulation:** The novel formulation of L2B as an Offline RL approach using a sub-optimal dataset is a significant departure from traditional methods.
2. **Efficiency in Data Collection:** The framework requires significantly less time to collect its dataset, enhancing its practicality.
3. **Performance:** The proposed framework improved performance compared to the GGCN framework on smaller dataset sizes, which is commendable.

### Weaknesses
Despite the novelty of the work, I have reservations about the robustness of its results. These concerns are expanded upon in this section and further detailed in the questions that follow. 

1. **Lack of Scaling-Generalization Results:** A key aim of collecting datasets on smaller instances is to develop policies that excel on larger, more complex instances. It would be beneficial to see how various models perform on scaled-up versions of instances in various problem categories like SC, MIS, CA, or CFL. How do these policies perform on Medium or Hard instances (scaled-up versions) in SC, MIS, CA, or CFL? Does RCAC retain its performance advantage on scaling up to larger instances?

2. **Insufficient Comparison with Existing Methods:** 
- The paper lacks a thorough comparison with recent advancements in the GGCN framework, particularly the augmented loss function introduced in "Lookback for Learning to Branch" (Gupta et al. 2022, https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.14987). It would be insightful to see how RCAC compares to this improved GGCN variant. 
 - If I understand correctly, RCAC (S) and GGCN (S) primarily differ in their approach to training despite similarities in other aspects, such as dataset collection. Specifically, GGCN (S) employs a Cross-Entropy loss function, while RCAC (S) is focused on learning a Q-function (and a corresponding policy). The distinctiveness of the RCAC framework lies in its utilization of rewards instead of directly using FSB selections, as is the case with GGCN. However, an alternative comparison could involve integrating rewards into the GGCN framework as an additional signal. This could be achieved, for instance, by employing rewards to modulate the Cross-Entropy loss at each node, similar to how node depth might be used. Demonstrating RCAC's superior performance in this modified context would further reinforce the effectiveness of its RL-based approach as formulated in the study. 
    - It would be valuable to have the values of \( k \) specified for each model. I am particularly curious to know whether \( k > 1 \) for RCAC(S).
- Comparisons with other RL methods, especially in terms of dataset size and time efficiency, would also be valuable.

### Questions
Clarifications:

1. **Section 3.3:** Should "representation of the B&B tree" be replaced with "representation of the B&B node" for accuracy? 
2. **Training Dataset for GGCN (H) and RCAC (H):** Are these models trained on the same dataset? Is GGCN (H) trained on a separate dataset collected as specified in the Appendix?
3. **VHB Dataset Transitions:** Could the authors clarify what constitutes a 'transition' in this context? Does the transition include (s,a,s’) even when FSB is not employed in VHB, which is 0.05 times? Do you discard any transition? How is it ensured that you explore a wide array of instances before 100K transitions are collected?
4. **S Method Training:** Is the S method trained with only 5K transitions? 
5. **Reward Distribution:** Could the authors provide details on the distribution of reward values in the dataset, perhaps in the Appendix? Information on how this varies with tree depth and how normalization is handled would be valuable.
6. **Figure 3 Clarity:** What is the specific problem family represented in Figure 3?
7. **Practicality of H dataset collection:** Given that VHB takes longer than FSB (as indicated in column 2), is it still a practical choice since the performance is worse than S?
8. **GGCN Expansion:** Could the authors clarify the abbreviation GGCN? It seems to be a variation of GCNN (Graph Convolutional Neural Networks) as used in Gasse et al. 2019.
9. **Inference Procedure in RCAC:** Are there two forward passes $G_\omega\$ and $\pi_\phi$ during inference in RCAC? How does this differ from the inference process in GGCN?
10. **Hyperparameter \(k\):** Figure 3 suggests that \(k\) has a significant impact on RCAC's performance. Could the authors provide the \(k\) values used for each model and dataset?

11. **Aggregation in Table 4:** How are scores aggregated across 20 instances in Table 4? Assuming this is a cumulative sum, RCAC appears to outperform in WA but not against RPB in AP. Can the authors speculate on which problem types might be more amenable to improvement by RCAC?

12. **Reward Ablation:** Could the authors discuss the rationale behind choosing dual bound improvement over primal-dual gap improvement? Understanding the preference for one metric over the other would be enlightening.


Suggestions:
1. **Dataset Comparison:** I think it will be pretty helpful to have a section or a figure demonstrating the difference (transition vs. individual nodes) between the dataset collected using the standard IL methods and the one proposed in this work. 
2. **Statistical Significance:** Please include p-values to indicate the statistical significance of differences in Tables 2 and 3.
3. **Evaluation Methodology:** Given that 20 seems a relatively small sample size for testing, it's common practice to evaluate each instance with multiple seeds, as demonstrated in Gasse et al. 2019. Could the authors clarify whether a similar approach can be employed in their study?

### Summary
The paper considers the problem of learning to select branching strategies while solving mixed integer programs via branch and bound algorithm. The key idea is to collect offline training dataset using full strong branching as behavior policy and learn an offline RL algorithm to generate the learned branching policy. Improvement of the dual bound is chosen as the reward function. Experiments are performed on four synthetic and two real world problems.

### Strengths
- Using offline RL for branching policies seems like a natural idea that should do better than pure imitation learning. I am surprised that this wasn't tried earlier and commend the paper for making this simple but natural idea work well. 

- The description of the problem and solution is written clearly and easy to understand.

- The proposed approach performs well on multiple benchmarks.

### Weaknesses
 - A large part of the paper talks about sub-optimality of the FSB policy. For example, this statement "Although FSB generally achieves high-quality branching, it could still become sub-optimal when the linear programming relaxation is uninformative or there exists dual degeneracy" Is there more justified argument for this backed by some evidence?

- why choose the proposed algorithm over any existing offline RL algorithm like CQL[1], IQL etc.?


### Questions
- What are connections of equation 6 to reward weighed regression?

### Summary
This work proposes the usage of offline reinforcement learning for variable selection in the branch-and-bound algorithm. To do so, they introduce a novel offline algorithm that uses a classifier to determine whether a state-action pair is in the offline dataset. Their offline Q-values are now restricted towards picking only the top-k most likely actions for each state.

### Strengths
The usage of offline reinforcement learning seems more fitting than current imitation learning algorithms due to its lack of reliance on high quality demonstrations.

### Weaknesses
 - The paper is a little unclear at some points. For instance, in the last paragraph of Section 2.2: Which variables are the selected ones? Just from the node chosen by the node selection policy, or all variables across the entire tree? In general, the distinction between node selection and variable selection doesn’t become clear: Does the method also do node selection (by picking variables from the entire tree), or just variable selection?
- Further, it is not exactly clear whether there is a single model trained and evaluated on all instances, or multiple independent models trained on and evaluated on individual datasets.
- One missing benchmark is the utilization of an off-the-shelf offline RL algorithm, such as conservative Q-learning as a baseline for the specific utility of RCAC over more established offline-RL algorithms (I.e. is the improvement in performance due to offline-RL or RCAC specifically?).
- The testing set is also rather small: 10k training instances, 2k validation instances and, 20 test instances is a strange ratio.
- The reward function is also a little bit strange: Why consider the dual bound, but ignore the primal one completely? Further, these bounds are not scale-invariant, meaning that the same problem, modulo a constant scalar, could have different dual bound improvements. Even if one takes care to normalize the objective vector c beforehand, most solvers like SCIP rescale this vector for increased numerical stability. Depending on which problems are chosen, the range of rewards across different instances might also be massive depending on the duality gap. However, we agree with the authors that this metric is still better than tree-size or number of nodes.

Some minor points:
- Abstract: hand-craft[ed]
- Intro: The sentence “All of these models are trained…” needs a re-write
- Intro: “To our knowledge, … to apply offline RL to MILP solving” (re-write)
- Sec. 2: typo pseudocsot
- Sec. 2.2. A[n] MDP
- Equation 4: one closing brace is too much (after $Q_\theta$)
- Sec. 3.1: when a[n] MILP instance
- Sec 3.1: discounted factor $\rightarrow$ discount factor
- Sec 3.3: citation of Gasse et al.: use cite instead of citep; same again happened in Sec. 4.1
- Sec. 4.1: please use cite and citep depending on how you add these citations into the text
- Sec. 5.2 does not add any benefit to the paper and can be omitted in its current state

### Questions
- Which set of variables if being selected from?
- What is the performance of other offline-RL algorithms?
- Can you evaluate on a larger testset?
- Why only look at the dual bound improvement (alternative: optimality gap between primal and dual)?
- In Sec 3.2. “In fact, a good action does no harm to policy optimization even if it is an OOD action” – can you please elaborate on this a bit more?

### Summary
This paper presents the Ranking-Constrained Actor-Critic algorithm, an offline reinforcement learning approach for optimizing Mixed Integer Linear Programs (MILPs). Traditional MILP solvers depend on hand-crafted heuristics for branching, limiting their efficiency and generalizability. Recent deep learning methods rely on high-quality training data, which can be scarce, particularly for large problems. The key contributions of the paper are the development of the new RL algorithm and its ability to efficiently learn branching strategies even from sub-optimal training data. The algorithm outperforms previous methods in terms of prediction accuracy and computational efficiency across various MILP problems, addressing the limitations of traditional solvers.

### Strengths
This paper claims to be innovative by being the first to apply offline reinforcement learning algorithms in branch-and-bound methods. Furthermore, the essence of the proposed method lies in further refining the dataset, specifically selecting the top-k actions in the set Gω for Bellman operator operations. This can effectively enhance the performance of the branching strategy. I believe this perspective can also be inspiring for similar problems in other domains.

### Weaknesses
This paper proposes training branch-and-bound strategies using offline reinforcement learning. However, in practice, interacting with solvers is relatively straightforward, and under these circumstances, using online reinforcement learning may yield better performance. The authors need to clarify the necessity of utilizing offline reinforcement learning.

This paper claims to be innovative by being the first to apply offline reinforcement learning algorithms in branch-and-bound methods. Furthermore, the essence of the proposed method lies in further refining the dataset, specifically selecting the top-k actions in the set Gω for Bellman operator operations. This can effectively enhance the performance of the branching strategy. I believe this perspective can also be inspiring for similar problems in other domains. However, the paper does not adequately explore the potential of imitation learning on the refined dataset. Specifically, if the top-k actions from Gω are indeed the key to performance, then a simple imitation learning approach on these state-action pairs might achieve similar results, suggesting that the benefit comes from dataset refinement rather than the offline RL method itself. This needs further investigation.

### Questions
•	Considering that interacting with solvers online is convenient, is there a necessity to use offline reinforcement learning to train branch-and-bound strategies?
•	In Equation 7, when k is small, the distribution of Q-values over the dataset will be centered around -δ, which is unfavorable for training. How do the authors ensure training effectiveness in this scenario?
•	I believe that the essence of the method proposed by the authors lies in further refining the dataset, specifically selecting the top-k actions in Gω for Bellman operator operations. I am curious to know if, after obtaining the top-k actions in Gω, simple imitation learning on these state-action pairs would yield similar results as the current approach. In other words, my question is whether the key to the effectiveness of this algorithm lies in the dataset refinement rather than offline reinforcement learning. I suggest that the authors conduct further ablation experiments to validate this idea.
