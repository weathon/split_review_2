# Training Neural Networks from Scratch with Parallel Low-Rank Adapters

- Decision: Reject
- Scores: 3, 6, 5, 3

## Abstract
The scalability of deep learning models is fundamentally limited by computing resources, memory, and communication. Although methods like low-rank adaptation (LoRA) have reduced the cost of model finetuning, its application in model pre-training remains largely unexplored. This paper explores extending LoRA to model pre-training, identifying the inherent constraints and limitations of standard LoRA in this context. We introduce \textit{LoRA-the-Explorer} (LTE), a novel bi-level optimization algorithm designed to enable parallel training of multiple low-rank heads across computing nodes, thereby reducing the need for frequent synchronization. Our approach includes extensive experimentation on vision transformers using various vision datasets, demonstrating that LTE is competitive with standard pre-training.

### Summary
The paper introduces the use of LoRA for pretraining in the context of neural networks. LoRA, originally designed to approximate weight updates as a matrix by decomposing it into two low-rank matrices, is typically employed after the initial pretraining phase. In this paper, a novel approach is proposed wherein the update matrix is represented as a mixture of low-rank matrices referred to as "heads." These heads collectively approximate the updates to the original weight matrix. Interestingly, various workers operating on potentially distinct GPUs compute updates to the LoRA matrices, and these updates are eventually used to update the original weight matrix after several iterations. This innovative method seeks to improve the pretraining process in neural network training.

### Strengths
***Federated Learning-Inspired Approach*** - The paper introduces a novel algorithm aimed at updating the initial parameters following the independent training of parallel LoRAs for several iterations.

***Innovative Concept*** - The concept introduced is quite refreshing, departing from the conventional practice of directly updating the original parameters and instead approximating them from a combination of low-rank matrices. This approach bears similarities to the concept of a "mixture of experts," as explored in other research papers such as "AdaMix: Mixture-of-Adaptations for Parameter-efficient Model Tuning." Notably, the authors apply this method to the pretraining phase, in contrast to the more common practice of fine-tuning the model

### Weaknesses
 ***Insufficient Experimentation*** - The paper lacks comprehensive experimentation, as it fails to include a comparison with competing methods or an initial set of experiments to validate the effectiveness of their proposed approach. For instance, the absence of comparisons to full fine-tuning or the use of a single LoRA with a pre-trained model in a conventional context is notable. The inclusion of more experiments would significantly enhance the paper's credibility. Specifically, the paper does not sufficiently explore the parameter space of the LoRA rank and the number of heads, which are critical to the performance of the proposed method. It is not clear if the chosen values are optimal, and a sensitivity analysis is needed to demonstrate the robustness of the method across different configurations. Furthermore, the experiments do not include ablation studies to isolate the impact of various design choices, such as the frequency of merging LoRA weights or the specific initialization of the LoRA matrices. Without these, it is difficult to ascertain the true source of performance gains or losses.

***Lack of Elaboration*** - The paper also suffers from a lack of necessary details. Crucial information regarding the dataset employed in the experiments is conspicuously absent. Furthermore, the figures provided do not effectively convey substantial information. To address this issue, a solution might be to relocate Figures 2 and 3 to an appendix, thereby creating additional space for a more detailed explanation. The paper also does not provide sufficient detail on the optimization process, such as the learning rate, batch size, and optimizer used for training the LoRA heads. This lack of detail makes it difficult to reproduce the results and assess the method's practical applicability. It is also unclear how the gradients are handled across different LoRA heads during the training process. The paper should clarify whether they are aggregated or treated independently.

***Enhanced Clarity in Writing*** - The motivation behind incorporating LoRA during the pre-training phase remains unclear throughout the paper. The initial paragraphs fail to provide a concise introduction to the fundamental concepts explored in the paper, exemplified by the use of the term "LoRA head" in the introduction without prior definition. Additionally, the authors' use of "merging" to describe the combination of LoRA weights with W during training is not adequately clarified until a reader has delved deep into the paper. Improving these aspects would enhance the overall clarity of the paper. The paper also lacks a clear explanation of how the proposed method addresses the limitations of existing pre-training techniques. It would be beneficial to explicitly state the specific problems that the method aims to solve and how it achieves this. The introduction should also discuss the trade-offs of using LoRA for pre-training, including potential limitations in terms of expressiveness and generalization.

### Questions
- ***Synchronization of Updated Weights*** - You mention that the original model's weights are updated by merging LoRA weights after several iterations. However, it's not clear whether this updated information is effectively communicated to all the workers involved in the process.
- ***Clarification of Experimental Particulars*** - The paper lacks critical information regarding the dataset used for training the models. The absence of details concerning the dataset used in the experiments is a notable gap in the presentation.
- ***Consideration of Alternative Datasets*** - While the authors mention testing their methods on the Imagenet dataset, it would be beneficial to understand whether they have considered using other datasets for comparison and analysis.
- ***Interpreting Figure 1*** - Figure 1 appears to suggest that only the LoRA matrices are updated without any mention of a "merging" process. This leaves room for confusion, as it might imply that the original weight matrix W is randomly initialized, potentially impacting training stability. It would be valuable to clarify whether this is indeed the case.

### Confidence
3: You are fairly confident in your assessment. It is possible that you did not understand some parts of the submission or that you are unfamiliar with some pieces of related work. Math/other details were not carefully checked.

### Summary
The paper extends the application of low-rank adapters from the domain of fine-tuning to model pre-training. The central innovation is the employment of a linear combination of low-rank adapters used in parallel for training models from scratch. The idea has the potential of enabling memory-efficient and communication-efficient model pre-training.

### Strengths
1. The paper delves into an underexplored area by investigating the potential of parallel low-rank updates for memory-efficient and communication-efficient model pre-training. This is highly relevant in the context of contemporary computational constraints.

2. The introduction of multi-head low-rank adapters that integrate into model parameters constitutes a novel contribution to the field. This idea could generalize to multiple training paradigms, thereby adding considerable value to existing research.

### Weaknesses
1. The paper acknowledges its own limitation as a proof-of-concept work. Although the idea is compelling, there is insufficient evidence to support its feasibility for large models or complex tasks.

2. The manuscript would benefit from an in-depth theoretical analysis that substantiates the proposed approach, thereby addressing its current shortcomings.

### Questions
While the extension of Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to model pre-training is undoubtedly an interesting avenue, the paper does not convincingly address the efficacy of using a combination of low-rank adapters in this context. More empirical and theoretical work are needed to validate this approach.

While the impact on resource utilization is stated, quantifying or benchmarking the reduction in memory or communication data usage would be beneficial.

### Summary
The paper explores the extension of Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA, Hu et al., 2021) for pre-training deep learning models. The authors propose LoRA-the-Explorer (LTE) that facilitates parallel low-rank updates/heads via infrequent synchronization across multiple compute nodes. LTE bridges the performance gap induced by a single LoRA head and recovers the standard model training from scratch. The experiments are conducted for Vision Transformer models using ImageNet100 to demonstrate the competitiveness of the proposed LTE with standard Distributed Data-Parallel (DDP) on 8 GPUs. At the cost of an additional 40% longer training time, LTE with 32 parallel LoRA heads (rank =64) converges to the same top-1 accuracy for ViT-S model.

### Strengths
This work boldly attempts to leverage the highly popular low-rank fine-tuning method (LoRA) for pre-training models from scratch. The paper carefully studies the performance degradation by drop-in LoRA, acknowledges the limitations, and offers future opportunities for the community to explore this line of research. The central idea of the proposed work is to approximate full-rank weight as a linear combination of low-rank weights, termed multi-head LoRA (MHLoRA). Section 3.1 is easy to understand and shows that single-head LoRA is equivalent to merging the multi-head LoRA at every iteration (tight synchronization). To alleviate this bottleneck of frequent synchronizations, authors propose periodic merging.

### Weaknesses
1. It will be worthwhile to examine, compare, and contrast a parallel body of work ReLoRA (Stack More Layers Differently: High-Rank Training Through Low-Rank Updates, Lialin et al., arXiv, July 2023) that presents a similar core idea.

2. Section 1 presentation can be further improved. The main findings and contributions in the middle seem to break the flow and could be considered a closing paragraph. Moreover, some of the items in these findings are the organization of the paper (eg, the last point on related work). It would be helpful to condense and limit it to highlight the key contributions and novelty of the work.

3. The key takeaways of the work are in the experiment sections. It would be helpful to highlight those and map them to theoretical insights.

4. The use of deep learning/neural networks in the title and body must be carefully examined as it may be misleading in its current form. The technique is presented for Transformer models, specifically ViTs. The authors should consider using ViTs instead to align the readers' expectations to the presented work.

5. It would be helpful to illustrate the parallelism and mapping to compute nodes in the proposed technique:
 parallel low-rank adapters corresponding to multi-head LoRA (MHLoRA) and multiple heads in Transformer models that allow natural parallelism.

6. The Figure captions should specify the model (ViT-S?) being used.

### Summary
The paper introduces Lora-The-Explorer (LTE) a parallel low-rank training algorithm for multiple attention heads. The authors' main finding is that frequent synchronization, e.g. every batch, is unnecessary for effective training. Instead, stale gradients may be used effectively reducing the communication overhead. In an experimental evaluation the authors study the impact of number of heads, rank and synchronization delays on a Vision Transformer and ImageNet dataset. They observe that the overall number of necessary training iterations until convergence increases by roughly 20%, while requiring only a third of the memory.

### Strengths
- Straight-forward and logical idea to map LoRa to full trainings
- Significant improvement of trainable model sizes (factor of 3 claimed)
- Better initial training performance compared to the baseline
    * Food for thought: would it be meaningful to use LTE as a warm up approach to subsequently fine-tune with regular full-rank training?

### Weaknesses
 - A 40% increase of necessary iterations is substantial and hinders practical use 
- The authors present a thorough evaluation of LTE for a single dataset and a singular model architecture. Yet, it seems meaningful to provide additional experimental evidence for:
    * The stability of the finding for this particular use case, e.g. how large is the standard deviation for multiple different initializations/seeds?
    * How well does LTE generalize to other datasets and models architectures?

- Albeit a highly dense related work section, it seems to the reviewer that the authors have missed some closer related work in the realm of general stale data-parallel update schemes, e.g.:
    Coquelin, D., Debus, C., Götz, M., von der Lehr, F., Kahn, J., Siggel, M., & Streit, A. (2022). Accelerating neural network training with distributed asynchronous and selective optimization (DASO). Journal of Big Data, 9(1), 14.

    It seems reasonable to mention and(!) possibly study/incorporate their findings

- In section 3.1, the authors mention that its assumed that all the parameters have the same initialization, but in section 4.1 you mention that LTE performs better when the heads are initialized to be different. It is unclear to the reviewer which scheme has been chosen for the experimentation.
- It is unclear how the weight synchronization is actually done. It is assumed by standard averaging like in DDP, but not explicitly stated especially with respect to the incorporation of stale gradients. How does the communication scheme for this look like (a form of master or an allreduce)? Where in Algorithm 1 is the synchronization happening?
- It would be meaningful to state the exact configuration of ViTs used for the full-rank training in Table 1
- The study is not reproducible as-is due to the source code not being released. If you intend to do so, it may be meaningful to hint it in the manuscript
- Fig. 7 should possibly also showcase the effects of quantization for a full rank training

Minor points:

- Figures and their textual reference are quite far apart
- Caption Fig 2., step (2), something is missing here, possibly the averaging and small delta
- Fig. 5 is actually a table and should be labeled as such

### Questions
There are a number of questions that the reviewer would like to learn more about and which should most likely be answered in the manuscript:

- How does your resource investment and utilization behave
    * Do you always commit exactly 8 GPUs/workers for all trainings? How do you deal with over-allocations of heads compared to workers
    * How does the wall-time behavior of LTE look like? Are your epoch execution time shorter or longer?
- It seem an apples-oranges comparison to allow larger models, i.e. with more heads, in the comparison against the baseline. The reviewer may have overlooked something, but why is this not the case?
- How would the rank r be practically determined? If the answer is a hyperparameter study, how detrimental is this for practical applications with an exponential growth of the hyperparameter search space?
- It is not mentioned how the non-attention heads in the ViTS network are trained. Is it a simple DDP-averaging with a frequency of 1?
- Although initialized to be orthogonal, the orthogonality of $A$ is not enforced or guaranteed, why would the cosine similarity be a
meaningful metric for it? ($A$ is a learned matrix will (likely) not be orthogonal anymore after several training steps). Is a general proof of update angles like in the following reference meaningful?
