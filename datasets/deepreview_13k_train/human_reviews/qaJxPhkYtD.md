- Decision: Accept
- Scores: 6, 6, 6, 6

## Abstract
Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are powerful representation learning tools that have achieved remarkable performance in various downstream tasks. However, there are still open questions regarding their ability to count and list substructures, which play a crucial role in biological and social networks. In this work, we fill this gap and characterize the representation {and generalization} power of GNNs in terms of their ability to produce powerful representations that count substructures. In particular, we study the message-passing operations of GNNs with random node input in a novel fashion, and show how they can produce equivariant representations that are associated with high-order statistical moments. Using these representations, we prove that GNNs can learn how to count cycles, {cliques}, quasi-cliques, and the number of connected components in a graph. We also provide new insights into the generalization capacity of GNNs. Our analysis is constructive and enables the design of a generic GNN architecture that shows remarkable performance in four distinct tasks: cycle detection, cycle counting, graph classification, and molecular property prediction.

### Summary
This paper studied the problem of detecting/counting graph structures such as cycles, cliques, and connected components, using MPNNs with random initial node features. They considered taking the high-order moment of the neural network output to obtain deterministic node representations. In this case, the authors proved that with the increase of the order, the resulting GNN can express more and more graph structures, resulting in higher expressivity. Experiments demonstrate the expressive power of the proposed method.

### Strengths
1. The theoretical results of this paper are rigorous and correct (although proving it is straightforward given prior work).
2. The proposed method is quite interesting. Prior to this work, researchers mainly improved the expressive power of GNNs by sacrificing the computational costs, e.g., using higher-order GNNs. While in this paper, the proposed GNNs only have linear complexity. On the other hand, using random node initialization has been proposed in prior work. However, unlike prior work, this paper achieves equivariance by using an expectation in the final layer (although there may be other weaknesses, see below). The authors showed promising theoretical results for this architectural design.

### Weaknesses
1. This paper is poorly written. Please carefully polish the paper in the rebuttal period. Several problems include: (1) the word "equation" is redundant in many places; (2) many definitions are unclear. For example, what do you mean by "x is anonymous" in page 4, and what do you mean by "stationary random vector"? (3) the paper even exposes the author name "Charilaos" in page 6. Please fix it. (4) What is role of the characteristic function in page 3? Why is it unrelated to x?

2. Regarding the theoretical results:
   - The authors only proved positive results for the expressive power of GNNs using high-order moments, which are incomplete. Does the GNNs fail without high-order moments? In other words, are the theoretical results tight? For example, can the GNNs count 6-cycle using only 2-order moment, and can the GNNs count 7-cycle using only 3-order moment?
   - I do not think Theorem 4.1 is meaningful. The theorem uses a GNN to fit the number of connected components of a *single* graph, which is just equivalent to fit a constant if I understand correctly.

3. Regarding the experiments:
   - The proposed method relies crucially on taking the expectation in the final layer. How do you implement this in your experiments? Will a large number of samples be needed?
   - I found from the results that the GNNs can even count 8-cycles perfectly but the current theory did not prove it. What is the number of moment order required in your experiments?

### Summary
This paper studies the representation power of GNNs in terms of counting graph substructures, including cycles, quasi-cliques, and connected components. The authors employ tools from tensor algebra and stochastic processes, and they demonstrate that with appropriate activation and normalization functions, GNNs can generate permutation equivariant node representations that capture statistical moments of the GNN output distribution.

### Strengths
1. The exploration of the graph substructure counting ability in the context of GNNs constitutes a novel contribution to this field. This particular property is closely tied to the representational power of GNNs and is critical for numerous real world graph modalities like social networks, making it a pertinent and valuable topic for discussion.

2. The theoretical analysis presented in the paper is extensive and commendable, shedding light on various aspects of the subject matter.

3. The empirical experiments conducted in the paper aligns well with theoretical findings and demonstrates the effectiveness of proposed method.

### Weaknesses
1. Many powerful, expressive, and well-adopted  GNN baselines are missed. For instance, GNN-AK[1], GrphGPS[2], CIN [3], ....

2. The technique of encoding substructures in graphs is widely used in GNNs to improve the expressiveness, such as EGO [1], GNN-AK [1] and NGNN [4].  I think the comparison with these substructure-based GNNs should be discussed. The current analysis lacks a clear comparison with methods that explicitly leverage subgraph information, making it difficult to assess the novelty and practical advantages of the proposed approach in relation to existing techniques.

### Questions
1. When performing graph regression task on dataset ZINC, does the 10000 training graphs, 1000 validation graphs and 1000 test graphs are randomly sampled or they are from the ZINC-100K? For a more fair comparison, can this experiment implemented on whole ZINC dataset?

2. Proposition 5.2 show that Moment-GNN can improve expressivity over 1-FWL. What about the upper-bound on its' expressive power?  Is it bounded by 3-WL like subgraph GNNs [1]?

### Summary
This work studies the substructure counting power of a message-passing neural networks (MPNN) with random input. Concretely, the function class of interest is the expectation of outputs of standard MPNNs with random node features. They prove that this model can count up to 7 cycles, which is more powerful than regular MPNN with constant input. Moreover, the model is shown be equivalent to a deterministic graph filtering with constant input, where the filter is a hadamard product of polynomial filters. The equivalent filtering model has a better empirical performance over tasks such as substructure counting and molecular property prediction.

### Strengths
- Though it is known that random node feature injection can improve expressive power, it is interesting to see such analysis in an average meaning (thus perserving equivariance), and the connection to the corresponding graph filtering.

### Weaknesses
 - The comparison to other baselines on cycle counting and ZINC is insufficient.
- I feel like the sentence in the abstract "However, their ability to count substructures, which play a crucial role in biological and social networks, remains uncertain" may be confusing in the sense that, the counting ability of regular MPNN is pretty clear as shown in [1]. Specifically, the cited work clearly demonstrates the limitations of standard MPNNs with constant or symmetric inputs in counting substructures, establishing a clear link to the 1-FWL test. The current phrasing could mislead readers into thinking that the counting power of MPNNs is generally unknown, which is not the case given the existing literature.

### Questions
- I was wondering if large cycles (such as 8 cycles) can also be written as hadamard product of $S^k$ and thus can be expressed by the model? I know the construction of such function is pretty combinatorial, so probably the question is open. But it is interesting as 7 cycle is also the counting limitation of 2-FWL.

### Summary
This paper focuses on the representation power of GNNs and their ability to count graph substructures. The analysis enables the design of a generic GNN architecture that achieves good performance in various tasks, including subgraph detection, subgraph counting, graph classification, and logP prediction. The paper also provides both theoretical and experimental evidence of the ability of GNN to count graph substructures in graph-level representation learning tasks.

### Strengths
1. The paper studies an important problem: the ability to recognize subgraphs is crucial in graph applications.

2. The authors provide detailed deductions of how to design the proposed GNN to identify different numbers of graph substructures.

### Weaknesses
1. Writing quality: The presentation and the layout of the paper need to be improved substantially. Equation spacing/referencing is not correct with editing hints unremoved.
The paper is hard to follow. A clear introduction/navigation at the beginning of each section is lacking. This is particularly the case in the methodology part, which confuses the reader.

2. Experiments: The experiments show that the proposed GNN has good capability of substructure counting. However, this may not lead to better performance on downstream tasks. There are many benchmark datasets commonly used for node-level and graph-level tasks. Testing on more datasets will better demonstrate how counting substructures can help improve the performance of other tasks.

3. For the regression task on ZINC, the method proposed in ‘Graph Neural Networks with Local Graph Parameters’ accepted by NeurIPS 2021 seems to have a better result, which is not included in this paper.
