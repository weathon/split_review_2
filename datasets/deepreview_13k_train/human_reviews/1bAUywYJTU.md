# DreamTime: An Improved Optimization Strategy for Diffusion-Guided 3D Generation

- Decision: Accept
- Scores: 6, 3, 6, 8

## Abstract
Text-to-image diffusion models pre-trained on billions of image-text pairs have recently enabled 3D content creation by optimizing a randomly initialized differentiable 3D representation with score distillation. However, the optimization process suffers slow convergence and the resultant 3D models often exhibit two limitations: (a) quality concerns such as missing attributes and distorted shape and texture; (b) extremely low diversity comparing to text-guided image synthesis. In this paper, we show that the conflict between the 3D optimization process and uniform timestep sampling in score distillation is the main reason for these limitations. To resolve this conflict, we propose to prioritize timestep sampling with monotonically non-increasing functions, which aligns the 3D optimization process with the sampling process of diffusion model. Extensive experiments show that our simple redesign significantly improves 3D content creation with faster convergence, better quality and diversity.

### Summary
The paper systematically studies the effect of the time schedule used for the diffusion model used in score distillation sampling for 3D generation. The key observation is that at different time steps, the denoiser focuses on different types of content -- high-frequency vs. low-frequency. It proposes a schedule to leverage this observation in order to improve the optimization quality and efficiency.

### Strengths
I really ike the idea proposed in the paper because it’s simple yet effective in improving the quality of 3D generation from text and images. It studies an aspects of using diffusion model for 3D diffusion model -- how to schedule the timestep used to condition the diffusion model, which is not systematically explored in prior literature. In the paper, the authors show both quantitative and qualitative experiments as well as detailed analysis to demonstrate the effectiveness of this simple technique. The authors also show the generality of this technique by showing results across many state-of-the-art 3D generation methods so it can be easily adopted by the community in any future work along the line.

### Weaknesses
1. Though I really like the idea, the paper studies a small aspect of 3D generation which can be seen as a trick to improve results. If more studies can be conducted such as using I to accelerate 2D image generation, the scope of the paper will be further expanded. But I don't think the authors need to conduct these experiments in the rebuttal.
2. The quantitative experiments presented in the paper are limited. While the authors demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed technique on many different methods with qualitative examples, quantitative evaluation will make these results more convincing.

### Questions
The Score Jacobian Chaining paper has studied the scheduling of diffusion timesteps to an extent. Due to its high relevance, I think the paper should discuss the related findings in that paper and put things in context.

### Summary
The authors propose a method for image-to-3D generation. Specifically, they suggest incorporating depth images during DDIM inversion and sampling to generate view-consistent novel view images. The enhanced novel view images are then used to compute a variant version of SDS loss, i.e., the RGSD loss, to optimize the 3D representation. The results appear to outperform the baselined methods used.

The authors proposed a timestep annealing scheme in SDS to enhance text-to-3D generation. Specifically, they pointed out the suboptimality of the random timestep sampling in Dreamfusion and suggested a non-increasing t-sampling approach using a Gaussian weight function W(t) in SDS. The proposed timestep annealing scheme proves to be effective and outperforms the baselines.

### Strengths
The paper is well-written and presents its ideas clearly.

The effectiveness of the proposed timestep annealing scheme in text-to-3D generation using SDS is demonstrated.

### Weaknesses
1. There are several existing works that have proposed timestep schedulings, such as two-stage samplings in ProlificDreamer [1] and the non-increasing timestep annealing scheme in HIFA [2]. These methods have been available on arXiv for a while. Given the rapidly evolving nature of this field, even if not officially published, it would be beneficial for the authors to compare the proposed Gaussian PDF with these existing approaches. The lack of comparison with these specific methods, which also explore timestep scheduling, makes it difficult to assess the novelty and relative performance of the proposed approach. The authors should have provided a more thorough analysis of how their method differs and improves upon these existing techniques, especially given their availability and relevance to the problem being addressed.
2. The enhancement of TP-VSD is intriguing. However, the authors have presented only one example in Fig.1. It is recommended to provide additional visual results, especially for a wider range of objects and scenes as demonstrated in ProlificDreamer. The single example provided is insufficient to demonstrate the generalizability and robustness of the proposed TP-VSD enhancement. A more comprehensive evaluation, including a variety of object categories and scene complexities, is necessary to validate the effectiveness of the method. Without this, it is difficult to ascertain whether the observed improvement is consistent across different scenarios or limited to specific cases.
3. While the proposed improvement is a valuable technique, its contribution as an ICLR paper may be limited. The core idea, while effective, seems to be an incremental improvement over existing methods rather than a significant breakthrough. The paper lacks a strong theoretical foundation and the empirical results, while promising, do not fully justify its novelty as a contribution to ICLR.

### Questions
I am curious if there exists a concrete theoretical deduction for the timestep annealing scheme that could explain which specific timestep annealing scheme should be employed.

### Summary
Recent advancements in text-to-image diffusion models, trained on vast amounts of image-text pairs, have paved the way for 3D content creation by optimizing an initially random differentiable 3D representation using score distillation. Despite its promise, the method has substantial drawbacks: a prolonged optimization convergence and subpar 3D model outcomes in terms of both quality (e.g., distorted features and textures) and diversity, especially when juxtaposed with text-guided image synthesis. This paper pinpoints the crux of the problem in the misalignment between the 3D optimization and the uniform timestep sampling in score distillation. A novel approach is introduced that reprioritizes timestep sampling using monotonically non-increasing functions, seamlessly integrating the 3D optimization and diffusion model sampling. Comprehensive experiments validate the efficacy of this redesign, showcasing marked improvements in convergence speed, model quality, and diversity.

### Strengths
While the paper's methodology is straightforward, its experiments are illuminating. It provides a visualization of NeRF's training steps guided by the SDS loss, uncovering a refined pathway to mitigate the training diversity and challenges associated with SDS loss. Furthermore, the study introduces a weighted function to fine-tune the significance of the t-sampling process for SDS. This not only accelerates convergence but also yields results with enhanced diversity. Moreover, this approach promotes improved semantic alignment.

### Weaknesses
The quality of the proposed method doesn't appear to significantly surpass that of Magic3D, Dreambooth3d[1], or Fantasia3D[2].

The method introduced seems to be a versatile technique applicable to various 3D representations. Comprehensive evaluations on diverse representations such as NeRF, NeuS, and DMTet should be undertaken.

While Fig.2 highlights issues of blurriness and color distortion associated with the SDS loss in the context of texture generation, it appears that this paper falls short of presenting compelling evidence to demonstrate that the introduced method effectively addresses both challenges.

Missing citations for AvatarCraft: Transforming Text into Neural Human Avatars with Parameterized Shape and Pose Control, which produces human avatars with SDS guidance. I'm intrigued to know if the methodology presented can be seamlessly adapted for avatar creation.

### Questions
In Fig.3, might it be beneficial to switch out NeRF for SDS-based implicit fields such as NeuS or VolSDF? Based on my experiments using CLIP guidance, each representation yields distinct visualizations as optimization unfolds. It raises the question: would these representations evolve similarly under SDS guidance? Occasionally, there might be a scenario where we initialize the neural implicit fields with a rudimentary object. How would the training process evolve in such instances?

The paper posits its objective as refining a differentiable 3D representation by leveraging knowledge distilled from either the pre-trained Stable Diffusion or Zero123, depending on whether the prompt is text or image-based. Could you clarify which outcomes are derived from the SDS loss in tandem with the pre-trained Stable Diffusion and which with Zero123? Additionally, I seem unable to locate results corresponding to image inputs.

### Summary
This paper proposes to use a monotonically non-increasing time schedule in the score distillation training for 3D generation. The paper identifies the different denoising effects of different time steps, e.g. larger t helps generate coarse geometry and smaller t helps generate fine texture details. The proposed method shows much faster convergence speed than its random time schedule counterpart, and generates results with more geometric and textural details.

### Strengths
1. The method is well motivated. The original SDS loss is derived from the training loss of diffusion models and thus adopts a random time schedule. But during score distillation for 3D generation, the process is more like the inference procedure of diffusion models. The optimized 3D representation goes from coarse to fine, so the time schedule should also be consistent with this.

2. The presentation is great. The paper motivates the method with an easy-to-understand analysis (Section 3.2) and good illustrations (Figure 3, Figure 6).

3. The proposed method is very easy to implement and yields no additional cost, but still achieves impressive results (Figure 8 and Figure 9).

### Weaknesses
1. The proposed time schedule seems to be highly heuristic. I do not think the optimal schedule would be the same for all different prompts. If the schedule is designed to be adaptive to the renderings of the current iteration it would be more robust. The current fixed schedule, while effective, lacks a theoretical basis for its specific monotonic decrease and may not generalize well to unseen or complex prompts. The lack of adaptability could lead to suboptimal convergence for certain object categories or scenes, where the optimal denoising trajectory might deviate significantly from the proposed fixed schedule.

2. In Figure 1 the authors also show the results for "TP-VSD", but I cannot find any more explanation for it. Maybe it is obvious to apply the method on VSD, but I still think a small dedicated piece of text explaining it would be good. For example, do you use the same schedule for both SDS and VSD? The paper does not detail whether the same monotonic schedule is applied to VSD, or if any modifications were made to accommodate the different loss function. This lack of clarity makes it difficult to assess the generalizability of the proposed schedule across different score distillation training methods.

### Questions
1. Do you have any idea on how to design an adaptive schedule based on the information of the current instance instead of a fixed schedule?
