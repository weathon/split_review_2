# Quantized Local Independence Discovery for Fine-Grained Causal Dynamics Learning in Reinforcement Learning

- Decision: Reject
- Scores: 6, 5, 6, 6, 6

## Abstract
Incorporating causal relationships between the variables into dynamics learning has emerged as a promising approach to enhance robustness and generalization in reinforcement learning (RL). Recent studies have focused on examining conditional independences and leveraging only relevant state and action variables for prediction. However, such approaches tend to overlook local independence relationships that hold under certain circumstances referred as event. In this work, we present a theoretically-grounded and practical approach to dynamics learning which discovers such meaningful events and infers fine-grained causal relationships. The key idea is to learn a discrete latent variable that represents the pair of event and causal relationships specific to the event via vector quantization. As a result, our method provides a fine-grained understanding of the dynamics by capturing event-specific causal relationships, leading to improved robustness and generalization in RL. Experimental results demonstrate that our method is more robust to unseen states and generalizes well to downstream tasks compared to prior approaches. In addition, we find that our method successfully identifies meaningful events and recovers event-specific causal relationships.

### Summary
This paper presented a local causal dynamic learning method by introducing meaningful events. It consists of two parts (1) inferencing local causal graph through quantization and (2) predicting next state. Empirical result on two RL environments showed the effectiveness of the proposed learning method. More importantly it also showed identifiability result for the proposed method.

### Strengths
1. The assumption that separating the whole (s,a) space into decomposition is intuitive.
2. This paper provided identifiability result of the proposed method that the optimal decomposition that maximizes the score identifies a meaningful context that exhibits fine-grained causal relationships.
3. The experiments (Chemical and Magnetic) showed the effectiveness of the proposed method.

### Weaknesses
* The theory and the implementation seem not aligned.
  * In theory there are ground truth decomposition which the LCG are the same within partition and different otherwise, however, it seems that for Magnetic, there is a uniform causal graph which does not change locally. This requires clarification. For example, in the Magnetic environment, are there specific conditions or subsets of the state-action space where the causal graph does differ, or is it truly uniform across all partitions? If it is uniform, how does this align with the theoretical premise of distinct LCGs across different partitions?
  * Identifiability results are not reflected in the method. There is no quantitative result that supporting that identifiability is or is not achieved in the experiment. The paper would benefit from a quantitative analysis demonstrating whether the learned decomposition aligns with the ground truth, perhaps using metrics such as the Structural Hamming Distance (SHD) to compare the learned and true LCGs.
  * Unclear relation between ID, OOD setting with the decomposition and the codebook size K (see questions).
* The assumption on the decomposition is not mild. In real world data, the transition function is usually highly complex. This method can only handle the case when different parts in the decomposition have different LCG. However, in real case, all parts may share the same LCG due to the highly complex transition function. Even though the conditional independence relations are the same (same LCG), the transition function itself may be used to further partition the sample space into further small parts. That is saying same LCG but with different $p(s'\vert s,a)$. The paper should address the method's applicability to scenarios where the LCG is consistent across partitions, but the transition dynamics differ. Can the method distinguish between partitions based on differences in $p(s'\vert s,a)$ even when the underlying causal structure (LCG) is the same?

### Questions
* Minor presentation issues about the notations.
  * In Sec 3.1, what is the definition of event $\mathcal{E}$?
  * In terms of the score function $\mathcal{S}(\\{\mathcal{G}_z,\mathcal{E}_z\\}_1^K):=\text{sup }\mathbb{E}\left[\text{log}\hat{p}(s' \vert s,a;\mathcal{G}_z) - \lambda \vert \mathcal{G}_z\vert\right]$
    * Which variables are for sup?
    * Which variables are for $\mathbb{E}$?
* In Proposition 3. why $\mathbb{E}\left[\vert\mathcal{G}_z\vert\right] \le \mathbb{E}\left[\vert\mathcal{\hat{G}}_z\vert\right]$.
  * Specifically, in appendix B.2 proof of Proposition 3 why the last equality holds? Can you provide detailed derivation involving the definition of score function $\mathcal{S}(\cdot)$?
* In the theory there is a ground truth decomposition $\\{\mathcal{G}_z,\mathcal{E}_z\\}_1^K$. How can this decomposition be aligned with the experiments? i.e., what are the ground truth decomposition and the corresponding LCGs in both Chemical and Magnetic environment?
* How to measure if the identifiability is achieved during learning process? Some measure of the distance between the learned LCG and the true LCG may be used here.
* For ID setting, the proposed method is not the best, is there any explanation for this?
* How to decide the number of codebook vector K?
* For the case mentioned in Weakness, when dealing with more complex data, if the LCG is shared but the transition function is indeed different among partitions, is the proposed method flexible enough to generalize to those case?

### Summary
The paper proposes a gradient-based method for local-independence-based causal discovery, and applies it to the Causal Dynamics Modeling problem in model-based reinforcement learning. Following (Hwang et al. 2023), the basic idea is to partition the state-action space into subsets, each called an "event" in this paper, and then to learn the transition function of the MDP as a collection of event-specific causal models. The main difference from prior work is that the event partitioning in this paper is learned through a clustering procedure over a (jointly-learned) latent embedding of the state-action space, using Eq.7. With two specially-designed MDP environments, the paper experimentally shows that MDP planning powered by dynamics model learned from their method performs more robustly under some out-of-distribution settings. Finally, the paper also presents some theoretical results about the soundness of jointly optimizing the event partitioning scheme and the event-specific causal models.

### Strengths
I think the paper touches an interesting and important topic. Causal discovery, for whatever reason we want to do it, is often hindered by the fact that many causal effects only manifest themselves under certain conditions. So, targeting at learning local models that each only works for a specific condition, instead of at learning a generic model, seems to be a promising direction for causal discovery in general. The problem of collaboratively learning the condition-specific models and the conditions that effectively facilitate such model discovery, is however quite challenging, and is attacked in this paper. It is also nice to see that the paper embeds this causal discovery task into model-based RL and experimentally tests its application in this scenario.

### Weaknesses
 **(a)** I am not sure about the soundness of the proposed method. The paper claims that they are jointly optimizing both the event decomposition/partitioning scheme and the causal models, but I doubt if the learning of the decomposition scheme is indeed effectively signaled by the impact of the decomposition on the quality of the resulted causal models. Moreover, I doubt if the learning objective designed for optimizing decomposition (Eq.7) may lead to degenerate results. See my question 1 and 2 below for the detailed concerns. Since joint optimization is a main selling point of this paper (without it the theory part becomes largely irrelevant to the experiment part, for example), this is a serious issue that must be clarified.

**(b)** I have concern on the reproducibility of the experiment part. No pseudo-code is provided for the proposed method, and the method description in Section 3.3, 4.1.2, and C.2, missed some important pieces. For example, how is the data sampled (what's the exploration policy being used)? Exactly what is being updated by L_pred and L_quant (the gradient is respective to what)? What are exactly computed for the differentiation?
  
Moreover, the experimentation code is not given either, and the description of the two MDP environments are not detailed enough for third-parties to reproduce the experiment, I'm afraid. For example, how exactly the nodes in the Chemical environment affect each other? How exactly the noise is injected at testing time? In the robot-arm environment, how exactly the "unseen locations" of the box is determined at testing time? In Section C.1.3, it's said that at training time the positions of the box are "randomly sampled within the range of the table", does this mean every location on the table has a positive probability density to be selected at training time (If so, the location of the box at testing time is not really out-of-distribution, even though it may be unseen)?   

**(c)** I have concerns on the theory part too. On one hand, the main theorem seems to only apply to a rather special case (where the causal model can only have two irreducible phases). On the other hand, the lemmas (Prop. 1-3) used for proving the main theorems seem to have flawed statements and proofs. Some important assumptions are not explicitly stated. See my question 3~8 for the details in this regard.

**(d)** The paper may need to better contrast to prior work, especially to (Hwang et al., 2023). It seems (Hwang et al., 2023) is not limited to sample-specific decomposition, but also discusses event-level or event-set-level decomposition. Proposition 1 in the paper under review is essentially a rephrasing of Proposition 4 in (Hwang et al., 2023), for example.

### Questions
1. In Eq.6, will the gradient of L_pred be used to update the codebook $C$ and (parameters in) the embedding model $h$? If I understand correctly, the decomposition scheme mainly depends on the codebook $C$ and the embedding model $h$, and both of them affect L_pred through $e$, via Eq.5 (and $e$ affects L_pred further through $A$). However, how does the gradient propagates through the argmin operator in Eq.5? 

(Suppose the gradient of L_pred does not change $C$ and $h$, then the learning of the decomposition scheme actually does not take into account its consequence on the likelihood score, but is solely based on the gradient of L_quant, in this case the algorithm you proposed is not truly a joint optimization method, although the decomposition and the causal models are indeed learned "in parallel".)

2. I don't quite get the rationale behind Eq.7. It seems to me that the L_quant defined in Eq.7 wants to encourage the feature vector $h$ of the state-action and its corresponding cluster center $e$ to be close to each other. But is this enough to learn a "good" decomposition? As a trivial and degenerate solution, imagine the embedding model h always outputs a constant vector, and all the cluster center $e_z$ in the codebook also equal this constant vector, this will minimize L_quant to zero, but is clearly not what we want. This question is assuming that the answer to Question 1 above is no (that the learning of $C$ and $h$ are not further based on the likelihood loss L_pred).

3. I can't quite follow the proof of Proposition 2. In fact, I'm not sure if the proposition is exactly correct as there is no requirement on the value of lambda at all. In comparison, Lemma 1 requires *small enough* (yet non-zero) lambda. Does Prop.2 also require special lambda values? For continuous state and action spaces, there can be an uncountably infinite number of possible decomposition schemes, each may require a different "small enough" lambda for the regularized likelihood score to work, in this case do we still have a single lambda that works for all decompositions? In general, the role of lambda seems to be subtle yet crucial for the entire theory developed here. 

4. In the proof of Proposition 3, I'm not sure about the inequality at line 4 of the proof -- between the equality sign, why can the likelihood terms $\hat{p}$ in S be dropped?

5. The probability factorization at Line 1 of Page 3 implies that you are assuming all the $S'_j$'s are independent to each other (conditioned on given $s,a$), right? Which propositions proved in the paper need this assumption? Without this assumption, the causal model is not necessarily bipartite, and skeleton learning based on local independence would be not enough, and we perhaps don't have unique identifiability any more? Also, does the environments used in your experiment satisfy this assumption? 

6. Please explicitly and formally state all the external propositions that your proofs crucially depend on and yet are only proved in other literature, such as (Hwang et al. 2023, Prop. 4) and (Brouillard et al. 2020, Thm. 1).

7. You define "local causal model" based on the concept of PA(j; E), but how is PA(j;E) defined? Does the global causal model entail the local models through the induced local independence relationships? In that case a proper *definition* of local causal model would be entirely conditioned on the E-faithfulness assumption, am I right?

8. In the proof of Lemma 1 you mentioned some assumptions and said they are assumed "throughout the paper". Such assumptions should not be placed in the appendix, in the middle of a proof for a proposition. They should at least be given in the statement of the involved propositions, in the main text. 

9. Is your algorithm equivalent to NCD if we set $K=|S \times A|$?

### Summary
This paper proposes a novel reinforcement learning method by considering causal relationships. Specifically, the authors jointly optimize the l1 regularized likelihood and a vector quantization loss, during which the event and each event-specific causal graph are expected to be identified. Experimental results on two environments show the effectiveness of the proposed method.

### Strengths
1. The method looks novel to me.

2. Overall speaking the identifiability theory looks plausible to me.

3. The paper is well-written and easy to follow.

### Weaknesses
1. The quantization technique in eq 5 is not novel. VQVAE and related papers should be cited there.

2. Though overall the identifiability theory is plausible, however, the identifiability of events is unclear to me. Specifically, it's not clear how the vector quantization leads to the identification of meaningful events, and how these events relate to the causal graphs. The connection between the learned discrete codes and the actual events in the environment is not rigorously established. It is also not clear how the method would perform if the true underlying events do not align well with the vector quantization boundaries. See my questions below.

### Questions
1. Why an event-specific graph has to be constrained to be a subgraph of the underlying G?

2. Why vector quantization can correctly identify the event?

3. Does the identifiability in Theorem 1 rely on the specific choice of K?

### Summary
This paper considers using the subgraph decomposition method under certain event conditions to enhance the generalization and robustness of the. The first step is to find the partition of events. Then, based on the partitions, a causal discovery method is applied to find the causal graph.

### Strengths
This paper presents an interesting idea, which suggests that causal relationships can be changed with variations in the conditional event. This is an issue worth discussing, especially in dynamic systems. The writing in this paper is easy to follow, and the method is supported by thorough experimental work.

### Weaknesses
See the questions below. If the authors can solve my concerns, I would like to raise my score.

* How can we understand the concept of 'event'? Is it akin to a specific state value or an additional variable, similar to the domain ID in domain generalization tasks? Could you provide some examples in the context of reinforcement learning scenarios? 
* Definition 1 may not fully describe an event-conditioned system. What if we consider a situation where changing the event alters the entire causal relationship? Definition 1 only discusses cases where the edges under certain conditions should be a subset of the original edge set.

* Can the score (equation 4) assist in identifying the causal graph? In Huang et al.'s paper, the score is a direct measure of conditional independence. Does equation 4 also measure conditional independence? In Brouillard et al.'s work, I found that the intervention data are required to support identifiability. Previous works have used score-based methods to discover causal graphs only under certain assumptions (e.g., linear and non-Gaussian Structural Causal Models). However, this paper lacks rigorous assumptions that substantiate identifiability. 

* In equation 5, both h and e_j are learned. How can we ensure a nontrivial result? Specifically, if both h and e_j are learned as the static value 0, how can we avoid trivial outcomes?

* Although there are some positive results in Table 3 shows that considering the subgraph can help to enhance the causal discovery score. I’m still curious about why breaking the full graph into subgraphs by removing unnecessary edges can help enhance the robustness. If the edges are unnecessary, the causal function on the full graph will not consider the causal effect of it.

### Summary
This paper proposed a novel method that discovers meaningful events and infers fine-grained causal relationships. They recommend learning a discrete latent variable representing the pair of events and causal graphs via vector quantization. Experimental results demonstrate their method is more robust to unseen states.

### Strengths
1.	The discovery of fine-grained event-based causality is novel and intuitive, and the experimental results also prove the author's point of view.
2.	The authors theoretically prove that their grouping method does not depend on the hyperparameter k setting and that meaningful context can be discovered in each group.
3.	Figures 4 and 5 in the experimental results clearly demonstrate the advantages of their event-based method in discovering fine-grained causal relationships.

### Weaknesses
1.	The validation environment for the experiment is somewhat simple, and the assumption of full observables seems to have significant limitations. Specifically, the environments used are low-dimensional and do not capture the complexities of real-world scenarios where partial observability is the norm. The reliance on full state information makes it unclear how the proposed method would perform in more realistic settings where agents must infer states from limited sensor data. This limits the generalizability of the findings.


### Questions
1.	In Table 3, it seems that the larger K is, the better the performance is. What happens if K is increased to equal the number of samples?
2.	Intuitively, an event should be a sequence of continuous states and actions. I would like to ask whether Eq. (7) is more inclined to aggregate neighboring states?
