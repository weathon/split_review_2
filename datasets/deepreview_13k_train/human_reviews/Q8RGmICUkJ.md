- Decision: Reject
- Scores: 6, 5, 6

## Abstract
Time series data across scientific domains are often collected under distinct states (e.g., tasks), wherein latent processes (e.g., biological factors) create complex inter- and intra-state variability. A key approach to capture this complexity is to uncover fundamental interpretable units within the data, Building Blocks (BBs), which modulate their activity and adjust their structure across observations. Existing methods for identifying BBs in multi-way data often overlook inter- vs. intra-state variability, produce uninterpretable components, or do not align with properties of real-world data, such as missing samples and sessions of different duration. Here, we present a framework for Similarity-driven Building Block Inference using Graphs across States (SiBBlInGS). SiBBlInGS offers a graph-based dictionary learning approach for discovering sparse BBs along with their temporal traces, based on co-activity patterns and inter- vs. intra-state relationships. Moreover, SiBBlInGS captures per-trial temporal variability and controlled cross-state structural BB adaptations, identifies state-specific vs. state-invariant components, and accommodates variability in the number and duration of observed sessions across states. We demonstrate SiBBlInGS's ability to reveal insights into complex phenomena as well as its robustness to noise and missing samples through several synthetic and real-world examples, including web search and neural data.

### Summary
This paper presents a framework called SiBBlInGS, which stands for Similarity-driven Building Block Inference using Graphs across States. The framework is designed to discover fundamental representational units within multi-dimensional data, which can adjust their temporal activity and component structure across trials to capture the diverse spectrum of cross-trial variability. The paper discusses the limitations of existing methods for understanding multi-dimensional data and how SiBBlInGS addresses these limitations. It also explains how SiBBlInGS employs a graph-based dictionary learning approach for building block discovery, and how it considers shared temporal activity, inter- and intra-state relationships, non-orthogonal components, and variations in session counts and duration across states. Finally, the paper compares SiBBlInGS to other approaches for discovering fundamental representational units within multi-dimensional data and discusses potential applications of this framework in scientific domains.

### Strengths
- The SiBBlInGS framework is a novel approach for discovering fundamental representational units within multi-dimensional data. It addresses the limitations of existing methods and considers shared temporal activity, inter- and intra-state relationships, non-orthogonal components, and variations in session counts and duration across states.
- SiBBlInGS is designed to be resilient to noise, random initializations, and missing samples. This makes it a robust framework for discovering building blocks in real-world data.
- The paper includes a thorough evaluation of the SiBBlInGS framework on both synthetic and real-world data. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the framework in discovering building blocks and its potential for applications in scientific domains.

### Weaknesses
 - The proposed framework is complicated. While the paper provides a high-level overview of the SiBBlInGS framework, it does not provide detailed implementation instructions or code. This may make it difficult for researchers to replicate the results or apply the framework to their own data.
- While the paper discusses potential applications of the SiBBlInGS framework in scientific domains, it does not provide concrete examples of real-world applications. This may limit the impact of the framework and its adoption by researchers in different fields. 
- The authors did not provide more details on the limitations of the SiBBlInGS framework and potential areas for improvement? This would help readers understand the scope and applicability of the framework.

### Questions
- Can the authors discuss the potential limitations of the SiBBlInGS framework in terms of scalability and computational efficiency? For example, how might the framework perform on larger datasets or in real-time applications, and what steps can be taken to address these limitations?
- How does the proposed method compare to other approaches for discovering fundamental representational units within multi-dimensional data?
- How does the shared temporal activity, inter- and intra-state relationships, and non-orthogonal components contribute to the discovery of building blocks and the effectiveness of the framework?
- Can the authors explain more on how SiBBlInGS handles missing samples and varied sampling rates in multi-dimensional data? How does it ensure that the discovered building blocks are robust to these variations?
- What advantages does graph-based dictionary learning approach offer different from other dictionary learning approaches?

### Summary
The authors address the task on analysing high-dimensional time-series data.  Explicitly accounting for states and trials, they perfrom a per-state-and-trial matrix factorization. As part of this, they infer factor matrices which they term building blocks (BBs); similarity of BBs is controlled via a state-similarity graph.

### Strengths
In the problem setup, the authors define a setting where allowing for observations stemming from different states, and sessions, as well as allowing for different durations between states/trials.  This setup reflects real-world applications well and as such has received little attention in the literature.

### Weaknesses
 - The authors compare their model only to very simple baselines, such as PCA and vanilla PARAFAC. In particular in the context of PARAFAC a lot of recent literature exists that generalized PARAFAC to explicitly account for temporal dependencies. Such approaches should be discussed explicitly and systematically benchmarked. In particular the authors should consider [1,2,3], where temporal information and different states over time are modelled via GP priors or parametric regularizers.
- The experiments are very limited. While there are some analyses on synthetic data, they should be extended to include more baselines and also demonstrate how the proposed Method works in different settings for high-dimensional time series data e.g. such as anslysed in [1]
- Results from baselines should also be discussed for the real-world applications
- I find the presentation of the paper could be improved: it requires a lot of jumping back and forth between appendix and main text for important results and to gain a good understanding.  I also found the results of the real world applications hard to understand.

### Summary
The document introduces SiBBlInGS, a framework designed to identify Building Blocks (BBs) and their temporal profiles within high-dimensional, multi-state time-series data. SiBBlInGS utilizes channel-similarity and state-similarity graphs to uncover interpretable BBs, providing insights into the system's structure and variability across different states. The framework is demonstrated to be applicable across various data modalities, offering a deeper understanding of functional circuits, task encoding, and state modulations. It is validated using neural data from a monkey's somatosensory cortex during a reaching-out movement experiment, showcasing its potential in neuroscience for analyzing complex datasets.

### Strengths
1. A well-written and structured paper.
2. The proposed SiBBlInG has the ability to account for variations in temporal activities across trials and subtle differences in the composition of Building Blocks (BBs) across states.
3. The SiBBlInGS framework offers valuable insights into functional circuits, task encoding, and state modulations across various data modalities. It is versatile and can be applied across diverse fields, including neuroscience, social science, and genetics.
4. The experimental part is solid and abundant.

### Weaknesses
The novelty of the paper mainly comes from borrowing the idea and success of functional Building Blocks (BB) into the neural data modeling. With a stacking of state-of-the-art techniques and domain knowledge, the proposed method achieves effectiveness through empirical evidence. However, these findings are a bit heuristic and empirical. There are few theoretical guarantees in this paper.

### Questions
1. How can you prove that the Building Blocks (BB) are capable of modeling the spatio temporal structures within the states and dynamics of neural data well than traditional methods like State Space Models (SSM) and Variational Autoencoders (VAE)?
2. How does the proposed method ensures to model and distinguish the within-state and between-state variabilities and relationships, which could be crucial for a comprehensive analysis of the data.
3. What are the bio-plausible insights of this paper and in the model design?
