- Decision: Reject
- Scores: 5, 8, 5

## Abstract
Equivariant graph neural networks force fields (\egraff{s}) have shown great promise in modeling complex interactions in atomic systems by exploiting the graphs’ inherent symmetries. Recent works have led to a surge in the development of novel architectures that incorporate equivariance-based inductive biases alongside architectural innovations like graph transformers and message passing to model atomic interactions. %Equivariant graph neural networks force fields (\egraff{}) have shown great promise in modelling complex atomic systems and interactions by exploiting inherent symmetries. 
However, thorough evaluations of these deploying \egraff{s} for the downstream task of real-world atomistic simulations, are lacking. To this end, here we perform a systematic benchmarking of 6 \egraff{} algorithms (\nequip, \allegro, \botnet, \mace, \equiformer, \torchmdnet), to understand their capabilities and limitations for realistic atomistic simulations. In addition to our thorough evaluation and analysis of eight existing datasets based on the benchmarking literature, we release two new benchmark datasets, propose four new metrics, and three challenging tasks. %we have added two new and challenging datasets, GeTe and LiPS20.  GeTe's phase-change behaviour makes it difficult to simulate with classical forcefields. LiPS20 contains 20 different compositions representing different phases, from crystalline to amorphous. 
The new datasets and tasks evaluate the performance of \egraff{} to out-of-distribution data, in terms of different crystal structures, temperatures, and new molecules. Interestingly, evaluation of the \egraff{} models based on dynamic simulations reveals that having a lower error on energy or force does not guarantee stable or reliable simulation or faithful replication of the atomic structures. Moreover, no model clearly outperforms other models on all datasets and tasks. Importantly, we show that the performance of all the models on out-of-distribution datasets is unreliable, pointing to the need to develop a foundation model for force fields that can be used in real-world simulations. In summary, this work establishes a rigorous framework for evaluating machine learning force fields in the context of atomic simulations and points to open research challenges within this domain.

### Summary
In this work, the authors conduct benchmarking of equivariant GNN force field for molecular simulations. The work includes some latest equivariant models and introduces 2 more datasets. Besides, the work introduces structure based metrics and dynamic metrics. The former evaluates how ML simulated molecular structures compare with ground truth and the latter evaluates how ML simulated forces/energies compare with ground truth. It further evaluate the performance on out-of-distribution data and shows that none of the models perform reliably in the proposed setting.

### Strengths
1. Thorough evaluation of ML force field rather than accuracy of energy/force is important in applying to molecular simualtions. 2
2. This work extends previous benchmark efforts with latest equivariant GNN/Transformer models. 
3. This work introduce new datasets and evaluation metrics for ML force fields.

### Weaknesses
1. The work neglects some useful metrics from the previous works, like stability, RDF, diffusivity, etc in [1]. It would be better to include the performance of latest models on these metrics. 
2. Though new datasets and metrics are proposed. The major conclusion that low energy/force doesn't guarantee performing well in molecular simulations is not fresh, as pointed out in [1]. 
3. Some benchmarking settings may not be convincing and not reflect the scenario in real applications. More discussions are included in the following Questions section. 

### Questions
1. The work include latest equivariant models. However, most models reported in previous works [1] are ignored. The authors may consider adding some more models to further validate the limitations of previous datasets and metrics. 
2. What are the hyperparameter settings for the equivariant models in the experiments?
3. In Table 1, there are models that perform well on one dataset but fail on the other. For example, allegro performs well on MD17 but is really bad on GeTe. What are the differences in the molecular systems that lead to the divergence? Are there possible under-fit?
4. In section 4.4.1, ML models are trained on a subset of 3 moelcules in MD17 and evaluated on another molecule. Not surprisingly, none of the models perform well in this setting as the types and number of molecular data are limited. However, this may not reflect the real application. [2] unveils that allegro pre-trained on SPICE, a large dataset with molecules < 100 atoms, can conduct molecular simulations of large molecular systems with 1M atoms. So a more realistic setting for OOD generalization may be training on large datasets with a wide variety of small molecules and test how it performs on other molecular systems. 
5. For the dynamics metrics, if two molecular systems start from the same initial structure but different initial velocities, they can diverge later. When that happens, EV & FV may fail to provide meaningful evaluations. Are there controls over the initial configuration when comparing ML-based simulations with ground truth?
6. How does EGraFFBench handle periodic boundary condition (PBC)?
7. In table 2, some models are not properly highlighted though superior performance is achieved.

### Summary
The benchmarks 6 different equivariant force field models using a combination of existing and new benchmarks. The authors use several evaluation metrics (e.g. predicted structures, dynamics, evaluation time) in addition to traditional force / energy MAE. The aim of the paper is to evaluate the methods in a variety of realistic settings and to determine the strengths / weakness of the methods tested.

### Strengths
The paper is thorough and benchmarking 6 models on such a breadth of tasks is a technical challenge in itself and helpful to the community. The paper provides concrete observations such as the lack of transferability of IPs trained on single molecules even to molecules of similar composition and structure. It also provides concrete conclusions that suggest paths for improvement of equivariant graph force fields.

### Weaknesses
I believe this would be difficult to do given the amount of work it would take, but it would be really valuable to have more of an ablation style study of what particular architectural choices help / hurt in different metrics. Even with the present benchmarks, there are many architectural difference between these models that the takeaways are a bit binary -- e.g. this model is or is not enough for this task -- rather than -- e.g. this architectural choice seems to help with X. If you think that your results can support such guidance I think that would be extremely useful to the community.

I believe that the paper could benefit from a more detailed analysis of the computational cost associated with each model. While the paper does mention evaluation time, it would be useful to have a more granular breakdown of where the computational bottlenecks are for each model. For example, is the time dominated by the message passing steps, the equivariant layers, or the final energy/force prediction? This would help guide future work in optimizing these models. Furthermore, it would be helpful to understand how the computational cost scales with system size for each model, as this could be a significant factor in their applicability to different problems.

### Questions
For each of the models, you can predict forces either as a direct prediction or via backprop to atomic coordinates. From 2.1 it seems that backprop was always used for forces for this benchmark (which makes sense given the desire for conservative forces). However, it would still be interesting to contrast the evaluation efficiency gain vs. stability loss in this setting and whether this changed substantially between methods. Do you have any runs that would give insight into this?

### Summary
This work performs a systematic benchmarking of six equivariant graph neural networks designed for force field prediction. It conducts an analysis of how these models behave in realistic atomistic simulations. This work also investigated the generalization ability of these models on out-of-distribution data.

### Strengths
1. This work proposes two new datasets, GeTe and LiPS20. Based on LiPS20, it proposes a new OOD task that aims to evaluate the model’s generalizability to unseen crystalline structures or unseen composition. 

2. This work proposes four metrics to evaluate how these models perform in molecular simulations.

### Weaknesses
1. I have serious doubts about the experimental results in Table 1. The MD17 results of NequIP and Equiformer are much worse than reported in their original papers. Although BOTNet and MACE report rMD17 results instead of MD17 in their papers, it doesn’t make any sense that their performance on MD17 will be such bad. I don’t think authors run their code correctly. Specifically, the reported MAE values for NequIP and Equiformer on the MD17 dataset are significantly higher than those reported in their respective original publications, raising concerns about the implementation or training procedure. The discrepancy suggests a potential issue with the handling of training data, hyperparameters, or even the model architecture itself during the experiments. The fact that BOTNet and MACE, which report on rMD17, also show unexpectedly poor results on MD17 further reinforces this concern, indicating a systematic problem rather than an isolated issue with a single model.

2. Since the molecular dynamic simulations are based on frozen models that are trained to predict energy and force, the quality of Table 1 makes the MD simulation not convincing. The unreliable energy and force predictions from Table 1 directly impact the validity of the subsequent molecular dynamics simulations. If the underlying models are not accurately predicting energies and forces, the resulting simulations will not reflect realistic physical behavior, rendering the analysis and conclusions drawn from them questionable. The MD simulations are only as good as the force fields they are based on, and the current results suggest a lack of reliability in the force field predictions.

3. Authors claim that they propose three new challenging tasks. However, the evaluation of model generalizability to higher temperatures (Sec 4.4.2) is not new. Actually, it’s proposed by LinearACE [1] and this task has also been studied by Allegro, BOTNet, and MACE. Although these works are focused on energy and force errors, the conclusion that “OOD is challenging” is not surprising to me. The evaluation of model performance at higher temperatures, while important, has already been explored in prior work [1] and other studies. The conclusion that out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization is challenging is not novel, and the authors do not sufficiently differentiate their approach from existing literature in this regard. The lack of novelty in this task undermines the claim of introducing new challenging tasks.

4. Concluding insights in Sec 5 are not surprising to researchers studying graph neural networks for force fields. Technical novelty is very limited. The insights presented in the concluding section do not provide significant new information or perspectives to researchers already working in the field of graph neural networks for force fields. The conclusions drawn are largely expected and do not offer any substantial advancement in the understanding or application of these models. The limited technical novelty of the work reduces its overall impact and contribution to the field.

### Questions
1.	In Figure 3, does PDF refer to Pair Distribution Functions?
2.	Errors in energy and force are commonly used as evaluation metrics for force field prediction. The EV and FV proposed by this work are similar to these two metrics. Considering RDF is a good idea, but there’re more metrics can be considered to evaluate molecular dynamics. For example, RMSD and temperature are used in [2]. Could you discuss why other metrics like RMSD and temperature are not selected as metrics in this benchmark?
