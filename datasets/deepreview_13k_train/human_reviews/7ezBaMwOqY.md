# Trading-off Multiple Properties for Molecular Optimization

- Decision: Reject
- Scores: 6, 5, 5, 3

## Abstract
Molecular optimization, a critical research area in drug discovery, aims to enhance the properties or performance of molecules through systematic modifications of their chemical structures. Recently, existing Multi-Objective Molecular Optimization (MOMO) methods are extended from Single-Objective Molecular Optimization (SOMO) approaches by employing techniques such as Linear Scalarization, Evolutionary Algorithms, and Multi-Objective Bayesian Optimization. In Multi-Objective Optimization, the ideal goal is to find Pareto optimal solutions over different preferences, which indicate the importance of different objectives. However, these straightforward extensions often struggle with trading off multiple properties due to the conflicting or correlated nature of certain properties.  More specifically, current MOMO methods derived from SOMO are still challenged in finding preference-conditioned Pareto solutions and exhibit low efficiency in Pareto search. To address the aforementioned problems, we propose the \textbf{P}reference-\textbf{C}onditioned \textbf{I}nversion (PCI) framework,  efficiently ``inverting'' a pre-trained surrogate oracle under the guidance of a non-dominated gradient, to generate candidate Pareto optimal molecules over preference-conditioned distributions. Additionally, we provide theoretical guarantees for PCI's capability in converging to preference-conditioned solutions. This unique characteristic enables PCI to search the full Pareto front approximately, thereby assisting in the discovery of diverse molecules with varying ratios of properties. Comprehensive experimental evaluations show that our model significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in multi-objective molecular optimization settings.

### Summary
This paper proposes PCI (preference-conditional inversion) framework that aims to efficiently find the Pareto optimal solution for multi-objective (i.e., multi-property) molecular design that matches a given preference across the different objectives.
This is achieved by first training a differentiable surrogate model for the oracle, which is then used to guide the molecular optimization process.
In each iteration of this optimization process, PCI computes the non-dominating gradient and performs gradient descent to identify preference-conditioned "local" Pareto optimal solution, which is used to sample a discrete scaffolding tree and assemble it to the molecule.
Based on a synthetic example as well as a multi-objective molecular optimization task with various combinations of properties, the paper shows that the proposed PCI may provide an efficient way of exploring trade-offs between multiple properties in molecular optimization problems.

### Strengths
This paper proposes a novel approach, called PCI (preference-conditioned inversion), for multi-objective optimization, which may enable efficient search of Pareto optimal solutions that meet given preference vectors.
The construction of a differentiable surrogate oracle that can be used to efficiently identify local Pareto optimal solutions, which then can be used to iterative assemble optimized molecules that are Pareto optimal and meet the preference conditions is novel and interesting.
By comparing with other popular schemes for multi-objective molecular optimization, the paper motivates the proposed scheme and illustrates its potential benefits.
The synthetic example as well as the molecular optimization design tasks with various combinations of molecular properties (that are frequently used to evaluate molecular design algorithms) demonstrate the potential advantages of the proposed scheme.
The evaluations show that PCI effectively optimizes the property scores of top molecules outperforming all other alternatives considered in this study..
Furthermore, PCI shows good performance in terms of diversity and novelty, outperforming almost all (except for LigGPT in terms of diversity).

### Weaknesses
While the paper is overall well-written, there are a number of issues that need to be addressed.

1. It is unclear whether PCI will provide any clear advantage over other SOMO schemes applied to MOMO tasks via linear scalarization - *IF* one has a specific preference condition to impose on the multiple properties to be optimized.
In such a case, would there be any advantage for PCI compared to MOMO method via SOMO+scalarization?

2. Similarly, if one has not a single but still a "small" number of preference conditions the optimized molecules need to meet, what would be the advantage of using PCI compared to repeating MOMO via SOMO+scalarization for each of the preferences?

3. However, when one desires to explore the overall Pareto front for a variety of preferences, it seems that the proposed PCI scheme may begin to provide distinct advantages over MOMO via SOMO+scalarization, since the pre trained surrogate oracle can be put to good use for a large number of different preferences - despite the initial cost (e.g., in terms of oracle calls) of training the surrogate.
It would be very helpful if the authors could discuss when PCI would have clear advantages over other simple extensions of SOMO methods.

4. In Fig. 1(b), it is not very intuitive why linear scalarization would result in the optimization trajectories shown in the figure.
Please provide a detailed explanation of the LS optimization scheme that is illustrated in Fig. 1(b) and provide some insights as to why the scheme would prefer Pareto optimal solutions located near the end of the allowable preference regions.
This also applies to the results shown in Fig. 3(b).

5. I-LS is defined as a scheme that uses "the same inversion framework as PCI but adopts linear scalarization".
This is somewhat ambiguous, and it would be helpful if the authors could refer to the PCI diagram in Fig. 2 and clearly explain which part is changed and how.

6. I-LS seems to perform surprisingly well in the evaluations (e.g., Table 1 and Table 2), where PCI doesn't necessarily outperform I-LS by a significant margin for all performance metrics.
This again raises questions about the fundamental advantages of PCI over simpler scalarization-based approaches (e.g., comments #1-#3 above).

### Summary
For molecular optimization in drug discovery, it is essential to simultaneously optimize multiple properties that may either contradict or correlate with each other, such as efficacy, potency, safety, bioavailability, and ease of synthesis. This paper proposes a framework called Preference-Conditioned Inversion (PCI) for multi-objective molecular optimization in such discrete spaces, given a set of m objective properties with specified preferences. Firstly, a surrogate function that provides m objective function values for a given molecular graph is learned using the differential scaffolding tree (Fu et al, 2022). Then, within the convex hull of the gradient vectors of the m objective characteristics, the direction that most aligns with the given preference vector and moves towards the Pareto optimal solution is determined by solving a linear programming problem updating the differential scaffolding tree. After several iterations of this update, the discrete scaffolding tree is sampled and assembled into molecules, updating molecule x. By repeatedly updating in this manner, a Pareto optimal solution that aligns with the preference in the discrete molecular graph space is generated. When enumerating Pareto optimal solutions, they can be efficiently generated by systematically changing the preference. In the paper, the effectiveness of this method is demonstrated by first performing a sanity check on a synthetic task and then comprehensively comparing it with many baselines in an actual molecular optimization task.

### Strengths
In optimization with multiple objective functions, it is standard to use Linear Scalarization, which rewrites them into a single objective function by weighted sum based on a preference vector, and then optimize it. In discrete optimization like molecular optimization, which is the subject of this paper, it is known that the solutions generated by this Linear Scalarization fail to capture trade-offs and produce biased solutions. This point is also illustrated in Figure 1. On the other hand, evolutionary computation and multi-objective Bayesian optimization have issues in terms of computational efficiency and alignment with the given preference vector. The proposed method addresses the demonstrated shortcomings of these existing methods, providing an algorithm that efficiently searches for Pareto optimal solutions that align well with the given preferences, making it a practically valuable contribution.

Firstly, the paper learns m objective characteristics using differentiable methods and then freezes them. The idea of leveraging their differentiability to compute multiple gradient vectors and explicitly optimizing their convex combination with linear programming, and then sampling the locally optimal solutions to return to discrete optimization is technically very intriguing. The experimental results, which include comparisons with many methods including Linear scalarization on actual multi-objective molecular optimization benchmarks, show good performance.

### Weaknesses
The proposed method deals with molecular optimization given a preference vector, and a comparison with Linear scalarization is of primary interest. However, on several points, it is unclear why the proposed method is superior to Linear scalarization:

1. The procedure for the non-dominating descent direction by linear programming, which is the core of the proposed algorithm, Eq.(9), is designed based on the non-uniformity criterion, eq.(3). But this metric would not be assumed in Linear Scalarization. While it seems natural that the score for eq.(3) is better than LS if we assumed this scoring, the practical significance of this is unclear. It is not clear how this non-uniformity metric directly translates to better performance in the context of multi-objective molecular optimization, where the goal is to find a set of diverse Pareto-optimal solutions that satisfy the given preferences. The paper does not provide sufficient justification for why optimizing this specific metric leads to better solutions compared to directly optimizing a scalarized objective function, especially when the preference vector is explicitly provided.

2. Although this method is proposed as a framework, it heavily relies on the "differentiable scaffolding tree" method (Fu et al, 2022). It's unclear if this specific method is essential, or if other surrogate methods could also be suitable. Moreover, especially the procedure in the inversion step, "sample the discrete scaffolding tree", is not clearly described. A more detailed comparison with the experimental results of I-LS and PCI would be appreciated for readers to interpret the comparisons between I-LS and PCI. The paper lacks a thorough investigation into the sensitivity of the proposed method to the choice of the surrogate model. It would be beneficial to see experiments with different surrogate models to understand the robustness of the framework. The description of the discretization process is also too vague, making it difficult to assess the impact of this step on the final results. It is unclear how the sampling is performed, and what kind of guarantees are provided for the quality of the sampled discrete molecules.

3. This study seems to specialize insights from established multi-objective optimization research, specifically De ́side ́ri et al (2012) and Mahapatra & Rajan (2020), to multi-objective optimization in the discrete space of molecular optimization. If we assume that this work utilizes the existing "differential scaffolding tree" (Fu et al, 2022) and its sampling function as a differentiable surrogate for this purpose, its technical contribution would appears somewhat incremental.

### Questions
Q1. If the alignment to the given reference is evaluated using methods other than eq.(3), can we say that PCI is better than I-LS? Is this criteria of eq.(3) appropriate for this comparison?

Q2. Given that the paper's focus is on molecular optimization with a given preference, it seems natural to have multiple metrics. Are there no metrics other than the non-uniformity in eq.(3)?

Q3. What is the procedure for the "sample the discrete scaffolding tree" part? This process involves discretization, but can its effects be ignored?

Q4. This study heavily relies on the existing method of the differentiable scaffolding tree (Fu et al, 2022). Is it essential to use this method, or can the surrogate part be replaced with other methods? If it can be replaced, why was only the differentiable scaffolding tree used?

Q5. Is the standpoint of this study to specialize insights from general multi-objective optimization, namely De ́side ́ri et al (2012) and Mahapatra & Rajan (2020), for multi-objective optimization in the discrete space of molecular optimization? Or does it also provide new insights into general multi-objective optimization?

### Summary
The paper introduces a multi-objective optimization technique for molecular structures, termed preference-conditioned inversion (PCI). Experimentally, PCI outperforms traditional linear scalarization in probing the Pareto frontier. Nevertheless, its central concept isn't groundbreaking, having been previously documented in [1]. The non-trivial effort of converting the molecular design challenge into gradient-based optimization is attributed to [2]. While the work has merit, its technical novelty seems modest. The manuscript might be better suited for a chemistry-focused journal.

### Strengths
## Quality of the writing
The method is articulated lucidly.

## Significance of the problem
The task of navigating the Pareto frontier in molecular optimization is pivotal for various subsequent applications.

### Weaknesses
## Question of Novelty
The manuscript's primary shortcoming lies in its novelty. As mentioned earlier, the foundational concept was presented in 1987 [1], and an enabling step for translating the molecular design task to gradient-based optimization was introduced in [2]. Despite references to many SOMO methods favoring linear scalarization for multi-objectivity, I think the reason they chose linear scalization is that the their emphasis is on the algorithm development while an extension to MOMO is relatively trivial. It might be more apt to redirect this focus towards application.

## Concerns over Linear Scalarization Critique
The authors critique linear scalarization methods, arguing that they can't comprehensively traverse the Pareto solution merely by weight adjustments, as depicted in Figure 3(b). Contrarily, based on my experience, linear scalarization can navigate along the Pareto front toward both extremes, and with weight tuning and keeping all points visited during the processes, results comparable to PCI's can be achieved. It would be beneficial for the authors to record all points traversed during optimization and employ hypervolume as a performance metric.

## Generalizability of the Method
DST represents only a handful of cases that render the molecular design problem differentiable, enabling the application of gradient-based methods. The value of PCI is limited if it can not be adapted for broader molecular design techniques.

## Lack of thorough investigation
The authors recurrently state that MOMO's aim is to scrutinize the Pareto front, yet they predominantly highlight a single value representing an average of the top-100 molecules. A comparison of the Pareto fronts analyzed by PCI and LS would bolster their claims.
