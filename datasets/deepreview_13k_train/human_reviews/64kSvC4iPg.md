# Compressed Context Memory for Online Language Model Interaction

- Decision: Accept
- Scores: 6, 6, 5, 6

## Abstract
This paper presents a context key/value compression method for Transformer language models in online scenarios, where the context continually expands. 
As the context lengthens, the attention process demands increasing memory and computations, which in turn reduces the throughput of the language model.
To address this challenge, we propose a compressed context memory system that continually compresses the accumulating attention key/value pairs into a compact memory space, facilitating language model inference in a limited memory space of computing environments.
Our compression process involves integrating a lightweight conditional LoRA into the language model's forward pass during inference, without the need for fine-tuning the model's entire set of weights.
We achieve efficient training by modeling the recursive compression process as a single parallelized forward computation.
Through evaluations on conversation, personalization, and multi-task learning, we demonstrate that our approach achieves the performance level of a full context model with $5\times$ smaller context memory size.
We further demonstrate the applicability of our approach in a streaming setting with an unlimited context length, outperforming the sliding window approach.

### Summary
The paper proposes a novel compressed context memory system for dynamically compressing contextual information during online inference with language models. This allows the model to handle continually expanding contexts efficiently. 

The main contributions are:

- A compressed memory framework that condenses context into a compact representation which is dynamically updated during online inference. This reduces memory usage and computation compared to using the full context.

- A parallel training strategy using masked attention to learn the context compression in a single forward pass.

- A conditional adapter applied only to compression tokens to avoid overfitting to inputs during training.

### Strengths
- The problem of efficiently handling expanding contexts is highly relevant given the online nature of systems like ChatGPT. The paper addresses an important open challenge.

- The method is flexible and broadly applicable to diverse online inference scenarios like multi-task learning, personalization and conversation.

- Empirical evaluations across three datasets substantiate the memory and computation advantages over baselines. The method achieves slightly lower performance than the full context with 5x smaller memory.

- The parallel training strategy is effective in enabling large model optimization. The conditional adapter improves compression capability.

- The complexity analysis clearly articulates the efficiency benefits, and ablation studies validate the design choices.

### Weaknesses
 - The main limitation of the proposed compression framework is that it is task-specific. The compression module must be trained for each task, which requires additional data, computation, and cannot generalize to new tasks. This is a significant drawback in the context of foundation models which are trained on large datasets for general-purpose use.
- There is still a obvious gap in performance between the compressed and full context models. The paper does not provide a clear explanation for this gap. The authors should provide more analysis into why the compressed context is less effective.
- While the compression framework is novel, the proposed memory update functions are basic. More sophisticated memory update mechanisms could further enhance capability.
- The comparison is primarily with simple adaptations of fixed-context compression methods. A direct comparison to recurrent memory approaches, such as linear Transformers, would be more informative.

### Questions
1. **Task-Specific Limitation**: The framework is mentioned to be task-specific and requires retraining for each new task. Could you elaborate on how this limitation affects the scalability of the proposed method, especially in real-world applications where diverse tasks are common? Additionally, are there any plans or potential strategies to make the framework more task-agnostic?

2. **Additional Resources for Training**: Given that the compression module necessitates extra data and computational resources for training on each task, can you provide a quantitative analysis of the additional resources required compared to other existing methods? How does this additional overhead impact the practicality of adopting your framework, particularly in resource-constrained environments?

3. **Inability to Generalize**: The framework's inability to generalize to new tasks could be a significant disadvantage. Have the authors considered hybrid approaches that combine task-specific and task-agnostic components to mitigate this limitation? If so, what were the challenges or outcomes of these considerations?

4. **Performance Gap Analysis**: The paper notes a clear performance gap between the compressed and full context models. Could the authors provide a more in-depth analysis or hypotheses as to why this gap exists? Are there particular types of data or tasks where this performance gap is more pronounced?

5. **Basic Memory Update Functions**: The memory update functions in the proposed framework are described as basic. Could the authors provide examples or discussions on more sophisticated memory update mechanisms that could potentially enhance the framework’s capabilities? What prevented the integration of these more advanced mechanisms in the current version of the framework?

6. **Lack of Comparison to Recurrent Memory Approaches**: The comparison in the paper is mainly drawn with simple adaptations of fixed-context compression methods. Could the authors justify the choice of these particular baselines and discuss the reasons for not including a direct comparison with recurrent memory approaches, such as linear Transformers? How might the results differ with these additional comparisons?

7. **Explaining Effectiveness of Compressed Context**: In relation to the performance gap, could the authors shed light on any specific scenarios or data types where the compressed context performs particularly well or poorly? Understanding these nuances could help in better positioning the framework and identifying areas for improvement.

### Summary
In the LLMs era, during long-term online user-model interactions, a lot of past dialogue history cannot fit the context length of the model and thus have to be compressed into memory to ensure that the model can memorize the past dialogue. It is an emerging and interesting research question. This paper introduces a novel method to compress the long context memory in the online user-machine interactions, named CCM as well as two variants, merge and concat. As LLM is hard to fine-tune to engage such CCM, the author also adopts LoRA adapter to fine-tune LLM in a lightweight setting to engage the model to learn to compress the memory.

### Strengths
1. The paper is overall sound. The method design is concise, effective, and efficient. Compared with retrieval-based method to re-compute the sentence embedding, the CCM can directly adopt the KV cache of introduced <COMP> token as the memory vector for one utterance and utilize them in further inference. To engage the LLM to utilize such CCM, the parallel training and LoRA adapter are designed well for efficient adaptation.

2. The CCM is efficient in both training and inference. Firstly, there is no need to re-compute the sentence embedding and instead caching the attention keys and values. Secondly, the memory storage cost, the compression ratio, and the algorithmic complexity all demonstrate the efficiency of the method. Thirdly, LoRA based adapter tuning brings a lot of efficiency in memory-engaged adaptation.

2. The evaluation is comprehensive and diverse. Three important benchmarks, MetaICL, LaMP, and DailyDialog are selected for evaluation and MetaICL covers 26 tasks with high-diversity.

### Weaknesses
1. The CCM method is not that novel and has been explored well in some important early milestones before the creation of Transformer, i.e., Memory Networks, Fast Weights to Attend Recent Past. The author should mention and discuss the relation with these methods. Additionally, the Compress Transformer should be briefly introduced as it is not a universally known preliminary for readers.

2. In terms of the baselines, in the main tables, CCM is only compared with “no context" and "full context" baselines on accuracy, which lacks sufficient comparison for demonstrating the effectiveness of the method. As least, the retrieval-based method should be considered as an important baseline and it is now the universally-adopted method for memory compression. If I understand the paper correctly, the token embedding produced by <COMP> token is the same as a sentence embedding. The author can follow MemoryBank for adopting retrieval-based method to compress the long-context during online interactions. Other baselines like LongMem and UnlimitedFormer can be also considered but not necessary.

### Questions
1. For Table 4 and 5, can you add a new row to present the memory size using number of tokens, which is a more intuitive metric than the disk size in MBs?

2. For CCM-merge, it is a vanilla average of all memory features, which does not make sense. Typically, the latest memory might be more important and contribute more to the current dialogue turn. Is it possible to add a weighted coefficient in terms of time steps for a weighted merge on all memory features, i.e. $$Softmax([1:t_i])\in R^t$$? 

3. Missing references which have been mentioned in weakness section.

### Summary
This paper proposes an interesting method to compress context memory. Compared with previous context compression work, the main novelty and contribution claimed in this paper is its ability to handle dynamic contexts. Its idea is similar to RMT, letting the transformer to work in a recurrent memory mechanism. By inserting a compression token in the in-context manner like Gist, Autocompressor and ICAE, the method can process the context recursively into a constant memory cost. The experiments conducted on Meta-ICL, LaMP and DailyDialog dataset show a promising compression rate with full-context performance.

### Strengths
- A interesting method to compress contexts in the few-shot learning setting.

- The results evaluated in the few-shot learning tasks show the effectiveness and superiority over the conventional approaches like RMT and Gist.

### Weaknesses
While this paper presents a seemingly promising solution to long contexts, I have significant concerns about several limitations.

Firstly, one of the main focuses of this paper is handling dynamic context for interaction. Judging from its experimental design, it mainly conducts experiments with a fine-tuned LLM for few-shot learning scenarios, which are generally simpler tasks, all being multi-choice, or classification tasks. The methods primarily compared in this paper are general context compression or long context handling methods (general and generative tasks). This involves 3 issues. The first issue: for simpler tasks like classification, compression is relatively easy (this is why previous models were easily distilled but GPT was not; I believe it's not because GPT is hard to distill, but because GPT is not for a specific task, but a general model. The authors may better know what I said if reading the paper about information bottleneck: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1503.02406.pdf). Therefore, it's not surprising that this method achieves good compression results (model size compression and context compression are similar, both reducing model capacity), but I believe it's hard for this paper's method and results to scale to general scenarios. At least in this paper, I didn't see any general tests to prove its compression effect. The second issue: for the few-shot learning setting, adding compression tokens after the demonstration makes sense, but for general scenarios, there is no definite boundary to limit compression tokens, making this method hard to generalize. Even if a compression token can be added every K tokens, this approach would lead to inefficient training, as a large amount of sampling is required to ensure the model learns well for each position. The third issue: the main setting of this paper is few-shot learning, and its main claim is online interaction. But for few-shot learning, there doesn't seem to be any online interaction. Users usually provide all demonstrations at once for the model to give an answer, and it's hard for me to imagine a setting where users incrementally provide demonstrations to the model.

Secondly, for dialogue tasks, this is a context compression for a specific task (more preciesely, for a specific dataset). Similar to what I mentioned above, if it's for a specific task/benchmark, there is actually a lot of compression space, which has been discussed in many previous works, such as: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2301.12726.pdf. For context compression of a specific task, even without this method, other methods should also achieve good compression results.

Thirdly, I am not entirely convinced by the results presented in the paper. For example, in Table 15, the performance of RMT is almost the same as that of No context, which is hard to believe. Moreover, Table 15 is an experiment conducted on OPT-2.7b. The few-shot learning ability of the 2.7b OPT model, as far as I understand, should be very weak, and changes in the order of sample arrangement will significantly affect the results. For a method like this paper's, which is similar to a recurrent method, it should be very easily influenced by later samples. Unfortunately, I didn't see any discussion about this.

### Summary
This paper proposes a way to compress LLM context in an online setting, such as conversation, where more information could arrive and needs to be compressed. Here are the contributions:
1. Extended the gisting technique to multi-context settings, and demonstrated the gains are better than naively adapting gisting to this setting. Further, the authors show that the proposed technique has very little gap with no compression, on three datasets.
2. The authors also have proposed a parameter efficient method for training this mechanism, which doubles as a regularization. They also proposed an efficient way to train the model, by parallelizing the originally sequential context segments.
3. Finally there are ablation studies on various design choices, such as the conditional adapter, the model architecture etc.

### Strengths
The exact method proposed is novel. On the three presented datasets, it seems to work pretty well, judging from the small gap between compressed and uncompressed setups. The problem this paper is trying to address is very important to the field, and I believe this work has significant contributions. Finally, the paper is generally easy to read.

### Weaknesses
This method could be evaluated on more diverse datasets, such as those used for long context, by utilizing a sliding window for example. From my perspective, this work has the potential to be applied more broadly beyond ICL, or dialog. It'll also be nice to have the comparison with RMT and AutoCompressor in the main text, as they are very relevant for this problem.

In eq (1), $h(t)$ is conditioned on $Mem(t - 1)$. However, in figure 4, and the description of the parallelized training procedure, it's unclear how this could be done, as all the $Mem(*)$ are computed after $h(*)$, for the same layer. Do you condition $h(t)$ on the previous layer's $Mem(t - 1)$? If so please update the text to make it obvious.

The motivation for the conditional adapter is to regularize against overfitting. The authors only reported the training loss of LLAMA 7B without context. To make it more clear on the overfitting situation, could you also report the loss with context, and the test performance with and without context.

The masking doesn't seem to be autoregressive in figure 4b?

Table 3 only has numbers on MetaICL. What about the other two datasets?

In section 4.2, on different model architecture, have you tried non instruction tuned T5? From what I can tell, instruction following is not necessary for the three datasets used in the paper.
