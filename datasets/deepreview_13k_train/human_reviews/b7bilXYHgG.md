# Counterfactual Fairness for Predictions using Generative Adversarial Networks

- Decision: Reject
- Scores: 5, 5, 5, 5

## Abstract
Fairness in predictions is of direct importance in practice due to legal, ethical, and societal reasons. It is often achieved through counterfactual fairness, which ensures that the prediction for an individual is the same as that in a counterfactual world under a different sensitive attribute. However, achieving counterfactual fairness is challenging as counterfactuals are unobservable. In this paper, we develop a novel deep neural network called \emph{\methodlong}~(\methodshort) for making predictions under counterfactual fairness. Specifically, we leverage a tailored generative adversarial network to directly learn the counterfactual distribution of the descendants of the sensitive attribute, which we then use to enforce fair predictions through a novel counterfactual mediator regularization. If the counterfactual distribution is learned sufficiently well, our method is mathematically guaranteed to ensure the notion of counterfactual fairness. Thereby, our \methodshort addresses key shortcomings of existing baselines that are based on inferring latent variables, yet which (a)~are potentially correlated with the sensitive attributes and thus lead to bias, and (b)~have weak capability in constructing latent representations and thus low prediction performance. Across various experiments, our method achieves state-of-the-art performance. Using a real-world case study from recidivism prediction, we further demonstrate that our method makes meaningful predictions in practice.

### Summary
This work proposes to use GAN to estimate counterfactual mediators. Although the method is shown to have strong empirical performance, there is no theoretical guarantee on the error of estimated counterfactual mediators, which can lead to arbitrarily unfair predictors given the proposed regularization relies on the generated counterfactual mediators.

### Strengths
- Empirically, the authors show, in some synthetic/semi-synthetic settings, their method can magically infer counterfactual mediators by learning from observational data. In addition, their method outperforms various baselines from the counterfactual fairness literature.
- Paper is well written, it is easy to read.

### Weaknesses
 - There is no discussion on the identification of counterfactual mediators. The authors need to show this before developing estimators for counterfactual mediators.
- The generator is trained on factual data only, there is no guarantee on the error of its generated counterfactuals. This would further lead to ineffectiveness of the discriminator as it is trained on generated counterfactuals. Similarly, In Lemma 1, the upperbound has a term ||M_{A'},âˆM_{A'}|| which is not computable, so, the minimizing the loss function Eq.(8) cannot guarantee the LHS of Eq.(9) is minimized.



### Questions
- In the literature, there are works on issues of methods that learn a ML model to predict counterfactuals for counterfactual fairness [1,2]. [1] points out that one can learn a model to predict counterfactuals iff a specific strong ignorability holds, i.e., A is independent of potential mediators M_a. In another words, the dataset is collected without selection bias, which is represented by a collider S \in \{0,1\} s.t. A->M, A->S, M->S and we can only observe samples from P(A,M|S=1). [2] argues counterfactual fairness is similar to demographic parity as (1) any predictor satisfying counterfactual fairness also satisfies DP and (2) any predictor satisfying DP can be modified trivially to satisfy counterfactual fairness. The authors may want to add a discussion about them.

- It is vague in Fig. 1 that whether the authors allow just correlation between X and A or there has to be a causal relationship X->A.

- The claim that one can include anything in the mediator if the domain knowledge is missing sounds not solid.

- Inconsistent notations: If M_a is the potential outcome, why do we need M_{A-\leftarrow a}?

- Parenthesis mismatch in Eq.(9).

- For Adult, how do the authors know marital status, education level, occupation, hours per week, and work class are mediators? How is the counterfactual fairness metric computed without knowing ground truth counterfactuals?

### Summary
The paper studies the issue of counterfactual fairness. It’s concerned with making predictions that are fair towards individuals, ensuring that the prediction would remain the same if the individual belonged to a different demographic group defined by sensitive attributes like gender or race. The proposed method use GAN for counterfactual mediator generation to ensure fairness while maintaining high prediction performance. Experiments are conducted to evaluate the method, including a real-world case study on recidivism prediction.

### Strengths
1. The paper addresses an important aspect of fairness in machine learning, ensuring that predictions are fair at an individual level.

2. The paper presentation includes rich contents, with tables and figures well organized. The writing is generally easy to follow.

3. The proposed method is validated through various experiments, including synthetic datasets and a real-world case study. The paper claims to achieve sota performance, and code is provided.

### Weaknesses
1. The theoretical analyses in 4.3 does not provide much insight or guarantee. The lemma states that the level of counterfactual fairness is upper-bounded by the performance of the counterfactual mediator generation and the counterfactual mediator regularization. This does not really takes an equation to be concluded, and it cannot say anything about whether the method would be effective or not.

2. Following the above point, the method does not have guarantee in achieving counterfactual fairness.

3. Though the authors compare this work with CFGAN, the use of GAN for generation-based counterfactual fairness makes the technical contributions largely alike, which impairs the the novelty of the proposed method.

### Summary
The paper "Counterfactual Fairness for Predictions using Generative Adversarial Networks" tackles one of the most challenging definition of fairness from the fair ML community, the counterfactual fairness, which is also probably the most conceptually appealing if effective. The goal is to insure for any individual that the outcome would be the same if the individual has a different value of a sentifive attribute (e.g., gender). As many attributes of the individual can be influenced by the sensitive, it implies to build a mechanism to imagine how the individual would look like for the other - counterfactual - sensitive value. Authors of the paper propose to build on a GAN architecture, which has already been employed for that purpose, but in a different way where the approach was to generate causal and interventional data, from which counterfactual fairness could be achieved. The proposed approach is more simple, proposing to generating a counterfactual representation of individual more directly, with a specific min max objective.

### Strengths
Clarity : I feel the paper very well-written and structured (maybe some introductional discussion and examples  could be given to help a uneducated reader with challenges with counterfactual fairness), very easy to read from the clear definitions of every component. It is nice to read such a self-contained paper, many papers I had to review recently had a lot of ill-defined notations, I was happy to read this one. 

The tackled setting is also very appealing and challenging. 

The method looks to achieve interesting results.

### Weaknesses
I have some concerns about soundness of the approach, positioning and the experiments. see questions below.

Positioning w.r.t. state of the Art

1. Related work say that VAE based methods fail because they capture correlations between the sensitive and the latent representation. Authors should at least mention that most cited approaches (e.g. Grari et al.2023) have regularizers that seek at removing these correlations. I cannot see why the proposed approach would be really better on that point, as I feel the discriminator makes some similar job as, for instance, VAE with adversarial loss that seek at reducing mutual information between the latent and the sensitive of these approaches. 

2. One mentioned limitation of VAE is "It is commonly assumed that the prior distribution of latent variables follows a standard Gaussian in VAEs", that would hinder the prediction ability. While I agree that VAE is more constrained than GAN since there is a need for choosing a distribution family that strongly affects the results if is does not well fit the data, this problem is about the decoding distribution, not the encoding one, as having a latent space structured using a gaussian is something usually desirable. Note that GAN also use a  sampling from a standard gaussian in the latent space... What do you think ?   

3. CFGAN: In appendix B3, authors point out than one of the main difference with CFGAN is that this approach only achieves interventional fairness, not counterfactual. From my point of view this is not true since, as explained in their section 3.5 counterfactual samples are generated by 1) generating samples from the causal model  2) selecting the z that led to the generation of a given class of the sensitive and finally 3) generate a new sample for each selected z, by interventioning on the sensitive, to get a counterfactual sample for each of them. Thus, a predictor can be learned on that data, with a regularization that ensures that both versions of individual lead to similar outputs. It is countefactual fairness as every varariables depending on the sensitive can be impacted. That is not only P(Y|X,do(A=a))=P(Y|X,do(A=a')) since X and Y are regenerated after intervention (using the same z in factual and interventional world allows to follow the counterfactual fairness objective that is mentioned in the paper).          

Soundness of the objectives

1. Authors consider a causal graph where X->A, but suggest in fig1 that there can exist some correlations between X and A, implying some cofounder that causes both. If there are in the data distribution for instance more old women than old men, and assuming Y is lower for women than for men, then I suspect that the regularization term in (7) cannot have any strong impact on that bias. X remains the same for factual and counterfactual, only M changes, which can be ignored by h if most of the information for outputting Y is in X. Please discuss that remark. 

2. I am surprised to see that the proposed adversarial objective is greatly asymmetric, as it never considers counterfactuals produced for individuals from the A=1 class. The adversarial loss is indeed weighted by A for the factual part and 1-A for the counterfactual one (which is 0 in the case A=1). Denoting as M_{i,j} the output of the generator for an individual from class i and intervention using j as the sensitive value, we M_1,1 steered toward M from Lf and far from M from Ladv; M_0,1   steered toward M from Ladv; M_1,0   steered toward M from Lf; and M_1,0 is totally free... Isn't it a problem ? I suspect that it can report most of the fairness effort on the A=0 class. Also, I am not sure if this does correspond to a well-defined optimization problem since there may exist many equivalent optima, no ? having M_1,1 = M   looks very likely at the end of the optimization (with G  outputting a very different value for M_1,0 which is unconstrained).  


Experiments

1. Comparative experiments are performed on semi-synthetic datasets, where we can get both factual and counterfactual versions of the data. However, I feel that the generative process that are considered are too easy to fully analyze, as 1) there is not correlation between X and A (which can be unfair regarding the previous remarks above) and 2) M is deterministically deduced from X and A, which appears as a really easy setting : First,  authors show in table 1 that counterfactual M can be generated accurately from their generator. However, this is not fully convincing (and does not reassure me about the asymmetry issue mentioned above), as it is easy to fully understand the relation between (X,A) and M only from samples from the 0 class (A=0). M_A' is well generated for the class A=1 thanks to this, but I am really not sure that is would applied in more difficult settings. Second, for such a setting we could design a very simpler approach that learn h(X,A) to be close to Y while limiting the distance between h(X,A) and h(X,A'), which would be at least as effective. 

2. Comparison with competitors only performed on semi-synthetic- not fully convincing - datasets. I know that countefactual fairness is difficult to fully evaluate, but wouldn't it be possible to conduct some analysis on the results of some competitors also, to see if there is impact of the improvements observed on synthetic data ? 

3. To be fully self-contained and reproducible, as every competitor has many variants inside their paper, with sometimes non trivial application for the considered setting, it would be nice to have in appendix the pseudo-code of each of the considered approach, at least ADVAE and CFGAN.      

Minor : the "," should be replaced by a "-" in every regularization (7) or metric (9) formulations.

### Summary
The paper proposes a method that learns predictor under counterfactual fairness. It first learns the counterfactual distribution of mediator (variables that are causally affected by sensitive attribute), based on which establish counterfactual mediator regularizer. Finally, the predictor is trained by enforcing such a regularizer. The paper conducts experiments to validates the proposed method on three datasets (sythentic, Adult, COMPAS).

### Strengths
1. Learning counterfactual fair predictors is an important problem. Unlike existing methods that learn counterfactual samples, the paper learns counterfactual distributions which are novel to my knowledge.
2. The paper is in general well-written and organized.

### Weaknesses
1. The paper focuses on binary-sensitive attributes. It is unclear whether the proposed method is applicable to settings where sensitive attribute has multiple categories. Specifically, for each $a$ sensitive attribute may take, do we need a GAN to learn the corresponding counterfactual distribution? Or do we only need a single GAN to learn “averaged counterfactual distribution?” It is not clear how the method would scale with an increasing number of sensitive attribute categories, both in terms of computational cost and the complexity of the learned distributions. Furthermore, the paper does not discuss the potential challenges of learning a joint distribution over counterfactual mediators for multiple sensitive attribute categories.
2. While the paper establishes an upper bound on the violation of fairness, the bound seems to be very trivial. The strength of fairness is controlled empirically by hyper-parameter $\lambda$. The paper does not provide sufficient theoretical justification for the choice of the hyperparameter, nor does it discuss how the optimal value of $\lambda$ might vary across different datasets or problem settings. The bound itself does not seem to offer practical guidance for setting $\lambda$ and its reliance on empirical tuning could limit the generalizability of the method.
3. The paper claims that existing works that rely on inferring latent variables may hurt prediction performance by introducing bias, and it argues the proposed method can mitigate such an issue. However, learning counterfactual distribution is often more challenging than generating counterfactual samples, and it can also be hard to stabilize the training of GAN. Although the paper empirically shows on synthetic data that the proposed method can attain a better utility-fairness trade-off than baselines, it is unclear how it performs in more complicated settings. The paper does not provide a detailed analysis of the GAN training process, including convergence behavior, sensitivity to hyperparameter choices, and potential failure modes. Furthermore, the paper does not discuss the computational cost associated with training the GAN, relative to methods that directly generate counterfactual samples.

### Questions
1. Because only factual mediators are observable, how can the generator ensure the generated counterfactual mediators are accurate? To my understanding, the generator’s accuracy is ensured via construction loss between generated factual mediators and actual factual mediators. Can it imply the accuracy of counterfactual mediators?
2. How can the method be generalized to settings with more than 2 social groups?
