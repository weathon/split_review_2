# DiffusionShield: A Watermark for Data Copyright Protection against Generative Diffusion Models

- Decision: Reject
- Scores: 6, 3, 8, 5

## Abstract
Recently, Generative Diffusion Models ({\GDM}s) have shown remarkable abilities in learning and generating images, fostering a large community of {\GDM}s. However, the unrestricted proliferation has raised serious concerns on copyright issues. For example, artists become concerned that {\GDM}s could effortlessly replicate their unique artworks without permission. In response to these challenges, we introduce a novel watermark scheme, \ourmodel, against {\GDM}s. It protects images from infringement by encoding the ownership message into an imperceptible watermark and injecting it into images. This watermark can be easily learned by {\GDM}s and will be reproduced in generated images. By detecting the watermark in generated images, the infringement can be exposed with evidence. Benefiting from the uniformity of the watermarks and the joint optimization method, \ourmodel ensures low distortion of the original image, high watermark detection performance, and lengthy encoded messages. We conduct rigorous and comprehensive experiments to show its effectiveness in defending against infringement by {\GDM}s and its superiority over traditional watermark methods.

### Summary
The paper introduces an image watermarking technique designed to protect data from being employed in the training of diffusion models. This problem is of significant importance, and the current literature lacks such watermarking solutions. The authors present findings indicating that the "pattern uniformity" metric significantly influences diffusion models' capacity to replicate the watermark. They demonstrate that existing watermarking approaches exhibit inadequate pattern uniformity, rendering them inappropriate for this task. Empirical results in the paper showcase the superior performance of DiffusionShield in comparison to existing methods, even when working with a more limited perturbation budget.

### Strengths
+ The paper offers a comprehensive examination of how "pattern uniformity" impacts the watermark's effectiveness in the specific task at hand.

+ In the absence of any corruption, the suggested watermark achieves a high level of bit accuracy while requiring a relatively low perturbation budget.

### Weaknesses
 + Insufficient evidence exists to establish the reliability of the classifier that is used to filter the generated images that require protection.

+ The paper does not include an examination of the method's false positive rate and AUROC.

+ The paper does not offer an analysis of the robustness of their watermark against recent attacks known to compromise imperceptible watermarks.

+ Employing the same watermarking pattern for every image simplifies the learning process for potential attackers, making it easier to potentially break the watermark.

### Questions
The class-conditional evaluation lacks practicality, as real-world offenders typically do not assign specific class labels to the protected training data used for training diffusion models. In the case of unconditional generation, no definitive ground truth criteria are established for identifying which generated samples should be considered as protected. Currently, the authors define these protected images as those filtered using a classifier, which we will refer to as C. This approach raises concerns as the authors have not sufficiently demonstrated the quality of classifier C, and it may not accurately gauge the impact of protected training data on image generation. A more effective approach to assigning ground truth labels to generated images might involve utilizing an influence function to quantify the influence of protected training data on image generation.

It is imperative to conduct an analysis of the method's false positive rate, specifically to determine if the method assigns high bit accuracy to samples that should not be considered as protected data. This assessment could be performed using metrics like AUROC.

Regarding Table 4, the method exhibits a relatively low resistance to Gaussian noise. It is essential for the authors to specify the standard deviation (std) of the Gaussian noise applied in this context. Recent research has demonstrated the vulnerability of imperceptible watermarks to attacks involving significant Gaussian noise addition and subsequent denoising using diffusion models [1] [2]. Given that DiffusionShield relies on an imperceptible watermark, the authors should provide a thorough analysis of the watermark's robustness against such attacks, including assessments of bit accuracy and AUROC.

### Summary
This paper introduces DiffusionShield, a watermark to protect data copyright, which adopt the "pattern uniformity" to assist the watermark to be captured by GDMs. The current experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. However, I think the method is not practical enough.

### Strengths
- The idea of this paper is intersting. Addressing the root cause of infringement (i.e., watermarking released data) can make copyright protection more comprehensive and reliable.

### Weaknesses
- Details of parameter settings are best placed inside the main paper rather than in supplementary material. Besides, the details of the compared methods should give. For example, how to reproduce the HiDDeN---the noise layer follows the paper? If so, it may not be fair since there are no attack (e.g., JPEG compression) introduced in the experiment.
- The setting of the experments are not practical.
   - should defend against possible attack. At least, the author should consider JPEG compression and Resize attack which is very common in the real scenario. If the generated images are resized to other shape, does this method still work? 
   - should introduced high resolution images ([1] is a good example). I don't think it makes sense to validate with low resolution images because GDM usually generates higher resolution images.


### Questions
- It seems that each 4x4 basic block can represent 2bit (if B=4), so how to embed 128bit in CIFAR-10? For me, the message should be (28/4)x(28/4)x2bit=98bit, right?

### Summary
This paper tackles the problem of Generative Diffusion Models (GDM) using unauthorized images as training data and learns the style/distribution of those unauthorized images.

This paper introduces DiffusionShield, a watermark to protect data copyright. It is motivated by the observation that "pattern uniformity" can effectively assist the watermark to be captured by GDMs. This pattern uniformity is how uniform the watermark patterns are. That is, lower variance in watermark patterns can cause GDMs to learn watermark features before the actual features.

By enhancing the pattern uniformity of watermarks and leveraging a joint optimization method, DiffusionShield successfully secures copyright with better accuracy and a smaller budget. Theoretic analysis and experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of DiffusionShield

### Strengths
originality: the paper proposes a novel approach to watermarking the images to prevent malicious GDMs from using the training data without authorization. The method is simple and effective, supported by theoretical and experimental results.

quality: this paper is technically sound, both theoretical and experimental results are provided to support the claims. 

clarity: this paper is well-written and well-organized. the presentation is great.

significance: this paper is significant and addresses a very important problem in the field of GDMs -- data copyright protecting. GDMs nowadays are strong enough to learn any data distribution and able to replicate some novel images using the style of the creator without crediting. This is because there is no proof that the GDMs have used the images from the creator. This paper proposes a simple but robust method to help protect the creator's copyright on the data they own.

### Weaknesses
I notice this method mostly describes adding a watermark to the original images instead of the latent space which is commonly used by existing GDMs such as Stable Diffusion (SD). Although there is a section describing fine-tuning a SD and adding watermarks to the latent space, there is much less visualization/analysis on it. The author can provide more examples/analysis of adding a watermark to latent space and how it will affect the VAE encoding/decoding process. 

Further, the author can provide the cost of watermarking the images and it maybe not be likely that a content creator has the resources to watermark the images. 

Finally, I think there is less analysis on how DiffusionShield can protect against the removal attack --- if the malicious took the watermarked data, perform some augmentations on the data. Will the watermark still able to be detected?

### Questions
1. If the malicious took the watermarked data, perform some augmentations on the data. Will the watermark still able to be detected?
2. How about the feature distribution of the watermarked images? Although little pixel changes are not visible to the human eyes but may be more obvious in the feature distribution of some feature extractors.

### Summary
To address the potential copyright infringement caused by Generative Diffusion Models (GDMs), especially the unauthorized imitation of styles and appearances of the products from artists and fashion companies, the authors propose a novel watermarking technique called DiffusionShield. This model embeds secret messages into protected images in an imperceptible manner, ensuring that these watermarks are easily learned by GDMs and will be reproduced in other generated images. Existing watermarking techniques were not specifically designed for GDMs, making them either hard for GDMs to learn or requiring larger perturbations to maintain partial watermarks. In contrast, the authors develop a new watermarking technique tailored for GDMs, based on the finding that GDMs more easily learn watermarks with high pattern uniformity and theoretical prove that uniform patterns are prioritized in learning over the original images. To capitalize on this pattern uniformity, DiffusionShield introduces a blockwise strategy and a joint optimization method that not only further enhance detection accuracy but also reduce the budget. Finally, the authors validate their model’s superiority over existing methods in terms of visual quality and detection accuracy through various experiments, and demonstrating its effectiveness in both single-user and multi-user scenarios.

### Strengths
1. The article organizes the problem statement in a clear manner, offering a comprehensive discussion on protection scenarios, including both single-owner and multiple-owner cases.
2. The authors properly define "pattern uniformity"(Equation 1) and provide related theoretical explanation. They further conduct experiments to substantiate the significance of this concept.
3. The experiments are extensive, examining the influence of different Perturbation Budgets, Message Lengths, and Watermark Rates on bit accuracy. Additionally, in a multiple-owner scenario, the paper discusses the impact of multiple users on bit accuracy.
4. The performance is good. The proposed method achieves state-of-the-art bit accuracy and perturbation budget across multiple datasets and maintains superior robustness under various image distortions (except for gaussian noise).

### Weaknesses
1. The paper carries out extensive experiments but could improve in terms of layout. A considerable amount of experimental data is placed in the appendix, with minimal mention in the main text. As a potential user of this model, I would be particularly concerned about the issue of watermark rates. Specifically, it's worth questioning whether the proposed method remains effective when the training dataset contains only a limited number of watermarked images. Appendix F's Figure 11 briefly touches upon this issue, but this aspect should be more explicitly mentioned in the main text.

2. The paper employs the HiDDeN model for deep learning-based watermarking, which is no longer state-of-the-art (SOTA). Nevertheless, HiDDeN outperforms the proposed method in certain experiments, such as under the 'Uncond.' condition in Table 1 for CIFAR10 and in the  distortion method of Gaussian noise in Table 4. Therefore, the authors should utilize a state-of-the-art deep learning-based watermarking model to further substantiate the superiority of their method.

3. In the Implementation Details section, the authors build training dataset by "designating one random class of images as watermarked images, while treating other classes as unprotected images." While using images from the same class might be an ideal and simpler scenario that could further promote pattern uniformity, in real-world applications, images could come from various classes. The authors need to elaborate more on the effectiveness of their method under such circumstances.

### Questions
1. For the first weakness, I understand that due to the constraints of the main text's length, it might be challenging for the authors to include all experimental details. However, I would still suggest at least mentioning the experiment of watermark rates in the main body of the paper. This is merely a suggestion on my part; even if the authors choose not to adopt it, it won't lead me to lower my rating of the paper.

2. The second point of weakness is a significant concern for me. I hope the authors can provide direct experiments to alleviate my doubts. The state-of-the-art (SOTA) model that I'm currently aware of is "Towards Blind Watermarking: Combining Invertible and Non-invertible Mechanisms."

3. For the third weakness, I believe the authors need to conduct more comprehensive experiments to further substantiate the effectiveness of their method across multiple real-world scenarios.
