- Decision: Accept
- Scores: 6, 5, 8

## Abstract
Molecular Representation Learning (MRL) has proven impactful in numerous biochemical applications such as drug discovery and enzyme design.
While Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are effective at learning molecular representations from a 2D molecular graph or a single 3D structure, existing works often overlook the flexible nature of molecules, which continuously interconvert across conformations via chemical bond rotations and minor vibrational perturbations.
To better account for molecular flexibility, some recent works formulate MRL as an ensemble learning problem, focusing on explicitly learning from a set of conformer structures.
However, most of these studies have limited datasets, tasks, and models.
In this work, we introduce the first \underline{M}olecul\underline{AR} \underline{C}onformer \underline{E}nsemble \underline{L}earning (\ours) benchmark to thoroughly evaluate the potential of learning on conformer ensembles and suggest promising research directions.
\ours includes four datasets covering diverse molecule- and reaction-level properties of chemically diverse molecules including organocatalysts and transition-metal catalysts, extending beyond the scope of common GNN benchmarks that are confined to drug-like molecules.
In addition, we conduct a comprehensive empirical study, which benchmarks representative 1D, 2D, and 3D MRL models, along with two strategies that explicitly incorporate conformer ensembles into 3D models.
Our findings reveal that direct learning from an accessible conformer space can improve performance on a variety of tasks and models.

### Summary
This paper discusses the use of graph neural networks for ensemble-based learning of molecular representations. 
Specifically, the paper introduces a molecular conformer ensemble learning benchmark, with the aim of evaluating
the potential of learning on conformer ensembles. The idea behind casting this problem as an ensemble-based
learning problem is that this could help take into account the dynamic aspects of molecules. Generally, the paper
is well-written and contains a thorough comparison to state of the art results in the field.

### Strengths
The paper's main strength, in this reviewer's view, is that it thoroughly compares its approach to the state of the art. Its main value is
likely that it can serve as a benchmarking basis for various approaches in the field. The main original aspect is the use of an ensemble-based approach, which affords to incorporate the dynamical aspect of molecules. The paper is also well written and meticulous at comparing to the state of the art,

### Summary
This paper introduces a new benchmark named MARCEL, which consists of four tasks: Drugs-75K, Kraken, EE, and BDE. The goal is to evaluate the learning with multiple conformers for each molecule. In traditional evaluations of molecular machine learning, the dynamic nature of molecules taking on various possible conformers has been somewhat overlooked. MARCEL addresses this by setting up a possible set of conformers for each molecule and preparing a task to predict the Boltzmann average of molecular properties over the set of conformers, i.e. conformer ensembles. Using this benchmark data, the paper also provides comprehensive empirical evaluations of widely-used 1D, 2D, and 3D GNNs, also examining two strategies of ensemble learning in situations where a set of conformations can be used.

### Strengths
In molecular machine learning, considering the dynamic structural transitions of molecules is an extremely important point. While there are studies predicting molecular dynamics simulations through machine learning, and existing research examining the impact and significance of conformers on machine learning predictions, the data and tasks are extremely limited. Thus, objectively comparing multiple methods on the same foundation is challenging. In this context, the benchmark proposed in this paper is extremely intriguing. Moreover, even if one wishes to consider multiple conformers for each molecule in machine learning evaluations, preparing it can be difficult without specialized knowledge. Considering these points, establishing such a benchmark and sharing it within the molecular machine learning community has the potential to enable more constructive methodological research and analysis.

In this paper, not only is a dataset provided, but comprehensive baseline evaluations are also given that would be useful for researchers looking to enter this field of study. In particular, comprehensive evaluation is conducted using multiple popular GNN models in 1D, 2D, and 3D. These results offer insight into how machine learning methods at each representation level are affected by actual conformation changes, providing very valuable knowledge.

### Weaknesses
In the four tasks developed in this study, the objective is defined as predicting the Boltzmann average of various properties over multiple conformers. Under this goal setting, it seems intuitive that using information from multiple conformers would naturally improve prediction accuracy. Therefore, it has not been proven that 'considering multiple conformers contributes to machine learning predictions of real data (e.g., actual experimental measurements of molecules rather than computed values).' In this sense, the utility of this benchmark remains a bit artificial, and practical values would be unclear.

It is possible that machine learning predictions based solely on the ground-state structure, as traditionally done, are already practically useful. Regarding how considering multiple conformers contributes to molecular machine learning, the contribution of this study might be limited.

Additionally, since all four datasets prepared are secondary data from referenced primary data, it's unclear how challenging it would be for researchers to prepare them on their own. While the paper mentions quality control and the removal of redundancies, it's unclear whether there is any original information added to this study.

### Questions
Q1. While Drugs-75K, a subset of the GEOM-Drugs [27], Kraken [33], EE [34], BDE [36] all have associated citations, indicating they are secondary data, it was unclear whether the presented datasets are a simple curated version of these primary data, or if any original information was generated in this study. If there is any original information, it would be very helpful to be clarified.

Q2. Regarding 'Dataset preparation' in the Supplementary Material, why are different methods used to generate conformers depending on the data? (Auto3D for Drugs-75k, Q2MM for EE, Open Babel with DTF?) Is this point not problematic for benchmarking several methods?


Q3. While I understand that the 'two conformer ensemble learning strategies' are useful for predicting the 'Boltzmann-averaged value of each property across the conformer ensemble,' can they be said to be generally useful for predicting molecular properties? Could you provide any supported evidence for this claim?


Q4. Is the BDE task also about predicting the Boltzmann-averaged value?

### Summary
This work presents MARCEL, a novel dataset and benchmark for studying molecular conformer ensemble learning. MARCEL curates multiple datasets in which every molecule has many molecular conformers, and benchmark several baseline methods for predicting molecular properties from multiple molecular conformers.

### Strengths
Originality: This work curates novel datasets and benchmarks for an under-explored problem of molecular conformer ensemble learning.  
Quality: Detailed information about dataset curation, baseline experiment settings and results are clearly elaborated.  
Clarify: The writing of this paper is excellent and well-organized.  
Significance: The presented MARCEL benchmark will be useful and impactful for researchers to develop novel molecule representation learning methods on multiple molecular conformers.

### Weaknesses
(1) For 3D models, it is recommended to add at least one 3D graph transformer models as baseline, such as Equiformer [1].
(2) It is recommended to add discussions about [2] as [2] proposes a molecular conformer ensemble learning module named ConfDSS. Also, it is recommended to add it as a baseline if it can be applied to the task in MARCEL.

### Questions
In Table 2, which molecular conformers are used as inputs to 3D graph neural network models?
