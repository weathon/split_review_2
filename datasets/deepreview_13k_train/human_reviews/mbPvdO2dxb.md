# Meta-Guided Diffusion Models for Zero-Shot Medical Imaging Inverse Problems

- Decision: Reject
- Scores: 6, 6, 3, 5

## Abstract
In the realm of medical imaging, inverse problems aim to infer high-quality images from incomplete, noisy measurements, with the objective of minimizing expenses and risks to patients in clinical settings. The Diffusion Models have recently emerged as a promising approach to such practical challenges, proving particularly useful for the zero-shot inference of images from partially acquired measurements in Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and Computed Tomography (CT). A central challenge in this approach, however, is how to guide an unconditional prediction to conform to the measurement information. Existing methods rely on deficient projection or inefficient posterior score approximation guidance, which often leads to suboptimal performance. In this paper, we propose \underline{\textbf{B}}i-level \underline{G}uided \underline{D}iffusion \underline{M}odels ({BGDM}), a zero-shot imaging framework that efficiently steers the initial unconditional prediction through a \emph{bi-level} guidance strategy. Specifically, BGDM first approximates an \emph{inner-level} conditional posterior mean as an initial measurement-consistent reference point and then solves an \emph{outer-level} proximal optimization objective to reinforce the measurement consistency. Our experimental findings, using publicly available MRI and CT medical datasets, reveal that BGDM is more effective and efficient compared to the baselines, faithfully generating high-fidelity medical images and substantially reducing hallucinatory artifacts in cases of severe degradation.

### Summary
Sparse-data reconstruction in CT and MR imaging is modeled as an ill-posed linear inverse problems subject to noise.
Similar to the DDNM (Denosing Diffusion Null-space models) algorithm for MRI reconstruction, the authors use diffusion denoising,
but replace the backprojections in DDNM with a bi-level MGDM approach relying upon a regularized outer objective and an inner expectation approximation.
Simulated comparisons with competing approaches demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed approach.

### Strengths
1. The authors demonstrate improvements in terms of pSNR and SSIM (an image quality metric) over competing algorithms for both fastMRI datasets via simulation and for CT simulations using real LIDC CT reconstructions as digital phantoms.

2. The ablation study in Sec. 4.4 and Table 3 clearly demonstrates that the regularized proximal optimization plays the most substantial role in the proposed MGDM method.

### Weaknesses
1. Two extra parameters $\zeta$ and $\rho$ are introduced in the proposed Algorithm 2 (MGDM sampling) in comparison to Algorithm 1 (DDNM sampling).
It is clear not how much of the improvements over DDNM were obtained by painstakingly tuning these two new parameters.

2.
While a slice-wise 2D imaging simulation is appropriate for demonstrating the practical efficacy for MR reconstruction and
the MRI simulation, as in the fastMRI paper, appears to be realistic, the 1989 ESPIRIT reference for estimate the parallel multi-coil sensitivities appears to be incorrect.
The cited 1989 paper doesn't consider any special considerations for the parallel MR imaging problem and the correct reference appears to be:
ESPIRiT — An Eigenvalue Approach to Autocalibrating Parallel MRI: Where SENSE meets GRAPPA, by Uecker, et al., 2014.
This is the reference from the fastMRI paper by Zbontar et al.

3.
In the case of CT imaging, 3D cone-beam CT or helical CT are the common practical data acquisition techniques and 2-D simulations are not particularly convincing.
Please refer to the following paper for a reasonable 3-D simulation as well as results on real sinogram data:
Kim, Donghwan, Sathish Ramani, and Jeffrey A. Fessler. "Combining ordered subsets and momentum for accelerated X-ray CT image reconstruction." IEEE transactions on medical imaging 34, no. 1 (2014): 167-178.
It may be acceptable that the authors do not simulate practically important effects such as beam hardening, but a 2-D simulation and an FBP baseline can be misleading.
It is also common practice in CT reconstruction to use an anthropomorphic digital phantom during simulation in order to uncover reconstruction artifacts that might get hidden
when using a reconstructed CT image, itself full of noise and other artifacts.

4.
Some typos exist in the paper, e.g. "fidility" at the bottom of page 5.

### Summary
The paper proposes a new method for inverse problem in medical imaging. The goal is to apply Diffusion Models in medical imaging to produce high-quality images using incomplete and noisy measurements, aiming to reduce costs and risks to patients. To this end, a model named Meta-Guided Diffusion Model (MGDM) is introduced to address the challenge of guiding unconditional predictions to align with measurement information through a bi-level guidance strategy (an outer level and an inner level ). The outer level optimizes for measurement consistency, while the inner level approximates the measurement-conditioned posterior mean as the initial prediction. Empirical results on medical datasets in MRI and CT demonstrate that MGDM outperforms existing methods by generating high-fidelity medical images that closely match measurements and reduce the occurrence of hallucinatory images.

### Strengths
-  This paper provides an effective strategy for addressing medical imaging inverse problems in a zero-shot setting.
-  Empirical results show a clear improvement, consistently overcoming the state-of-the-art benchmarks, and exhibiting robustness across diverse acceleration rates, projection counts, and anatomical variation.

### Weaknesses
 - Seems the method is a combination of DPS (Chung et al., 2022a) and DDNM (Wang et al., 2022), which somehow limits the contribution of this paper.
- The 3D volumes are divided into 2D slices. How can the method ensure the consistency of the volume from other views, like sigital and coronal?

### Questions
- What do you mean by 'a novel class of "fully" probabilistic Deep Learning Models (DLMs)'?
- Seems in section 2.1 that there is no need to include both Discrete-time formulation and Continuous-time formulation, just introduce the one related to this paper.
- the proximity term penalizes deviations from the initial estimate, which seems like the data consistency in MRI acceleration?
- Is the pre-trained Guided diffusion model (from natural images) used here or the model is trained from scratch?
- Why did not test on the brain data from fastMRI? Can we share the same model for BraTS and brain from fastMRI?
- I am not quite sure what the mentioned 'zero-shot setting' is? For MRI accereration, we do have the fully sampled k-sapce data as the reference to train the neural network. What is the 'zero-shot setting' here?
- Can we share the model for different acceleration rates?

### Summary
This paper is tasked with using diffusion models to solve medical imaging inverse problems.
It proposes a new method based on an introduced optimization problem to derive the sampling of images from a diffusion model conditioned on measurements (typically the k-space or sinogram).
A series of experiments is then presented to showcase the effectiveness of the method

### Strengths
- the experiments are diverse and a ablation study is presented to get more insights
- the problem tackled is interesting and in a very thriving area of research

### Weaknesses
 - **Presentation**: the presentation needs to be reworked: for example one page is dedicated to introducing diffusion models, which I think is unnecessary; a few lines would suffice to introduce relevant notations and point to relevant references. There are a lot of typos which can be checked using grammarly or LTex (https://valentjn.github.io/ltex/vscode-ltex/installation-usage-vscode-ltex.html) or weird formulation (why zero-shot?). 
In addition, there are too many confusing notations, and it's difficult to piece how they interact together even with the figure or the algorithm (which would benefit from comments): for example when the ablation study is conducted, I don't what equations the different labels mentioned refer to.
- **Method**: the presentation of the method is very handwavy : there is no derivation of why this sampling is supposed to work even with very strong assumptions. The only "theoretical" grounding is proposition 3.1 which to me amounts a bit to mathiness given its simplicity. Another example is the introduction of the discrepancy gradient which is not discussed.
- **Results**: given how good the results are, it's important to question why the improvement is so big. If I focus on knee MRI reconstruction, there is a +4dB improvement in PSNR: this is absolutely huge but it isn't discussed. In particular, it should be viewed in comparison with fully supervised methods like the ones presented in the 2019 fastmri challenge which are nowhere near the performance reported here. 
- **Code**: while some code is provided, the README has not been updated from the Wang et al. repo, which makes it difficult to know how to look at the relevant code, i.e. where the new sampling method is introduced.


Nitpicks:
The paper is 10 page-long rather than 9, but it's just due to a figure that slipped into the 10th page.

### Questions
- How can the new sampling be derived using a bayesian formulation?
- How can you explain the gap between this work and previous works?
- What is (pr) i.e. proximal optimization and refinement?

### Summary
The paper titled: META-GUIDED DIFFUSION MODELS FOR ZERO-SHOT MEDICAL IMAGING INVERSE PROBLEMS presents a novel sampling strategy (MGDM) for solving inverse problems in medical imaging using diffusion models. Adopting a pre-trained unconditioned diffusion model to conform to the measurement constrain has been an open problem, though there have been quite a few attempts, its still not a well-solved problem. This work introduce an effective bi-level guidance strategy, that acts as a stronger regularizer. The authors evaluated the proposed algorithm on 2 MRI benchmarks and 1 CT benchmark, showing superior performance compared to existing SOTAs.

### Strengths
1. This paper introduces a novel yet simple sampling strategy (MGDM) for zero-shot medical imaging inverse problems. I like the core idea of range-null space analysis and using closed-form least square to better conform to the measurements. From the results, the improvements are significant with this simple clean design. 

2. The paper is well-written the theory, proof, figures. The core idea is clearly delivered. I truly enjoy reading it, very comprehensive. 

3. The authors evaluated the proposed approach on various benchmarks (2 MRI and 1 CT), the ablation studies are well-designed.

### Weaknesses
1. Miss the baseline comparisons with supervised method and [Robust compressed sensing MRI with deep generative priors]. I think the current benchmark comparisons are fair, but would curious on how MGDM compare to supervised methods [like MODL: https://arxiv.org/abs/1712.02862] and one of the earlier generative model for MRI recon using Langevin dynamics:  [Robust compressed sensing MRI with deep generative priors]. Specifically, the comparison with supervised methods is crucial to understand the trade-offs in performance and computational cost. The lack of comparison with  [Robust compressed sensing MRI with deep generative priors], which uses Langevin dynamics for reconstruction, makes it difficult to assess the advancement of the proposed method over earlier generative approaches.

2. Regarding BraTS dataset: In general, I'm not a big fan of BraTS dataset, since its real-valued images. Therefore, one big problem is that if you perform Fourier Transform, the k-space is conjugate symmetric, and the undersampling factor is not what it is. For example, ACR = 8 effectively represents ACR = 4, this can be miss leading. Please refer and consider citing the paper: https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2117203119 Implicit data crimes: Machine learning bias arising from misuse of public data, that discussed this problem. I won't against using BraTS (its a great dataset), but should mention this issue. This is a critical point that needs to be addressed to ensure the validity of the reported results, especially with high acceleration factors. The effective undersampling rate should be explicitly stated and justified. Meanwhile, I would appreciate more results on FastMRI dataset, I only see one visual example - Figure 5, without the undersampling pattern, and much descriptions. The limited results on FastMRI hinder the assessment of the method's generalizability across different MRI datasets.

3. From results in Figure 2, I am amazed but also confused on the third column ACR=24, despite the effective undersampling rate, with only a few lines, I don't expect the model accurately predicting the tumor. Could you please elaborate on this results? I would like to learn more on what you think? The reconstruction at such high acceleration factors is surprising, and a deeper explanation of the model's ability to recover fine details, such as tumor structures, is needed. It would be beneficial to discuss the limitations of the method at such extreme undersampling rates and the potential for overfitting to the training distribution.

Minor problems:

1. The figures are not of high-resolution and some of them are compressed. For example, Figure 5, I can actually see jpeg artifacts in all images, which is not acceptable for imaging related papers. Please fix this problem. Also the knee orientation is up-side-down, please fix it.

2. Wrong citation: In the Dataset Section, ESPIRiT is not cited correctly, should be [ESPIRiT — An Eigenvalue Approach to Autocalibrating Parallel MRI: Where SENSE meets GRAPPA], please fix it and check other citations.

### Questions
1. Please provide some comprehensive explanation on why MGDM can recover the brain tumor given such a high undersample rate.
2. Could you add some visual results for your ablation studies? I would want to see how the reconstruction results look like with different ablations.
