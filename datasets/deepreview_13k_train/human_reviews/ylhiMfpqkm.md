## Abstract
Generative Flow Networks (GFlowNets) are amortized samplers that learn stochastic policies to sequentially generate compositional objects from a given unnormalized reward distribution.
They can generate diverse sets of high-reward objects, which is an important consideration in scientific discovery tasks. However, as they are typically trained from a given extrinsic reward function, it remains an important open challenge about how to leverage the power of pre-training and train GFlowNets in an unsupervised fashion for efficient adaptation to downstream tasks.
Inspired by recent successes of unsupervised pre-training in various domains, we introduce a novel approach for reward-free pre-training of GFlowNets. By framing the training as a self-supervised problem, we propose an outcome-conditioned GFlowNet (OC-GFN) that learns to explore the candidate space. Specifically, OC-GFN learns to reach any targeted outcomes, akin to goal-conditioned policies in reinforcement learning. 
We show that the pre-trained OC-GFN model can allow for a direct extraction of a policy capable of sampling from any new reward functions in downstream tasks.
Nonetheless, adapting OC-GFN on a downstream task-specific reward involves an intractable marginalization over possible outcomes. We propose a novel way to approximate this marginalization by learning an amortized predictor enabling efficient fine-tuning.
Extensive experimental results validate the efficacy of our approach, demonstrating the effectiveness of pre-training the OC-GFN, and its ability to swiftly adapt to downstream tasks and discover modes more efficiently.
This work may serve as a foundation for further exploration of pre-training strategies in the context of GFlowNets.

### Summary
The paper  proposes the outcome-conditioned GFlowNet (OC-GFN) for reward-free pre-training and fine-tuning of GFlowNets in order for efficient adaptation to downstream tasks. OC-GFN is learnt to reach any specified outcome, and an amortized predictor is learnt to approximate an intractable marginal required for fine-tuning. The paper provides extensive experimental results to validate the effectiveness of their proposed approach.

### Strengths
1. The paper introduces a novel approach for reward-free pre-training and fine-tuning of GFlowNets, which can serve as a foundation for further research of GFlowNet pretraining.
2. The paper provides a thorough description of the proposed approach, including the formulation of the problem, the training procedures, and the evaluation metrics. The experiments are well-designed and conducted, and the results are presented clearly.

### Weaknesses
1. The paper lacks a comparison with existing approaches for pre-trained models or goal-conditioned RL methods.



### Questions
1. How does the proposed approach perform compared to existing methods for pre-trained models or RL methods besides DQN? and what about the computation cost of these methods?
2. Is the trained GAFlowNet necessary? What about its performance and how does it influence the results?

### Summary
The paper introduces a novel approach to pretrain generative flow networks (GFlowNet) in a self-supervised manner, focusing on aligning input with target outcomes. When adapting to a downstream task, there's no need to re-train the GFlowNet; instead, outcomes are integrated using Monte Carlo sampling. The authors cleverly introduce an amortized predictor to overcome sampling challenges.

### Strengths
The concept presented in this paper is both simple and elegant. The unsupervised fine-tuning approach offers a significant contribution, adeptly addressing the training challenges associated with GFlowNet. Overall, the paper is well-structured and easy to follow, making it a valuable addition to the literature.

### Weaknesses
See questions.

### Questions
In the 'Discussion about applicability' section, the trajectory balance's inability to learn the stateflow function, and its subsequent inapplicability for converting a pre-trained GFlowNet on a new reward, is mentioned. Have the authors evaluated the sub-trajectory balance objective (as per Pan et al.) which does incorporate the state-flow function?

### Summary
- This paper tackles the problem of pretraining Generative Flow Networks (GFNs) and fine-tuning them to quickly approximate new sampling distributions.
- The authors take a reinforcement learning (RL) perspective, and observe that for GFNs the state-space, action-space, and transition probabilities remain unchanged for many problems of interests.
- This lets them apply goal-conditioned RL methods as a generic strategy to pretrain GFNs, which they dub outcome-conditioned GFNs (OC-GFNs).
- For fine-tuning, they show how to immediately adapt OC-GFNs when given the reward function of a downstream task (see Eq. 6). Since this involves the computation of an intractable sum, they amortize it with a learned predictor.
- The authors demonstrate the efficacy of their fine-tuned OC-GFNs on toy (GridWorld & BitSequence) and real-world biology problems (DNA binding, RNA generation, AMP generation), with some ablations on the toy problems.

### Strengths
- The exposition is generally clear, and I enjoyed reading the paper. The authors first present the goal-conditioning idea and how it applies to GFNs, then walk the reader through their derivation and assumptions for amortized adaptation. I especially appreciated Section 2 which gave a clear and concise background.
- The paper tackles an impactful problem for GFNs. While the pretraining solution is not particularly novel, it’s a neat application of goal-condition RL to an amortized sampling problem. The authors also figured out how to make it work on a wide range of problems, and provide several ablations in the main text and the appendix.
- The insight that a new sampling policy can be readily obtained from an outcome-conditioned flow is neat and, as far as I can tell, novel. This could spawn interest in outcome-conditioned flows and different ways to amortize Eq. 6.

### Weaknesses
 - There should be a discussions of assumptions behind the OC-GFNs pretraining. Namely, that transfer is only possible when the reward function changes but not if the action-space or the state-space change. Moreover, the goal-conditioning requires a well specified set of outcomes Y — presumably not all states s are terminal states — which makes the proposed method not truly unsupervised. This limitation is significant because it restricts the applicability of the method to scenarios where the underlying state and action spaces remain constant across tasks, which is a strong assumption that should be clearly stated. The requirement of a predefined set of outcomes Y also implies a degree of supervision during pretraining, which should be acknowledged and further explored. These limitations (together with the applicability mentioned at the end of A.2) could be stated explicitly in the main text, and left to future work.
- While there are enough benchmarks, I believe none include continuous action/state spaces. Moreover, the experiments only one GFN variant — the detailed-balance one, which is also used for OC-GFN. It would help validate the generality of OC if we had experiments showing it worked on these different settings. The lack of experiments with continuous state/action spaces is a significant limitation, as many real-world problems involve such spaces. Furthermore, the exclusive use of the detailed-balance GFN variant makes it difficult to assess the robustness of the proposed method across different GFN objectives. It would be beneficial to see experiments with other GFN variants, such as those based on trajectory balance or sub-trajectory balance, to demonstrate the broader applicability of OC-GFNs. Moreover, I’d be curious to know how other pretrained amortized sampling baselines (eg, VAEs, normalizing flows) fare against OC-GFN — and what about pretraining a GFN on task A (without OC) and fine-tuning it on task B?
- (minor) The second and fourth paragraphs of Section 4.2 mention the “reasoning potential” of GFNs, and that intractable marginalization leads to “slow thinking”. Are these anthropomorphisms really needed for this paper?
- (minor) I wished the preliminaries (Section 2) included a training objective like Eq. 5 & 9, and that these more clearly specified which are the optimization variables.
- Some typos, there maybe more:
    - p. 3: multi-objective what?
    - p. 4: “given a reward R a posterior as a function”
    - p. 4: autotelicly → autotelically?
    - p. 5: “in log-scale obtained from Eq. (5)” should be Eq. 4?

### Questions
- Please comment on the weaknesses outlined above.
- Figures 10 and 11, right: Why is adaptation slower for OC-GFN than GFN in the first few thousand iterations? This is surprising since one would hope pretraining helps bootstrap downstream performance as in vision / language / RL. If it’s an exploration phase, did you validate it and is there a way to side-step it?

### Summary
The paper describes a methodology for self-supervised reward-free pretraining of generative flow networks (GFlowNets). The authors propose a novel scheme for pretraining of GFlowNets and show its efficiency on a number of tasks. They also compare it with the baselines on a number of datasets. The authors include a number of improvements over the standard GFlowNets: 

- Self-supervised pretraining

- Target task finetuning (or should it be called, e.g., task transfer as it does not finetune the coefficients of the original model to the new task?)

- Amortisation procedure for the target task finetuning to alleviate the problem of high cost of estimation of the task-specific reward function (Eq 6)

### Strengths
- (Originality, Significance) A multifold methodological contribution (see above), which helps define new ways to train and use the GFlowNet models, most importantly, including the insight about transferring the model to the downstream task without re-training (Section 4.2)

- (Quality) Well-written paper

- (Quality) Thorough analysis of the method on a number of tasks

- (Reproducibility/Clarity) The paper appears to provide good explanation of the experimental conditions and therefore, addresses reproducibility well (apart from Q2)

### Weaknesses
 - (Soundness aspects) There are some questions to resolve about the motivation of the outcome teleportation module (see Q1), hence the current score. 

- Clarifications on the experimental setting (see Q2)

### Questions
Q1: 
While the experimental results show clear improvement when using the outcome teleportation module, the theoretical  motivation of Eq 4 still remains not entirely clear. The  original detailed balance equation represents the reversibility of the Markov chain; the proposed method, in contrast, does not satisfy such condition as it is seemingly assymetrical with backwards flow. One possible way would be to consider the right hand side a factorisation of the transition function $\tilde{P}_B(s | s’, y) = P_B (s | s’, y) R(x|y)$ but that won’t give $\int \tilde{P}_B(s | s’, y) ds = 1$. One can interpret it that it works as a regularisation of the loss function in Eq (5). Another related question relates to the transition between Eq 14 and Eq 15 in the Appendix related to the proof of this statement. It is not clear where did $R(x|y)$ disappear in between  Eq. (14) and (15). In the standard case of the detailed balance equation, that would have been a valid transition, but why is it valid for the non-1 R(x|y)?

Q2: Not sure I completely understand how the number of discovered modes (normalised and unnormalised) is calculated  (see Figures 10 and 11)?

Q3: “A remarkable aspect of GFlowNets is the ability to demonstrate the reasoning potential in generating a task-specific policy.“ Not sure the word reasoning would be the right way to describe it as I am not sure it is objective; despite not necessarily agreeing with the wording, I do think the meaning behind it, i.e. transferring to the task without re-training (Section 4.2), is a valuable aspect.
