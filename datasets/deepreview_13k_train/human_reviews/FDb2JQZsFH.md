# Attention-based Iterative Decomposition for Tensor Product Representation

- Decision: Accept
- Scores: 8, 6, 6, 6, 8

## Abstract
In recent research, Tensor Product Representation (TPR) is applied for the systematic generalization task of deep neural networks by learning the compositional structure of data. However,  such prior works show limited performance in discovering and representing the symbolic structure from unseen test data because their decomposition to the structural representations was incomplete. In this work, we propose an Attention-based Iterative Decomposition (AID) module designed to enhance the decomposition operations for the structured representations encoded from the sequential input data with TPR. Our AID can be easily adapted to any TPR-based model and provides enhanced systematic decomposition through a competitive attention mechanism between input features and structured representations. In our experiments, AID shows effectiveness by significantly improving the performance of TPR-based prior works on the series of systematic generalization tasks. Moreover, in the quantitative and qualitative evaluations, AID produces more compositional and well-bound structural representations than other works

### Summary
Background information: TPRs are an approach for representing compositional structure in vector space; they work by encoding a compositional structure via pairs of fillers - the components of the structure - and roles - the positions of the fillers in the structure. For instance, in the sentence “cats chase dogs”, the fillers could be the words “cats”, “chase”, and “dogs”, and the roles could be “subject”, “verb”, and “object”, respectively. Each filler and each role is represented with a vector, and these vectors are then combined via tensor products and matrix addition to produce a representation for the whole compositional structure.

What this paper does: The authors introduce an approach called Attention-based Iterative Decomposition (AID) designed to generate role and filler representations for models based on Tensor Product Representations (TPRs). TPRs require the input to be broken down into fillers and roles (both represented as vectors), and this is what AID is designed to do; it can be plugged into any TPR-based system as a way to produce the fillers and roles, which can then be processed in the way they normally are for TPRs. AID starts with an initial proposal for the values of the role and filler vectors. These values are then iteratively updated; at each iteration, each TPR component (i.e., role or filler) attends to the input elements, and the TPR components compete with each other for which component attends to which input element. The result of the attention process at each iteration is a new proposal for the role and filler vectors, which is then the input to the next iteration, until the iteration finishes and the final role and filler vectors are produced. The authors then run experiments where they test 3 TPR-based systems from prior work on 4 tasks that involve systematic generalization. They find that adding the AID module improves compositional generalization across tasks.

### Strengths
- S1: The paper addresses an important problem - namely, how to get neural networks to produce effective compositional representations.
- S2: The proposed AID module is intuitive and can act as a drop-in module in any TPR-based system, meaning that it will be straightforward for other authors to adopt.
- S3: AID shows very strong performance in the experiments, often substantially increasing accuracy over previous approaches.
- S4: The experiments are extensive, providing compelling evidence for the strength of the approach.
- S5: In addition to the experiments based on accuracy, there are also analyses of the structure of the learned representations, which deepen the analyses and lend insight into the ways in which the AID module is enhancing the representations.

### Weaknesses
 - W1: I believe there is a potential confound of number of parameters. That is, if I understand correctly, AID adds more parameters to the model. Therefore, it’s possible that the improvements created by AID are due to having more parameters rather than due to the effectiveness of the strategy. For most of the experiments, the difference in performance is so large that it’s probably not solely due to number of parameters, but for the Wikitext experiment, the improvement that AID brings is pretty small, so it does seem like a more important concern there. The most convincing way to address this concern would be have the same number of parameters in the model version that has AID and the model version that doesn’t; this could be achieved by, for example, making the feedforward size a bit smaller in the AID version than the non-AID version.
- W2: I believe that the paper mischaracterizes the binding problem. The binding problem is the question of how different attributes of a structure can be appropriately bound together; for example, given an image with a red square and a blue triangle, how can a system appropriately associate (that is, bind) colors and shapes in order to represent the fact that you have a red square and a blue triangle, rather than a blue triangle and a red square? There is a separate problem that I’ll call the “decomposition problem” (I don’t think this is a standard term, but it will be useful for this review), which is how to decide what the attributes of a structure are. The paper seems to use the term “binding” or “binding problem” when in fact what it talks about is the decomposition problem. Specific places where this occurs are in the abstract (“because of the incomplete bindings”, “can effectively improve the binding”), the second paragraph of the intro (“these works still have a binding problem”), and the first section of related work (“Binding problem”). The reason why I think that this work is not really about binding is that the part of the TPR formalism that does binding is the step where tensor products are used to combine fillers and roles; the AID module does not alter that portion of the formalism, which is why, properly speaking, I believe it is really about decomposition rather than binding. I would recommend updating the wording to clarify this point. 
- W3: I think the paper is not as careful as it should be at distinguishing facts (things that have been empirically demonstrated), goals (things that the authors want to achieve), and plausible guesses (things that we think are likely to be true but can’t be certain of). I would recommend rewording the paper to be more careful about these points; as it stands, some points are presented as facts when I believe they are in fact goals or plausible guesses, and this could potentially mislead readers about how clearly these points have been demonstrated. Here are the specific points that stood out to me:
    - The intro says “these works still have a binding problem … because the decomposition mechanism they employed relies on a simple MLP, which is known to be not effective in capturing the compositional nature of data.” I think that this is plausible but not something that can definitively be stated as a fact; a way to more clearly state what is known vs. not known would be “we find that these approaches still show some difficulties on compositional generalization, likely because the decomposition mechanism they employed relies on a simple MLP, which may not be sufficiently structured to learn the compositional nature of the data.” Specific motivations for these edits: adding “likely” to signal that this explanation is plausible but can’t be definitively said to be the cause; add “may” for a similar reason; changing “capture” to “learn”, because an MLP can capture anything (it’s a universal function approximator), so the actual difficulty would be when it needs to learn something.
    - At the start of section 2, I think the word “effectively” should be removed from “we illustrate how the AID module effectively decomposes”. This section doesn’t show that the AID is effective - that is not demonstrated until later, when there are empirical results. Similarly, near the top of page 4, I would remove the word “effectively” again; I don’t think this work demonstrates that competitive attention on its own is effective at decomposing (as opposed to competitive attention being effective when used in combination with the rest of AID, such as the appropriate initial_components).
    - At the start of section 3, and at the end of “Disentanglement analysis” under 3.1.1, I would recommend removing the word “consequently”. That word asserts a causal connection that has not been demonstrated (we know that the model gets better disentanglement and better task performance, but we can’t be certain that one causes the other); a more valid way to phrase this would be “These results demonstrate the AID module’s efficacy in capturing underlying factors during TPR component generation, which may explain why the AID improves task performance.”
    - Near the top of page 7, it says that AID generates “more accurate representations.” I don’t think that “accurate” is the right word here; a better phrasing might be “representations that better conform to the formal requirements that Smolensky established for ideal TPRs”
- W4: Some aspects of the experimental setup were not clear to me. First is what the input features are; see Q1 below. Second is that I found it somewhat difficult to understand exactly how the tasks worked; this concern could be addressed by providing some examples of the tasks (ideally in the main paper, or in an appendix if there isn’t room). For example, it’s not clear to me what the inputs are in the SAR task - is it just one x and one y? Or a sequence of x’s and y’s, and if so how are they arranged - x y x y x y, or x x x y y y? And how is the model presented with an x?

### Questions
- Q1: What are the input features? I was unable to figure this out. Specifically, is each input feature one object (such as one word)? Or is it one element within a vector representation? From most of the paper I was assuming that it was one object. However, I normally associate the word “feature” with an element of a vector representation. Also, if the input features are objects, that makes me confused about why N_inputs is considered a hyperparameter in Figure 5, since that’s really a property of the task rather than a hyperparameter. One thing that could help to clarify this is to show an actual example from an actual task in Figure 1, so that we can see what wach input feature is in the context of that task.
- Q2: Near the top of page 4, it says that producing initial_components from the concatenated input features assigns symbolic meanings to each component, such as roles and fillers. I don’t understand how it achieves this. I can understand why this would be useful (because it would provide a better/optimized starting point), but I don’t see how it pushes each component to have a particular symbolic meaning such as “roles” or “fillers”

### Summary
The work proposes using iterative attention for learning Tensor Product Representations (TPR), meant to improve their systematic generalization capability, as measured through experiments over textual and visual reasoning tasks.

**Update following rebuttal:**

Dear authors, thank you for addressing the comments in my review.

I appreciate the additional experimental results over the bAbI task, both the analysis per question type on table 14 and the new attention maps -- these look great. Expanding the discussion in the related work section about how the approach compares to slot attention is useful too. Finally, I appreciate the detailed response to my review and to those of other reviewers.

While I agree with reviewer bmNb that novelty-wise, the technical difference between slot attention and the paper is not large, nevertheless, for the usefulness of applying it in the context of TPRs and, most importantly, for the thoroughness of the rebuttal and paper updates, including performing additional experiments following the reviewers' comment, I'm happy to raise my score.

### Strengths
- **Idea**: TPRs and attention fit well together: identifying and extracting the role and filler components seems like a natural application of attention and so the integration between them makes a lot of sense to me.  
- **Evaluation**: Experiments are conducted on multiple datasets including both textual and visual modalities as well as both synthetic and realistic data (bAbI, Sort-of-CLEVR, WikiText and the Systematic Associative Recall (SAR) task). The experiments investigate using the attention module to extend several related models (TPR-RNNs, Fast Weight Memory, and Linear Transformers). Both quantitative (through e.g. DCI, downstream performance) and a bit of qualitative analysis (visualization of similarity between the representations of the TPR components). Overall these support the approach’s flexibility.
- **Clarity**: The presentation is good and the paper is clearly written and well-organized. The introduction and model sections do a good job motivating the idea and presenting the necessary background and preliminaries. The overview figure is very helpful. Detailed description is provided for each of the 3 inspected models and the 4 tasks. The supplementary is also good, providing implementation details and ablation experiments.

### Weaknesses
 - **Novelty**: The iterative attention decomposition works very similarly to slot attention, reducing the technical contribution of the paper. The paper introduces the idea as a novel attention-based module, not making it clear enough that effectively this strongly relies on slot attention. The comparison to slot attention appears only at the very end of the paper. Since the approach integrates together existing ideas, it will make sense in this case that the related work section will appear earlier on, before the model section.
- **Empirical Results**: The improvements for WikiText (perplexity) and disentanglement (DCI) are relatively low. On the other hand, we see larger improvements on bAbI and Sort-of-CLEVR.   
- **Related Works**:  A more detailed comparison to the prior related works, in particular to “Enriching Transformers with Structured Tensor-Product Representations for Abstractive Summarization” that also integrates attention and TPRs. It is cited by the paper but more discussions on similarities and differences would be helpful.

### Questions
- **Qualitative Evaluation**: It would be particularly useful for this work to have more qualitative evaluation for both bAbI and sort-of-CLEVR. What do the different TPR components actually attend to? Does their behavior make sense over specific instances? What mistakes do they tend to make? What type of mistakes are made by the baselines and eliminated by the new approach? How do they behave over examples with unseen names (systematic generalization cases)? This type of analysis can significantly help in demonstrating the actual impact of integrating attention into TPRs, beyond the overall accuracy metrics.  For bAbI, a more detailed breakdown of the performance by question type or story length will also be helpful.

### Summary
This paper aims to improve Tensor Product Representation (TPR) for systematic generalization tasks. The authors propose an Attention-based Iterative Decomposition (AID) module, which is plug-and-play and can be easily integrated into existing TPR models. AID is conceptually similar to Slot Attention, but with special designs tailored towards the task. Experimental results show that AID consistently improves existing TPR methods across a broad range of tasks.

### Strengths
- The considered challenge, roles/fillers decomposition, is indeed very similar to the object binding problem in object-centric learning (OCL). Therefore, it is intuitive to apply the SOTA OCL module Slot Attention here.
- The experimental evaluations are thorough. AID shows consistent and non-marginal improvement in all the tasks.
- The ablation and adapted designs from the original Slot Attention are insightful.

### Weaknesses
My background is in OCL so I am unfamiliar with these tasks and baselines. One concern I have is all the tasks (except the WikiText-103 one) are very simple. I understand that areas in the early stage experiment on simple data. However, for example for the CLEVR VQA task, people can train a Slot Attention model to extract object-centric features, and then attach a small Transformer head to predict the question's answer. According to my own experience, such a naive baseline can already achieve nearly perfect accuracy (on the original CLEVR dataset, not Sort-of-CLEVR). Therefore, it is hard for me to assess the importance of this paper.

Also, what is the difference in model size and computation cost of baselines with and without AID? For example, on the WikiText-103 task, the authors mention that they do not insert AID in every layer due to computation concerns. I wonder how will the baselines perform if they have more parameters.

### Questions
The Orthogonality Analysis in Sec. 3.1.1 shows that AID also helps extract more orthogonal *roles*. I am curious why this is the case. In my own experience with Slot Attention, the object-centric features (slots) are usually entangled, as there is no loss to force them to be orthogonal. Any insights here?

### Summary
This paper proposes an Attention-based Iterative Decomposition (AID) module that uses a competitive attention mechanism to decompose sequential input features into structured representations (roles, fillers, and unbinding operators) to improve systematic generalization for Tensor Product Representation (TPR) based models.
The AID module is flexible enough to integrate with existing TPR-based models such as TPR-RNN, Fast Weight Memory, and Linear Transformer.
The experiments support the improvements, show AID produces more compositional and well-bound structural representations, and exemplify applications with large-scale real-world data.

### Strengths
- It is important to decompose sequential input to structured representations for systematic generalization, and the AID module enhances the performances for TPR-based models.

- The module design is simple and clean, so it may be expected to keep the advantage in general cases.

- It integrates with a wide range of TPR-based models in flexible ways.

### Weaknesses
 (1) The WikiText-103 task shows the AID module performs well in a large-vocabulary language modeling task, but it seems not to be a systematic generalization task.



### Questions
(2) Do the intermediate TPR components always keep TPR conditions (the three key conditions required by TPR)?
For example, in integrating with TPR-RNN, the input features to the AID module $x_t$ are a set of word vectors, which may be in any form.
Does the AID module convert the input features to TPR?

(3) TPR has its properties, such as the separation of roles and fillers.
Does the AID module use TPR properties in the module design, e.g., use role for attention key?

(4) Though the AID module is designed to enhance TPR-based models, is it also informative to compare it with non-TPR-based models in experiments?

### Summary
The authors try to apply the Attention mechanism in the tensor product representation models. They also showed that the proposed AID block can be easily incorporated into many existing networks. Experiments show the advantages of introducing the AID block in previous network architectures.

### Strengths
1. The authors proposed a new Attention based module for TPR. The proposed module can be combined with existing structures such as TPR-RNN, FWM and Linear Transformers.
2. The authors conducted extensive experiments including ablation studies to show the advantages of the AID module and influences of hyperparameters.
3. Code for all experiments is provided.

### Weaknesses
The authors mentioned that one advantage of TPR is to represent symbolic structures. I am wondering if this was demonstrated in experiments. I am not familiar with these tasks, but I did not find descriptions about this issue in experiments.



### Questions
How is the scalability and complexity of the proposed AID module?
