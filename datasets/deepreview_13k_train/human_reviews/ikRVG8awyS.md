# RFold: RNA Secondary Structure Prediction with Decoupled Optimization

- Decision: Reject
- Scores: 6, 6, 5, 3

## Abstract
The secondary structure of ribonucleic acid (RNA) is more stable and accessible in the cell than its tertiary structure, making it essential for functional prediction. Although deep learning has shown promising results in this field, current methods suffer from poor generalization and high complexity. In this work, we present RFold, a simple yet effective RNA secondary structure prediction in an end-to-end manner. RFold introduces a decoupled optimization process that decomposes the vanilla constraint satisfaction problem into row-wise and column-wise optimization, simplifying the solving process while guaranteeing the validity of the output. Moreover, RFold adopts attention maps as informative representations instead of designing hand-crafted features. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RFold achieves competitive performance and about eight times faster inference efficiency than the state-of-the-art method.

### Confidence
2: You are willing to defend your assessment, but it is quite likely that you did not understand the central parts of the submission or that you are unfamiliar with some pieces of related work. Math/other details were not carefully checked.

### Summary
This paper proposes an end-to-end deep learning pipeline for RNA secondary structure prediction from the input 1D sequence. Compared to previous deep learning pipelines, the proposed one simplifies the manually-crafted data pre-processing step with the learned representation and the result post-processing step through reformulating and approximating the loss function. On standard benchmarks, the proposed method significantly outperforms current SOTA methods in both accuracy and speed. The ablation studies clearly demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed design choices.

### Strengths
- The paper is well-written. The "preliminary" section clearly summarizing existing works and the figures are helpful for understanding.

- The proposed method has a simple yet effective design.

- The proposed method significantly outperforms the previous SOTA on the standard benchmarks.

- The ablation studies are helpful to verify the design choices for the data pre-processing and result post-processing.

### Weaknesses
On the high-level, the proposed method employs a simple trick to decode M from H: compute the row-argmax and col-argmax, and then Hadamard product them, where the output is guaranteed to be a symmetric 0-1 matrix satisfying the constraints. Overall, the paper does a good job to justify this simple approach by reformulating the optimization objective and approximating it to the train deep learning model. However, there are some details that may need modification.

- The solution to Eq (6) is not Eq (10). Here, H is the unconstrained output and \hat H can have negative values. (1) If \hat H is all non-positive (0 on the diagonal), the optimal solution to Eq (6) is M=0. (2) Even if \hat H is non-negative, consider \hat H = [5,4;4,1]. The row-col-argmax(\hat H) = [1,0;0,0] while the optimal for Eq (6) is [1,0;0,1].

- Suppose Eq (10) is correct, it is unclear how good is the approximation in Eq (14). (1) It'll be great to compare with the approximation (row-softmax \odot col-softmax). (2) argmax can been seen as softmax with temperature T->0. Current approximation uses T=1. It'll be great to add an ablation study to examine how good is the softmax approximation.

--------------
Minor
- Eq (1): the order of composition should be swapped. F(x) = G[H(x)]. => F = G\circ H

### Questions
- Under Eq (9), what does \otimes refer to? Are S_r and S_c sets of vectors? Maybe better to define S_r and S_c as matrices and use Hadamard product.
- I really like the paper, but the soundness of the formulation and approximation slightly make me concern as pointed out in the weakness section. I'd like to hear authors' explanation on them. One simple change is to tune down the claim "optimal solution" to "a greedy algorithm solution".

### Summary
This paper proposes a decoupled optimization approach for the RNA folding problem. Through decoupled optimization formulation of the mapping matrix learning, the RNA folding prediction becomes much faster. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method compared to bunch of baseline methods.

### Strengths
(1) The writing is well-organized and the core idea is clearly presented. In general, although this reviewer has not read too much RNA paper before, the problem formulation and key algorithm design can be easily captured;

(2) This paper conducts very comprehensive experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. This reviewer firmly believes the proposed method can bring some improvements to this domain of research.

### Weaknesses
It seems that the major point of the proposed method is mainly about the optimization formulation of the assignment matrix learning while the seq2map network architecture and the mapping matrix formulation are mainly inherited from previous works. So probably the novelty of the proposed method is a little bit limited. However, this reviewer is not very familiar with RNA folding frontier research, thus it is not very fair for this reviewer to evaluate its novelty and significance.

It is also concerning that the Row-Column-Softmax operation, which is crucial for the proposed method, may suffer from training instability. The operation bears a resemblance to the Sinkhorn algorithm, which is known to have numerical stability issues. This raises a question about whether this method will be robust during training, especially with larger RNA sequences.

### Questions
Does the Rol-Column-Softmax operation have a training instability issue? Since this operation is very similar to the Sinkhorn operation and the Sinkhorn algorithm has training stability issues. This reviewer afraid that the proposed method also has the same drawback.

### Summary
The paper proposes RFold, a method for RNA secondary structure prediction. RFold introduces decoupled optimization that decomposes the constraint satisfaction problem into separate row-wise and column-wise optimizations. This simplifies optimization while guaranteeing valid outputs. RFold also employs Seq2map attention to automatically learn sequence representations, avoiding manual feature engineering. Experiments show RFold matches state-of-the-art approaches on benchmarks while having faster inference. Ablations validate the optimization and attention contributions.

### Strengths
The strength of RFold is its simple yet effective approach for RNA structure prediction. The post-processing step simplifies satisfying complex structural constraints. The pre-processing step automatically learns useful sequence representations without feature engineering. Together these enable high performance prediction with fast inference. Rigorous experiments demonstrate RFold matches or exceeds state-of-the-art methods across multiple benchmarks. The ablation studies clearly validate the benefits of the proposed techniques.

### Weaknesses
A key weakness is the technical approaches seem incremental, lacking major deep learning innovations. The decoupled optimization and Seq2map attention offer straightforward extensions to UFold. This suggests the work may be better suited for a venue focused on the specific domain.

### Questions
How is Equation 10 obtained with the proposed decoupled optimization?

### Summary
In this paper, the authors propose RFold, a simple yet effective RNA secondary structure prediction in an end-to-end manner. Speciﬁcally, a decoupled optimization process that decomposes the vanilla constraint satisfaction problem into row-wise and column-wise optimization is introduced to simplify the solving process while guaranteeing the validity of the output. Besides, RFlod adopts attention maps as informative representations to automatically learn the pair-wise interactions of the nucleotide bases instead of using hand-crafted features to perform data pre-processing.

### Strengths
1. The article closely links RNA-related issues with the ICLR community.

### Weaknesses
1. Presentation:
    - Grammar issues, such as in the sentence: "The general deep-learning-based RNA secondary structure prediction methods into three key parts," which is unclear.
    - Incorrect citation format; the ICLR official template recommends the use of \citep, but it seems the author used \cite, causing the citation information to mix with the text, which hampers readability.
    - Inconsistent abbreviation of equations; some use "Eq." while others use "Equ." (e.g., in the last line of page 5).

2. The experimental results are not sufficiently detailed. The article emphasizes the validity of the proposed method's prediction results but lacks validity results for the baselines.

### Questions
1. I gave this article a rejection recommendation, largely due to its poor presentation. In addition to the specific issues mentioned in the Weaknesses section, the explanation of the method is not very clear. For example, I'm not very clear about how Eq. 9 is derived. From my understanding, $\mathbf{M}$ should represent the ground-truth, and $S_r, S_c$ constitute the decomposition of M. Then, is there any necessity to optimize $S_r$ and $S_c$?
2. In Equation 13, there is no rigorous explanation provided for why the Row-Col Softmax function is used to approximate the Row-Col Argmax function for training.

If the author can effectively address my concerns, especially those related to presentation, I will reconsider this article and possibly revise my evaluation.
