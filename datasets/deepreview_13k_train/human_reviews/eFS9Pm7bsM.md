# Adversarial Latent Feature Augmentation for Fairness

- Decision: Reject
- Scores: 6, 6, 5, 5, 6, 3, 6

## Abstract
As fairness in machine learning has been increasingly important to mitigate bias in models, various methods to enhance fairness have been proposed. Among them, the data augmentation approach has shown promising results in improving fairness. However, existing data augmentation methods on either input or latent features provide limited evidence of how they discover bias and rectify it. In this paper, we propose the Adversarial Latent Feature Augmentation (ALFA) for fairness, which effectively merges adversarial attacks against fairness and data augmentation in the latent space to promote fairness. Though the adversarial perturbation against fairness has been discussed in existing literature, the effect of such adversarial perturbations has been inadequately studied only as a means to depreciate fairness. In contrast, in this paper, we point out that such perturbation can in fact be used to augment fairness. Drawing from a covariance-based fairness constraint, our method unveils a counter-intuitive relationship between adversarial attacks against fairness and enhanced model fairness upon training with the resultant perturbed latent features by hyperplane rotation. We theoretically prove that our adversarial fairness objective assuredly generates biased feature perturbation, and we validate with extensive experiments that training with adversarial features significantly improve fairness.

### Confidence
3: You are fairly confident in your assessment. It is possible that you did not understand some parts of the submission or that you are unfamiliar with some pieces of related work. Math/other details were not carefully checked.

### Summary
In this paper, the authors propose an adversarial data augmentation technique based on maximizing the covariance of sensitive attributes and signed distance from the decision boundary. They then incorporate the augmented samples into the training of the classifier layer. Overall, the authors demonstrate that their method improves fairness metrics over the considered baselines.

### Strengths
- The proposed method is simple and effective 
- The presentation of the paper is good.

### Weaknesses
 - The paper considers fine-tuning only the classifier part of the network (i.e., the last layer) and freezes the encoder part of the network. While this method works for simple tabular-like datasets, I have concerns about how this method performs in the case of datasets with a large label space, like ImageNet. The concern is that the frozen encoder might not provide sufficiently discriminative features for the classifier to learn a fair representation, especially when the pre-trained encoder was not trained with fairness in mind. This could limit the generalizability of the approach to more complex datasets.

- In general, the idea is not novel as the perturbation in the latent space is already explored by the earlier methods

### Questions
Please see the weakness section above and in addition to that:

- How is the perturbation $\epsilon$ set for different feature encoding layers in different ML models? This is an additional hyperparameter that needs to be carefully tuned. Moreover, the authors mention hyperparameters in Table 2 in the appendix. It would be fair if the authors mentioned the cost of hyperparameter tuning in terms of time for the proposed method compared to the baselines.

- How is the performance in datasets with large label space?

- What is the performance of the adversarial training by perturbing the input space instead of latent space with similar attack objective?

- In section 4.4.1, authors could quantitatively discuss the  improvements in terms of performance and fairness metrics. It is not clear to me from the graphs about the comparison of different methods.

### Summary
This paper proposes ALFA as a new method to enhance the fairness of classification models. It introduces the concept of adversarial perturbation in latent variable space, and demonstrates that fine-tuning on these perturbed features can lead to rotated decision boundaries, covering unfair regions. Experiments verify the effectiveness of ALFA in achieving group fairness while maintaining accuracy.

### Strengths
*Quality*
- This paper proposed a new approach to enhance fairness in machine learning models was proposed. This approach effectively merged data augmentation and adversarial attacks in the latent space to promote fairness. It revealed a counter-intuitive relationship between adversarial attacks and enhanced model fairness upon training with the resultant perturbed latent features. 
- The theoretical and experimental results are correct to the best of my knowledge. Theoretical proof showed that the approach could generate biased feature perturbation, and experiments validated that training with adversarial features can improve fairness.

*Relevance*

The topic of fairness is important in machine learning.

### Weaknesses
 *Novelty*

- Although the proposed method is new, the idea of using adversarial training and data augmentation for fairness enhancement is not novel. Adversarial training has been widely used to improve model robustness and generalization, while data augmentation is a common technique to enrich training datasets and reduce overfitting. Integrating these two concepts to address fairness issues has already been studied. Thus, further research is needed to explore the boundaries and limitations of this approach, as well as its applications in different domains.

*Algorithmic Analysis*

- One of the key aspects of ALFA's design is its ability to generate biased feature perturbations during training. This is achieved by introducing a novel loss function that encourages the model to focus on features that are particularly sensitive to small perturbations in the input space. While this approach can effectively rotate the decision boundary to cover previously unfavorable regions, it may also introduce computational complexity and training time challenges. ALFA's computational requirements are not explicitly stated in the article, but it's essential to consider them in order to evaluate its practicality for large-scale datasets and complex models.

- Additionally, while ALFA may improve fairness measures for certain groups, it's important to consider its overall impact on model stability and robustness. Adversarial loss can make training process vulnerable to small perturbations in the input space, potentially leading to increased numerical instability. This issue is not addressed in the article, and further research is needed to investigate these potential trade-offs when employing ALFA in practice.

- Moreover, while the experimental results provided in the article are encouraging, they only cover a limited number of datasets and model types. It remains to be seen how ALFA performs on other datasets that may exhibit different characteristics and challenges. Extensive validation and comparison with other state-of-the-art methods are necessary to assess ALFA's overall effectiveness and superiority.

### Questions
- To what extent is the proposed ALFA method innovative? Is it based on novel ideas or techniques that have not been previously explored in the field of fairness-enhancing machine learning? ALFA's algorithm design incorporates adversarial training and data augmentation. What are the novel aspects of this integration, and how does it lead to improved fairness?

- The use of adversarial training can potentially lead to instability. How does ALFA address this issue, and what measures are taken to ensure algorithm stability during training and deployment?

- ALFA's design involves a novel loss function that encourages the model to focus on features that are particularly sensitive to small perturbations in the input space. How does this loss function compare to traditional loss functions used in fairness-enhancing machine learning?

### Summary
The paper considers fairness in binary classification with binary protected features. In particular, focusing on DP and EOdds notions of group-level fairness, the paper proposes adversarial latent feature augmentation (ALFA), which considers the adversarial attack together with data augmentation. Experimental results are also provided.

### Strengths
The strength of the paper comes from the attempt to address adversarial attack and (latent space) data augmentation at the same time, for certain group-level fairness notions.

### Weaknesses
The weakness of the paper comes from the relatively unclear presentation of the material, the worry of the limited scope of application, and therefore, the unclear takeaway message. It would be helpful if points in __Questions__ below can be clarified.

__Q1__: regarding "data augmentation in latent space"

The paper sets a goal of addressing adversarial attack and data augmentation at the same time for fair classification. However, it is not clear to me what exactly is being considered in the "latent space". The theoretical derivation closely follows the previous work Zafar et al., (2017), but with a different loss function (Equation 1). The "latent feature" $\mathbf{z}$ is utilized to attack the classifier. What is the relation between the original input features and the latent feature after attack? I am having difficulty understanding the motivation behind introducing an alteration in latent feature space for the purpose of both augmenting data and improving fairness. Specifically, how does modifying the latent representation $\mathbf{z}$ achieve the effect of data augmentation, and why is this done in the latent space rather than the input space?

__Q2__: what is "unfair region"

In Figure 1a, "unfair regions" are highlighted near the decision boundary (hyperplane). While I understand the fact that the groups are imbalanced, and that the proposed approach yields a "rotated" decision boundary, I am not sure how to parse the goal of finding a different slope (i.e., rotating) for the hyperplane in terms of data augmentation for fair classification. Please clarify. The notion of an "unfair region" remains vague. What is the precise definition of this region? Is it simply the area where misclassification rates differ significantly across groups, or is there a more nuanced characterization? How does the rotation of the decision boundary specifically address the fairness concerns, and why is this rotation achieved through latent space manipulation, as opposed to other methods?

__Q3__: more general scenarios beyond binary classification with binary protected feature

Can the proposed framework handle more complicated settings in practical scenarios? What is the takeaway message the paper would like to convey? The paper's focus on binary classification with a single binary protected feature seems restrictive. How would this approach extend to multi-class classification problems or scenarios with multiple, potentially non-binary, protected attributes? What are the limitations of the proposed method in more complex, real-world datasets? The core contribution and the broader applicability of the method are unclear.

### Summary
This work proposes a data augmentation technique to improve fairness, based on adversarial perturbations in the latent space. This technique leverages a covariance based constraint to to generate features which are maximally separated i.e. biased - followed by a training procedure to minimize the distance between the perturbed and original features - hoping to enforce some “invariance” over the true features i.e. not relying on the spurious / sensitive features. Experiments are demonstrated across multiple fairness datasets and vis-a-vis different methods, demonstrating the competitive fairness-accuracy tradeoff of the proposed method.

### Strengths
The paper addresses an important challenge of fairness by leveraging an adversarial latent space approach - which is interesting as most previous works demonstrate the opposite i.e. adversarial robustness maybe at odds with fairness. Further,  it is appreciated that detailed analysis is also shown on a synthetic dataset to better understand the hyperplane rotation i.e. how the boundary is encouraged to be changed. For the experiments, comparison is performed with many other methods.

### Weaknesses
Please see below:
1.  It is is unclear how this approach could be better than simple reweighting of the demographic groups, given that the knowledge is already available. Why would one like to leverage the adversarial data augmentation? Specifically, the paper does not clearly articulate the limitations of reweighting methods, such as potential overfitting or instability, which would justify the need for a more complex adversarial approach. A more detailed explanation of why reweighting is insufficient for the problem at hand is needed.
2. It is hard to infer the experimental conclusions from the many plots which are represented - is there any reason for not observing a non decreasing or non increasing trend in most of the experiments? The plots lack clear trends and the performance seems inconsistent across different datasets and methods. It is difficult to determine the effectiveness of the proposed method from the presented results. A more concise and focused presentation of the experimental results is needed, perhaps with a summary table highlighting key performance metrics.
3. There seems to be no comparison with baselines such as reweighting and using only ERM features (no data augmentation) - how does the performance compare? Without these comparisons, it is difficult to assess the added value of the proposed adversarial data augmentation technique. The paper should include a comparison with standard baselines to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.
4. The motivation for choosing a covariance based approach is unclear - is there any specific intuition behind this choice? The paper does not provide a strong justification for using a covariance-based constraint for generating adversarial perturbations. It is unclear why this particular constraint was chosen over other possible fairness constraints, and what specific advantages it offers. A more detailed explanation of the theoretical underpinnings of this choice is needed.
5. Overall, the conciseness and coherence of the paper could be improved - e.g. :During the adversarial training, we ensure that the semantic essence of the perturbed features is preserved “ -> semantic essence could be replaced with a more technical term w.r.t the true invariant / sensitive attributes.

### Questions
Questions:
Apart from the questions mentioned in the above section:
1. Is there any underlying assumption on the structure of the space? Perhaps, it would be helpful to have a causal model explaining the structure of the input space (e.g. to depict the spurious correlation between Y and A). 
2. Does this method scale beyond binary Y and A?
3. Could you compare your intuitions with the following adversarial group robustness technique?  Paranjape, Bhargavi, et al. "AGRO: Adversarial Discovery of Error-prone groups for Robust Optimization." arXiv preprint arXiv:2212.00921 (2022)

Suggestions:
1. I would recommend adding a concise summary of the plots (e.g. a table) to show the demonstrated improvements.
2. "Hyperplane rotation" may be hard to understand in the first read, could we replaced with a more common term like decision boundary.

### Summary
The paper proposes using adversarial attack on fairness of a Deep network to generate more synthetic samples that could be used to fix the bias present in the model. The authors show through a small example how generated adversarial samples would be overlapping with the region of unfairness. Hence using such samples in the training set rotates the classifier boundary in a way the misclassification regions are now correctly predicted. The idea is quite novel application of adversarial attack on a neural network. The paper also provides theory on why optimizing over covariance is relevant to impacting the fairness constraints like DP and Equality of Opportunity. The experiment results on standard datasets show better pareto frontier for proposed method for most cases.

### Strengths
The paper provides insights on one of the reasons of unfairness due to data imbalance and tackles the problem through data augmentation. I like the analysis presented in the paper.
 
1. The proposed data augmentation intelligently utilizes the adversarial attack to identify the unfairness regions. The samples from unfairness region are then used to teach the model to fix its linear decision boundary.
2. The optimization objective for adversarial attack are tied to the fairness objectives under certain conditions.
3. The pareto frontier for proposed technique is better than baselines.

### Weaknesses
There are some minor weaknesses of the proposed approach:
1. Storage cost increase due to dataset augmentation. Not necessarily a flaw.
2. Limitation: Paper only deals with binary classification and two protected classes. 
3. The current solution of adjusting rotation of the linear classifier would only work when the two classes are separated in their latent space. For more complicated cases like lesser data, higher dimensional data etc. the latent space might not be separated and intuition would not hold. However this would be future direction to look into.

### Questions
I find the proposed method quite interesting. However I have some clarifying questions:

Q1. One of the comparisons that could be done would be to generate samples using directly optimizing empirical EOd or DP, i.e finding adversarial examples using maximizing False positive error or False negative error. This could be done by flipping the labels for the dataset. Why choose to attack L_fair vs False positive rate?

Q2. In theorem 3.2, $N_p = 4\times \max(n_{i,j})$. How is this maintained? Does this mean some samples would be repeated before adversarial attack?

Q3. The final loss function is a convex combination of true and perturbed dataset. I wanted to understand the weight attributed to the perturbed dataset. What values of $\lambda$ are used in different cases? 

Q4. How can linear decision boundary handle the case of multiple classes in protected attribute? A rotation would not be able to fix the bias in the dataset.

I will adjust my score after these concerns are addressed.

### Summary
The paper discusses a novel approach called Adversarial Latent Feature Augmentation (ALFA) to address bias in machine learning models. This approach involves perturbing latent features with the aim of mitigating bias and achieving fairness. The authors define a fairness attack as a feature-level perturbation to maximize a covariance-based fairness constraint, which can lead to biased latent features. They argue that fine-tuning these perturbed features can rotate the decision boundary, covering unfair regions and achieving group fairness. The method is tested on various datasets, including Adult, COMPAS, German, and Drug datasets, as well as image classification on CelebA, demonstrating accuracy while achieving group fairness.

### Strengths
1. The paper is clearly presented and easy to follow.
2. It provides some theory analysis.
3. Empirical studies sound.

### Weaknesses
1. Why "GAN-based perturbation might yield unsuitable generated features not aligning on the sensitive hyperplane" for tabular datasets? The intuition is unclear to me. It would be better to explain using concrete examples and provide citations.
2. Can the proposed method be applied to non-tabular datasets, such as vision datasets (i.e., images and videos)? If not, the scope of the method is limited. If so, why does W1 matter?
3. In Eq.(1), the perturbation \delta should be bolded. What is the \bar{a} in Eq.(1)? Is this the mean of all a_i? The notation of \bar{a} is not defined before using.
4. Adversal fairness learning is not novel. The earliest work dates back to 2018 [1]. I doubt the novelty of the proposed method in 3.3.
5. According to the setting and empirical studies, the proposed method can be applied only when there is only one sensitive attribute with binary values.

### Strengths
This paper has good originality, high quality and clear expression.  The paper combines adversarial attacks into data augmentation in the latent space to promote fairness and proposes a new method.

### Weaknesses
More complex dataset is better to be verified the effectiveness of the proposed method.

Adversarial perturbations suffer from robust overfitting[1] when used as data augmentation in adversarial training, when used as data augmentation in fairness, is there exits some overfitting in promoting fairness?

The rotation of the decision boundary is because of the exists of adversarial pertuabations in the proposed method,will different forms of perturbations such as L2 perturbation or L-infinity effect the rotation of decision boundary?

The proposed method has a relatively large number of hyperparameters, will this affect its efficiency when applied to more complex datasets?
