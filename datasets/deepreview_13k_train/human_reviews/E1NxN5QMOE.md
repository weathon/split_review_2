## Abstract
Fairness, especially group fairness, is an important consideration in the context of machine learning systems. The most commonly adopted group fairness-enhancing techniques are in-processing methods that rely on a mixture of a fairness objective (e.g., demographic parity) and a task-specific objective (e.g., cross-entropy) during the training process.  However, when data arrives in an online fashion -- one instance at a time -- optimizing such fairness objectives poses several challenges. In particular, group fairness objectives are defined using expectations of predictions across different demographic groups.  In the online setting, where the algorithm has access to a single instance at a time, estimating the group fairness objective requires additional storage and significantly more computation (e.g., forward/backward passes) than the task-specific objective at every time step. In this paper, we propose {\X}, an ensemble of oblique decision trees, to make fair decisions in online settings.  The hierarchical tree structure of {\X} enables parameter isolation and allows us to efficiently compute the fairness gradients using aggregate statistics of previous decisions, eliminating the need for additional storage and forward/backward passes. We also present an efficient framework to train {\X} and theoretically analyze several of its properties.  We conduct empirical evaluations on 5 publicly available benchmarks (including vision and language datasets) to show that {\X} achieves a better accuracy-fairness trade-off compared to baseline approaches.

### Summary
This paper explores the application of an existing machine learning model to improve group-level fairness performance in an online data streaming setting. Specifically, the authors work in a setting where individual data points arrive at the predictive system one after another over time. Given this setting, the authors deploy a predictive algorithm based on an oblique decision forest. The paper shows how to incorporate group fairness notions such as demographic parity while ensuring efficient training of the forest-based model online. The authors use real-world datasets ranging from tabular to vision and language to highlight the efficacy of their method.

### Strengths
The authors propose a novel application of oblique decision trees in the online group fairness setting. I believe the paper has several strengths.

The work is original as it explores the novel application of oblique decision trees in the context of group-fair online predictions. In order to ensure predictions are accurate and fair in the online setting, the authors provide key insights and explore the novel adaptation of oblique decision trees for efficient training. They also introduce theoretical lemmas to help show the relationship of the complexity, fairness performance and the modeling choices, e.g., the depth of the tree.

The authors have presented a work of good quality. The paper provides extensive theoretical complexity analyses. In addition, the authors provide evaluations for demographic parity fairness on multiple modalities of data, e.g., tabular data, image data, and language data. The work also includes extensive ablation studies to empirically show the properties and behavior of the proposed method.

The authors do a good job in making the paper clear to read. The scenario is clearly defined, the intuitions clearly stated, and the modeling is explained in clear language and terms. The article was relatively easy to follow even without understanding of oblique decision trees.

In my opinion, the work can be significant in showing how to adapt a powerful tree-based model for online predictions with fairness as an important consideration. This is especially for tabular data where tree-based models have been shown to perform better. The authors' proposed model may prove to be an useful tool in the practitioner's toolbox for online predictive systems, especially where fairness is also important to consider.

### Weaknesses
In terms of weaknesses, I find the following points.
* The evaluations only show demographic parity results. While the authors mention how to formulate Aranyani for other group-fairness notions, they provide no results to highlight how it would perform for notions also based on the true label, e.g., equalized odds or equal opportunity. Specifically, it is unclear if the method can effectively balance accuracy and fairness when the fairness metric is conditioned on the true label, a common requirement in many real-world scenarios.
* The results do not have error bars. So, it is difficult to compare different methods without taking into consideration the variance across different initialization. As far as I understand, Aranyani and the other baselines may not be guaranteed to find the global optimum. Hence, reporting the mean and the variance across different initialization is very important for fair comparison. The absence of error bars makes it challenging to assess the robustness and reliability of the proposed method, especially given the stochastic nature of the optimization process.
* While the work measures and reports the expectation of the fairness measure at each time step, it is unclear what the fairness dynamic looks like for different methods across time as the training proceeds. In online settings, the variation of the fairness measure over time may tell a story and be essential to see. Specifically, it is not clear how the fairness measure **varies across different time steps**. It is not clear if the training process is relatively stable or not, and how Aranyani compares to the baselines in this respect. The lack of this temporal analysis limits the understanding of the method's behavior in a dynamic environment.
* As per the appendix results, the fairness result variance seems to increase significantly as we move from a single tree to a forest. The authors motivate the need for a forest instead of a tree with a promised reduction of variance. However, in some sense, it seems that variance can increase as well. This aspect does not seem to be discussed well. It is unclear why the variance increases with the number of trees, contradicting the expectation that ensemble methods reduce variance.

There are a few minor points as well.
* Figure 4 (right) includes error bars, but it is not clear how the variance is measured in this case. Is it the variance of a measure across time steps? It is not clear why the tree depth impacting the variance of fairness so greatly. The lack of clarity on the source of the variance makes it difficult to interpret the results.
* The fairness performance seems to degrade considerably when the tree depth is higher. This follows from the theoretical finding, where the fairness bound becomes looser as we increase the tree depth. However, this may limit the expressivity of the model in some situations. The trade-off between fairness and expressivity needs to be further explored, as the current results suggest a limitation of the model's capacity.
* There are no ablation studies that show the impact of the particular loss that is used to measure fairness, i.e., using Huber loss over $\ell_2$ loss or hinge loss. The choice of the loss function is critical, and the absence of ablation studies leaves open questions about the sensitivity of the method to different loss choices.
* While the authors provide a complexity analysis for their method, an empirical runtime analysis comparing the different methods might have also been insightful. Understanding the practical runtime performance is crucial for real-world applications.
* Figure 4 (right) does not have any legend. It is difficult to understand which line/symbol corresponds to which metric.

Very minor point.
* The Aranyani triangle symbol in the text does not match with the plots.

### Questions
1. The authors showed how to implement a binary oblique decision tree. However, is it possible to formulate a non-binary version of oblique trees for fairness? Are there any scenarios that may necessitate non-binary splits in the tree?
2. The scenario considered exposes the ground-truth label of an individual data point after the prediction is made, irrespective of the predicted label. However, in many real-world online decision-making settings, the ground-truth label is observed **only** when the prediction/decision is positive [1, 2, 3], e.g., in the COMPAS recidivism setting. This is the selective labeling scenario that reflects the real world more. Can the method be applied when true labels are not observed when the prediction is negative?
3. Instead of considering a tree-based structuring across the nodes, can we train a GNN where each node's representation is learned from the features? Would it be possible to apply similar tricks to optimize for the problem?
4. Temporal aspects of fairness can have many different meanings. While the expected fairness across different time steps is one measure, there can be other measures, e.g., fairness in hindsight. Can Aranyani be modified to work for such temporal notions?
5. What does the variance of the fairness look like during the online training across the time steps? Does the fairness measure change a lot from one time step to another? Is it stable, or does it reach a stable state relatively soon? Similarly, what does the accuracy nature look like over time?
6. Why does tree depth impact the fairness variance so much? Similarly, moving from a tree to a forest should reduce variance. But, from Fig. 6, an apparent relationship is not clear. In some cases, it seems that having a forest increases the variance. Do the authors have a thought about this behavior?
5. How would the method compare to bandit-based solutions? Bandits seem well suited to the single-datum online setup discussed here, where the bandit can observe the true label no matter the decision.
6. If we start moving away from the one datum at a time setup and consider multiple data points arriving at each time step, would the efficacy of the oblique tree reduce compared to other methods, e.g., MLPs?

### Summary
The authors propose a framework, Aranyani,  based on an ensemble of (soft) oblique decision trees to address group fairness in the online learning setting where one instance arrives at a time. This work proposes a method to update the oblique decision forests model that only relies on updating two aggregated statistics for each node    in the tree and each sensitive group (Section 3.3).  The authors provide a theoretical analysis (Section 4) of the proposed approach such as a bound on demographic parity (DP) based on the depth of the tree under the assumption that the fairness constraint is satisfied on each tree node. Moreover, they also show that the proposed approach to aggregate statistics in an online fashion guarantees gradient norm convergence with enough time steps. Finally, they provide experimental results showing that their approach achieves in general better or competing tradeoffs between accuracy and demographics parity.

### Strengths
The paper is well written, the problem is well motivated, and results are promising. I think one of the interesting aspects of the proposed approach, in addition to its online characteristics (no need to store previous data, no need to query the model multiple times), is that the group fairness objective (DP in this case) is being imposed at a local level (in each node). This may reduce the disparities in terms of DP across different regions of the input space. The theoretical analysis provided is reasonable, it motivates and provides some grounded guarantees on the proposed solution.

### Weaknesses
 The weaknesses I see are summarized in the following questions:

How do you guarantee that in each leaf you have samples from both sensitive groups? From Eq.3 and Eq 5 I understand that $F_{i,j}$ requires examples from both sensitive groups. If this is not guaranteed in the solution, how do you deal with nodes containing samples from a single sensitive group?. How does this method scale with multiple groups?

A discussion on $\delta$ and $\lambda$ parameters from Eq.4 should be provided. In particular, I think $\lambda$ should be set based on $\epsilon$ (DP constraint) from Eq 2, which is the fairness violation that the user is willing to accept. In general, I would have expected to maximize the $\lambda$ parameter until that constrain is satisfied ($\epsilon$). However, it seems that the Huber loss function is not zero when the epsilon constraint is satisfied. Why did you choose this approach to enforce the fairness constraint?


I think the algorithm or a simplified pseudocode of the proposed framework should be provided. This would help with the understanding and reproducibility of the work since it summarizes the logic of the proposed approach.

### Questions
In addition to the questions in the weakness section I have some concerns about the practical scalability of this approach.  My understanding is that each time step a new oblique tree is generated, then, the final model can be considerably large. Have the authors thought how this can scale in practice?

### Summary
This paper introduces "Aranyani," a novel framework designed to compute and enhance group fairness in online learning scenarios. The work is systematically presented, starting with foundational knowledge on oblique decision trees in Chapter 2. Chapter 3 delves into the problem formulation, detailing demographic parity equations for both offline and online settings. Within this chapter, the authors explain their choice of the Huber loss function, addressing the challenges inherent to online scenarios. Chapter 4 provides a comprehensive theoretical analysis of Aranyani, covering its expectations and assumptions. The experimental findings, presented in Chapter 5, benchmark Aranyani against prominent online learning algorithms.

Central to the paper is Aranyani's innovative approach to achieving fairness in online settings. Aranyani leverages an ensemble of oblique decision trees, which are capable of making nuanced oblique splits by utilizing routing functions that account for all input features. The authors begin by detailing an offline setting, constraining the objective function with a fairness objective (L1 norm), and then adapt this framework to oblique decision forests. Given the non-smooth and convex nature of the L1 norm, optimization challenges arise. The authors cleverly employ Huber Regularization to smoothen the L1 norm, paving the way for more effective optimization.

What sets Aranyani apart is its approach to data storage. Traditional methods tend to store instances to train a model, whereas Aranyani calculates fairness gradients based on aggregated statistics from previous decisions, effectively handling the online situation.

From a theoretical standpoint, the authors rigorously examine four fundamental properties of Aranyani: Demographic Parity (DP), Rademacher Complexity, Fairness Gradient Estimation, and Gradient Norm Convergence. Each of these properties is supported by robust theoretical proofs.

To validate their approach, the authors conduct experiments on five diverse datasets: UCI Adult, Census, COMPAS, CelebA, and CivilComments. Their results indicate that, in terms of the Fair-Accuracy trade-off, Aranyani outperforms existing online learning algorithms across most datasets. Notably, its performance on the COMPAS dataset was less dominant, warranting further investigation.

### Strengths
Significance: The proposed Aranyani framework has the potential to be a groundbreaking adjustment in online learning algorithms, paving the way for enhanced fairness in this domain.

Originality: This research stands out due to its unique experimental environment settings and the innovative adjustments made in the problem formulation. The paper presents a fresh perspective by introducing a new idea in the realm of online learning.

Quality: While there are certain ambiguities, primarily concerning the linkage between foundational knowledge and experimental configurations, the paper's narrative is cohesively structured and of commendable quality. The meticulous mathematical proofs provided for each of the Aranyani properties add depth and credibility to the work.

Other Notable Strengths: Aranyani's design, which negates the need to store individual data instances, is especially significant concerning data privacy. This approach not only addresses data storage challenges but also underscores the paper's emphasis on operating based on aggregate statistics rather than individual data points.

### Weaknesses
Methodological Clarity: 
- The manuscript would be enhanced with a more detailed breakdown of the concluding stages of the training process. It remains uncertain whether the oblique decision tree is designed as an end-to-end neural network or if Aranyani follows the training pattern of standard tree models while adopting a neural configuration.

Performance Insights & Recommendations: 
- It would be beneficial to have deeper insights regarding Aranyani's subdued performance on the COMPAS dataset. Could there be challenges in using Aranyani for datasets with less than 7k entries?
- While the paper indicates that Aranyani is more suited to trees of limited height, it would be useful to explore alternative approaches for instances where greater tree height is needed.

Experimental Enhancements: 
- Real-World Application: Observing Aranyani's functionality in intricate real-world situations, outside the realm of benchmark datasets, would add depth to the findings. 
- To further solidify the paper's comparative analysis, including more recent fairness representation learning models from the related works — modified for online environments — as baselines would be valuable.

Visualization Feedback: In Figure 4 (right), legends are necessary to distinguish which line represents accuracy.

### Questions
"In scenarios where the provided dataset is inherently imbalanced, does the definition of fairness shift? Could the fairness criteria evolve based on varying tasks and datasets? And how does the framework handle datasets that may already carry inherent biases? (This query extends broadly to research in the domain of fairness.)"

Regarding addressing some of the weaknesses:
- Handling imbalanced or biased datasets is a nuanced challenge in fairness-related research. Proper preprocessing, data augmentation, or applying techniques like re-sampling can help. If Aranyani uses any such methodologies or has in-built mechanisms to counter these biases, it would be crucial to highlight.
- Furthermore, explaining the adaptability of Aranyani in different scenarios, especially with datasets that are inherently biased, would provide clarity on its real-world applicability.

### Summary
This paper proposes a method for achieving group fairness in online setting, equipped with fairness, accuracy, convergence analysis. Moreover, numerical experiments have been conducted for showing the great performance of the proposed method in terms of reducing the unfairness while maintaining the accuracy.

### Strengths
1. This paper proposed an effective approach called Aranyani, and provide solid theoretical analysis for it. 
2. The experiment results look promising

### Weaknesses
1. [Major] The main use cases for achieving fairness in this online setting are missing. This issue makes the motivation of this work lack justification. 
2. [Major] Problem setting should be stated more clearly. For instance, in this paper, considers an online setting where only one single instance can be processed. Typical online learning indeed process one data point at a time but also privy to the feedback from previous data points, but this paper seems to assume that the previous data points are not available. A more clearly setup should be stated before getting into the gradients used in the algorithm (5). 
3. [Major] Authors do not clearly state the goal in the online setting. Can you add an equation like (3) to the online setting? I am not even sure what is the right fairness metric for online settings — at each step, are you measuring the fairness for the entire dataset?

### Questions
1. Where is the FAHT’s result in the rightmost plot in Figure 2? 
2. Why is FAHT worse than the adaptive HT in terms of DP?

### Summary
This study introduces an online algorithm called Aranyani, aimed at addressing group fairness issues. This algorithm integrates a collection of oblique decision trees and leverages the tree's structural attributes to improve group fairness in online learning scenarios.

Firstly, the study demonstrates that when group fairness constraints are applied to decisions at the local node level, it results in parameter isolation, paving the way for superior and more equitable outcomes.

Secondly, by keeping track of the overall statistics of decisions made at the local node level, the algorithm can effectively calculate group fairness gradients, removing the requirement for extra storage for forward/backward passes.

Thirdly, the study offers a framework work for training Aranyani.

Lastly, both empirical and theoretical evidence provided in the study underscores the efficacy of the suggested algorithm.

### Strengths
* This study focuses on a unique and critical problem wherein machine learning fairness is examined in an online context, with individual sample instances observed sequentially.
* In such a scenario, determining group fairness attributes and executing backward propagation to modify model parameters necessitates retaining all prior samples, leading to computational complexities. To address this, the paper introduces an effective framework for forward and backward propagations, taking advantage of statistical summaries from previous samples.
* The presented algorithm consistently surpasses baseline techniques across all tasks. It is both empirically and theoretically robust and comprehensive.

### Weaknesses
 * Utilizing the aggregate of past statistics to adjust the model parameters poses a challenge. As the model parameters shift with each time step, past statistics, derived from earlier model parameters, might diverge significantly from what would be obtained if the model gradients were calculated using all the previously stored data. I'm curious if the authors could elaborate on the conditions under which using aggregated past gradients to update the current model would be successful or not.
* The problem is framed in an online setting where the actual predictive labels are seen after the model makes its predictions. More realistically, if the model consistently underperforms, it could result in a shift in data distribution. Specifically, the minority group might cease supplying data for model updates. Could the author discuss how the proposed algorithm would operate under these circumstances?
