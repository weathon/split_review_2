# A/B testing under Identity Fragmentation

- Decision: Reject
- Scores: 5, 3, 5, 6

## Abstract
Randomized online experimentation is a key cornerstone of the online world. The infrastructure enabling such methodologies is critically dependent on user identification. However, nowadays consumers routinely interact with online businesses across multiple devices which are often recorded with different identifiers for the same consumer. The inability to match different device identities across consumers leads to an incorrect estimation of various causal effects. Moreover, without strong assumptions about the device-user graph, the causal effects are not identifiable. In this paper, we consider the task of estimating global treatment effects (GATE) from a fragmented view of exposures and outcomes. Our experiments validate our theoretical analysis, and estimators obtained through our procedure are shown be superior to standard estimators, with a lower bias and increased robustness.

### Summary
This paper proposes a mechanism to perform A/B testing and estimating the global average treatment effect (GATE) in a setting where users interact with online service via multiple devices and the precise mapping of users to devices is unknown, i.e., there is identity fragmentation. The methodology rests on the key assumption that, for each user, a superset of their real devices is known. The paper ventures to show that GATE is possible under such a setting and proposes a good estimator.

### Strengths
The paper makes an interesting contribution in an active research area.
Eventually, the results present the developed method to show less bias than others.

### Weaknesses
The core assumption is the availability of a model M which provides information on the true underlying user-device graph adjacency matrix A, in the sense that one can get the predicted or assumed neighbors of a device. These neighbors are assumed to be always superset of the true neighbors, as stated in Equation A7, in conformity with the assumptions stated elsewhere in the paper. This assumption is justified by a geographi argument. However, this assumption is not revisited again in Section 5, where experiments are presented. It is not clear what extent those supersets are meant to have. Perhaps that related to the strength of interference r, yet that is not clearly stated. In Section 5.3 the size of the fraction of extraneous neighbors in M(i) is eventually taken in consideration. However, this parameter was not discussed in previous experiments. The notion of extraneous neighbro is not discussed prior to that.

Parts of the paper are incomplete. Section 5.1 ends abruptly. Conclsusions do not exist.

### Questions
Why is M(i) not discussed in the first experiments?

### Summary
This paper proposes a new approach for estimating the global average treatment effect (GATE) considering identity fragmentation. The authors conducted both theoretical analysis and experiments to validate their approach, demonstrating its effectiveness compared to standard estimators.

### Strengths
S1. An approach to estimate causal effects in the presence of identity fragmentation, enhancing the accuracy and reliability of A/B testing in online platforms.

S2. The approach proves effective in the experiments.

### Weaknesses
W1. Poor presentation.

W1-a. Some variables, such as X, lack clear definition or explanation, particularly in their role in estimating true neighbors within the model. This lack of detail or oversimplification can lead to confusion when attempting to understand the motivation and core concepts presented in the paper, significantly impacting its quality. The paper does not clearly articulate how the covariate X is used, or if it is used at all, in the construction of the neighborhood graph, which is a crucial component of the proposed method. The description implies that X is somehow involved in determining the neighborhood structure, but the exact mechanism is missing, making it difficult to assess the validity of the approach.

W1-b. The utilization of the trained model, specifically in the format of equation A2, within the estimation process of the GATE value is not elucidated. This omission introduces ambiguity when attempting to compare it with previous methods in the experimental section. It is unclear how the parameters learned in the model defined by equation A2 are used to estimate the potential outcomes required for GATE calculation. The paper does not specify how the neural network outputs are translated into the counterfactual outcomes, which are essential for estimating the treatment effect.

W2. Unconvincing experiments.

W2-a. The settings appear to intentionally align with the assumptions of the proposed model without practical justification. The experimental setup in Section 5.1 seems to be tailored to the model's assumptions, which raises concerns about the generalizability of the results. The generative process for the data closely mirrors the model's structure, potentially leading to an overestimation of the method's performance in real-world scenarios. The lack of diversity in the experimental settings makes it difficult to assess the robustness of the proposed approach.

W2-b. The experimental environments are not clearly outlined, including specific settings of the baseline estimators and the methodology used for calculating metrics in the figures. The paper lacks crucial details regarding the implementation of the baseline methods, making it difficult to reproduce the results. The specific parameter settings for the baselines, such as the degree of the polynomial in polynomial regression, are not provided. Furthermore, the exact procedure for calculating the bias and RMSE metrics is not described, which hinders a thorough evaluation of the experimental results.

### Questions
1 In equation A2, c0, c1, g, and w are referred to as neural network functions, yet no further details are provided. This omission makes it challenging to infer the specific characteristics or behavior of the proposed approach.

2 Regarding your simulation environment:
a. The relationship between the covariate X and the randomly generated "random device graphs" remains unclear. Given the methodology described, it appears that X plays a vital role in determining neighboring relationships. A more detailed explanation is needed to elucidate this connection.
b. The similarity between the equation for generating ground truth and model A2 raises questions. Is there a specific reason for this resemblance, and could it potentially confer an advantage to the proposed model in certain settings? Further clarification on this matter would be beneficial.
c. The computation of the bias metric in the experiment figures is not discernible from the paper alone. Providing insight into how this metric is calculated would enhance the reader's understanding of the experimental methodology.

### Confidence
1: You are unable to assess this paper and have alerted the ACs to seek an opinion from different reviewers.

### Summary
The authors provide a method to estimate the global treatment effects. The theoretical analysis is provided and the experiment results verify the correctness of the theoretical results and the effectiveness of the proposed methods.

### Strengths
1. The presentation of the paper is good, making it clear for those that are not familiar with the field.
2.  the assumption is shown clearly together with the theoretical analysis.

### Weaknesses
1. the contribution of the work should be listed more clearly, compared with the existing methods. The table can be showed if needed.
2. the novel of the theoretical results should be verified. I am not sure which thm is essential and novel in the work. I am not sure whether the prop. is directly from given related works.
3. more experiments results need to be provided with larger dataset and the more complex real world settings

### Questions
1. The analysis in the work is all about the linear model, how about non-linear ones?
2. how are the proposed methods different from the classical VAE, if so, if more advanced ones can be adopted?
3. will the noise distribution influences the methods; for the time series data, will the noise correlation or process take effects?

### Confidence
3: You are fairly confident in your assessment. It is possible that you did not understand some parts of the submission or that you are unfamiliar with some pieces of related work. Math/other details were not carefully checked.

### Summary
Due to the depreciation of identifiers causing interference, it's hard to separate groups into treatment and control groups in randomized control experiments. The authors propose VAE-based treatment effect estimators with interference to address the issue. The authors test their model on synthetic data created with the Erdos-Renyi model and the AIRBNB simulations. They conduct extensive experiments comparing different model parameters and compare their work with other methods like HT and DM.

### Strengths
- I love the idea and write-up. 

  - The authors address an actual problem likely to be faced in randomized online experiments.  
  - The authors do a great job of presenting the problem and proposed solution. The introduction is well written, and before they introduce their method, the authors clearly explain the shortcomings of  HT and SUTVA methods. Additionally, the write-up is generally consistent and concise.

- The authors address (and perform experiments) for several different settings, for example, the populations size and impact of neighborhood accuracy on GATES estimation, which was very useful. The graphs are intuitive and comparison with other methods are clear.

### Weaknesses
While I like most of the paper, I found a few shortcomings and unclear parts I would like the authors to address;

- Although the authors address the potential issues that could arise from inaccurate neighborhoods, it's mainly focused on the removal/addition of edges. I am curious about a setting where the edge exists but is weak. For example, assume a user owns several devices (e.g., same login credentials for Netflix), however, in principle, there are several *different* users using the same credentials. Would it be better to use a probabilistic matrix and rely on a threshold to decide the neighborhood?


- While the authors address the issue of varied treatments on devices in the neighborhood, I am curious about a case where the actions determining Y are completely different on each device in N (e.g., in the case of shared Netflix passwords accessed by different members.).  How would that affect Y?


- In practical settings, even though users might own different devices, in most cases, they are logged/active on one at a time or restricted to a single access at a time. Would adding the temporal (time) aspect of the model improve treatment estimates?


- There are some write-up issues and typos. Although this can be implied, some variables are not immediately defined when used, e.g., in A2. On page 8, the last sentence before section 5.2 seems incomplete. On page 6, it should |M(i)| >> |N(i)| not |M(i)| >> N(i), page 4 last paragraph, "treatment group in small" should  "treatment group is small", e.t.c.  


- Some of the crucial sections are missing. I think having a conclusion/discussion and limitations would help address potential issues that might arise, for example, from unsatisfied assumptions and broader recommendations. I understand this might be a space issue, but if authors can find a way to add them, that might be helpful. 


- Other issues, mostlyminor: Authors could improve the font of the figures. What do the authors mean by type in this sentence "if the listing and person have the same type" on page 8? In the age of GDPR and similar privacy measures, device linking might not just fall short but might be an altogether infeasible approach. Lastly, I find the explanation given for the strong assumption (A7) a bit unrealistic.

### Questions
I generally like the authors' work and presentation. I have a couple of questions in the weakness section that I would like the authors to address.
