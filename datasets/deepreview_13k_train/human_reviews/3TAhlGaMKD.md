- Decision: Reject
- Scores: 5, 1, 8, 5

## Abstract
Large Language Models (LLMs) are powerful tools for natural language processing, enabling novel applications and user experiences.
However, to achieve optimal performance, LLMs often require adaptation with private data, which poses privacy and security challenges. 
Several techniques have been proposed to adapt LLMs with private data, such as Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), Soft Prompt Tuning (SPT), and In-Context Learning (ICL), but their comparative privacy and security properties have not been systematically investigated.
In this work, we fill this gap by evaluating the robustness of LoRA, SPT, and ICL against three types of well-established attacks: membership inference, which exposes data leakage (privacy); backdoor, which injects malicious behavior (security); and model stealing, which can violate intellectual property (privacy and security).
Our results show that there is no silver bullet for privacy and security in LLM adaptation and each technique has different strengths and weaknesses.

### Summary
The paper studies the privacy and security property of several parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods using 3 attacks.

### Strengths
1. The paper is the first to systematically study the privacy and security effect of parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods.
2. The paper is well-written and easy to follow.

### Weaknesses
1. I am mainly concerned that the results are not generalizable since these properties can heavily depends on the model architecture, the dataset and even the hyper-parameters used. The authors chose several open-source LLMs and a few language tasks, but only partially addresses the concern. I would suggest the authors to extend their evaluation to other modalities such as images.
2. The paper only evaluates 3 parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods. I would suggest conducting a more thorough study to cover more parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods.

### Summary
This paper evaluates the security and privacy risks of three adaptation methods, namely LoRA, soft prompt tuning, and in-context learning. The paper evaluates model privacy based on a loss-based membership inference attack and a model stealing attack. The model security is evaluated based on a backdoor attack.

### Strengths
1.	Security and privacy investigated in the paper are both critical for LoRA, soft prompt tuning, and in-context learning.
2.	This paper conducts the first comprehensive analysis on adaptation techniques, filling a gap in the existing literature in terms of security and privacy analysis. 
3.	Figure 1 provides a good summary of the overall evaluation results.

### Weaknesses
1.  My major concern is the outdated attacks used in the evaluation. Most evaluations are conducted based on out-of-date and less effective attacks. For example, the paper uses only a loss-based membership inference attack to evaluate the training data privacy, which has been shown ineffective in the existing work. Recent and more advanced attacks like LiRA [1] should be used. Similarly recent model stealing and backdoor attacks are not evaluated in the paper. 
2.  The paper only reports the evaluation results. However, the in-depth analysis of the results is missing. For example, why do LoRA and SPT achieve good privacy performance against membership inference attacks? Does the number of training samples or the number of training iterations play an important role in security/privacy risk? More in-depth ablations would benefit the paper.
3.  The security and privacy evaluation results do not include the accuracy results, which is insufficient. Typically, there exists a trade-off between accuracy and security/privacy. 
4.  It would be interesting to compare three adaptation techniques with a naïve fine-tuning approach regarding the security and privacy risks.

### Questions
Please provide a more in-depth analysis of the evaluation and the accuracy achieved by all the evaluated models.

### Summary
The paper investigates the susceptibility of fine-tuning techniques on LLMs to membership inference attacks, model stealing attacks and backdoor attacks. In the experimental evaluation, Low-Rank Adaption (LoRA), Soft Prompt Tuning (SPT) and In-Context Learning (ICL) are evaluated against these three types of attacks. The results show that not every fine-tuning method is equally susceptible to all three attacks. For example, while ICL is mostly resilient against backdoor attacks, membership inference attacks are very successful against models fine-tuned using ICL. Overall, it seems that each of these fine-tuning methods have their pros and cons regarding the susceptibility to security and privacy attacks. The paper raises awareness of these risks when using these fine-tuning methods.

### Strengths
- The paper is well structured, well written and easy to follow
- The fact that different fine-tuning methods are not equally susceptible to privacy and security attacks is intriguing
- The study of the privacy and security aspects of different fine-tuning methods seems to be novel and timely as LLMs are often not trained from scratch, but instead fine-tuned

### Weaknesses
 - The backdoor attack is only evaluated with the target label 0. The results might differ for targeting other classes, as other classes might be more difficult to predict using a backdoor.
- For the backdoor attacks, it would be nice to draw the baseline of random guessing into the attack success rate plots (Fig. 8 and Fig. 10). This allows the reader to quickly see how effective the backdoor attack is.
- With the limited context length of the LLMs it is hard to make a definitive conclusion about the susceptibility of ICL to membership inference attacks. There seems to be a trend that increasing the number of given examples reduces the susceptibility. However, the authors acknowledge this trend.

Misc:
- Page 9: missing word - "Finally, we investigate whether poisoning either the first or the [last] demonstration [...]"

### Questions
- Q1: How was the membership inference attack on ICL performed? And was the whole prompt/all of the given examples considered as the "member" here?
- Q2: What are the accuracies of the original fine-tuned models using ICL, SPT and LoRA on the different datasets?
- Q3: Could you provide experimental results for backdoor attacks with different target labels other than the label 0?
- Q4: "We do not replace clean samples but concatenate the fine-tunig dataset with the backdoored one" -> Does this mean that samples are present twice in the fine-tuning dataset? Once with the backdoor trigger and once without the backdoor trigger?
- Q5: Why is the standard deviation of the backdoor attacks so high?

### Summary
In this work, a comparison of three LLM adaptation methods is provided with regards to their resiliency against three privacy and security threats. As one might expect, no single technique emerges as a clear winner in terms of robustness but different techniques seem to have certain strengths and weaknesses.

### Strengths
1. The presentation, writing, and results in the paper (for example, Figure 1 to visualize the trade-off) are very clear and easy to follow.
2. The comparison seems comprehensive in the sense that it covers multiple different LLM architectures, different adaptation techniques, and multiple datasets.

### Weaknesses
I think that the while the paper claims to make assessments on security and privacy, the three attacks considered here are not comprehensive enough. For example, just on the basis of resiliency results again one backdoor attack and one model stealing attack, it might be a bit preemptive to make generalized statements regarding security. In particular, prompt injection attacks are a major security threat which do not seem to be covered here at all. Similarly, for privacy, while membership inference attack is one kind of threat, other relatively sophisticated privacy attacks pertaining to PII memorization/extraction can be crafted.

### Questions
1. While conducting the MIA, the classification is done based on loss function value. So is the assumption that the adversary knows the correct loss function? 
2. Also, what significance does the loss function value have for ICL exemplars? For LoRA and SPT, the LLM has learned to minimize loss on member exemplars, but I do not know what relationship the ICL samples have with the loss function value. 
3. In section 3.2, it is not clear what is meant by the sentence "Subsequently, we calibrate the hyperparameters of LoRA and SPT to align their performance with that of ICL." What exactly are the steps taken to ensure that the comparison of these methods is apples-to-apples? How can adding, say, 4 ICL examples be equated to performing LoRA with hundreds of training samples?
4. In the model stealing, the success of the attack is quantified by a certain "agreement" score between the target model and a surrogate model. Can the authors please define what this metric exactly is, as it is not available anywhere.
