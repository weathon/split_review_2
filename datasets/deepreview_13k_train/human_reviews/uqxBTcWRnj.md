# Bridging Neural and Symbolic Representations with Transitional Dictionary Learning

- Decision: Accept
- Scores: 5, 5, 8, 8

## Abstract
This paper introduces a novel Transitional Dictionary Learning (TDL) framework that can implicitly learn symbolic knowledge, such as visual parts and relations, by reconstructing the input as a combination of parts with implicit relations. We propose a game-theoretic diffusion model to decompose the input into visual parts using the dictionaries learned by the Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm, implemented as the online prototype clustering, based on the decomposition results. Additionally, two metrics, clustering information gain, and heuristic shape score are proposed to evaluate the model. Experiments are conducted on three abstract compositional visual object datasets, which require the model to utilize the compositionality of data instead of simply exploiting visual features.  Then, three tasks on symbol grounding to predefined classes of parts and relations, as well as transfer learning to unseen classes, followed by a human evaluation, were carried out on these datasets. The results show that the proposed method discovers compositional patterns, which significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art unsupervised part segmentation methods that rely on visual features from pre-trained backbones. Furthermore, the proposed metrics are consistent with human evaluations.

### Summary
This paper looks at a way to merge symbolic and DNN representations. The authors propose a transitional representation that contains high-fidelity details of the input and and also provides structural information about the semantics of the input. An Expectation-Maximization loop is used to optimize the parameters, where the Expectation step is used to optimize the hidden dictionary of parts, and maximize the overall likelihood of the dataset. To control the arity, techniques such as online clustering and random sampling are used. The authors conduct unsupervised segmentation on three abstract compositional visual object datasets and show superior accuracy compared to unsupervised clustering baselines.

### Strengths
Neuro-symbolic reasoning is a timely topic for research, and joint optimization of reconstruction and predicate logic appears to be an interesting idea. The method utilizes a dictionary of entities, and 1-any and 2-ary predicates as a neck to train the semantic distance during reconstruction. The works incorporates several interesting ideas such as Expectation Maximization, game-theoretic loss function and online prototype clustering to make the system work.

### Weaknesses
- The paper is a hard to read and the language is confusing. Technical concepts such as "hidden dictionaries of symbolic knowledge" are introduced early on without much explanation. The paper lacks clarity in defining the transitional representation and its connection to both symbolic and DNN aspects, making it difficult to grasp the core methodology.
- Experiments are limited to tiny, mostly binary datasets such as "ShapeNet5", which is basically a subset of 5 categories from the ShapeNet dataset. It is not clear if the methods would generalize to noisy real-world data, such as training using noisy, incomplete instances where the parts are not all visible. The datasets used do not reflect the complexity of real-world scenarios, raising concerns about the practical applicability of the proposed method. The lack of experiments on more complex datasets makes it difficult to assess the robustness of the approach.
- Although the paper provides a reasonably well-curated list of neuro-symbolic approaches, the evaluations do not compare against any of the recent approaches. Instead the comparison is against clustering baselines. The absence of comparisons against relevant neuro-symbolic methods makes it difficult to assess the novelty and superiority of the proposed approach. The chosen baselines are not directly comparable to the proposed method, limiting the conclusions that can be drawn from the experimental results.
- The paper reads as a mishmash of several different ideas that are used together, but not integrated coherently. Therefore having a ablation studies to show the value of each module would be crucial. However, the evaluations do not provide a clear understanding of the contribution of each component to the overall methodology. The lack of ablation studies makes it difficult to understand the importance of each component and how they interact to achieve the final results. The paper needs to dissect the contributions of the EM loop, game-theoretic loss, and online clustering.
- Ultimately, the task of reconstructing and explaining shapes simultaneously might be quite ambiguous as depicted in figure 4, and might not generalize to natural datasets, These aspects are not addressed in the paper. The paper does not address the inherent ambiguity of the reconstruction and explanation task, particularly when applied to complex or noisy data. The method's ability to handle ambiguous inputs and provide consistent interpretations is unclear.

### Questions
1. Are the predicates shared among different classes? Do predicates always correspond to semantic attributes? It would help to visualize the learnt 1-any and the 2-ary predicates. 
How does the method compare to other neuro-symbolic baselines? The current set of baselines are essentially unsupervised clustering methods.
2. 
2. Please provide a clear set of ablation studies which show the benefits drawn from each component. How can the system be simplified without affecting the overall accuracy.
3. It would be good to have a limitations section that discusses when this method wouldn't work. How do predicates such as left_of and larger (examples from the paper) operate in case of multi-view settings, where these terms become ambiguous.

### Summary
The paper targets the reconstruction of an input signal $x$ (evaluated with images and point clouds) through a combination of parts in a learning framework. The solution is formulated as an unsupervised dictionary learning problem and solved through EM. The method is evaluated and compared on three datasets including 2D non-overlapping lines, 2D handwritten characters, and 3D shapes.

### Strengths
+ The motivation and the background of the paper are well demonstrated and insightful in Sec. 1&2. The significance of the paper is clear and the arguments are insightful.

### Weaknesses
The major weakness of the paper is the bad presentation of Sec. 3&4 that greatly hinders the readers from understanding the paper.
- The annotation in Sec. 3 is in quite a mess. Scalar value, vector, set, and matrix are not in consistent forms, and multiple critical variables lack clear definition/explanation:
1) what is 'a' stands for in "such as Cat(a), Tree(a), Person(a)"? 
2) What is the relationship between $x_i$ and $x$? Seemingly the pieces of $x_i$ are determined by the masks and are directly combined into a whole instead of the linear addition. The assumption of linear combination needs to be explicitly stated and justified, especially given the non-linear nature of image and point cloud data.
3) What is the relationship between $r_i$ above Eq. 1, $R_i$ in Eq. 1, and $r_j^i$ below Eq. 1? The inconsistent notation makes it difficult to track the transformations and relationships between these variables. It's unclear how the individual part representations $r_i$ relate to the overall representation $R_i$, and how these are further indexed by $j$ to produce $r_j^i$.
4) How can $theta$ be optimized in Eq. 1 if it does not appear in the two terms? The definition of the decoder g(·) is not consistent. Does it take $theta$ as a condition or not? Seemingly Eq. 2 is the appropriate form. The lack of clarity on whether $g$ is conditioned on $\theta$ makes the optimization process ambiguous. The relationship between the decoder $g$ and the dictionary $\theta$ needs to be explicitly defined.
5) The definitions of two crical terms $E_{\tilde{D}}$ and $d_S$ are unclear. The expectation term $E_{\tilde{D}}$ lacks a clear explanation of what distribution it is taken over, and the ideal metric distance $d_S$ needs a more concrete definition in the context of the problem.
6) How is the dictionary $\tilde{D}$ obtained given the argument "As we have meaningful $\tilde{D}$"? The assumption of a meaningful dictionary $\tilde{D}$ is not justified, and the process of obtaining or learning this dictionary is not explained.
7) It seems that the only variable to be optimized is the hidden dictionary $\theta$. What about the models of $f(x;\theta)$, $\hat{g}(r_i;\theta)$, $g_{\theta}(R^i)$, and $g_{\tilde{D}(R)}$? The optimization process needs to clearly specify all parameters being optimized, including the parameters of the encoder $f$ and decoders $g$.

- The illustration of Fig. 2 does not clearly demonstrate the formulation in Sec. 3 and the solution in Sec. 4:
1) $f, R, r_i, g, x_i, m_i$ are not clearly labeled in the figure. The lack of clear labels makes it difficult to connect the figure to the mathematical formulation in the text.
2)Where is the $N_P$ copies of the model in the figure? The figure does not clearly show the multiple instances of the model used for different parts.
3) What does each patch stands for and what are the relation between the patches and the aforementioned terms in Sec. 3? The relationship between the visual patches and the variables in the formulation needs to be made explicit.
4) Why is there a "GT loss" in an unsupervised learning pipeline? The presence of a ground truth loss in an unsupervised setting is confusing and requires a clear explanation of its purpose and how it is derived without labels.
5) Where is the "Decomposition Loss" mentioned in Fig. 2? The figure does not clearly indicate where the decomposition loss is applied in the pipeline.

### Questions
Though Sec. 1&2 are well-demonstrated with clear motivations, the unsatisfied presentation of Sec. 3&4 makes the formulation and solution hard to follow. The authors are also encouraged to provide qualitative comparison results on Line World and ShapeNet5.

### Summary
This paper explores unsupervised part segmentation using a neural symbolic approach.  The authors propose Transitional Dictionary Learning for symbolic feature representations for representing the feature embedding as structural information.  This is done via a set of ‘players’ estimating the visual parts which are combined together for the reconstruction and clustering losses for self-supervised learning of the features.  In addition, a game-theoretic decomposition loss prevents one player from reconstruction everything or overlapping with other players.

### Strengths
The paper is well-written and easy to understand.  There are good explanations for each step of the approach.  The "Transitional Representation" section does a really good job of approaching the symbolic and neural representations.  


The method is topical and will be of interest to the ICLR community and the method seems to be novel for how to produce a dictionary of neuro-symbolic part segmentation.  

I really like the overarching goal for self-supervised part segmentation and the method seems to attack the problem directly.  The neural symbolic approach to ML has been of interest for a while and part segmentation is a good problem to apply it towards.

### Weaknesses
The biggest disappointment was not doing this on real visual data rather than on LineWorld data.  This is still useful with just LineWorld but showing on realworld data would be much more impressive.  The method's applicability to more complex, real-world scenarios remains unclear, limiting the impact of the work.

Running human evaluations requires an IRB or something similar not mentioned here.   This needs to be stated (anonymously) that you did actually go through someone to ensure the human experiments were done properly. The lack of detail regarding the human evaluation process raises concerns about the validity and ethical considerations of the study. Specifically, the absence of IRB approval or a similar ethical review process is a significant oversight.

### Questions
For Figure 3, could you compare a more conventional approach to compare against to see if this approach is causing it to be separated verse just from the data?  

Have you tried this on more complex data 2D images?

Can you elaborate on exactly what the human criteria were that they were evaluating?

### Summary
The paper introduces Transitional Dictionary Learning – a framework for implicitly learning symbolic knowledge, such as visual parts and relations, through input reconstruction using parts and implicit relations. This is done by employing a game-theoretic diffusion model for input decomposition, leveraging dictionaries learned by the Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm. Experimental results demonstrate the proposed approach’s efficacy through evaluation in discovering compositional patterns compared to SOTA methods, depicting human alignment with the predictions as well.

### Strengths
The paper provides a convincing motivation for the proposed methodology. It offers crucial insights into transitional representations, clustering information gain, and the reinforcement learning approach employed to optimize the objective. Overall, the paper exhibits a well-written supported by experimental evidence and a well-formulated mathematical framework. Figure 2, along with Section 4, elucidates the proposed approach and its crucial implementation details for the reader. I believe that this methodology holds significant promise for the research community, particularly in the midst of the surge of VLMs, where interpretable representations can not only serve as effective starting points or initializations, but also provide disentangled inputs for VLMs/LLMs to engage in high-level reasoning. The transfer learning experiments outlined in Table 2 provide strong evidence of the approach's utility beyond the confines of its training domain.

### Weaknesses
While the conducted experiments offer valuable insights into the effectiveness of the proposed approach, I would like to encourage the authors to extend their testing to more challenging real-world datasets. This expansion could further underscore the practical utility of the approach. Specifically, incorporating diverse categories of 3D objects from sources like ShapeNet, integrating written language datasets such as EMNIST, and including datasets featuring objects relevant to manipulation tasks would be valuable additions to the paper. Demonstrating the application of the proposed approach in contexts like robot manipulation or affordance prediction would provide tangible benefits for readers. The current evaluation primarily focuses on synthetic datasets, which might not fully capture the complexities and nuances of real-world scenarios. The lack of experiments on more complex datasets limits the generalizability of the findings. Furthermore, the paper could benefit from a more thorough analysis of the failure cases of the proposed approach, which would offer a more balanced view of its strengths and weaknesses.

### Questions
Apart from the points mentioned in the Weaknesses section, the paper could benefit from a broader discussion of its potential applications and impact, which would be valuable for the research community. Additionally, a more detailed analysis of the computational resources and time required would be helpful for readers seeking to implement the proposed methodology.
