# Rational Decision-Making Agent with Internalized Utility Judgment

- Decision: Reject
- Scores: 8, 5, 6, 6

## Abstract
Large language models~(LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable advancements and have attracted significant efforts to develop LLMs into agents capable of executing intricate multi-step decision-making tasks beyond traditional NLP applications.
Existing approaches to LLM-based decision-making predominantly build upon the manually-designed external performance metrics to guide the decision-making process.
However, reliance on the external performance metrics as prior is problematic in real-world scenarios, where such prior may be unavailable, flawed, or even erroneous.
For genuine autonomous decision making, it is imperative for the agent to develop its rationality from its posterior experiences to judge decisions independently.
Central to the development of rationality is the construction of an internalized utility judgment, capable of assigning numerical utilities to each decision.
This paper proposes \model (\underline{Ra}tional \underline{D}ecision-Making \underline{Agent}), which fosters the development of its rationality through an iterative framework involving \textit{Experience Exploration} and \textit{Utility Learning}.
Within this framework, \elo is devised to assign Elo scores to individual decision steps to judge their utilities via pairwise comparisons. 
Consequently, these Elo scores guide the decision-making process to derive optimal outcomes.
Experimental results on the ToolBench dataset demonstrate \model's superiority over baselines, achieving over 10\% improvement in Pass Rate on diverse tasks. 
It offers higher-quality solutions and reduces costs (ChatGPT API calls), highlighting its effectiveness and efficiency.

### Confidence
4: You are confident in your assessment, but not absolutely certain. It is unlikely, but not impossible, that you did not understand some parts of the submission or that you are unfamiliar with some pieces of related work.

### Summary
The submission proposes a new approach to LLM-based decision making that it calls RaDAgent. The approach works by computing elo scores to decision sequences using the outcomes of LLM-based pairwise evaluations of decision sequences.

### Strengths
I am not aware of any existing approaches resembling the one proposed in the paper. The key idea of backing out elo rankings using pairwise evaluations from an LLM is intuitively appealing, but subtle enough that the submission merits credit for originality. 

The submission is mostly clear and mostly well-written. 

LLM decision making is an important problem and the submission's results are strong relative to existing previous works.

### Weaknesses
### Clarity Issues

Below I list a couple of places I had trouble following along with some explanations.

---

> In contrast, RADAGENT assigns lower scores to fewer potential decision steps, displaying a trend for exploring novel avenues, which exemplifies a scenario demanding diversity in exploration.

I wasn't able to parse this sentence.

---

In RQ5, I feel there could be some more guidance to the reader. It seems like RaDAgent has the highest or tied for highest incidence ratio for both Hallucinated Tool and Tool Call Error. If I understand the meaning of incidence ratio correctly, high values are undesirable. Yet the text does not really provide any discussion of these results, so I am left a bit confused as to what to make of them. Is this because the other methods fail for other reasons? What do these numbers really tell us?

### Structure of Paper

I think related work would be better placed earlier in the paper (prior to experiments). It would help the reader better contextualize the both RaDAgent and the baselines.

I also find the structure of the experiments is a bit rambly. Having section an experimental settings section and RQ1-5 is fine, but then having an additional discussion section after 5 previous subsections that are already discussing results feels kind of disorganized, especially since there is some overlap. In particular, each section of the discussion contrasts RaDAgent against existing methods, which according to the description of RQ5 (What are the key differentiating factors of RADAGENT against other methods?), is supposed to be within its purview.

### Questions
How important is the utility learning prompt to performance? Were other prompts tried? How much worse would the performance be with a simpler prompt?

How much hyperparameter tuning was done on the hyperparameters $\hat{d}$ and $K$? What was the performance of other hyperparameters that were tried?

---

Overall, I liked the submission. The idea to use elo rankings from pairwise comparison makes intuitive sense to me and the results seem strong.

### Summary
The paper proposes an approach for integrating RL/MDP type methods for use with LLMs. RL methods typically function by interacting with the environment (exploring) and greedily selecting actions (exploiting). However, such methods rely on the Reward function being available and the agent being capable of perceiving rewards at each step. 

The authors propose RADAGENT, an agent that can utilize RL-type sequential decision-making methods in the absence of a reward function. In order to do so, the authors devise a customized reward function (reward shaping) that is based on the Elo rating system. Each episode (decision sequence) assigns a reward following three-valued logic (1, 0 or 0.5) depending on the outcome. These are propagated upward in a bottom-up fashion enabling the agent to eventually self-evaluate earlier steps in the decision making process. The exploration process is similar to methods like $\epsilon$-greedy but now conditioned as a softmax over elo scores.

The authors then provide an empirical evaluation on a few datasets and showcase that their approach is able to outperform baseline methods.

### Strengths
1. The paper builds on known principles on sequential decision making

2. The results presented have a sizeable performance lead over the baselines

### Weaknesses
I think that the paper has a few weaknesses in some key areas that might limit its applicability.

Also, the empirical evaluation section was a bit confusing to read. A bit of reorganization here might help.

1. The paper mentions (Sec 3.2) the initial elo scores for a decision sequence (iteration 1) are fixed. How are comparisons performed? IE how is a "win" determined? I assume it is binary (task completed or not). In this case, are two decision sequences where both are "wins" but one is longer than the other compared? (Longer ones require more API calls I assume).

2. Building upon #2 above, the paper claims that there is a performance measure absent. That would mean that there is no real way of determining the final utility or "win". I think that there is some human-expert knowledge that is required for RADAGENT to be able to function. Could you please clarify this?

3. Why the specific use of Elo and not a different rating system like Glicko? There is not sufficient motivation for the choice of Elo.

### Questions
I have asked my questions in the weaknesses section itself.

### Summary
The authors introduce a novel rational decision-making agent, RaDAgent, which seeks to instill rationality in large language models (LLMs) through internalized utility judgment. RaDAgent operates on an iterative framework that encompasses experience exploration and utility learning to establish this internalized utility judgment. During experience exploration, the agent samples the next decision step from a Boltzmann distribution, which is determined by their Elo scores. To learn the Elo score function, the method employs pairwise comparison and subsequent score update. It starts by recalibrating the Elo scores of the final decision steps in each sequence based on pairwise comparison, then updates the Elo scores of preceding steps using the scores of their subsequent decision steps. Various experimental tasks validate RaDAgent's superiority over its competitors.

### Strengths
1. The paper is articulate, presenting high-quality content that is easy to follow.
2. The methodology proposed is novel. By leveraging LLM’s inherent capability for value assessment, it pioneers a way to guide decision-making without the need for manually tailored prompts for value evaluation.
3. The experimental results robustly corroborate the efficacy of the proposed method. RaDAgent consistently surpasses the benchmarks in various tasks. Moreover, the correlation observed between Elo scores and pass rates further underlines the effectiveness of the Elo-based Utility Construction in gauging decision utility.

### Weaknesses
1. The revelation of the experimental details is inadequate. Notably, not all prompts used are revealed, and no examples are provided. Such omissions pose a challenge for reproducibility and make it difficult to pinpoint the source of the observed improvements. Specifically, the prompts used for the pairwise comparison in Elo score updates, and the exact format of the input to the LLM for decision-making, are absent. Without these details, it's difficult to assess the sensitivity of the method to prompt variations and the degree to which the observed performance is attributable to the specific prompt design.
2. There's a conspicuous absence of an ablation study concerning the Elo-based value evaluation. By not contrasting it with a manual value evaluation prompt, it remains ambiguous whether the observed performance boost arises from the Elo-based valuation, the experience exploration, or both. Furthermore, it's unclear how the Elo-based approach compares to other automated value evaluation methods, like using a simpler prompt or a hand-crafted heuristic, leaving a gap in understanding the specific benefits of the proposed approach. The lack of comparison to a manually designed strategy also leaves open the possibility that a well-designed external heuristic could perform equally well or better.

### Questions
1. I suggest revealing all experimental details so that the contribution can be properly evaluated and reproduced.
2. It would be helpful to conduct an extra experiment comparing the Elo-based evaluation and manually designed value evaluation.
3. Why is the Boltzmann distribution used? How about using upper confidence tree for searching?

### Summary
This paper proposes RADAGENT, a Large-Language-Model(LLM)-based decision-making agent that does not need external performance feedback. RADAGENT explores in a tree stucture similar to Tree-of-Thought and learns a utility of solutions based on ELO scores over different outcomes. The ELO score is calculated by LLM-prompted pairwise comparison between solutions, and guides the annealed probability of choosing branches for exploration. The result with the best ELO score is used as the final solution. On sevaral decision-making environments, RADAGENT outperforms ReAct, Tree-of-Thought-based methods and Reflexion.

### Strengths
1. The problem studied by this paper, how to improve the decision-making ability of Large Language Model (LLMs) with no external feedback, is timely and interesting. For example, on some reasoning environments that can be modeled as decision-making ones such as HotPotQA [1], it is very reasonable that the agent does not know whether its answer is correct until it gives the final answer. External feedback would also make tasks such as fact verification [2] and multiple choices [3] trivial, and thus decision-making with no external feedback is important. 

2. The proposed solution based on ELO scores and tree-of-thought is simple, intuitive, yet effective on multiple environments.

### Weaknesses
 **1. The presentation of the work is not clear enough.**

a) The state, action and decision step in the context is not well-defined. As Large Language Models (LLMs) take text as input and output text, it is unclear what do state and action correspond to in the context. I assume the authors develop their method based on ReAct [1] and Tree-of-Thought [2] as illustrated in Figure 1, but they are not properly introduced in the methodology part. In addition, I would recommend the authors to emphasize that the reward is not given in Markov Decision Process (MDP) of this paper, which is uncommon.

b) The "subsequent step" in Sec. 3.1 is unclear. In preliminary section, decision steps have a subscript that stands for the number of steps, and "subsequent step" can be comprehended as a chain of steps following the current step. but in Sec. 3.1, the subsequent step with different subscript should be different versions of next step. Also, I would suggest to introduce $n$, change $\hat{d}$ to $d_{n+1}$ (because $\hat{d}$ has no subscript), and change $\sum_j$ to $\sum_{j=1}^{n+1}$.

**2. Prompts for each environment is not specified.** Only the prompt for utility learning is listed; the prompt for each environment is missing in the appendix.

**3. The authors could perform more ablations on the exploration process.** The exploration process is controlled by multiple factors, such as temperature $\tau$, initial ELO score $\hat{v}$ and ELO coefficient $r$, and because the probability of exploring a new decision is exponential to the initial ELO score, it is intuitive that RADAGENT might fall into local minima where the currently best solution presents in the branch but can still be improved. Thus, it would be better if an ablation study on the hyperparameter could be performed to better measure the robustness of RADAGENT.

### Questions
I have one question: how does the method work with GPT-4, which I expect would give us even better performance? Also, I would suggest the authors to include a pseudocode in the appendix to help the readers better understand the algortihm process.
