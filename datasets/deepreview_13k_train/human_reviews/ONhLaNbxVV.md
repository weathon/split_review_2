# Improving Prototypical Part Networks with Reward Reweighing, Reselection, and Retraining

- Decision: Reject
- Scores: 6, 5, 6, 6

## Abstract
In recent years, work has gone into developing deep interpretable methods for image classification that clearly attributes a model's output to specific features of the data. One such of these methods is the \textit{prototypical part network} (ProtoPNet), which attempts to classify images based on meaningful parts of the input. While this method results in interpretable classifications, it often learns to classify from spurious or inconsistent parts of the image. Hoping to remedy this, we take inspiration from the recent developments in Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF) to fine-tune these prototypes. By collecting human annotations of prototypes quality via a 1-5 scale on the CUB-200-2011 dataset, we construct a reward model that learns to identify non-spurious prototypes. In place of a full RL update, we propose the \textit{reweighed, reselected, and retrained prototypical part network} (R3-ProtoPNet), which adds an additional three steps to the ProtoPNet training loop. The first two steps are reward-based reweighting and reselection, which align prototypes with human feedback. The final step is retraining to realign the model's features with the updated prototypes. We find that R3-ProtoPNet improves the overall consistency and meaningfulness of the prototypes, and maintains or improves individual model performance. When multiple trained R3-ProtoPNets are incorporated into an ensemble, we find an increase in interpretability and an increase in predictive performance.

### Confidence
4: You are confident in your assessment, but not absolutely certain. It is unlikely, but not impossible, that you did not understand some parts of the submission or that you are unfamiliar with some pieces of related work.

### Summary
The authors propose three modifications to the training of prototypical part networks, inspired by RLHF (i..e using lay human feedback on the quality of prototypes). The authors demonstrate that this approach improves the interpretability of the learned prototypes according to three metrics, and provide qualitative support for the improvements conferred by their approach.

### Strengths
Clear relationship with differentiation from/discussion of improvements from protopnet. 
Overall well written, specially the section on 4.2. Very good integration of notes, explanation, and notation/math (this is surprisingly rare, so good job!).

### Weaknesses
While it's great that your scope is clear, it ends up feeling a bit like a lab report, where your assignment was to apply RLHF to ProtoPNet and report the results. This isn't bad per-se; science for the sake of doing it can be great, but ideally for a scholarly paper I would want to see some more interpretation, insight, and high-level thinking. Specifically, the paper could benefit from a more in-depth discussion of how the proposed R3-ProtoPNet contributes to the broader field of interpretable deep learning. What new understandings does it offer about the interplay between human feedback and prototype learning? How does it advance the state-of-the-art beyond simply combining existing techniques?

It would also be nice to see some more illustrative/selective qualitative results. The current qualitative analysis feels somewhat superficial. Providing a more detailed examination of specific examples, highlighting both successes and failures of the R3-ProtoPNet, would strengthen the paper. For instance, showcasing cases where the model correctly identifies and focuses on relevant features, as well as instances where it still struggles with spurious correlations, would provide a more nuanced understanding of the method's capabilities and limitations.

Finally, it would be ideal to have an evaluation done by expert human evaluators (whatever that group might be depending on the intended goal of the paper, if any) -- ie. most likely, ornithologists or birders. Given that the focus is on interpretability, how useful are the prototypes actually, to humans who might use them? Do they find the same characteristic features people use for ID? Any novel and interesting ones? The lack of expert evaluation makes it difficult to assess the real-world applicability of the proposed method. While the CUB-200-2011 dataset is a common benchmark, its utility for evaluating interpretability for domain experts remains unclear.

Captions of tables could be improved to be more descriptive. Currently, the captions are too brief to provide sufficient context for understanding the presented data.

The "parts" highlighted by the original or your modified version tend to be very soft-edged and blobby. In some sense I would "like" to see prototypes that crisply highlight e.g. tails, feet, beaks, etc. Do you think this is desirable and/or possible? Why or why not? E.g. the pixel-level segmentation maps used in AP seem like they could provide very good supervisory signal for this. The soft-edged nature of the prototypes might be due to the inherent limitations of the ProtoPNet architecture, which relies on comparing upsampled prototypes to image patches. This process could lead to a loss of spatial precision. Exploring alternative architectures or incorporating techniques like attention mechanisms might help in achieving sharper prototype localization.

I also feel there could be a more nuanced discussion of what makes a feature spurious or not. E.g. it's repeatedly stated that the background is spurious, but (as an amateur birer) I can tell you habitat (especially if it includes something as characteristic as a nest) can often be incredibly useful for identification. Even the presence of sky vs. grass or sea or something could be informative (e.g. woodland thrushes would virtually never be photographed against open sky, unlike a swallow). And even at a more general level, the shape/contour of e.g. tailfeathers or the bird's overall silhouette (i.e. the edge pixels which would include some bg) are also often characteristic. The paper should acknowledge that the definition of "spurious" can be context-dependent and that features considered spurious in one context might be informative in another. A more thorough discussion of this issue, potentially drawing on insights from cognitive science or domain expertise, would enhance the paper's rigor.

The main stated high-level goal of the work is to improve interpretability ... for whom, and for what purpose? If everything worked "perfectly", what would this system be able to do/be used for? Or if it doesn't have a goal in mind (which again, IMO is totally fine and great for science), what do we understand better about RLHF or Prototype nets or deep nets in general as a result of your work? The paper would benefit from a clearer articulation of the intended audience and the specific use cases for the proposed method. This would help readers understand the practical implications of the work and its potential impact on the field.

small things:- protopnet should be cited in abs- briefly state what results/evidence you found supports the claims about improvement (second to last sentence) - suggest renaming the section "limitations" to "limitations of ProtoPNet" to avoid confusion with typical "limitations" sections. - interpretability ...leads to a .... suggest rephrasing as "interpretabilty ... is useful for RLHF" or something like that.  - explain what is the Bradley Terry Model and why you want to use it

### Summary
The authors propose a debugging procedure for Part-prototype Networks based on human feedback.  Rather than using the feedback as-is, as done by prior work, the proposed method (R3-PPNet) uses it to train a reward function, which generalizes said feedback, and use the latter to drive the model away from bad prototypes.  The model refinement step uses a couple of heuristics to improve the model.  Experiments are carried out on the CUB-200 dataset augmented with prototype rating feedback collected with Mechanical Turk.

### Strengths
**Originality**: To the best of my knowledge, the idea of combining RLHF mechanics and concept debugging (also, I like it a lot).

**Quality*:  The proposed technique is sensible (all three stages), and makes good use of existing techniques.  The coverage of related work is good.  The experimental setup is mostly satisfactory (for instance, the authors consider several backbones and good evaluation metrics), but see below.  I also appreciate how the authors were upfront about limitations of their technique.

**Clarity**: The text is very readable.  Ideas are conveyed clearly.

**Significance**:  This work tackles an important problem in concept-based models.  The key contribution is, in my opinion, showing that RLHF can be used for debugging learned concepts (or steering the model towards using better concepts).  The specific algorithm itself is not core, and it could be improved, I think.  Regardless, I believe the main contribution will have some impact on interactive debugging techniques.

### Weaknesses
 **Originality**:  This work combines existing ideas.  The degree of novelty, from a technical perspective, is limited (but still sufficient, in my opinion).

**Quality**:  [Q1] One issue with the experiments is that they consider a single data set (CUB-200).  Bontempelli et al. (cited by the authors) do evaluate their approach on three data sets (CUB-200, a synthetic data set, and an X-ray data set).  The choice of focusing on CUB-200 only is not exactly justified.

[Q2] It is also not clear why R3-PPNet was not compared to the work of Bontempelli et al. -- it should be trivial to convert tratings into binary lables (say, ratings below 3 could be converted to a "bad" label, and 4 and above to "good").

[Q3] One clear downside of the approach is that the reward model is pre-trained on a large number (in terms of annotation cost) of ratings.  While the cost of collecting ratings is generally compensated for when dealing with LLMs (as these models can be used for a variety of tasks, so you'd want them to be as good as possible), the cost-benefit ration for ProtoPNets is not as clear.  I think this should, at the bare minimum, be discussed in the limitations.


**Minor issues**:

- In Section 5.1, you wrote "R3-ProtoPNet requires two datasets", but that's not true.  It needs one dataset with additional annotations:  now new *inputs* are added by this second "dataset".  I'd prefer if the text was changed accordingly.

### Questions
Please see Q1-Q3 above.

Q4.  It seems to me R3-PPNet is designed for passive learning only.  The reason is that, if I understand correctly, the reward function (which depends on the learned model) becomes obsolete after fine-tuning/debugging the model.  If the debugged model is still buggy, the old reward function cannot be used again.  Is this correct?

Q5.  How have alpha, beta, and gamma been chosen in the experiments?  How should users of your system choose them?  How sensitive is the quality of the resulting model to the choice of thresholds?

### Summary
In this paper, the authors proposed a reward reweighed, reselected, and retrained prototypical part network (R3-ProtoPNet) that improves upon the original prototypical part network (ProtoPNet) by Chen et al. (2019). Given a trained ProtoPNet, the proposed R3-ProtoPNet involves: (1) collecting human feedback regarding the quality of learned prototypes; (2) learning a reward function that takes as input an image and its prototype activation map from a particular prototype, and outputs a reward that represents how good the prototype activation map is for the given image; (3) using the learned reward function to reweigh the inverse distance to a prototype and to improve the prototype; (4) reselecting prototypes whose rewards are below a threshold by replacing them with random patch representations whose rewards are above the acceptance threshold; (5) retraining the model to improve the prediction accuracy. The authors performed extensive experiments using several ProtoPNet models with various base architectures, and concluded that their R3-ProtoPNet has higher test accuracy, higher average rewards (based on the learned reward function), and higher activation precision over the original ProtoPNet.

### Strengths
- The authors proposed a way to improve the prediction accuracy of ProtoPNet, which is an important interpretable deep classifier.
- The proposed method is generally sound.
- The paper is easy to read.

### Weaknesses
 - There is no evaluation of the learned reward function.
- While the proposed R3-ProtoPNet does empirically improve the prediction accuracy over the original ProtoPNet, there is little theoretical insight as to what makes R3-ProtoPNet work.
- Is it necessary to have both reward reweighing and prototype reselection? More specifically, while prototype reselection is more necessary (it is a way to move away from badly learned/low-reward prototypes), reward reweighing seems optional to me. An ablation study on this will be helpful.
- There are limited visualizations. While the authors did include visualizations of prototypes (in the appendix), they did not include enough examples of how prototypes are used in R3-ProtoPNet, the closest prototypes to a given image from a trained R3-ProtoPNet, and the closest image patches to a given prototype learned by an R3-ProtoPNet. These are needed to convince readers that an R3-ProtoPNet uses high-quality prototypes in reasoning, and the learned prototypes are semantically meaningful.

### Questions
- An R3-ProtoPNet can be thought of as initializing a ProtoPNet in a smart way (by reward reweighing and prototype reselection), and then training it again. As mentioned earlier, is there any explanation for why this empirically improves the prediction performance?
- As mentioned before, is it necessary to have both reward reweighing and prototype reselection? Please include an ablation study on this.

### Summary
The paper proposes a new method called R3-ProtoPNet to improve the interpretability and performance of the prototypical part network (ProtoPNet). ProtoPNet is an interpretable image classifier that makes predictions based on prototypical parts of images. However, it can learn spurious or inconsistent prototypes. R3-ProtoPNet collects human feedback on prototype quality to train a reward model. The reward model predicts human preferences between prototypes. R3-ProtoPNet has 3 stages - reward reweighting, prototype reselection, and retraining. Reweighting uses the reward model to update prototypes to be more similar to highly rewarded patches according to human preference. Reselection replaces low reward prototypes with random high reward patch candidates. Retraining realigns the network features and classification layer with the improved prototypes. Experiments were done on CUB-200-2011 birds dataset using VGG, ResNet, and DenseNet architectures. Human ratings of prototype-image pairs were collected via Amazon Mechanical Turk.
The reward model achieved over 90% accuracy in predicting human prototype preferences. R3-ProtoPNet improved average prototype reward by 31.65% and activation precision by 46.85% over ProtoPNet.

### Strengths
Advantages of the approach:
Inspired by the RLHF, the authors use a flexible human feedback mechanism via learned reward model. Reward model also provides a quantifiable metric for prototype quality. Reweighting and reselection improve prototype interpretability. Retraining maintains or improves predictive performance.
This approach can be applied to different base architectures like VGG, ResNet, etc.
Most importantly, reward-guided training aligns prototypes to human preferences.
The results are quite compelling: it achieves high reward model accuracy in predicting human preferences -- this indicates it captures prototype quality well. Increased average reward shows prototypes are more meaningful after R3 training.
Improved activation precision verifies R3 prototypes have better overlap with birds. R3 training maintains or improves accuracy, showing no loss of predictive power. R3 ensemble outperforms ProtoPNet ensemble, demonstrating improved performance.
Examples show reduced dependence on background and other spurious features after R3 training.
Thus, retraining enables improved prototypes to be utilized for better prediction.

### Weaknesses
Some potential weaknesses include:
The approach strikes as overly hand-crafted. The beauty of ProtoPNet was exactly in that it learned parts from coarse labels. Compared to that, the proposed approach is overly reliant on guidance by manually collected labels. Specifically, the reliance on human-provided prototype ratings introduces a strong bias, potentially limiting the model's ability to discover novel or unexpected features that might be useful for classification, even if not immediately interpretable to humans. The method's dependence on a reward model trained on human preferences also raises concerns about the subjectivity and potential inconsistencies in human ratings, which could lead to suboptimal prototype selection.
Limited evaluation on just one dataset (CUB birds) - needs more diverse evaluation. The CUB dataset, while commonly used, is relatively constrained in terms of object diversity and background complexity. The method's performance on more challenging datasets with greater variability in object appearance and context is unclear. This limited evaluation makes it difficult to assess the generalizability of the proposed approach.
Duplicate prototypes still occur after R3 training. The persistence of duplicate prototypes suggests that the reweighting and reselection mechanisms may not be sufficiently robust in eliminating redundant representations. This could indicate a need for more sophisticated prototype management strategies.
Reward model may not sufficiently capture cross-image consistency. The reward model, trained on individual prototype-image pairs, may not adequately capture the consistency of a prototype's relevance across different images of the same class. This could lead to prototypes that are highly rated in some contexts but less meaningful in others.
Potential for reward model to penalize useful but non-obvious features. The reward model, by prioritizing human-interpretable features, may inadvertently penalize features that are useful for classification but not immediately obvious to human raters, such as subtle textures or contrast variations. This could limit the model's ability to learn a complete and robust feature representation.

### Questions
You showed results on the CUB birds dataset. How does R3-ProtoPNet perform on more complex, diverse datasets like ImageNet? Does it still improve interpretability and accuracy?
Can you provide some analysis or examples showing that R3 training does not lose focus on useful non-obvious features like texture or contrast?
How sensitive is R3-ProtoPNet to the amount and quality of human feedback data for the reward model? How little data can you use and still see benefits?
You retrain the full network - have you tried only retraining the classifier layers? This could improve efficiency.
How does R3-ProtoPNet scale to larger datasets and models? Is the computational overhead of R3 prohibitive?
