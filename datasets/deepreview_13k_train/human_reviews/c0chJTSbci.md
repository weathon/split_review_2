- Decision: Accept
- Scores: 5, 8, 6, 6

## Abstract
If generalist robots are to operate in truly unstructured environments, they need to be able to recognize and reason about novel objects and scenarios. Such objects and scenarios might not be present in the robot's own training data. We propose \methodname, a method that leverages an image-editing diffusion model to act as a high-level planner by proposing intermediate subgoals that a low-level controller can accomplish. Specifically, we finetune InstructPix2Pix on video data, consisting of both human videos and robot rollouts, such that it outputs hypothetical future ``subgoal'' observations given the robot's current observation and a language command. We also use the robot data to train a low-level goal-conditioned policy to act as the aforementioned low-level controller. We find that the high-level subgoal predictions can utilize Internet-scale pretraining and visual understanding to guide the low-level goal-conditioned policy, achieving significantly better generalization and precision than conventional language-conditioned policies.
We achieve state-of-the-art results on the CALVIN benchmark, and also demonstrate robust generalization on real-world manipulation tasks, beating strong baselines that have access to privileged information or that utilize orders of magnitude more compute and training data.

### Summary
SuSIE enables robots to recognize and reason about new objects and scenarios using a pre-trained image editing diffusion model, InstructPix2Pix. It proposes intermediate subgoals for the robot to reach, which are fine-tuned on robot data. A low-level policy is trained to reach these subgoals, resulting in robust generalization capabilities. The approach successfully solves real robot control tasks with novel objects, distractors, and environments in both real world and simulation settings.

### Strengths
SuSIE uses a pre-trained image editing diffusion model as a high-level planner, along with a low-level goal-conditioned policy trained to achieve these subgoals.
The approach successfully solves real robot control tasks that involve new objects, distractions, and environments.
The method is compared to existing approaches in terms of incorporating semantic information from pre-trained models.
The paper is well-written and easy-to-read.

### Weaknesses
The diffusion model and low-level policy are trained separately, meaning the diffusion model is unaware of the low-level policy's capabilities. This separation could lead to the generation of subgoals that are physically unrealizable or too challenging for the low-level policy to achieve, especially in dynamic environments. There is no discussion on how to handle the situation if the generated subgoal is incorrect, nor are there any mechanisms for error detection and recover. The system lacks a feedback loop where the success or failure of the low-level policy could influence the high-level planning. Most of the tasks presented in the paper appear to be easily solvable using pre-trained perception modules and traditional planning methods. The manipulation tasks, such as placing a crayon in a bowl, do not require complex reasoning or dynamic planning. The core of the method InstructPix2Pix can only infer from visual information and cannot infer any physical properties of the scene that certain tasks require. This limits the method's ability to handle tasks that depend on understanding object mass, friction, or stability. Real-world evaluation is conducted in just three scenes, which may not fully capture the complexity and variability of actual manipulation tasks. The limited number of scenes and tasks makes it difficult to assess the method's generalization capabilities in diverse real-world settings.

### Questions
1. In Algorithm 1
I was wondering how to determine the key frames that cannot be described in a single instruction. You mentioned sampling a new subgoal every K steps. How do you choose the goal sampling interval K to ensure the subgoals are plausible enough?  
2. In 5.2 you mention "an understanding of dynamics to predict how to move and rotate the gripper to grasp it."
How can you determine the plausibility of the prediction in terms of dynamics, given that the generating subgoals and learning low-level control policies are separate?  
3. It seems that an extremely accurate pose of the end effectors is needed. I am somewhat concerned that the precision of the genarated subgoal frame may not be sufficient to achieve it.

### Summary
This paper tackles the problem of zero-shot generalization to novel environments, objects, and scenarios in the context of robotics dexterous manipulation. The tasks are defined by a starting and end states, provided as visual observations. The goal is then to control a robotic arm to reach the goal state from the start state.

Authors propose to leverage large pre-trained language-guided image editing diffusion models to hallucinate the next subgoal or waypoint to reach to complete a given task. The diffusion model is thus used as a high-level planner whose goal is to output a close next sub-goal to find. A low-level policy is also trained to reach a sub-goal given its current state.

The diffusion model is fine-tuned on robotic data to learn to predict a waypoint given a language intersection, while the low-level policy is trained with behavior cloning on a dataset of trajectories.

The main claim of the paper is that the knowledge coming from Internet-scale pre-training of diffusion models allows a broader generalization to new scenarios and that such models are able to provide physically realistic new sub-goals. As all high-level planning is done by the generative model, the policy only has to perform low-level short-term control to reach a close waypoint, leading to more precise manipulation.

Experiments are conducted both in simulation and on a real-world robotic platform, and the introduced method is compared against diverse relevant baselines.

### Strengths
* **S1**: The idea is straightforward and properly motivated in the paper. Indeed, defining two modules, i.e. high-level planning and low-level control, appears to be an interesting idea to simplify the task to learn. Moreover, framing high-level planning as an image editing task and focusing on only predicting the short-term future (instead of full video prediction) is an appealing approach.

* **S2**: The paper is well-written and easy to follow.

* **S3**: Experiments are conducted both in simulation and on a real-world platform, and the proposed method is compared against several challenging baselines.

### Weaknesses
 * **W1**: **[Major]** Quality of the predicted sub-goals: Authors present a qualitative study of predicted sub-goals in Figure 3. They claim that the predicted sub-goal images are physically plausible and of higher quality when leveraging the *InstructPix2Pix* pre-training. I find it hard to assess the quality of the generated images only from looking at these examples. This leads to 2 concerns:
    * **W1.1**: Is the pre-training improving the downstream policy performance? The paper only presents a qualitative comparison of predicted sub-goals. Authors should report quantitative results, controlling the low-level policy to reach subgoals generated by the 2 models (with and without InstructPix2Pix pre-training) to show that the Internet-scale pre-training brings a boost in performance. It is not clear if the improvement in sub-goal image quality directly translates to better task performance. A more rigorous analysis is needed to validate the claim that pre-training is beneficial for the downstream policy.
    * **W1.2**: Are the predicted subgoals really physically plausible, and is it a pre-requisite for the low-level policy to succeed in controlling the robotic arm? By looking at Figure 3, it is not easy to verify that sub-goals are physically plausible. Further experiments should be conducted to verify this quantitatively. Moreover, authors should conduct experiments to show that having physically plausible sub-goals improves the performance of the low-level policy. A possible scenario might be that sub-goals are not always physically plausible, but through its training, the low-level policy has learned to come as close as possible to sub-goals while avoiding ending up in any undesirable state. It is essential to determine if the low-level policy is robust to physically implausible sub-goals, or if such sub-goals lead to a significant performance drop.

* **W2**: **[Major]** How are findings from Figure 4 generalizable? It shows qualitative rollouts from the proposed method and RT-2-X which seem to indicate that RT-2-X manipulates objects with less precision. However, quantitative results in Table 2 show that RT-2-X outperforms the introduced method in certain tasks, showing it might be more precise in some cases. The qualitative results in Figure 4 should be backed up by more quantitative evidence to make stronger claims about the method's precision compared to RT-2-X. The fact that RT-2-X outperforms the proposed method in some tasks raises concerns about the generalizability of the qualitative results.

* **W3**: **[Major]** RT-2-X outperforms the method on certain tasks. However, as mentioned by the authors, RT-2-X was trained on a large robotics dataset and the proposed method still showcases promising performance on most tasks. I thus believe this smaller performance compared with RT-2-X on scene C does not outweigh the interesting contributions of this work. The fact that RT-2-X outperforms the proposed method in certain tasks indicates that the method might not be universally superior. It is important to analyze the reasons behind this performance difference and discuss the limitations of the proposed method.

* **W4**: **[Minor]** To the best of my knowledge, the policy action space is not described in the main paper. A description should be added. The lack of a clear definition of the action space makes it difficult to fully understand the experimental setup and reproduce the results. The dimensionality and nature of the action space should be specified.

* **W5**: **[Minor]** Even if authors properly reference the paper of interest and refer to the appendix later, the following sentence is quite vague: “To obtain a robust goal-reaching policy in Phase (ii), we follow the implementation details prescribed by Walke et al. (2023).” Additional details should be added directly in the main paper following this sentence. The reliance on implementation details from another paper without providing sufficient context in the main paper makes it difficult to assess the specific choices made in the low-level policy training. More details should be included to ensure clarity and reproducibility.

### Summary
The paper discusses the challenge of enabling robots to recognize and respond to novel objects and situations that were not part of their training data. While robotic manipulation datasets have expanded, they can never encompass every potential object or context a robot might encounter. To address this, the paper proposes integrating semantic knowledge into language-guided robotic control by leveraging pre-trained vision and language models.

In essence, the proposed approach, SuSIE, decomposes the robotic control problem into two phases. In the first phase, an image-editing model is fine-tuned on robot data, allowing it to generate hypothetical future subgoals based on the robot's current observation and a natural language command. These subgoals serve as intermediate objectives that guide the robot towards accomplishing the user-specified task. Importantly, the image-editing model doesn't need to understand how to achieve these subgoals; it only generates them based on semantics. In the second phase, a low-level goal-reaching policy is employed to help the robot reach these hypothetical subgoals. This policy focuses on inferring visuo-motor relationships for correct actuation but doesn't require a deep understanding of semantics. By breaking down the task into smaller, semantically guided subgoals, the overall problem becomes more manageable. SuSIE is compared against a diverse set of approaches, and shown to achieve comparable or sometimes better performance.

### Strengths
- Using VLMs to synthesize subgoals is a novel approach (however, it's unclear how these subgoals are trained - see questions).
- Decoupling the subgoal generation and the low-level control policy learning components seems to be effective (but authors seem to have contradicting opinions, see my comments in the questions part).
- Experiment setup was sound (different scenes with seen/unseen objects, with increasing difficulty by involving more unseen objects and other clutter)
- A good amount of comparative analysis is presented. The authors present both simulation and real-life experiments. Furthermore, they have shown instances where their models perform well, but they have also demonstrated cases where their models perform worse than previous models and provided valid explanations for these outcomes.

### Weaknesses
 - Subgoal training procedure is unclear - see questions.
- Some parts could be reformulated/reworded better in Section 4 to reduce ambiguities and improve reproducibility.
  - In 4.1, “k” is used for two different contexts (hyperparameter and index).
  - In 4.1, “q” distribution appears to be a uniform discrete distribution in [i, i + k], but it remains undefined.
- The information regarding the datasets used can be provided more comprehensively and at an earlier stage in the paper.
- Some results are missing and/or unclear - see questions.
- The assumption that the gripper is always visible is a strong constraint, limiting the applicability of the method in more complex scenarios where occlusions are common.
- The method assumes feasible subgoal predictions at all times, which is a strong assumption that might not hold in real-world scenarios where the robot might encounter unexpected situations or objects.
- The independence of the diffusion model and the low-level policy, while providing flexibility, might limit the overall performance of the system as the low-level controller is not aware of the semantic context of the subgoals. This could lead to suboptimal actions in certain situations.

### Questions
-	The figures depict a properly selected sub-goals for the scenes, such as a pre-grasp pose in figure 1. However, it is unclear if or how the sub-goal synthesis procedure is optimized to output such intuitive sub-goals, rather than less important/effective transitionary scenes that simply happen to follow the input pose. In essence, how do you select/optimize for the feasible/relevant subgoals?
- Table 1 uses some success rates from another paper (Ge et al., 2023). However, the approach proposed in this cited paper achieves higher success rates (see 'Ours' row in Table 2 of Ge et al.) than the ones reported on this paper. Why did you omit this result? Ge et al. seem to also address out-of-distribution generalization. Other than 1-step chain case (theirs 72% vs. SuSIE 75%), the longer chains achieve better results than SuSIE.
-	It was mentioned that Scene C should be a more difficult task than Scene B, however the results in 5.3 show that both MOO, RT-2-X and SuSIE perform significantly better on scene C than on B. Can you explain what the reason might be? Is it related to the VLM or the low-level control policy?
-	The model is illustrated to depict sub-goals nicely as it is able to distinguish between particular objects to orient the gripper towards. But there are non-visual properties of these objects that low-level controllers need to consider to perform pick and place tasks, such as weight and friction. This model however seems to rely on visual properties only. Would the robot in this pipeline be able to pick up such challenging objects, such as a heavy and slippery object, even after a few tries?
-	InstructPix2Pix is not capable of performing viewpoint changes, how would this challenge be reflected in a real-life or research scenario where there are often multiple or moving cameras present?
-	Often, the gripper may be obscured in the camera view due to other objects, such as the rest of the robot. The first phase may output these subgoals as a suggestion of pre-grasp or grasp pose. However, due to decoupling, the low-level controller would have no way of knowing this is the case. In the image of the scene, any pose of the gripper would look the same. How would the scene play out, would the robot be able to recover or get stuck?
-	Can you elaborate on the role/effect of the conditional policy (Section 4.2)? It seems to enforce the robot to follow the trajectory sampled in the dataset when it encounters a similar state and subgoal. What happens when it encounters, say, a similar current state but a different subgoal (that was not in the dataset) during test time?
-	Does your robot dataset consist of only completely successful trajectories? If not, could a subgoal be generated for failure (e.g., robot holds the desired object in the current state, but subgoal generates a state where it is dropped? If so, how do you handle such cases?
-	There is a minor error in the table references. In Section 5.3 and A2.2.2, you mentioned "Table 5.3," which refers to "Table 1."

### Summary
This paper introduces the interesting approach to utilize the Internet-scale semantic knowledge for solving robotic tasks by leveraging pre-trained image-editing models. The main components consist of two part: 1) Image-editing model that generates future subgoals given the current state and task description in language. This model is first pre-trained with Internet-scale data and fine-tuned with in-domain robotic data. This guides low-level policy by specifying near future subgoals. 2) Low-level goal-conditioned policy that accomplishes generated subgoals. The method is evaluated on simulated (CALVIN) and real-world environments, where the proposed method shows better performance in generalization ability that deals with solving novel tasks, objects and environments.

### Strengths
- The paper starts with the interesting questions such as "how to effectively inject semantic knowledge into robot control problems?" and "how to better utilize the Internet-scale foundation model to solve the problem of robot learning?", which are quite important problems these days.
- This paper is well-written and easy to follow. The idea is very simple, yet consistently perform well in overall experiments and shows effectiveness.
- The experimental settings are well designed for the purpose the authors want to show such as zero-shot generalization to novel objects and environments, so the experimental results seem to show effectively that the proposed method is better.

### Weaknesses
 - I think the analysis of the results of the real-world experiment is a little insufficient. In the results shown in Table 2, RT-2-X performs much better on scene C, so why does it perform better only on scene C? RT-2-X is said to have been learned through larger model and more data, but that does not show such performance in scene A and B, but analysis on this part seems to be insufficient. Specifically, a deeper dive into the potential reasons for the observed discrepancies, such as differences in object types, environmental complexities, or specific task requirements, would be beneficial.
- In order to generate subgoal well, an overall temporal understanding of the task is required. But there is not much clear analysis or intuition why the fine-tuned image-editing model performs better than the video prediction model. The paper would benefit from a more thorough comparison between the image-editing model and video prediction models, particularly in terms of their ability to capture temporal dependencies and generate coherent subgoals.
- The results from the simulated environment(CALVIN) don’t show much significant performance difference from other language-conditioned policy baselines. While the proposed method demonstrates good performance, a more detailed analysis of its strengths and weaknesses compared to existing language-conditioned policies in the CALVIN environment would provide a clearer understanding of its contributions.

### Questions
- It would be better if the authors could provide additional experiments with the baselines which utilize low-dimensional image embeddings as subgoals rather than high-dimensional raw images to show that image-editing model is effective as a subgoal generator.
- When learning the goal-reaching policy, the model is learned to provide subgoals within k steps of any state. But I wonder if how much the change in k value makes a difference in performance. It would be nice to see additional experiments showing changes in performance according to the value of k.
