# Guided Decoupled Exploration for Offline Reinforcement Learning Fine-tuning

- Decision: Reject
- Scores: 8, 6, 5, 3

## Abstract
Fine-tuning pre-trained offline Reinforcement Learning (RL) agents with online interactions is a promising strategy to improve the sample efficiency. In this work, we study the problem of sample-efficient fine-tuning for offline RL agents. We first discussed three challenges related to the over-concentration on the offline dataset, *i.e.,* inefficient exploration, distributional shifted samples, and distorted value functions. We focused on the exploration issue and investigated an important open question of how to explore more efficiently in offline RL fine-tuning. Through detailed experiments, we found that it is important to relax the conservative constraints to encourage exploration while avoiding reckless actions which could ruin the learned policy. To this end, we introduced the Guided Decoupled Exploration (GDE) for fine-tuning offline RL agents, where we decouple the exploration and exploitation policies and use a dynamic teacher policy to guide exploration. Experiments on the D4RL benchmark tasks showcase the effectiveness of the proposed method.

### Summary
The paper describe a novel technique were exploration in offline to online RL is decoupled from the offline learning. This guided exploration avoid three of the current pitfalls of the offline RL techniques. Inefficient exploration because of biased conservatism. The difference in probability distribution between offline and online samples. Finally the value function learned from the offline dataset is far away from the optimal value function. In this work a teacher policy is introduced which guide the exploration policy to avoid policy crashing. The teacher policy is updated frequently. This decoupled avoid the conservatism bias and focusing on the latest online samples and using a n-step return made this algorithm more sample efficient.

### Strengths
originality: It's quite novel the approximation even though the community have proposed related solution for some of the problems. CA-CQL for efficiency when jumping to the online phase. (Some concurrent work that also use decoupling: Offline Retraining for Online RL: Decoupled Policy Learning to Mitigate Exploration Bias Mark et al 2023) What I like about the paper is that address all the three approach in one coherent algorithm.

 quality: the paper have presented clear equation to backup the claims, and have provided a strong methodology and well written experiments section, with proper problems accepted by the community.

clarity: the paper is quite clear in its presentation, the structure and flow of the paper is well done.

 significance: the paper in an incremental change on the field of offline RL.

### Weaknesses
Probably one weakness I see is how it compared with a off-policy algorithm with a preload buffer.
It would interesting to see how it compared with Cal-QL as well.

### Questions
What's not clear to me in this paper is what the difference between this and having a off-policy algorithm  that start with a preload buffer?

### Summary
This paper investigates the challenges of offline-to-online RL with interesting experimental exploration, namely inefficient exploration, distributional shifted samples and distorted value functions. Based on the empirical findings and analysis, it proposes a simple yet effective algorithm called Guided Decoupled Exploration (GDE), which maintains a exploration policy and a teacher policy in addition to the main exploitation policy. GDE outperforms prior approaches in multiple domains with various backbone algorithms. Ablation study and hyperparameter tests are provided to verify the effectiveness of GDE.

### Strengths
- This paper studies an interesting and important problem, which is to finetune an offline learned policy in online environments. 
- The paper starts by demonstrating the key challenges in this setup with motivating experiments. Although the studied challenges have been discussed a lot in literature, the experiments in Sec 3 provide factual evidence, which I find interesting and helpful.
- The proposed algorithm is based on the empirical findings, which makes intuitive sense and works well in standard benchmarks.

### Weaknesses
 - The analysis of challenges can be made more in-depth. The current experiments are more like proof-of-concept and the results can be expected.
- GDE maintains 3 policies, rendering extra computation and memory costs. Although the authors emphasize the minimalist algorithm design, I feel that the current design is not necessarily the most efficient. For example, can the exploration poilcy directly be a function of the exploitation policy (one can just adjust the output action distribution by exploration objectives, without training an extra policy.)

### Questions
1. There are a lot of exploration approachs, is there a reason of selecting Eq (5) as the loss for the exploration policy? Will other methods work here, such as curiosity-driven ones?
2. Why is the performce of train from scratch with SAC so low? Given enough samples, shouldn't SAC be able to learn a good policy in many of these tasks?

### Summary
The paper presents three issues afflicting the performance of offline-to-online fine-tuning methods: insufficient exploration due to conservative pre-training, distribution-shift between offline and online distribution, distorted value functions. The paper then motivates and designs an algorithm based on IQL, where a decoupled exploration policy collects the online data. The loss for the exploration is based on the TD3 update, in contrast with the AWR loss used for policy update in IQL. However, TD3 update can cause the policy performance to crash, to avoid which a KL penalty with the best exploitation policy (aka teacher policy) is introduced, which also helps take safer actions. Overall, the proposed framework allows for more efficient offline-to-online fine-tuning.

### Strengths
- Good coverage of the literature
- The discretization into the three problems for offline-to-online RL makes sense and pedagogically useful
- Section 3.2 presents an interesting experiment where removing the offline data during online fine-tuning improves the performance. Presenting more concrete evidence for this observation would improve the paper further.
- Lots of experiments and the performance improvements are substantial, though more comparisons are needed to ascertain if the gains are for the hypothesized reasons.

### Weaknesses
The clarity of Section 4 and method description can be improved quite a bit. Please see questions for further clarifications.

Overall, I am not entirely sure about the generality of the framework, while the paper claims to be general. For example, if the actor loss for the base algorithm already uses a TD3 update, it is not obvious to me that the decoupled exploration does anything different.

The main benefit of GDE likely comes from the ability to allow the behavior policy to be updated using TD3, which cannot be done with IQL naively, as Q-values aren’t  trained on OOD actions in IQL. The policy crash at low levels of $\rho$ is likely because of using TD3 loss with an IQL trained Q-value function. This make the comparison with [2] quite critical. They report fairly sample efficient results, but beyond empirical gains, I suspect most of the benefit in GDE is derived from the fact that using a TD3 update for exploration policy, which improves the policy much faster than AWR update and thus generates better exploration data. CalQL shows that calibrated Q-value functions can allow direct usage of TD3 style updates for policy improvement, without the whole decoupled framework.

Overall I am willing to improve the score for the paper, if some of these conditions can be met:

(1) The phenomenon in 3.2 is established in more environments, with algorithms beyond IQL

(2) Comparisons with CalQL are added, and GDE outperforms CalQL.

(3) Alternately, the framework is shown to be compatible with CalQL, and demonstrates an improvement in the performance over it

(4) Clarifying the writing in Section 4, and confirming that the evaluation rollouts for exploitation policy are duly counted in the fine-tuning budget

### Questions
- Section 3.1 inefficient exploration; have you tried adding RND reward to the offline agent to encourage wider/broader exploration? This issue seems to be part of the desiderata
- Section 3.2: This is an interesting point, but might be worth rephrasing the open question  “how to leverage prior knowledge without hurting performance” to clarify how to best use offline data during online fine-tuning. Figure 3 (a) is quite interesting. Am I understanding it correctly that for IQL and SAC, the policy and Q-values are pre-trained (using IQL and CQL respectively on the offline data), but removing the offline data during online fine-tuning and collecting data in the replay buffer from scratch improves the performance and efficiency during training? Can you reproduce this phenomenon on other environments, potentially AntMaze or Kitchen environments? Would this be less of a problem if the offline data contained higher proportion of expert trajectories? One possible way to continue using offline data during online fine-tuning is to rebalance the offline distribution, sampling more relevant transitions more frequently. See [1].

For Table 1:
- Can you report the default IQL performance for comparison, ie, IQL that continues to use offline data naively during online fine-tuning? If using the official code for IQL, please note that it is not setup to fine-tune on locomotion environments, as the reward using during offline and online fine-tuning are different. Fixing that is important before reporting the IQL fine-tuning results.
- Can you report the average performances as well (clustering locomotion envs, antmaze environments)?

Section 4:
- The clarity of writing in this section can be improved as it is missing quite a few details — more explicit details would greatly improve the understanding of GDE + minimizing or defining notation clearly with \phi, \mu, \hat{\phi}, \bar{\phi}
- Is exploration policy initialized randomly?
- How many trials are done for evaluation? Are those trials counted towards the budget for online fine-tuning? Are you evaluating every 2500 (Appendix B3) steps or 25000 steps (Table 7)?
- How is the exploitation policy updated over the course of training? What does “exploitation policy pi_e which is responsible for policy extraction from newly collected online samples mean”? Is it updated only on the online samples or does it continue to use offline samples?
- Do the exploration policy and exploitation update on the same value functions? I understand that this is possible to do for IQL where the Q-values are trained using the replay buffer data and does not query the policy, but if you use a different base algorithm, for example, CalQL, would this still make sense?
- Which policy is used for reporting the performance? Have you tried evaluating the exploration policy?

### Summary
This paper identifies the excessive exploration problem that arises in an offline-to-online RL setup and proposes a new method that addresses the problem. The main idea is to separate exploration and exploitation policies and introduce a teacher policy that guides the exploration policy not to deviate too far from the teacher's actions. Teacher policy is updated to be the best policy so far by evaluating the exploitation policy at the specified regular interval. The proposed method is evaluated in locomotion and locomotion-based navigation tasks in D4RL Benchmark.

### Strengths
- The paper clearly motivates their paper by providing supporting analysis and experiments
- The proposed method is still simple even though it introduces several moving components. The idea of having the teacher policy that guides the exploration policy is well executed.
- The method is compared against a lot of baselines and includes the error bar, which is commendable given the current status of this field.

### Weaknesses
I liked reading the paper but there's some weaknesses possibly due to my understanding. Please see my weaknesses and questions.

- Introductory analysis and experiments are helpful for understanding and motivating the method but they are mostly not new as authors also already mentioned in the paper. They are mostly already covered in works like [Fujimoto'18; Lee'22; Luo'23]
- The proposed method needs evaluation rollouts for updating the teacher policy. Then the number of environment interactions required for this evaluation should also be incorporated into the sample count for the proposed method. It's not clear if this is reflected in the current results, and this should be properly computed if they are not because it's not a fair evaluation. Correctly doing this would also make Figure 6(b) analysis more meaningful because it's an important trade-off.
- The paper is a bit difficult to parse in some parts. There is a room for improving the readability. For instance, Table 4 is difficult to read because it's missing the results of GDE with all the components. Including this could help improving the readability by making not scroll the paper up and down. Figure 5 is not very helpful for understanding the main method and could be improved to intuitively help the readers to understand the main idea. Augmenting the Algorithm 1 to be more self-contained could be helpful for better readability.

### Questions
- Could you clarify what's the unique observation that could be further emphasized in the paper?
- Is the number of samples required for evaluating the policy is incorporated for counting the samples? It's important for a fair comparison.
- Is n-step used for all the methods including both the proposed method and the baselines? It's not a new component proposed in the method so it needs to be included for a fair evaluation.
- Improving some parts of Table 4, Figure 4 as in Weaknesses could be useful for improving the readability of the paper.
- In Section 5.5, it's not clear how would the method that ablates a component work. For instance, how would the method work without the exploitation policy? Then what is the main policy you are updating with? Such things are not clear so it's difficult to understand what's going on in the analysis.
- Please consider only making the numbers be bold when they are statistically significant, i.e., when errors do not overlap
