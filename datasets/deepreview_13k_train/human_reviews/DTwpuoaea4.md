# PAGER: A Framework for Failure Analysis of Deep Regression Models

- Decision: Reject
- Scores: 6, 6, 6

## Abstract
Safe deployment of AI models requires proactive detection of potential prediction failures to prevent costly errors. While failure detection in classification problems has received significant attention, characterizing failure modes in regression tasks is more complicated and less explored. Existing approaches rely on epistemic uncertainties or feature inconsistency with the training distribution to characterize model risk. However, we find that uncertainties are necessary but insufficient to accurately characterize failure, owing to the various sources of error. In this paper, we propose PAGER (Principled Analysis of Generalization Errors in Regressors), a framework to systematically detect and characterize failures in deep regression models. Built upon the recently proposed idea of anchoring in deep models, PAGER unifies both epistemic uncertainties and complementary non-conformity scores to organize samples into different risk regimes, thereby providing a comprehensive analysis of model errors. Additionally, we introduce a suite metrics for holistically evaluating failure detectors in regression tasks. We demonstrate the effectiveness of PAGER on synthetic and real-world benchmarks. Our results highlight the capability of PAGER to identify regions of accurate generalization and detect failure cases in out-of-distribution and out-of-support scenarios.

### Confidence
4: You are confident in your assessment, but not absolutely certain. It is unlikely, but not impossible, that you did not understand some parts of the submission or that you are unfamiliar with some pieces of related work.

### Summary
The paper addresses the need for proactively detecting potential prediction failures in AI regression models. The author introduces a framework called PAGER that combines epistemic uncertainties and non-conformity scores to systematically detect and characterize failures in deep regression models. PAGER is shown to effectively identify areas of accurate generalization and detect failure cases in various scenarios.

### Strengths
1. The presentation of the paper is clear, and it is insightful to characterize different failures of models in a unified framework.

2. The idea of unifying epistemic uncertainties and complementary non-conformity scores is reasonable.

3. The experimental results verify that PAGER achieves great improvement in failure analysis of deep regression models on synthetic and real-world benchmarks.

### Weaknesses
Can the framework proposed in this paper for analyzing model failures be applied to multi-class classification tasks, and what are the potential differences between it and the regression task studied in the paper?

### Rating Number

### Confidence
2: You are willing to defend your assessment, but it is quite likely that you did not understand the central parts of the submission or that you are unfamiliar with some pieces of related work. Math/other details were not carefully checked.

### Summary
In this paper, the author provide a new framework for failure mode analysis in regression problem where they can identify different regions in the input space based on the model's generalization. They use the idea of anchoring and provide uncertainty and non-conformity scores to test samples. Based on these two scores, they categorize samples. They further evaluate their method and compare it to existing methods based on FN in detecting high-risk samples, FP in detecting low-risk samples, and confusion error in both low and high-risk regions. Their method brings improvement over the existing results.

### Strengths
+ The observation that an uncertainty score is insufficient and a complementary non-conformity score can better organize different regions is interesting.
+ The idea of using anchors to obtain uncertainty and non-conformity is interesting.
+ Evaluation is comprehensive and includes various methods on different datasets.
+ Propose method ($\text{score}_1$) is efficient and is faster than existing work in inference time.

### Weaknesses
 + $\text{score}_2$ is slower than $\text{score}_1$ in inference time, but it is not significantly better than $\text{score}_1$ in all settings; I'd expect to get more information about why this method should be used and what settings it performs better.

### Questions
i'd like to get more insight about the usefulness of $\text{score}_2$.

### Summary
This paper presents a risk estimation methods that can categorize regression prediction failure into four groups, including ID, Low Risk, Moderate Risk, and High Risk. The paper starts with demonstrating the weakness of epistemic uncertainty based method and show that it is insufficient to evaluate predictive risk when there is Out-of-Support in the modelling. With such motivation, the paper presents its method based on anchoring  predictive model. The transformation of inputs is able to construct a connection between training data points with test data point such that OOS / OOD data could be flagged out through carefully defined functions. In experiments, the paper includes synthetic benchmark function as well as real regression datasets to show the effect of the proposed method. Baselines are those epistemic uncertainty based solutions. Evaluation metrics are somewhat not standard, which is probably introduced by this paper itself. Thus, I cannot tell if the experimental result is indeed trustworthy.

### Strengths
1. The paper focus on the risk estimation of regression tasks, which is less explored compared to classification tasks. While uncertainty estimation based solution has been there for a long time, there were less contribution made in this field that is not based on uncertainty estimation. This makes the paper stand out as a novel contribution.
2. The paper is fairly well written with sufficient evidence to support its claim. While some concepts may be a bit hypothetical (I mean not really possible to distinguish between OOD OOS in practice), the motivation and solution are well connected.

### Weaknesses
1. The solution is based on anchoring predictive model. I realized the novelty majorly comes from the nature of the anchoring predictive model, which makes me concerning the contribution this particular paper (as it is more incremental now). In addition, how does people use this method to measure regression risk if they don't use anchoring model (which more likely happen in real world)?
2. Multiple concepts introduced in this paper are hypothetical and may not be possible to know in practice. E.g. OOS / OOD are hard to distinguish.
3. The evaluation metric introduced in this paper is hard to be convincing in terms of the setting with 20 percentile or 90 percentile in the False Positive and $C_{low}$. Why? What makes the authors to choose those numbers. Is that the real reason of better performance compared with existing solutions?
 
Minors: 
Type: Section 3.3, False Negative (FP) should be False Positive.
