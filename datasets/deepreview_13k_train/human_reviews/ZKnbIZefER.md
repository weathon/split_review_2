# Availability Attacks Need to Create Shortcuts for Contrastive Learning

- Decision: Reject
- Scores: 6, 5, 5, 3, 3

## Abstract
Availability attacks can prevent the unauthorized use of private data and commercial datasets by generating imperceptible noise and making unlearnable examples before release. 
Ideally, the obtained unlearnability prevents algorithms from training usable models. 
When supervised learning algorithms have failed, a malicious data collector possibly resorts to contrastive learning algorithms to bypass the protection.
Attacks need both supervised unlearnability and contrastive unlearnability.
Through evaluation, we have found that most of the existing availability attacks are unable to achieve contrastive unlearnability, which poses risks to data protection. 
Furthermore, we find that employing stronger data augmentations in supervised poisoning generation can create contrastive shortcuts and mitigate this risk. 
Based on this insight, we propose AUE and AAP attacks which prominently boost the worst-case unlearnability across multiple supervised and contrastive algorithms.

### Confidence
4: You are confident in your assessment, but not absolutely certain. It is unlikely, but not impossible, that you did not understand some parts of the submission or that you are unfamiliar with some pieces of related work.

### Summary
The authors explore the problem of unlearnable data in an unsupervised setting (in addition to the more common supervised setting). The authors employ stronger data augmentations in their proposed attacks to boost the potency of the unlearnable samples in the unsupervised domain.

### Strengths
* The authors do a very thorough job in their experimentation and literature review. 
* The problem is well motivated, and the authors explore it in a principled and thorough way. 
* The work seems to demonstrate a Pareto improvement over existing methods meant to generate poisons for unsupervised and supervised learning.

### Weaknesses
 * An existing method SEP seems to demonstrate a Pareto improvement over every attack this work proposes, except for UT-AAP. 
* I do appreciate the authors principled approach, and intuition, and analysis. Although I think the finding that strong augmentations during poison crafting improves unlearnable examples was also found in [1]. But this work does include very thorough analysis of this, as well as introducing more augmentations during training of the generating model.
* This isn't a weakness of the core work, but tables 3-6 are way too small and it can be aggravating to have to zoom in significantly while reading the work. I would suggest moving to the appendix. Also legends/labels on several of the figures had this same problem.


### Questions
* Should the constraints in Eq 1 be $f_\delta \in \text{argmin}_f ...$ instead?

### Summary
For joint effectiveness of availability attacks on supervised and contrastive learning, the author propose stronger data augmentations to improve worst-case unlearnability on both tasks. Experiments on a range of learning algorithms aim to justify their claim on the proposed method.

### Strengths
1. The attacks achieved improved results for multiple supervised and contrastive algorithms.
2. The paper explores the use of label information in poisoning perturbation generation to acquire stable worst-case unlearnability, which contributes to the effectiveness of the proposed attacks.
3. Interesting framing and insights on availability poisoning attacks.

### Weaknesses
1. It appears the primary factor contributing to the improvements in results are because of the more aggressive augmentations. It has been known to the community for a while that stronger data augmentations can lead to better defenses against existing unlearnability attacks. ISS and UEraser(-Max) also demonstrated stronger resilience against adaptive attacks in their original papers. It appears that the novelty is diminished slightly by the earlier discoveries regarding stronger augmentations, although they focused on defenses. The paper does not sufficiently explore the interplay between the strength of augmentations during the attack phase and the defense phase, and how this impacts the overall unlearnability. Specifically, the experiments do not provide enough insight into whether the gains from stronger attack-phase augmentations are simply negated by similarly strong defense-phase augmentations, or vice-versa.
2. It remains to be seen whether stronger defense-phase augmentations beats stronger attack-phase augmentations. The few results on this is in Table 3, and the answer remains inconclusive. The reviewer suspects that “shortcuts” are difficult to form with such stronger defenses with a tight perturbation budget. The paper needs to explore the trade-off between perturbation budget and augmentation strength more thoroughly, as it seems the current budget may be insufficient to overcome the stronger defenses.
3. In Figure 1, UT-AAP is not strictly better than UT-AP.
4. It is confusing why Sections 4.2 and 4.3 are separate. The difference between AUE, AAP exists only in the use of existing error-minimizing and maximizing objectives employed in existing attacks, which are not the core contribution of the paper. It would be better to refactor Section 4 to combine both algorithms and sections for clarity, as it appears redundant in the current format.

### Questions
Potential Improvements:
1. Please consider adding more defense baselines against the proposed attacks, e.g. the ISS variants, UEraser variants, and AVATAR [1].
2. The motivation for improved / stronger augmentation (the key contribution of this paper) should be further strengthened. The rationale behind Theorem 4.1 could benefit from additional clarification, as its purpose remains somewhat ambiguous. In Section 4.1, the primary takeaway appears to be the notion that to effectively generate poisons, it is imperative to employ stronger augmentations in line with those utilized by contrastive learning algorithms.
3. It would be better to consider ImageNet-100 instead of Mini-ImageNet to align with previous work.
4. A discussion is needed on the proposed method, TUE and CP (the most relevant baselines), especially from the perspective of computation overheads, transferability, etc.

Minor Issues:
1. Avoid breaking Code Listing 1 between two pages.
2. Tables 3-6 are way too small.
3. "obey the same distribution. ." -> "obey the same distribution."

### Summary
Availability attacks aim to safeguard private and commercial datasets from unauthorized use by introducing imperceptible noise and creating unlearnable examples. The goal is to make it extremely challenging for algorithms to train effective models using this data. In cases where supervised learning algorithms fail to achieve this unlearnability, malicious data collectors might turn to contrastive learning algorithms to bypass the protection. Successful attacks must target both supervised and contrastive unlearnability. However, the evaluation shows that most existing availability attacks struggle to achieve contrastive unlearnability, which poses a significant risk to data protection.

This paper reveals that utilizing more robust data augmentations during supervised poisoning generation can lead to the creation of contrastive shortcuts, potentially undermining the protection measures. Leveraging this insight, we introduce AUE and AAP attacks, which significantly enhance worst-case unlearnability across various supervised and contrastive algorithms.

### Strengths
1. The performance is commendable and has achieved state-of-the-art results.

2. The paper is well-organized.

### Weaknesses
1. There are several typos in the text, such as the need to replace "argmax" with "argmin" in Eq. 1.

2. Consider moving the section on related works from the appendix to the main paper for better visibility and accessibility to readers.

3. Expanding the experiments to include a wider range of methods, such as surrogate-free methods like OPS [1] and robust methods like REM [2], would enhance the comprehensiveness of the evaluation and allow for a more thorough comparison. 

4. It would be beneficial to include an evaluation of the attack performance when facing adaptive defenses, such as the inclusion of additional augmentations in the contrastive learning process.

5. Consider conducting experiments on the ImageNet-subset dataset, which includes the first 100 classes of ImageNet data.

6. Consider adding the mean performance value in addition to the worst-case performance in the tables reporting the results.

### Summary
This paper studies unlearnable examples - imperceptible perturbations generated to prevent the released data from unauthorized use. The mechanisms for generating unlearnable examples work similarly to availability attacks. Observing that unlearnable examples generated for supervised learners do not achieve contrastive unlearnability, the paper aims to achieve unlearnability for both supervised and contrastive learning algorithms. Built upon unlearnable example attacks (Huang et al., 2020) and adversarial poisoning attacks (Fowl et al., 2021), the paper proposed to use enhanced data augmentations to create shortcuts for contrastive learning, thus improving the worst-case unlearnability across different supervised and contrastive learning methods.

### Strengths
The threat model considers worst-case unlearnability for generating unlearnable examples, which is interesting. In realistic scenarios, the attacker may use any possible learning method to produce a model based on the published unlearnable examples. Therefore, ensuring the data protection scheme of unlearnable examples works for a broad range of learning methods that the attacker may employ is meaningful. The proposed method uses stronger data augmentation, which is straightforward and easy to implement. The paper also provides extensive evaluations regarding the existing methods of availability attacks.

### Weaknesses
As shown in the pseudo-code in Section 4.1, the proposed method employs a tuning hyperparameter to control the strength of the data augmentation. While the considered threat model is of practical importance, the technical contributions of the paper are not strong enough. 

Another concern is the presented empirical and theoretical results are not structured clearly and coherently, which hinders my understanding of the paper’s overall contributions. For Section 3, the definitions of alignment loss and uniformity loss are introduced in existing work (Wang & Isola, 2020), so they should be moved to the previous background section. The remaining part of Section 3 seems new but is not well-explained. The main empirical finding of Section 3 is that contrastive unlearnability seems correlated with alignment and uniformity gaps. However, there is no clear explanation of how these poisoning methods are grouped in Table 1. It would also be useful to conduct a correlation analysis to demonstrate how strong the correlation is, such as providing the Pearson correlation coefficients. In addition, I do not understand why clean/poisoned alignment & uniformity scores and SL accuracy are also demonstrated in Table 3, which are redundant from my perspective. Moreover, it is hard for me to understand why the results of Table 1 imply the need for enhanced data augmentation. The explanations provided at the end of Section 3 are difficult to parse, and I found the transition between Sections 3 and 4 abrupt. For Section 4, I do not understand the role of Theorem 4.1, where I found the presented theoretical results particularly hard to parse. For example, why do you assume the supervised loss is the mean squared error, and the contrastive loss contains only one negative example? What does the upper bound proven in Theorem 4.1 imply? I would expect a detailed discussion of how Theorem 4.1 connects to the main messages you are trying to convey.

Finally, a minor concern is that the empirical improvements on worst-case unlearnability are not strong. For example, CP-BYOL achieves 41.8% performance on CIFAR-10, which is relatively competitive compared with your methods, while TUE-MoCo achieves relatively similar worst-case unlearnability on CIFAR-100. It would be useful to study why these existing methods can attain good performance and explain how your method improves over them.

### Questions
In addition to the questions above, I have the following comments and suggestions for the paper:

1. It would be useful to explain the existing poisoning attacks and their abbreviations in Section 3 before the introduction of Table 1 (instead of Section 5.1). In particular, how these methods are selected and grouped in the table should be explained clearly. Two considered methods, _EntF_ and _HYPO_, are neither effective against _SimCLR_ nor _SL_, so I wonder why they are tested.

2. In the pseudo-code provided in Section 4.1, it is clear that you employ a single parameter _s_ to control the augmentation strength. The parameter applies to three augmentation functions: _RandomsizedCrop()_, _RandomApply()_, and _RandomGrayscale()_. I would like to know whether the worst-case unlearnability can be improved if different hyperparameters are applied to different augmentation functions for your method. A general question is: How does the defender choose the right augmentation functions and their corresponding hyperparameters to achieve the best protection performance?

3. Have you tried to apply your augmentation method to other alternative poisoning attacks, such as TUE and CP? Can you further improve the worst-case learnability based on their method?

4. Section 5.3 presents early stopping as a potential mitigation approach for unlearnable examples. Claiming this as a mitigation method is a bit confusing since unlearnable examples are designed to protect the data from the defender's perspective. It would be helpful to explain in more detail how the attacker can employ early stopping to enhance their attack effectiveness.

5. Tables 3-6 are difficult to read. Please replace them with larger ones in the next version of your paper.

### Summary
The authors' experiments reveal that most data availability attacks designed for supervised learning become ineffective under contrastive learning training methods. They find that supervised training with enhanced data augmentation in reference models can mimic contrastive learning. Consequently, the authors propose sampling from different data distributions within the data distribution. By employing this contrastive learning-like data augmentation approach for training the substitute models, the generated unlearnable noise can provide protection under both supervised learning and contrastive learning conditions.

### Strengths
- The authors quantitatively measure the GAP between the attack effectiveness of supervised learning and contrastive learning methods using two contrastive learning metrics.
- By incorporating the data augmentation techniques of contrastive learning into supervised learning, the authors develop an availability attack method that is effective under both supervised learning and contrastive learning training frameworks.

### Weaknesses
 - The paper is difficult to read and the organization of the content is not very clear.
- The Cross-Entropy (CE) loss and InfoNCE loss may be essentially similar, and using these two losses to reflect the relationship between the two tasks is not particularly convincing. It's unclear if the observed decrease in InfoNCE loss when optimizing for CE loss with augmentations is a meaningful indicator of contrastive learning behavior, or simply a byproduct of the augmentations themselves. The paper needs to provide more evidence that this is not just a coincidental correlation.
- Although the paper emphasizes sampling in data augmentation as being introduced from contrastive learning, it bears a resemblance to the Expectation Over Transformation (EOT) used in the reference paper on REM. EOT also involves sampling from data augmentation, and this technique is commonly used in adversarial settings. The paper fails to adequately distinguish its approach from EOT, and needs to clarify the novelty of their augmentation strategy in the context of existing adversarial techniques.
- The assumptions made in the theoretical analysis employ a simple linear network, which presents a significant discrepancy from practical settings. The theoretical results are not well-connected to the empirical results, and it is unclear how the analysis of a linear network generalizes to the complex non-linear networks used in the experiments. The paper should provide a more detailed discussion of the limitations of the theoretical analysis and its relevance to practical scenarios.
- The resolution of the Tiny-ImageNet dataset is not down-sampled, and the Mini-ImageNet dataset has a limited number of samples per class. The paper should justify the choice of these datasets, and address the potential limitations of using these datasets for evaluating the proposed method.

### Questions
- Does the value of the GAP affect accuracy? According to the paper, GAP reflects the difference between clean and poison distributions. Logically, the greater the difference, the better the protection effect should be. However, the results in Table 1 do not seem to support this notion.
- Why does the loss of Alignment in Figure 3(c) first decrease and then increase?
