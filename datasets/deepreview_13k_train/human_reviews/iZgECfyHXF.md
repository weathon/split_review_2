- Decision: Accept
- Scores: 6, 8, 6, 6

## Abstract
Online nonconvex optimization has been an active area of research recently. Previous studies either considered the global regret with full information about the objective functions, or studied the local regret with window-smoothed objective functions, which required access to unlimited number of gradient oracles per time step. In this paper, we focus on the more challenging and practical setting, where access to only a single oracle is allowed per time step, and take the local regret of the original (i.e., unsmoothed) objective functions as the performance metric. Specifically, for both settings respectively with a single exact and stochastic gradient oracle feedback, we derive lower bounds on the local regret and show that the classical online (stochastic) gradient descent algorithms are optimal. Moreover, for the more challenging setting with a single function value oracle feedback, we develop an online algorithm based on a one-point running difference gradient estimator, and show that such an algorithm achieves a local regret that a generic stochastic gradient oracle can best achieve.

### Summary
This paper studies minimizing the local regret in online non-convex optimization. Previous work mainly focus on smoothed version of regret, and show the **worst-case** local regret with window size 1 is linear with respect to T. In this paper, the authors reveal that, both upper bound and lower bound in this setting can be better, as they can depend on the total function variation. The authors consider several different settings in ONCO with different oracles, such as sgo and ssgo, and show matching function-variation-dependent lower and upper bounds.

### Strengths
Significance and novelty:

The main idea is quite novel and very interesting. In recent several years, there have been a lot of work on studying the local regret. However, all of these work use smoothed version of the loss function (i.e., the average of a batch of functions in a window) when computing the regret, and people typically believed that using the exact function (that is, with window size 1) will lead to a \Omega(T) regret. However, these bounds are actually worst-case bound, and do not depend on data of the loss functions themselves. That is to say, there must exist simple cases where the regret is sublinear. In this paper, the authors captures this by showing a data-dependnt lower bound (function variation bound) and matching upper bound. This is the first paper that shows both sublinear lower and upper bounds for online non-convex optimization with local regret with window 1, which is a significant and novel contribution, and may inspire future works. 


The proof for the upper bound is relatively straightforward and brings to mind what people do when obtaining the function variation  bound  for dynamic regret. The proof for lower bound is much more challenging and require novel techniques.

Presentation: The paper is in general well-written, and easy to read.

### Weaknesses
There is a long line of research in online learning that studies dynamic regret, which also have function variation bounds. After reading the proof, I found that the many parts of proof for obtaining the **upper** bound are very similar to this line of research. I recommend the authors review these papers and add a discussion.

There is a lack of clarity regarding the practical implications of the function variation bound. While the theoretical results are interesting, it's not immediately clear how this bound translates into actionable insights for practitioners using online non-convex optimization algorithms. The paper would benefit from a more thorough discussion on the practical relevance of the derived bounds.

I don't understand this discussion. Regret is a performance metric, and people do not really compute regret when implementing the algorithm. So why "accessing the global minimum of nonconvex functions is typically infeasible"?

### Questions
In online optimization, apart from function variation bound, there are also other measues for function changes, such as the gradient variation bound. Is it possible to also consider this or other adaptive bounds (in future work)? Similar to function variation, the gradient variation bound is defined as: V_T = \sum_{t=1}^T \sup_{x} ||\nabla f_t(x) - \nabla f_{t-1}(x)||^2. See, e.g., (1) of [1], for more information.

> Introduction: One line of work adopted the global regret as the performance metric (Krichene et al., 2015; Agarwal et al., 2019; Lesage-Landry et al., 2020; Heliou et al., 2020), which compares the algorithm output to the global minimum of the nonconvex objective functions. However, accessing the global minimum of nonconvex functions is typically infeasible.

### Summary
This paper studies online-nonconvex-optimization (ONO) problem with local regret. Unlike previous works that focused on window-smoothed loss of the form $F_t(x)=\frac{1}{w}\sum\_{i=t-w+1}^t f_i(x)$, this paper directly addresses local regret using the original losses, namely $\mathrm{Regret}\_T = \sum\_{t=1}^T \\|\nabla f_t(x_t)\\|^2$ (which corresponds to setting $w=1$ in the window-smoothed definition). Moreover, the paper focuses on single oracle algorithm where, in each iteration, the algorithm can only request one oracle query. Specifically, three oracle models are analyzed in this work: 1. deterministic gradient oracle (SGO) that returns $\nabla f_t(x_t)$, 2. stochastic gradient oracle (SSGO) that returns an unbiased estimator of $\nabla f_t(x_t)$, and 3. function value oracle (SVO) that returns $f_t(x_t)$. For the first two oracle models, the paper presents a tight analysis, providing both upper and lower bounds. For the third model, the paper offers improvements over existing state-of-the-art results.

### Strengths
This paper offers a thorough examination of the ONO using single-oracle algorithms. I'd like to highlight a few standout results:

- While previous results of ONO with local regret consider window-smoothed approximation $F_t(x)=\frac{1}{w}\sum\_{i=t-w+1}^t f_i(x)$, which may vary a lot from the original loss, this paper works directly on original losses and thus providing a more accurate regret bound.

- The algorithms studied in this paper only makes one single oracle query in each iteration, while most algorithms in prior works require multiple oracle queries due to window-smoothing.

- This paper provides comprehensive analysis for 3 different oracle models. Specifically, it provides lower bounds for the gradient oracle models and proves that online subgradient descent achieves the optimal lower bounds in both cases. 

  Moreover, for the function value model, this paper proposes a single oracle algorithm, matching the state-of-art regret bound which is previously achieved by an algorithm making two oracle queries per iteration. The idea of one-point estimator using running difference of function values instead of the standard two-point estimator is novel and interesting.

- What stands out to me the most is the notation of "function variation over time", namely $V_T = \sum_{t=2}^T \sup_x |f_t(x) - f_{t-1}(x)|$. Similar to the notation of path length in dynamic regret, function variation is also an adaptive measure that captures the difficulty of the ONO problem. Therefore, the proposed regret bounds in this paper (namely $O(1+V_T)$ for SGO, $O(\sqrt{(1+V_T)T})$ for SSGO, and $O(d\sqrt{(1+V_T)T})$ for SVO) are always tighter than the previous vacuous bounds in the corresponding settings.

  I also find it interesting how $V_T$ naturally follows from $\sum\_{t=1}^T f_t(x_t) - f_t(x_{t-1})$ in the smooth loss analysis, and it just happens to be a tighter measure.

### Weaknesses
The lower bounds for SGO and SSGO models are restricted to a relatively small family of algorithms such that $x_{t+1} = x_1 + \sum_{i=1}^t a_{t,i} g_i$. This family does not include popular algorithms like online mirror descent and FTRL.



### Questions
1. For the lower bounds, I assume there is an implicit assumption on function dimension $d$ (where $f_t:\mathbb{R}^d\to\mathbb{R}$), e.g. $d\ge \Omega(1+V_T)$ to guarantee there are $\Omega(1+V_T)$ orthogonal gradients? 

2. The lower bound construction in Carmon et al. 2021 and Arjevani et al. 2022 can be applied to a larger family of algorithms besides algorithms of form $x_{t+1} = x_1 + \sum\_{i=1}^t a_{t,i} g_i$. I am curious if the lower bounds for ONO can also be extended beyond the current family? If not, what is the main difficulty in ONO compared to offline nonconvex optimization?

3. proof of Lemma 2 first two equalities: where does $d$ out side $\\|\mathbb{E}...\\|$ come from? is it a typo?

### Summary
This paper studies the online nonconvex optimization problem, where access to only a single oracle is allowed per time step. The authors consider three variants: single gradient oracle (SGO) feedback, single stochastic gradient oracle (SSGO) feedback, and single value oracle (SVO) feedback, and take the local regret of the original objective functions as the performance metric. For SGO and SSGO, they derive lower bounds on the local regret and show that the classic online algorithms are already optimal. For SVO, they develop an online algorithm based on a one-point running difference gradient estimator, which achieves a local regret that a generic stochastic gradient oracle can best achieve.

### Strengths
- The online nonconvex optimization problem is interesting and relevant.
- The three proposed variants are practical and meaningful.
- The theoretical results are standard, specifically, indicating the importance of parameter $V_T$.

### Weaknesses
 - I would like to see more comparisons and discussions on three variants, specifically, when we need to consider SGO/SSGO/SVO.
- There is no matching lower bound for the SVO problem.

### Questions
- Can the lower bound analysis extend to the general setting of sliding windows? E.g., for a fixed window length $w$, is $V_T$ still appear in the regret bound?

### Summary
This work studies the problem of online nonconvex optimization with single oracle feedback. More specifically, the authors consider three setups of the single oracle: single exact gradient feedback, single stochastic gradient feedback, and single function value feedback. The authors choose local regret on the original function, not on the smoothed version of it as previous works, as the performance measure. The key contribution of this work is that the authors find that the problem-dependent quantity of function variation is a fundamental variable in this problem. Specifically, in the first two cases, the authors give two corresponding lower bounds regarding the function variation for the linear-span algorithm family. And they prove that OGD and OSGD are optimal inside the linear-span algorithm family. In the functional value feedback, the authors use a new running difference gradient estimator and obtain an optimal result inside the linear-span algorithm family. Note that the result under the function value feedback with one-point running difference gradient estimator is as good as that using a two-point gradient estimator.

### Strengths
The overall paper is well-written. The problem is well-motivated, and the descriptions of the three cases are well-explained with proof sketches. The observation of the role of function variations in this problem is important and may lead to novel perspectives for this problem for future research.

### Weaknesses
I have only one major concern, which affects my score for this paper.

Concretely, I think some statements of the optimality of the results are a little over-claimed. Note that the lower bounds (Theorem 1 and Theorem 3) do not hold for any possible algorithm but only for a specific family called linear-span algorithms. Although the family of linear-span algorithms contains many famous and widely used algorithms such as GD, AGD, and so on, as the authors have stated, they cannot represent all algorithms. As a result, the lower bounds are only algorithm-related lower bounds. When talking about optimality, it is correct to say that 'our algorithm is optimal inside the linear-span algorithm', but not just 'our algorithm is optimal', as the authors have claimed in the current version. This is a serious issue, and I suggest that the authors could revise the corresponding statements to avoid unnecessary misunderstandings of the paper's contributions. By the way, I think the contributions of this paper are still adequate for acceptance, even if the authors use the correct descriptions of optimality. As a result, there is no need for over-claiming, which will only give readers and reviewers (at least for me) a bad impression.

### Questions
1. Can I conclude that after this work, the methods using the smoothed function $F_{t,w}$ can be abandoned? Or equivalently, does this work offer a strictly superior methodology compared with Hazan's work? If not, what is the disadvantages of measuring local regret defined on the original functions?
2. Is the one-point running difference gradient estimator strictly superior to the standard FKM one-gradient estimator? I think this only holds in the problem of online nonconvex optimization, but not in bandit convex optimization (BCO)? As the authors have stated, the variance of the one-point running difference estimator is a constant, which is also the case for the standard two-point estimator, and thus the guarantee of this work is as good as that using a two-point estimator. However, is the variance of the running difference estimator still a constant in the BCO setup? If so, it seems that an $O(\sqrt{T})$ regret can be achieved in the BCO setup, which is definitely the most exciting progress in the BCO research (which is too simple to be true). If not, what is the difference between using this estimator in the nonconvex setup and in the convex setup? Will using the running difference estimator in the method of Flaxman (SODA'05) improve their $O(T^{3/4})$ regret? If not, what is the key difficulty?
