# Split and Merge Proxy: pre-training protein inter-chain contact prediction by mining rich information from monomer data

- Decision: Reject
- Scores: 5, 6, 5, 6

## Abstract
Protein inter-chain contact prediction is a key intelligent biology computation technology for protein multimer function analysis but still suffers from low accuracy. An important problem is that the number of training data cannot meet the requirements of deep-learning-based methods due to the expensive cost of capturing structure information of multimer data. In this paper, we solve this data volume bottleneck in a cheap way, borrowing rich information from monomer data. To utilize monomer (single chain) data in this multimer (multiple chains) problem, we propose a simple but effective pre-training method called Split and Merge Proxy (SMP), which utilizes monomer data to construct a proxy task for model pre-training. This proxy task cuts monomer data into two sub-parts, called pseudo multimer, and pre-trains the model to merge them back together by predicting their pseudo contacts. The pre-trained model is then used to initialize our target -- protein inter-chain contact prediction. Because of the consistency between this proxy task and the final target, the whole method brings a stronger pre-trained model for subsequent fine-tuning, leading to significant performance gains. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our method and show the model performs better than the state-of-the-art (SOTA) method by 11.40\% and 2.97\% on the P@ $L/10$ metric for bounded benchmarks DIPS-Plus and CASP-CAPRI, respectively. Further, the model also achieves almost 1.5 times performance superiority to the SOTA approach on the harder unbounded benchmark DB5. Finally, we also effectively apply our SMP on docking and interaction site prediction tasks to verify the SMP is a general method for other multimer-related tasks. The code, model, and pre-training data will be released after this paper is accepted.

### Summary
This paper introduces Split and Merge Proxy (SMP), a new pretraining framework for PPI contact prediction leveraging the abundant monomer data. SMP splits monomer data into pseudo-multimers and trains the model to merge them back by predicting "inter-chain" contacts. Experiments on PPI contact prediction, protein-protein docking shows that SMP is a general method for PPI-related tasks.

### Strengths
1. Novelty: A novel pretraining method leveraging monomer data for multimer tasks. I believe leveraging monomer data for multimer-related tasks is important, as shown by AF2-Multimer.
2. Performance: New SOTA on benchmarks such as DIPS-Plus, CAPRI.

### Weaknesses
1. Writing: IMHO the writing could be significantly improved. E.g., "1.5 times more performance" should be "50% better performance", "except that" should be "in case" in your context. Also please do not shrink the margins and spacings as it makes the paper look very crowded.
2. Significance: Since AF2-Multimer and DiffDock-PP (which, by the way, should be compared in the docking benchmark) can already predict the structure of the protein complex quite well, the role of contact prediction becomes less significant. Quite similarly, in monomer structure prediction, initially contact maps are predicted and used to refine the final structure, until models like AF2 can predict protein structure end-to-end.

### Questions
1. When you benchmark against AF2-Multimer, are you benchmarking against the contact prediction module? Could you try computing the contact map based on the predicted structures and benchmark against that?
2. Could you compare your docking results with DiffDock-PP?
3. In response to my comment above, could you elaborate the significance of inter-chain contact prediction?

### Summary
The authors propose a novel pre-training strategy for predicting inter-chain contacts that utlizes more plentiful monomer data by splitting monomer structure and predicting the contacts in these artificially-created proxy data.  Results indicate performance improvement over state-of-the-art methods, and helps improve a method's performance compared to purely supervised training.  Multi-chain contact prediction is an extremely challenging problem, and based on the experiments provided by the authors, their method provides a good increase in performance.

### Strengths
The proposed pre-training method can be used to improve the performance of any method applied to multimer data. The authors demonstrate its advantage in comparison to methods trained without any pre-training, and in comparison to other structure-based pre-training methods.  The advantage over other pre-training methods is that there is no task mismatch between the pre-training and final task.

### Weaknesses
This is a solid submission without any real issues.

Comments:

- DB5 is the most appropriate benchmark dataset, as it provides the individual chains in their unbound state.  In my opinion, using DIPS-plus data for testing is not appropriate, since the unbound structures are not available.  It is a highly valuable resource for training and validation.  Your results demonstrate how much more difficult this task is, and makes me question the value of the evaluation over the DIPS-plus and CASP-CAPRI datasets.  It also demonstrates that we are still very far from being able to accurately predict inter-chain contacts in a realistic scenario.

- The single chain proteins are split by cutting the sequence into two.  Another option would be to cluster the monomer into two clusters and use those as the proxy interacting chains.  This might give rise to more "natural" splitting of the initial monomer.  Can you comment on that?

- There is a potential concern for information leakage if the monomer data contains structures that are similar to the trained complexes.  I don't think that is a concern, since the monomer data does not contain information about the labels; infact, I would be curious to know whether allowing the model to learn from the monomers in a complex helps improve performance.

- The performance advantage for EquiDock is unclear, as the results using SMP are slightly worse than the EquiDock published results, but comparable to the result when they ran it.

Minor comments:

"However, due to the small scale of existing multimer data, current models are less accurate in protein inter-chain contact prediction." 
Less accurate than existing methods?  AlphaFold-multimer will definitely be less accurate than its monomeric counterpart as complex structure prediction is a more difficult problem.

"Due to the ID numbers of monomer and multimer in PDB being different, there is no overlap between pseudo multimer and real multimer data."  One is composed of multi-chain complexes, and the other is composed of single chains, so no overlap is possible by construction.  However, the chains in the multi-chain complex data, can potentially appear in the single chain dataset.  However, I don't consider that an issue.

"we all use HHBlits (Remmert et al., 2012) with Uniclust30 (Mirdita et al., 2017) database for MSA, and PSAIA (Mihel et al., 2008) to calculate geometric features."  what do you mean by geometric features?

Please define the metric you use (e.g. P @ L/5).  Are those numbers in percentages?

"After filtering extreme data, such as too long, too short sequences and high relative data with other datasets,"  Please define "high relative data..." Did you mean sequence similarity to other datasets?  The threshold used to define that is important.  Also, I can understand why you wouldn't want to include very short sequences, but why remove long ones?

### Summary
This study introduces a novel pre-training method called "Split and Merge Proxy" (SMP) aimed at enhancing the accuracy of protein inter-chain contact prediction. Specifically, the method leverages monomer protein data to create a proxy task for model pre-training. This task involves splitting the monomer data into two sub-parts to simulate multimers and pre-training the model to merge them back together by predicting their pseudo contacts. The pre-trained model is then fine-tuned on the actual task of protein interchain contact prediction. The method demonstrates significant performance improvements over existing state-of-the-art approaches across multiple benchmark datasets, including DIPS-Plus, CASP-CAPRI, and DB5.

### Strengths
1. The method outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods on multiple benchmark datasets
2. The approach is simple and easy to implement and deploy.
3. The innovative agent task gives new ideas for other tasks that lack homologous pairwise data.

### Weaknesses
1. Data Quality: While mining information from monomer data might provide more data for multimer contact prediction, the synthesized data might not be as accurate as genuine multimeric structural data. This could lead to instability in model training or inaccuracies in prediction. Specifically, the random splitting of monomers might create artificial interfaces that do not reflect true inter-chain interactions, potentially biasing the model towards learning spurious correlations. The lack of true multimeric context in the pre-training data could limit the model's ability to generalize to real-world multimer structures.

2. Challenges with Transfer Learning: While pre-training methods like SMP can leverage monomer data, the transfer from monomers to multimers might not always be seamless. This means that features in monomer data might not entirely correspond with those in multimer data. The spatial arrangement and interaction patterns within monomers are fundamentally different from those in multimers, which could lead to a mismatch in feature representation and limit the effectiveness of transfer learning. For example, the interface residues in a monomer might not have the same characteristics as the interface residues in a multimer.

3. Computational Complexity: Splitting and merging data could add to computational complexity, especially when dealing with large-scale protein datasets. The process of generating pseudo-multimer data through splitting and merging monomers introduces an additional computational overhead, which can be significant when dealing with large datasets. This could make the pre-training process more resource-intensive and time-consuming.

4. Issues with Experimental Validation: Due to the relative scarcity of genuine multimeric structural data, it might be challenging to adequately validate the model's performance. This might lead to overfitting or an over-reliance on synthesized data. The limited availability of diverse and high-quality multimeric structural data makes it difficult to assess the true generalization capability of the model. The model's performance on the benchmark datasets might not accurately reflect its performance on unseen multimeric structures.

5. Structural Diversity: The diversity of protein multimeric structures might exceed what monomer data can provide, possibly limiting the model's generalization capability. Monomer structures, by their nature, lack the complexity and diversity of multimeric interfaces. The pre-training on monomer-derived data might not adequately capture the full range of interaction patterns and structural variations found in multimers, potentially limiting the model's ability to generalize to novel multimeric structures.

6. Other Biological Limitations: Biologically, not all monomers can simply be split and merged to simulate multimeric structures. Some proteins are highly specific in structure and function, which might impact prediction accuracy. The assumption that monomers can be arbitrarily split and merged to simulate multimeric interactions ignores the biological constraints and specificities of protein-protein interactions. This could lead to the generation of unrealistic pseudo-multimers that do not reflect true biological interactions, potentially hindering the model's ability to learn meaningful patterns.

7. Usually, structural changes accompany the polymerization of polypeptide chains to form multimers, and the interaction between them should be distinct from the folding of single chains. In this premise, the effect remains, and the pre-training is surprisingly effective. The article lacks a discussion of this phenomenon.

### Questions
Would this approach also work for antibody CDR design?

### Summary
In the context of the limited available multimer data, the authors proposed a simple yet effective method to create pseudo multimers based on monomers. To be specific, they split a monomer into two parts at a random position. They further pre-trained their model on the pseudo data with a contact prediction objective. The effectiveness of the pre-training is demonstrated through various downstream tasks.

### Strengths
1. The idea is novel, simple yet effective.
2. The benchmark is comprehensive.

### Weaknesses
1. The authors did not discuss the biological insight of their proposed pre-training method. There is no good biological sense that the interaction between two parts of a monomer could be useful to reveal the true nature of the interaction among chains of multimers.
2. Many multimers contain multiple identical chains. It might be difficult for the proposed method to be applied to modeling the interaction of those identical chains, since the pre-training objective may not be able to distinguish a chain interacting with itself and identical chains interacting with each other.

### Questions
1. λ the threshold for pseudo label and R the range for random split are important hyperparameters. I hope the authors could further discuss how their different values impact the pre-training process.
2. The pre-training method always splits a monomer into two parts, while it is not always the case that a multimer only consists of two chains. However, I guess the proposed method could be easily extended to more chains and I hope the authors could further discuss this issue.
