- Decision: Accept
- Scores: 6, 6, 6, 6

## Abstract
We investigate learning the equilibria in non-stationary multi-agent systems and address the challenges that differentiate multi-agent learning from single-agent learning. Specifically, we focus on games with bandit feedback, where testing an equilibrium can result in substantial regret even when the gap to be tested is small, and the existence of multiple optimal solutions (equilibria) in stationary games poses extra challenges. To overcome these obstacles, we propose a versatile black-box approach applicable to a broad spectrum of problems, such as general-sum games, potential games, and Markov games, when equipped with appropriate learning and testing oracles for stationary environments. Our algorithms can achieve $\widetilde{O}\left(\Delta^{1/4}T^{3/4}\right)$ regret when the degree of nonstationarity, as measured by total variation $\Delta$, is known, and $\red{\widetilde{O}\left(\Delta^{1/5}T^{4/5}\right)}$ regret when $\Delta$ is unknown, where $T$ is the number of rounds. Meanwhile, our algorithm inherits the favorable dependence on number of agents from the oracles. As a side contribution that may be independent of interest, we show how to test for various types of equilibria by a black-box reduction to single-agent learning, which includes Nash equilibria, correlated equilibria, and coarse correlated equilibria.

### Confidence
4: You are confident in your assessment, but not absolutely certain. It is unlikely, but not impossible, that you did not understand some parts of the submission or that you are unfamiliar with some pieces of related work.

### Summary
The paper considers the multi-agent RL problem in non-stationary Markov games, as a generalization from the non-stationary bandit problem.

### Strengths
- The paper is well-written and provides a good summary of the existing work on multi-agent RL. The black-boxes approach not only makes the results of this paper more general, but also helps the reader to understand the approach to this problem at a high-level.

### Weaknesses
 - The paper seems to be the first work that considers the non-stationary Markov games, but this particular game setup is not well-motivated, except it is a natural generalization from the non-stationary bandit problem. I expect the author to provide some discussion on the motivation of this game setup, possibly with some real-world application scenarios.
- Is Assumption 3 a reasonable assumption? I expect the author to add some discussion to justify this assumption (you did for Assumption 1, 2). I think only when \delta is small, there are existing algorithms that can satisfy this assumption. Specifically, the assumption requires a bound on the average reward of a sequence of policies, which is not a standard assumption for non-stationary RL. It would be helpful to see a more detailed explanation of how this assumption is met by existing algorithms, beyond just referencing the single-agent case.
- It seems to me that the key idea of the proposed algorithm is largely based on that of Wei & Luo (2021). I expect the author to provide some discussion/summary on the challenges of extending their approach to the game setup and highlight some key differences between the two algorithms. The paper should elaborate on the specific difficulties in adapting the change-point detection mechanism from the single-agent setting to the multi-agent setting, and why a direct extension is not straightforward. It would be beneficial to discuss the limitations of using an auxiliary quantity in the multi-agent case, as it is not clear how such a quantity can be defined or computed in a game-theoretic setting.

### Summary
The authors study the problem of multi-agent reinforcement learning with only bandit feedback and where the underlying game may be non-stationary---that is, slightly changing at each iteration of the learning process. The authors propose to quantify the degree to which the game changes at each iteration using a total variation-inspired quantity. They show that since standard algorithms already provide regret bounds that scale reasonably even under non-stationarity bounded by this TV quantity, one can simply use the algorithms and creatively reset them whenever the non-stationarity has become too great (since between resets, the algorithms are expected to already handle the bounded amount of non-stationarity). The main technical ingredients the authors use is 1) a testing schedule that efficiently tests for non-stationarity to determine when resets should happen and 2) algorithms that test whether joint strategies constitute equilibria by reducing to single-agent learning problems.

### Strengths
The paper studies a reasonable and easily stated problem: how hard is multi-agent RL when your training environment is slightly changing at each round. It is (for the most part) well-written and makes its technical contributions clear. The quantity that the authors proposed measuring their regret bounds by, total variation non-stationarity budget $\Delta$, is a reasonable analogue of total variation distance for this application. As a fairly pessimistic quantity, the claimed bounds' dependences on $\Delta$ also seem reasonable. The proposed algorithms are intuitive and admit a fairly clean analysis, although I have a hard time evaluating their significance, which I'm hoping the authors could clarify through my questions.

### Weaknesses
 * The claimed regret bounds in Table 1 seem somewhat coarse given that the proposed notion of "total variation non-stationary budget" $\Delta$ scales linearly in $H \times S \times A$. Taking that into account, all of the regret bounds for multi-round games displayed in Table 1 look like they should scale linearly or superlinearly in horizon length and linearly in state size for general-sum Markov games and the square-root of state-size for zero-sum games. It seems one could get a similar regret bound (maybe even of order $O(\sqrt{T})$) by just flattening each game into a single round game with $H \times S \times A$ actions and having each player run Exp3 on those actions? The results in Table 1 could still be really interesting, but its difficult to put them into perspective because their main feature is $\Delta$, which the authors seem to be proposing the use of. It would be helpful if the author could clarify if $\Delta$ is already a commonly used quantity that is known to be small in practice.
* I'm not familiar with restarting-based algorithms so I find it harder to evaluate the novelty/significance of the results in 5.2 and 5.3. However, the contributions listed in 5.1, namely the reduction of equilibria testing to single agent learning, are---to the best of my knowledge---already known (in the case of CCE testing) or very direct in the sense that its a one-two sentence reduction and the first thing one would try (in the case of CE).
* The notation in the paper is a bit difficult to read in certain cases. In particular, the use of $\Delta$ in exponents could be clarified. (See below)

### Questions
* Can you clarify the difference between $c_1^\Delta$ versus $c_1$ and $c_2^\Delta$ versus $c_2$? Is $c_1^\Delta$ referring to $c_1$ to the power $\Delta$, or is it some other constant entirely?
* Is your definition of a "total variation non-stationarity budget" $\Delta$ used in any other works? As mentioned previously, it seems like a very pessimistic quantity (as one would expect from a TV-like quantity) scaling linearly in # of states * # of players * # of actions * horizon.
* Why do online learning algorithms fail in this setting because of bandit feedback? Its not obvious why bandit/semi-bandit algorithms that give regret bounds even for adaptive adversaries are not applicable in this setting. In fact, a bounded total variation non-stationarity budget seems like it would also imply that the second-order regret bounds of online learning algorithms should be small in this setting.
* Are the first 5 columns of Table 1 referring to single-timestep games?
* Is there a reason the terminology alternates between "Protocol" and "Algorithm"?
* Typo on page 6: chanllanges -> challenges, page 5: For simplicity, We -> For simplicity, we.

### Summary
This paper delves into the multi-agent general sum Markov games framework within nonstationary environments. The scenario involves m agents where, at each step, a policy selects a joint action (a_h = (a_1, ..., a_m)), and each player i receives a random reward (r_{h,i}). The subsequent state at h+1 (s_{h+1}) is drawn from P_h( |s_h, a_h). To accommodate nonstationarity, Markov games can undergo changes in transition probability or reward function over time.

The primary contribution of the authors lies in highlighting the nontrivial nature of generalizing an algorithm for nonstationary Markov games to a parameter-free version due to distinct objectives. They advocate a black box approach for nonstationary games and subsequently analyze the algorithm for both known and unknown nonstationary budgets.

For the purposes of this study, the authors define epsilon-approximate Nash equilibrium, coarse correlated equilibrium, and correlated equilibrium using the gap between the value function given a policy. Regret over T is then defined as the summation of the gap given a policy.

The proposed method initially considers black box oracles capable of learning and testing equilibrium in near-stationary environments. The learning equilibrium oracle requires the fulfillment of assumption 1, where access to an oracle outputting a good EQ policy within C_1 samples is available. The test equilibrium oracle assumes access to an oracle that outputs False when a policy is not a good EQ policy and True when the policy is good EQ.

In the warm-up section, the authors present a MARL algorithm (Algorithm 1) for nonstationary environments with a known nonstationary budget. Regret bounds, depending on the bases, are achieved by setting rounds of each phase and the value of epsilon with a nonstationary budget, as detailed in Corollary 1.

In the subsequent section, the authors address the case of an unknown nonstationary budget. In this scenario, a testing oracle is required, which can be constructed from Protocol 1 using a learning oracle. They propose Algorithm 2, comprising learning EQ, testing EQ, and a meta-algorithm, achieving regret bounds as detailed in Theorem 1 and 2.

### Strengths
-This paper is the pioneer in addressing nonstationarity in Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning concerning equilibrium.

-The proposed framework is designed as a black box, ensuring compatibility with various bases.

### Weaknesses
 -Algorithm 2, as outlined in the paper, necessitates a test EQ algorithm to detect nonstationarity in the case of an unknown budget. The assumption of the existence of a testing EQ trained offline appears to be a strong assumption in the context of online learning problems.

-The tightness of regret is not clear.  For example, it is not evident whether the results achieved in this paper surpass the Bandit over Bandit approach with a sliding window multi-agent RL algorithm.



minor:
It would enhance clarity to provide an explanation for the definition of '(\Delta)-EQ' in Assumptions.

### Questions
-It seems that the regret from training the test EQ is not factored into the results presented in Theorems 1 and 2. What implications might there be if the training cost is considered in the regret?

-Despite the authors discussing the inapplicability of the Bandit over RL approach to this problem, what if we were to consider a bandit over (sliding window) MARL approach for addressing nonstationary MARL? Due to the order of the regret in Theorems 1 and 2, it remains unclear whether the suggested method is superior to the bandit over bandit approach.

### Summary
This work points out two main challenges in generalizing single-agent non-stationary algorithms
to non-stationary Markov games: (1) applying the online learning techniques to tackle non-stationarity In the bandit feedback setting is problematic; (2) equilibria is multi-agent games are not unique. To overcome these obstacles, the authors propose a black-box approach to transform algorithms designed for stationary games into ones capable of handling non-stationarity.Also, regret bounds in different settings are provided.

### Strengths
Regarding the originality, the studied problem is new (though there has been some works on single-agent non-stationary settings). Also, it is obvious that this problem contains its intrinsic difficulties, so I would agree this study is resolving a significant problem. 

For clarity, this work is well-presented though it still can be improved. It is easy to understand its motivation of handling the challenges of non-stationary games. Introducing the the case of known non-stationary budget is very helpful to understand the main results.

### Weaknesses
Lack of discussions on the definitions, assumptions, and results. For exmaple, from Definition 4, if the non-stationarity degree of Markov game is zero, should this setting degenerates to the traditional stationary setting? It seems very straightforward, but I prefer to get confirmed from the paper. I put more comments in the questions section.

The introduction section contains many terms that have not been clearly defined, such as non-stationarity budget and black-box approach. I would prefer to see a revision on the introduction section including providing a high-level introduction to these concepts and giving some references on real-world scenarios where we really need this algorithm.

### Questions
1. If the non-stationarity degree of Markov game is zero, should this setting degenerates to the traditional stationary setting? 
2. Also, when $\Delta=0$, will the regret bounds (Corollary 1) degenerates to the regret bounds in the stationary case? Will it match the existing rate?
3. I am not familiar with Assumption 1 and Assumption 2. Are they also common to be made in stationary MAML works? 
4. Continuing the questions about Assumption 1 and Assumption 2, when $\Delta$ is not zero, the learned EQ may have a constant distance $c^\Delta \Delta$ from the desired EQ. Is this true? Why should we learn this joint policy that has a constant gap to an EQ? 
5. It is a purely theoretical work, but I am still interested in real-world scenarios where the proposed algorithm can find its applications. Any examples?
