# SoftPhy: Soft-Body Physical Concept  Learning  and Reasoning from Videos

- Decision: Reject
- Scores: 6, 6, 3, 5

## Abstract
We introduce the \datasetFull~(\dataset), a novel benchmark for assessing machine physical commonsense. 
\dataset complements existing physical reasoning benchmarks by encompassing the inference of diverse physical properties, such as mass and density, across various scenarios and predicting corresponding dynamics.
We evaluated a range of AI models and found that they still struggle to achieve satisfactory performance on \dataset, which shows that current AI models still lack physical commonsense for the continuum, especially soft-bodies, and illustrates the value of the proposed dataset.
We also introduce an oracle model (\model) that marries the particle-based physical dynamic models with the recent large language models, which enjoy the advantages of both models, precise dynamic predictions, and interpretable reasoning.
\dataset aims to spur progress in perception and reasoning within diverse physical settings, narrowing the divide between human and machine intelligence in understanding the physical world. Project page: {\url{https://physical-reasoning-project.io}}.

### Confidence
4: You are confident in your assessment, but not absolutely certain. It is unlikely, but not impossible, that you did not understand some parts of the submission or that you are unfamiliar with some pieces of related work.

### Summary
This paper presents SOPHY a new soft-body benchmark including four types of simulated videos (based on Unity) and their corresponding question-answering pairs which can serve as a new benchmark to study AI models on understanding complex physical properties and dynamics for soft-body scenarios. The paper also evaluate the performance of several SotA methods and show that there is still a lot room to improve as they fall behind human performance.

### Strengths
- the paper proposes a new benchmark that involves careful task environment designs and question-answering pairs generation, which is technically novel and interesting.
- the proposed four types of soft-body tasks are indeed lacking from existing benchmarks and they are more complex so the proposed benchmark adds values to the community.
- the authors benchmarked several SotA methods on the proposed benchmark, provided good analysis, conducted human performance study, and showed that there is still a lot room to do research, which are all quite valuable to the community.

### Weaknesses
 - the task family is limited to the designed four types. Also the questions are generated from pre-defined sets of templates. These restrict the general use of the benchmark for other tasks, environments, and questions. Could the authors comment on how is it possible to extend the framework for other tasks?
- the authors claimed that previous benchmarks cannot change mass and friction, but as many of them are also based on physical simulators, it's unclear why they couldn't do that. 
- the paper doesn't propose a solution to improve the performance based on the findings.

### Summary
The authors present the Soft-Body Physical Dataset (SOPHY), an innovative benchmark designed to assess machine learning models' capacity for physical reasoning within a range of scenarios involving soft bodies. The authors subsequently assessed several visual models, such as CNN and MAC, using the dataset. Their findings suggest that contemporary AI models are yet to fully grasp the physical commonsense associated with soft objects, underscoring the significance of the introduced dataset.

### Strengths
The paper boasts several commendable attributes. Foremost, the dataset it introduces is characterized by a notable diversity in its scenarios, offering a comprehensive spectrum for analysis. Furthermore, the evaluation of the properties associated with soft objects is designed with meticulous detail. Another significant strength is the decent render quality, which not only enhances the visual clarity but also aids in the accurate interpretation of data. Moreover, the paper provides a comprehensive comparison between human perception, random/frequent answer, non-visual model, and other visual models.

### Weaknesses
- Some results are just stated without further discussion.
  - In Section 4.2 Paragraph "Physical Property", The author stated that "ALPRO achieves the best results in the rope scenario, and maintains competitive results in other scenarios, showing the value of large-scale video-text pre-training and alignment.". However, why other models slightly outperform ALPRO in scenarios other than Rope is not discussed. Specifically, it is unclear if this is due to inherent limitations of ALPRO in handling specific object dynamics or if the other models benefit from scenario-specific inductive biases.
  - In Section 4.2 Paragraph "Dynamics", only the result of ALPRO and HCRN is discussed, and why other models do not work well is missing. It would be beneficial to understand if the failure of other models is due to an inability to model the temporal dynamics, or if they struggle with the visual feature extraction necessary for the task.
  - In Section 4.2 Paragraph "Scenario Analysis.", only cloth and rope scenarios are discussed. A more comprehensive analysis should include a discussion of the performance of all models across all scenarios, including fluid and ball, to understand the challenges posed by each scenario and the models' ability to generalize.

- The writing could benefit from some improvements.
  - In Section 4.2 Paragraph 1, "We summarize the performance of all baselines in Table 1.", should be Table 2.

- Some statement is not supported well.
  - In Section 4.2 Paragraph "Evaluation Conclusion", the authors concluded that "Machine models results show that even state-of-the-art models struggle with answering physical questions based on the visual input.". However, the relationship between "soft body physics reasoning capability" and "answering physical questions based on visual input" is not clear. For example, AI models may understand soft body physics well, but unable to understand the questions, as the semantic information is not recognized by the model. The evaluation does not isolate the physical reasoning ability from the language understanding ability of the models.
  - In conclusion, the authors stated that "Despite progress, our evaluation of AI models revealed an ongoing challenge: they struggle to perform well on our benchmark, highlighting their limited physical commonsense for soft objects.", but there are already articles(i.e. [1]) concluded that AI models lack physical reasoning capability, if this capability is missing, the model should also lack physical reasoning capability for soft objects.

### Questions
- Should tasks related to reasoning on liquids and soft objects be evaluated in different ways? The comprehension of physics for soft objects and liquids may represent divergent capabilities.

### Summary
The paper introduces the Soft-Body Physical Dataset (SOPHY), a new benchmark for testing AI's physical reasoning with soft objects. SOPHY covers various physical properties like mass and density in dynamic scenarios. Despite the comprehensive nature of the dataset, current AI models show limited performance on it, revealing a gap in their understanding of soft object dynamics. The authors aim for SOPHY to drive improvements in AI's physical world perception and reasoning.

### Strengths
1.	This paper targets a really interesting problem, the motivation is sound. 
2.	The paper is well-written and easy to follow.

### Weaknesses
1.	On the conceptualization of this work. From the bottom of my heart, I like the topic this paper discusses. But since it concerns physics understanding, the description of physics should have a high standard, at least, the very basic concept should be coherent:

a.	In Intro – Second Paragraph. The examples given for humans are very irrelevant to the “soft body”, the topic of this paper. For the liquid example, it can demonstrate the density, but for the pulley example, which physics parameters are the humans trying to distinguish? Moreover, humans can distinguish these physics properties do no means AI models can, so there is a logic leap between the human examples to “However, it remains an …”

b.	From this paragraph on, I notice that the paper has a confusing meaning of “soft body”, how is liquid a type of soft body? According to Wikipedia (Soft-body dynamics - Wikipedia), it should be a solid object at least. Yes, I can find more rigorous sources (e.g. a textbook), but I think a simple checkup on Wikipedia can avoid such concept mistakes.

c.	According to Section 3 Dataset, the paper mentions physical properties: mass, friction, elasticity, density, deformability, and stretchiness.
First, there’s a difference between the physical properties a physics simulator can simulate and a property with genuine physics meaning. Sometimes the physics simulator just combine many underlying physics process and expose some high-level properties for the game developer or artist to control. Here is exactly the case. For example, physically speaking, elasticity and stretchiness are both two types of deformability. I wonder how they can be put at the same level. Besides, stretchiness and deformability are both parameters without corresponding basic physics meaning, which means you cannot measure them in the real world. How would the authors measure the stretchiness of cloth from the real world, as is the method of measurement coherent with what’s inside the physics engine? Besides, for soft body objects, there are more physics properties to influence the deformation such as plasticity, viscosity, etc.

2.	On the writing: The pie charts of Fig 3 and Fig 5-7 do not give precise ratio numbers. The labels of the sections of the pie charts are not clear enough. Take Fig 3 for example, it has “Mass”, “Mass Change”, and “Mass Goal”, then why it does not have “Shape”, “Shape Change”, or “Shape Goal”, if the shape is not a physical property, then why no “Tension”, “Tension Change”, “Tension Goal”. A similar confusion goes for Fig 5-7.

3.	On the dataset: The number of videos is not large. A potential reason is the lack of variance in the scene setup. The soft body can deform in infinite ways, how can a 500-video dataset satisfy the coverage of dynamics?

4.	On the experiments: Will the model train on the proposed dataset be generalized to real-world videos? Or is there any potential way the paper aims for real-world physics reasoning?
