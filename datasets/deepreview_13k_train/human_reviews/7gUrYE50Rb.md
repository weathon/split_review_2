# EQA-MX: Embodied Question Answering using Multimodal Expression

- Decision: Accept
- Scores: 8, 8, 8, 8

## Abstract
Humans predominantly use verbal utterances and nonverbal gestures (e.g., eye gaze and pointing gestures) in their natural interactions. For instance, pointing gestures and verbal information is often required to comprehend questions such as "what object is that?" Thus, this question-answering (QA) task involves complex reasoning of multimodal expressions (verbal utterances and nonverbal gestures). However, prior works have explored QA tasks in non-embodied settings, where questions solely contain verbal utterances from a single verbal and visual perspective. In this paper, we have introduced 8 novel embodied question answering (EQA) tasks to develop learning models to comprehend embodied questions with multimodal expressions. We have developed a novel large-scale dataset, EQA-MX, with over 8 million diverse embodied QA data samples involving multimodal expressions from multiple visual and verbal perspectives. To learn salient multimodal representations from discrete verbal embeddings and continuous wrapping of multiview visual representations, we propose a vector-quantization (VQ) based multimodal representation learning model, VQ-Fusion, for the EQA tasks. Our extensive experimental results suggest that VQ-Fusion can improve the performance of existing state-of-the-art visual-language models up to 13% across EQA tasks.

### Summary
This paper proposes a new dataset for the task of embodied question answering using multiple expressions (gaze and pointing) and textual questions called EQA-MX. It further provides a simulator for generating a large dataset containing simultaneous multimodal expressions (gaze and gesture) and verbal questions from multiple viewpoints. It defines 8 different EQA tasks to evaluate the performance of verbal and non-verbal gestures at embodied question answering. Additionally, it proposes a vector quantization (VQ)-based method to quantize dense visual information from various visual views with discrete textural information for EQA. The paper shows the effectiveness of using the proposed VQ model at combining information from multiple views and the utility of using gaze and gesture information at the task of question answering through several empirical tests.

### Strengths
The paper addresses a new and interesting problem of embodied question answering which is key to enabling human-robot interactions in their natural environments. Inspired by the observation that communication between humans is a combination of both verbal and non-verbal gestures (gaze and pointing), for example, it examines for the first time whether incorporating such multiple cues can be useful for embodies question answering tasks well. Lastly the paper also proposes a new and effective approach to fusing visual information from multiple different viewpoints/perspectives into a single semantic visual code using VQ and combines it with verbal information for various EQA tasks.

The work is of broad and significant impact. All aspects of the proposed methodology are technically sound.

The paper is extremely well presented, written and organized.

### Weaknesses
1. The only criticism/question that I have is whether the proposed methodology and experimental conclusions would generalize to real-world datasets? Synthetic datasets contain a significant domain gap to reality. Real scenes have more noise, clutter, lighting variations, etc and experiments purely in simulations and the conclusions obtained from them cannot be guaranteed to hold in the real world as well.  This work would have been a lot stronger and more impactful had the authors also evaluated their proposed methodology on real world datasets/scenarios and provides results of it.

2. While the authors show the value of VQ in Table 3, the value of using multiple views has not been ablated. How much does having visual information from multiple views help in EQA? It seems obvious that it should, especially if some views are likely to have occlusions and ambiguities, while other are not, but it would have been nice to see its effect quantitatively.

### Questions
I would like to hear from the authors about the questions/concerns that I raised in the "Weaknesses" section of my review.

### Summary
The paper introduces Embodied Question Answering (EQA) tasks that require agents to answer questions using both verbal and nonverbal gestures in an embodied setting. The authors present a large-scale dataset, EQA-MX, that contains diverse multimodal expressions from various verbal and visual perspectives. The work also introduces a Vector Quantization-based multimodal fusion approach (VQ-Fusion), which discretizes visual representations using shared codebooks before fusing them with discrete verbal representations. Additionally, the paper explores the importance of nonverbal gestures (gaze and pointing)  in learning EQA tasks.

### Strengths
-  The paper presents eight EQA tasks designed for understanding questions using multimodal expressions (verbal utterances and nonverbal gestures) in embodied settings. 
- The introduction of the vector quantization-based fusion model addresses the structural mismatch between the discrete verbal representations and the continuous visual representations from the three available visual views. Experimental results show that incorporating VQ-Fusion in the existing baseline models improves their performance across EQA tasks. 
- The paper consists of extensive ablation studies on the number of codebooks, the use of multiple views, the generalizability of VQ-fusion, learning single vs. multiple tasks, etc.

### Weaknesses
 - The paper focuses on a synthesized dataset, which, while important for controlled experiments, may not fully capture the complexities and nuances of real-world interactions. This concern is partially due to the way view perspectives are included in the data. "The blender to the right of the book. From which perspective is the object described?" may not be something you'd commonly encounter in everyday (embodied) conversations/questions. Same for the example shown in Fig. 2 for RG.
- Table 1 is a bit unclear, e.g., why is EQA not available for all datasets, when some of the datasets referred to in the table correspond embodied QA benchmarks (EQA, MT-EQA)? Also, to the best of my knowledge, some of the datasets have egocentric views and not exocentric ones.
- There is a body of work in pointing gesture recognition - most involving human communication in interactive embodied task-completion environments [2,3,4]. Similarly, the exists work that focuses on view perspectives [5]. It would be good to include and differentiate this work from the existing literature.
- While the reviewer appreciates the performance improvements of VQ-Fusion on 4 baselines, it would be beneficial to include more advanced baselines, such as a Multimodal Transformer model that extracts visual representations across all visual views and the verbal representations together, as well as more recent Multimodal LLMs (Otter, MiniGPT, UniLM, GPT4, InstructBLIP, LLaVA, etc.) that potentially can offer competitive fusion capabilities for these tasks.
- Based on Table 5 and Table 3, results in Table 3 for VQ-Fusion models are reported with varying codebooks, tuned for each task. This can improve performance, but it also raises questions about the generalizability of the approach. In some cases, the worst-case setting of the number of codebooks (e.g., 4 codebooks for EP or PG) can hurt the performance of the baseline CLIP model, which might impact the model's ability to perform well on new unseen tasks.

Minor edits:
- If the paper focuses on embodied AI, it would make sense to categorize the works into embodied and not embodied and then embodied multimodal prompting and language-guided embodied. VIMA [1], PATRON, and CAESAR could also be moved to Table 1 from Table 4 as similar embodied multimodal prompting tasks, especially since the Table 1 format and most of the capabilities originate from the use of CAESAR as the underlying simulator.


While the dataset introduced tackles an important embodied task, the execution, motivation, and realism of some of the subtasks could be better explained. The choice of baselines and the generalizability of the VQ-fusion approach raise concerns about its applicability to more advanced multimodal models that have been recently more prevalent in the E-AI literature. Additionally, the paper could benefit from providing a clearer differentiation between embodied and non-embodied works in the field, as well as a more comprehensive review and comparison with recent advancements in multimodal language models.

### Questions
In terms of the dataset, which is one of the main contributions of this work, there are aspects that need further explanations:

- Figure 3(a) is also difficult to read due to resolution issues and the same colors used for all lines. What is the y-axis, i.e., how are datapoints ordered?

- How many of the tasks involve non-verbal gestures? From Fig. 2 and Table 6, it seems that {OG, POG, OAQ, and OAC} (4/8) is the subset of tasks that involves gestures, how about the rest? Do OAQ, POG, and OAC focus on color only? Object Attribute Compare in Table 6 mentions "<Referring expressions using the templates from CAESAR>. From which perspective is the object described?" which seems very different from the example in Fig. 2, please explain.

-  To my understanding, experiments in the ablation study on Table 4 (only gaze, only gestures, and without gaze and gestures) involve different splits of the EQA-MX dataset? It seems that it would make more sense to keep the splits the same and just remove the non-verbal information (gaze, gesture, etc). Keeping the splits consistent ensures that the experimental conditions are comparable, and any performance differences can be more directly attributed to the presence or absence of non-verbal information.

A couple of minor questions:
- In supplementary section 3.2, could you provide references for the sentence "Previous studies have observed similar performance degradation when learning multiple competing tasks"?
- In supplementary section 3.3, what is the performance of the combination of VQ-fusion on MuMu (SoTA model)?

### Summary
The paper presents a large-scale Embodied Visual Question Answering dataset along with 8 benchmarks, and extensive experiments of various vision-language model representations are studied and benchmarked in the task. In addition, the paper proposes a VQ-fusion model that discretizes the representations of VL models, which improves the corresponding VL models by large margins in some tasks.

### Strengths
1. The motivation of the paper is clear, and aims to solve the referring expression issues in VQA by explicitly proposing an embodied VQA task where the objects being asked are referred not only by verbal expressions but also by gestures or utterances.

2. The scale of the dataset is quite large and diverse, and each question category is balanced. Overall, I feel like the quality of the dataset is really good to serve as a reliable benchmark for different approaches.

3. The paper proposes an vq-fusion model (discretizing the multi-view encoded representations) that outperforms the ones without discretizations.

### Weaknesses
1. The proposed method described seems lack of implementation details, I think a section should be devoted to describe each component of the model in very details. I don't understand why multiple codebooks are used in the paper, as read from the figure 4. I understand that each vector representation is divided into different segments along its feature dimension, so the question: is each segment belong to different codebooks? What is the Factor-1, Factor-2, ..., Factor-N in the figure, standing for N codebooks?

2. More qualitative studies regarding the samples answered by VQ-fusion and without VQ-fusion should be included in the paper to help understand why the VQ-fusion works and brings more insight to the proposed baseline approach.

3. Studies of more powerful models like GPT-4V could be added as strong baseline, I am wondering if GPT-4V could solve this problem already?

### Summary
The paper presents a large-scale dataset for embodied question answering (EQA) in 3D scenes. The dataset combines verbal questions with visual perspectives, such as gaze directions and pointing gestures, to enrich EQA with multimodal tasks. To solve these tasks, the paper also proposes a VQ-based multimodal fusion network to discretize the visual features and align them with the discrete verbal features. The authors benchmark their dataset and show the benefits of their proposed method through multiple dataset comparisons, experiments, and ablation studies.

### Strengths
1. The proposed dataset is a natural extension of VQA tasks into EQA, providing novel, multimodal interactions that are closer to how humans interact in the real world. The dataset is likely to be of interest to researchers in related areas, including scene understanding, human-object interaction understanding, and robot navigation.

2. The proposed approach of discretizing visual features through vector quantization (VQ) and aligning them with discrete verbal features obtained from natural language is technically sound and overall well-explained.

3. The experiments are well-planned, extensive, and conclusive. They clearly highlight the benefits of the proposed dataset and the approach.

### Weaknesses
I did not find any major weaknesses in the paper. However,

1. There seem to be some details missing on the processing of non-verbal gestures. For example, how is the pointing direction determined? Does the network take in absolute 3D joint positions, relative joint rotations, or some other representation? How is gaze represented?

2. Do the authors consider any situations with multiple similar objects? For example, in Fig. 1, what if there are two red lamps next to each other? By extension, what other sources of ambiguity can exist in the dataset (for example, specific pointing with a finger vs. general pointing with the palm facing upwards, pointing to an object that is behind another object in the gaze direction, etc.)?

### Questions
1. On Page 4, the descriptions of object grounding (OG), perspective-aware object grounding (POG), and perspective grounding (PG) appear to be slight variations of a single composite task, POG. In other words, solving POG seems to imply solving both OG and PG. Is this correct? Or could the authors please clarify the differences between these tasks further, maybe with some examples?

2. Looking at Fig. 2, is the current method capable of locating up to 10 objects?
