# Selective Prediction via Training Dynamics

- Decision: Reject
- Scores: 3, 6, 6, 5, 5

## Abstract
Selective prediction is the task of rejecting inputs a model would predict incorrectly on through a trade-off between input space coverage and model utility. Current methods for selective prediction typically impose constraints on either the model architecture or the loss function; this inhibits their usage in practice. In contrast to prior work, we show that state-of-the-art selective prediction performance can be attained solely from studying the (discretized) training dynamics of a model. We propose a general framework that, given a test input, monitors metrics capturing the instability of predictions from intermediate models obtained during training w.r.t. the final model's prediction. In particular, we reject data points exhibiting too much disagreement with the final prediction at late stages in training. The proposed scoring mechanism is domain-agnostic (i.e., it works for both discrete and real-valued prediction) and can be flexibly combined with existing selective prediction approaches as it does not require any train-time modifications. Our experimental evaluation on image classification, regression, and time series forecasting problems shows that our method beats past state-of-the-art accuracy/utility trade-offs on typical selective prediction benchmarks.

### Summary
The paper presents SPTD, a new method for Selective Prediction (SP) based on an ensemble approach using checkpoints from the training dynamics. Unlike several of the recent methods, the proposed approach works for several tasks including classification, regression, and time series. The paper presents a comparison between SPTD and different recent state-of-the-art methods.

### Strengths
The points of strengths include: 

1- The method works for several tasks including classification, regression, and time series.

2- The method seems to outperform the previous state-of-the-art selective classification methods.

3- Several experimental results presented

### Weaknesses
The points of weaknesses include:

1- The proposed idea lacks novelty as it is very similar to using ensembles of models. The difference here is that the ensembles are generated on a fixed schedule from the training dynamics. This approach does not explore the diversity of model space as effectively as methods that use random restarts or cyclic learning rates, potentially leading to less diverse and therefore less effective ensembles.

2- Checkpoints are chosen based on a fixed schedule which can correspond to models of bad performance. A better approach is to follow the approach from [Huang et al. 2017] which constructs an ensemble by choosing points of good performance using a cyclic learning rate. Using good checkpoints removes the need for the complicated weighted aggregation of the disagreement functions as all the snapshots are good models. The fixed schedule may include checkpoints that are still in the early stages of training, which are unlikely to contribute positively to the ensemble, especially when compared to methods that specifically select well-performing models.

3- The proposed method has several hyperparameters including the number of checkpoints and the weights to calculate the selection function $g$ from the disagreement function $a$. The weighting function introduces an additional hyperparameter, $k$, which requires tuning and may be dataset-dependent. This adds complexity to the method and makes it less practical compared to methods like Deep Ensembles that use uniform weighting.

4- Several choices are not clear as described in the following section.

### Questions
1- How was $\tau$ chosen?

2- "Checkpoint each model after processing 50 mini-batches of size 128", how many checkpoints are chosen?

3- In Table 1, the name of the baseline is SAT but in the text, it is mentioned that the baseline is SAT with Entropy Regularization (ER) and Softmax Response (SR) Selection from [Feng et al. 2023]. Which one is the baseline? If the latter, then please update the table as SAT and SAT+ER+SR are 2 different methods.

4- Why not add SelectiveNet as a baseline for the regression task?

5- How were $g$ and $\tau$ chosen for the Deep Ensembles (DE)?

6- What is the intuition of SPTD performing better than DE for some coverages? It seems counter-intuitive as DE consists of high-performing models vs SPTD which has fixed checkpoints that do not have to be high-performing.

7- How are the disagreement function, g, and $\tau$ chosen for DE+SPTD?

### Summary
This work introduces SPTD, a novel selective prediction method that relies on measuring---for a test sample $x$---the disagreement between predictions obtained from multiple checkpoints of the model. More precisely, the disagreement measures $a_t(x)$ for checkpoint $t$, $1\leq t \leq T$ are combined with weights $v_t$:
$$g(x) = \sum_{t \in [T]} v_t a_t(x)$$
They propose simple formulations of $a_t(x)$ and $v_t$ which work for both the classification and regression cases. They test their approach on $4$ vision datasets and $3$ regression tasks. On all of those tasks, they show that their method can---alone or in combination with deep ensemble---outperform other baselines in providing a better utility/coverage tradeoff.

### Strengths
I find the paper well written, clearly presenting each relevant concept and experiment. The method is simple, which facilitates its adoption by ML practitioners. The experiments are convincing.

### Weaknesses
 - The novelty of the method is limited, the ideas of re-using past checkpoints to form an ensemble can be found in e.g. [1]
- The results for SPTD and Deep Ensemble (DE) are both relatively close to one another and it would be nice to derive conditions under which one method is expected to be better than the other.  
- It is unclear how the performance of SPTD is tied to optimization noise. Especially, regression experiments use full-batch gradient descent, how would the results evolve when using smaller batches? 
- The values for $v_t=(\frac{t}{T})^k$ seem a bit arbitrary. 

### Questions
- See above.
- How would your method compare to using conformal-based selective prediction [2, section 5.5]?

### Summary
The paper proposes a new approach to selective prediction, which is a learning setup that allows the model to abstain from making prediction. The main idea is to keep a set of checkpoint models during training and compute a weighted average of the prediction discrepancy between checkpoint and final models. The entire process can be described concisely as follow:

g(x) = sum_(t in S) (t/T)^k * L(f_t(x), f_T(x)) where S is the set of checkpoint indices and L is a distance function, such as 0-1 loss for classification or mean absolute error for regression; k is a hyper-parameter
if g(x) >= tau: abstain; otherwise, use f_T to make prediction

This is a simple but interesting idea. It seems to provide strong empirical results too. However, despite the presence of extensive experiment results, the fundamental reason why this method has an advantage over methods that calibrate uncertainty directly is still not clear to me. Furthermore, I have some practical concerns regarding the proposed approaches as well.

Overall, I believe this is an interesting work but it still lacks a deep insight into why this machinery is expected to work better than prior approaches. This is why I currently rate this paper a bit below the acceptance bar but surely, if the authors address my concerns convincingly, I will be happy to upgrade my rating -- it is possible that I might have missed something important here.

### Strengths
Looking at the training dynamic to gauge the prediction reliability at a test point is a refreshingly interesting idea. Despite its simple formulation, I consider the idea novel -- in fact, simplicity in implementation is a plus to me.

The paper is also reasonably well-written. It is a pleasant to read this paper. All discussion points & experiment highlights are well-organized, which makes the core idea very digestible. 

I also appreciate the extensive results with a lot of ablation studies. There are also some pretty interesting theoretical results in the appendix. I think some of these results do provide some theoretical insights into how the variation of certain performance metric across checkpoint models can be related to the probability of correct classification, which could help strengthen the discussion in the main text if the corresponding assumptions is well-justified.

I like that part of the appendix also provides interesting discussion points relating the proposed approach to other lines of research.

### Weaknesses
Despite the above strengths, I still have a few doubts regarding the practicality of this paper:

First, the results are presented in a way that gives the impression that one can control the coverage. 

How is it possible in practice? I understand that the threshold can be adjusted to meet a certain coverage level on the training set but I am not sure how we could do that for the unseen test set. 

In other words, I feel that setting tau algorithmically should be part of the solution. 

Second, if I understand the main point correctly, the exploitation of the checkpoint model is mainly to help with uncertainty calibration. Then, what makes it perform better than methods that do so explicitly? I think we need a more insightful discussion here.

Third, does the tuning of the parameter k depend on test data? 

Fourth, part of the claim is the proposed method can be applied on top of existing models. But is it always effective? Could we demonstrate such synergy between SPTD and other baselines? Furthermore, I wonder how well a simple probabilistic method with explicit prediction uncertainty, such as Bayesian Neural Net or Gaussian process would fare against SPTD -- we can either do that experiment or point out previous finding in the literature that already sheds light on this.

Last, will SPTD still be robust regarding checkpoint resolution if the model complexity increases? ResNet18 is probably not a SOTA model for hard classification task such as CIFAR-100 -- how does SPTD work on larger model, such as ViT?

### Questions
I have raised some questions in the Weakness section. In addition, I also have a few other minor questions:

How do you set the threshold? In your experiment, was it set with respect to the training or test set?

I find this statement confusing: "checkpoint each model after processing 50 mini-batches of size 128. All models are trained over 200 epochs" -- by this statement alone, it means if you are making 200 passes over the entire training set & for CIFAR-10, that means looping over a total of 50K * 100 / 128  batches -- so if you checkpoint every 50 batches, approximately > 1K checkpoint needs to be stored -- this seems a bit too extravagant

That being said, I feel like I have missed something here since the later context clearly points out that the no. of checkpoint models used in the experiment is between 25-50

In addition, I wonder whether an explicit probabilistic method (such as BNN & GP) would be over-confident in the synthetic experiment. Can we do a quick check on this?

### Summary
This paper proposes a new metric for selective predictions -- SPTD. The metric is based on training dynamics of the sample. It is applicable to classification, regression and time-series forecasting. It is an inference time method -- does not need any specialized training. although, it needs some checkpoints to be stored -- which makes it compatible in combination with existing selective prediction methods.

### Strengths
- The method is novel in terms of it doesnt need a specialized training, and it can be applied on top of existing methods.
- Reasonable baseline and ablations (i especially like the analysis on checkpoint granularity)

### Weaknesses
 - Fail to cite some very related works on training dynamics (e.g., https://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.10795.pdf) as well as using training dynamics to analyze test sample (https://proceedings.mlr.press/v163/adila22a/adila22a.pdf)
- Considering the two works mentioned above, the novelty of the work seems less now. If the authors can come with a convincing argument on this, I would not be opposed to raising my score
- The numerical improvement over baseline (Table 1) seems very small.
- Distribution on g evaluation (Figure 4) is only done for the proposed method. If other baselines have the same pattern, the relative efficacy of the method becomes questionable

### Questions
- Check Weakness
- Have the authors try the method on OOD datasets? Can it reliably reject OOD samples?

### Summary
This paper proposes SPTD (Selective Prediction based on neural network Training Dynamics), a new approach to selective prediction problem. In this approach, SPTD captures the final model along with many intermediate models learned during the SGD style training method. SPTD runs these intermediate models and find the disagreement between the final model prediction and the intermediate model predictions. With some weighting scheme, a threshold based gating function is introduced to estimate the selection region. Given that this method introduces no architectural changes, it has no train-time impact (the intermediate checkpoint storage is an additional overhead). This also means that such an approach can be utilized for not only classification tasks, but other tasks such as regression.

### Strengths
- No architectural changes implies no training time changes 
- Applicable for not only selective classification problems but other tasks such as regression and time-series forecasting

### Weaknesses
 - Added storage overhead for the intermediate models
- Added inference cost for the prediction using the intermediate models compared to other selective prediction models that only require one forward pass through the architecture and the gating mechanism.
- It is unclear which of the many intermediate checkpoints should be used for the inference stage.

### Questions
-  Have you plotted other baselines for the Figure 2 to see what impact these baselines have compared to SPTD?
-  How do you select which of the intermediate checkpoints should be used for the inference stage? It is possible to design clever selection strategies during training to reduce the storage and inference cost rather than storing intermediate points at fixed checkpoint intervals.
-  Have you tried other weighting schemes than (t/T)^k? 
-  Have you compared the inference cost of STPD with other methods (which only require one forward pass through the network and some gating mechanism)?
