# Unlocking Tuning-free Generalization: Minimizing the PAC-Bayes Bound with Trainable Priors

- Decision: Reject
- Scores: 6, 8, 5, 5, 6

## Abstract
It is widely recognized that the generalization ability of neural networks can be greatly enhanced through carefully tuning the training procedure. The current state-of-the-art training approach involves utilizing stochastic gradient descent (SGD) or Adam optimization algorithms along with a combination of additional regularization techniques such as weight decay, dropout, or noise injection. Optimal generalization can only be achieved by tuning a multitude of hyper-parameters extensively, which can be time-consuming and necessitates the additional validation dataset. To address this issue, we present a nearly tuning-free PAC-Bayes training framework that requires no extra regularization. This framework achieves test performance comparable to that of SGD/Adam, even when the latter are optimized through a complete grid search and supplemented with additional regularization terms.

### Summary
The paper introduces a training framework that improves the generalization ability of neural networks without extensive hyper-parameter tuning and regularization. By minimizing the PAC-Bayes bound with trainable priors, the framework achieves comparable performance to traditional methods like SGD/Adam, even without additional regularization. It eliminates the need for hyper-parameter search and reduces reliance on validation data. The paper highlights the importance of weight decay and noise injections as essential techniques. The approach shows promise for enhancing generalization in deep neural networks.

### Strengths
1. This paper generally is well-written and easy to follow.
2. The idea of tuning-free generalizaton with trainable prior is both interesting and theoretically grounded, and seems to be promising in training neural networks, especially when it can be extended to large-scale neural networks, e.g., transfermers.
3. This paper has provided solid theoretical analysis, which can be inspiring for the follow-up works.

### Weaknesses
1. The paper suggests that only weight decay and noise injections are essential for PAC-Bayes training. However, this conclusion seems premature and lacks comprehensive analysis. It would be beneficial to investigate and compare the impact of other regularization techniques commonly used in deep learning, such as dropout or batch normalization, within the proposed framework. This would provide a more comprehensive understanding of the interplay between different regularization methods and their contribution to generalization performance. Specifically, the paper should explore whether the implicit regularization effects of methods like dropout, which introduces stochasticity during training, or batch normalization, which normalizes layer outputs, can be effectively replaced by the proposed noise injection method. It's not clear if the proposed method captures the full spectrum of regularization effects provided by these other techniques, and a more thorough comparison is needed to justify the claim that only weight decay and noise injection are essential.
2. The method proposed in this paper may require i.i.d. data and may not be able to deal with out-of-distribution tasks.

### Questions
1. Could the authors elaborate more on why it is so important to give a generalization bound on unbounded loss? Existing bounded one can not work well in practice? An empirical compare with them when apply those bounds for training? From my understanding, the bounded part has now been shifted to the bounded $\gamma$ with $\gamma_1$ and $\gamma_2$ in the unbounded bounds.
2. Could the authors elaborate more on why optimizing prior on training dataset will be helpful for the generalization performance. Normally, we should fix prior or choose a good one using validation dataset.

### Summary
The paper proposes an approach for PAC Bayesian approach for training deep neural nets that automates the determination of the model hyperparameters based on a learning-theoretic bound instead of performing combinatorial search. The developed PAC Bayesian bound has novel aspects such as being applicable to unbounded losses by making more plausible assumptions than the prior art. The paper evaluates the practical benefit of the developed bound on diverse and challenging use cases such as training neural nets with a depth of 10+ layers on image classification and graph neural nets on five different graph prediction benchmarks. The proposed method appears to reach state-of-the-art performance or above in most of these use cases.

### Strengths
The paper does a really good job at identifying the bottlenecks of the existing approaches, such as how the assumed range of exponential moment inequality leads to vacuous bounds. There are many other such to-the-point statements clearly justifying and motivating the proposed solution.

The proposed way of developing a PAC Bayes bound for unbounded loss is novel and very interesting. The way it moves from bounded loss to bounded moment generating functions is truly creative and elegant.

The algorithm derived from the bound addresses a fundamental problem of machine learning: tuning hyperparameters of large-scale predictors. The enterprise is very ambitious and the reported results are very promising.

### Weaknesses
There is ample room to improve the clarity of Section 6. The current version is missing a good amount of essential information. As far as I understand, a key message of the paper is “do not do grid search, do PAC Bayes training instead”. Then grid search appears as the main baseline to improve on. Wouldn’t it then make senses to reserve some space in Section 6 to describe how they build the grid, why it is a strong alternative to PAC Bayes (i.e. how do we know that it contains competitive hyperparam values), and how much computation overhead it brings?

It looks to me possible to use an existing PAC Bayes bound, such as one from Dziugaite et al. or Haddouche et al. for the same purpose: hyperparameter tuning. How does the proposed bound compare to them on the same experiment setup? I believe that I see what is novel with the bound but I do not immediately see why it should be a better bound, better in the sense of both being tighter and being a training objective that gives improved generalization accuracy. How do the current experiment results help us make this comparison? If they cannot, could the authors report additional results during the rebuttal phase to make this comparison possible?


I also have difficulties interpreting Figure 1. What does the x axis correspond to? What does “index” stand for in this context?

The conclusion section makes the claim that the proposed method also mitigates the curse of dimensionality. How do we conclude this from the rest of the paper, especially from the experiment results?

### Summary
This work proposes minimising a novel PAC-Bayes bound as a new objective instead of the usual cross entropy loss. This novel PAC-Bayes bound applies for unbounded losses and further allows for (weakly) training the prior. Besides the benefits of minimising an upper bound to the generalisation error, the authors further observe that such an objective is significantly more stable with respect to the choice of various training hyper-parameters such as learning rate, batch size, weight decay etc. This thus alleviates a tedious hyper-parameter search, leading to speed-ups of a single training cycle.

### Strengths
1. Improving upon the optimisation objectives in deep learning is a very under-studied avenue. Especially PAC-Bayes bounds moreover are very principled theoretically as they serve as upper bounds to the generalisation error. Making such techniques more practical and showing benefits over standard training would be very important and potentially impactful.
2. The paper is very well-written and gives a very accessible introduction to PAC-Bayes bounds, how they have been used and what weaknesses of prior work the authors aim to address. I really enjoyed reading this part of the paper! The extension to trainable priors also seems non-trivial (although I have some questions on this later in the review) and the authors manage to match performance of baselines without too much tuning of hyper-parameters.

### Weaknesses
1. The authors develop a novel and arguably tighter PAC-Bayes bound but never put it to test (at least from what I could see). I don’t see any generalisation bounds reported in the paper, so it is hard to gauge how much of a contribution the novel bound is in terms of tightness, compared to the previous works cited in this paper. I understand that this is not the main focus of the paper but it would definitely strengthen its technical contribution, i.e. the bound itself. I would have also liked to see a discussion regarding the trade-offs of having a learnable prior. What if the set of priors is so large that it includes the posterior, i.e. the KL term could be set to zero perfectly. How large would the resulting penalisation term be? Is there ever a scenario where this could lead to a non-vacuous bound?  Also, how does this learnable prior compare to methods that perform a (discrete) grid search over the prior and then perform a union bound, resulting in an additional  penalty term (e.g. [1])? 
2. The paper focuses on the efficiency of their proposed method, which arises due to the absence of hyper-parameter tuning. I am not convinced by these claims based on the empirical experiments performed in this work:

    a) There seems to be a certain arbitrariness as to what hyper-parameters are simply chosen ad-hoc and turn out to work well. The $\gamma_1$ and $\gamma_2$ values are, for instance set to values that work well for the vision tasks but they actually need adaptation for the graph and text tasks, suggesting that some tuning is actually needed. Specifically, it is mentioned that $\gamma_2$ requires tuning for optimal performance. The paper should provide a detailed account of how many runs were needed to find a suitable value for this parameter. I also could not find a stability analysis for the default choices, were those just the first values tried or was an initial grid search actually needed to find those values? There is also a warmup period only detailed in the Appendix to ensure faster convergence, how was the duration of this set?  I also would like to see a comparison to SGD/Adam/AdamW, where the default hyper-parameter settings are used. For instance, I very rarely see anyone changing the default momentum value for simple tasks such as CIFAR10/CIFAR100. I would also like to see a plot depicting how sensitive the baselines are to individual parameters such as the learning rate, momentum etc, I think the results are already in Figure 1 but need to be re-grouped accordingly.

    b) The method is strongly more involved conceptually than the standard objectives. First, K_min needs to be estimated before-hand and it’s not clear how the quality of such an approximation affects results. The optimisation has to be split into two phases, where the objective is reduced in the second part to ensure better convergence properties. The objective itself is naturally also more complicated although this might be fine as it also comes with theoretical guarantees. The hurdle for practitioners to use this framework might be rather high and I’m not convinced at this point if it is worth the effort.

    c) My biggest concern however is due to the training time required for the proposed method. A single run on CIFAR10, according to Table 8 in the Appendix takes roughly 7000 seconds, while for SGD the same takes roughly 600 seconds. This means that one can roughly perform 12 SGD runs in the time it takes to perform a single run with the PAC-Bayes technique. I would argue first that (1) it does not take 12 runs of SGD to find an acceptable hyper-parameter setting, especially not on simple tasks such as CIFAR10/CIFAR100. (2) Even if 12 runs are required, I would argue that one has obtained a better understanding of the task in the sense of what techniques work etc, and subsequent re-runs of the same method will be very cheap. Moreover, one could even make use of those 12 runs and build an ensemble, perform uncertainty quantification etc. I also believe that this should be discussed more transparently in the main text, instead of the Appendix.

### Summary
This paper examines training of deep neural networks via directly optimizing their PAC-Bayes bounds. This is done with the secondary goals of reducing reliance on hyperparameter searches and investigation of which regularization tricks/implicit biases can be omitted without compromising generalization performance. In doing so, the authors extend earlier results of Dziugaite & Roy to relax the assumption of bounded loss, by appealing to an exponential moment bound. While this assumption is not typically considered to be an issue, its relaxation may be of interest on its own.

### Strengths
The paper identifies that a weakness of many PAC-Bayes type bounds is the assumption of a bounded loss. Conditions that allow for this assumption to be relaxed are identified, and connections to sub-Gaussian bounds are highlighted.

### Weaknesses
Although the terminology surrounding prior and posterior distributions is consistent with Maurer 2004 and parts of the PAC-Bayes literature, the more recent prominence of Bayesian methods in the machine learning literature and their more specific use of these terms leaves room for confusion. Distinguishing between the distributions appearing in the bounds and the specific choice of the Gibbs posterior, for example, would be helpful (see e.g. https://arxiv.org/pdf/1605.08636.pdf, https://arxiv.org/pdf/2110.11216.pdf).

The overall contribution of this work seems minimal, since there is previous literature loosening the bounded loss assumption, and there is little additional information provided in the current work.

The posterior distribution given by $\mathcal{Q}_{\sigma}(h)$ does not appear to be a valid probability distribution, as defined in the paper.

### Summary
The paper proposes a principled PAC-Bayes framework for optimizing neural networks in classification. Specifically, the paper first extends the current PAC-Bayes bound for bounded loss functions to unbounded loss functions and introduces trainable priors. The end result is a practical AC-Bayes bound consisting of learnable parameters: model weights, prior parameters, posterior parameters, and a moment parameter. The algorithm jointly optimizes over all learnable weights. Compared to the existing optimization framework, the PAC-Bayes framework does not require extensive learning rate tuning and comes with built-in learnable regularization capabilities. Experimentally, the proposed framework achieves similar performance with extensively tuned existing pipelines.

### Strengths
* **Principled approach**: most of the proposed framework stems from rigorous derivation and extension to the PAC-Bayes learning theory. Specifically, the paper derives the PAC-Bayes bounds for both preset and learnable priors and discusses why it is reasonable to learn a prior in a data-driven way. 

* **Practical novelty**: from a practical perspective, the proposed framework can potentially automatically learn its regularization strength during optimization without turning. Specifically, the KL divergence term $KL(Q|P)$ between the parametrized posterior and prior, using Gaussian distributions, reduces to learnable weight decays and noise injection. The regularization strength is controlled by the variance parameters in the prior and posterior respectively. 

* **Distributional output**: Conventional optimization pipeline only yields a MLE point estimation, the proposed method returns a posterior distribution over model weights, which could be utilized for Bayesian inference with improved robustness and better uncertainty quantification.

### Weaknesses
 * **Poor compatibility with data augmentation**: a major downside of the method is its poor compatibility with data augmentation techniques, which are important and beneficial to boost a model's performance. The reason is that the algorithm needs the exact number of training data sizes and data augmentation breaks this assumption. This is discussed by the authors in the appendix. Nevertheless, this is an important limitation of the approach. 

* **Lack experiments**:  On CIFAR10 and CIFAR100 experiments, the proposed method is on par with existing optimization methods, which need extensive hyper-parameter tuning, especially for regularization heuristics. Given the theory-oriented nature of this paper, this is reasonable. However, it would be great to scale up experiments to medium/large datasets. More importantly, given the claim that the proposed framework automatically learns regularization, it is *necessary* to test its performance under a low-data regime for example using only 10% of CIFAR10 and CIFAR100. This will make the claim of being *nearly tuning-free* much more convincing. 

* **Need more clarity on $K(\lambda)$**: The loss function derived from the PAC-Bayes bound has three important terms, the empirical data-driven loss, the KL divergence between the posterior and the prior, and $K(\lambda)$. It's not clear what role $K(\lambda)$ plays in the overall algorithm. Since it is estimated before training, it is also not clear how it affects the learning in terms of gradient.

### Questions
My major concern is over the experiments. While it is reasonable to have small-scale experiments, I would really like to see how the proposed method works for low-label situations since a major claim is its tunning-free capability. This means that it can adjust its built-in regularization strength to different dataset sizes. 

It would make the claim much more convincing if the algorithm showed promise in adapting to varying numbers of training data. I would suggest the authors run a study on varying the number of training data, e.g., 10%, 50%, and report the performance and the learned variances for the prior and posterior. What do you expect the prior and posterior variances to be when the dataset size is small and how do the results support this? 

I will be happy to raise my score if this concern is addressed convincingly.
