- Decision: Accept
- Scores: 3, 8, 6, 5

## Abstract
Virtual sensing techniques allow for inferring signals at new unmonitored locations by exploiting spatio-temporal measurements coming from physical sensors at different locations. 
    However, as the sensor coverage becomes sparse due to costs or other constraints, physical proximity cannot be used to support interpolation. 
    In this paper, we overcome this challenge by leveraging dependencies between the target variable and a set of correlated variables (covariates) that can frequently be associated with each location of interest. 
    From this viewpoint, covariates provide partial observability, and the problem consists of inferring values for unobserved channels by exploiting observations at other locations to learn how such variables can correlate. 
    We introduce a novel graph-based methodology to exploit such relationships and design a graph deep learning architecture, named GgNet, implementing the framework. 
    The proposed approach relies on propagating information over a nested graph structure that is used to learn dependencies between variables as well as locations.
    GgNet is extensively evaluated under different virtual sensing scenarios, demonstrating higher reconstruction accuracy compared to the state-of-the-art.

### Summary
This paper proposes a solution to the multivariate spatial interpolation problem through a nested graph representation and graph convolutional networks. Real climate data is used to validate the performance of the proposed solution.

### Strengths
1. The problem of spatial interpolation through deep learning is generally meaning for and important.
2. The authors acknowledge traditional spatial interpolation methods such as Kriging
3. Real-world dataset used for experiments.

### Weaknesses
1. The claim that Kriging or similar approach won't work due to sparse sensors lacks sufficient justification. The proposed solution can be solved by multivariate Kriging. The authors should at least show the results on such a well-known spatial solution and compare it with their solution.

2. The graph of sensors is built by measuring similarities between node embeddings. However, it is unclear how to learn such embeddings and why it is not affected by sensor sparsity. If two sensors are too far away their values have no correlation. The edge defined in under such a case would be meaningless. 

3. There is no demonstration of a successful prediction of missing values on a spatial map.

### Questions
1. Why Kriging would not work in this case is not adequately justified. The semi-variogram function can be selected from a variety of options depending on the assumptions. As long as the two locations are not farther than a threshold (the range) apart, they can be assumed to have correlations. 

2. Another traditional model that might solve this problem is Markov random field. Why not considering it in the baseline?
/?？
3. How to define the graph edges based on (static) embedding? What information do you used to learn it?

### Summary
In this paper, the authors presented a novel graph-based framework for virtual sensing from sparse multivariate spatio-temporal observations, called GgNet. They leveraged a nested graph structure to account for dependencies between covariates and relations across locations and learned end-to-end to maximize reconstruction accuracy. The GgNet achieves superior performance in settings with poor sensor coverage, where other state of the art fail, and contributes to the methodological advancement of the field as well as a powerful tool in practical applications.

### Strengths
①	The GgNet proposed in the article effectively addresses the limitations of traditional methods in the context of sparse sensor coverage by inferring signal values at unmonitored locations through learning dependencies between variables and positions.
②	The article provides numerous details in the appendices to help readers gain a more comprehensive understanding of the framework. For instance, Appendix B and C offered a detailed description of the experimental settings and baseline parameter details.
③	The author employed effective training method. They masked an additional small fraction of data points, at random, in the training channels, which can enforce robustness to random missing value.
④	The experimental baseline selection is quite comprehensive and reasonable, including KNN, BRITS, SAITS, and GRIN, along with various progressively more advanced recurrent RNN. These choices in baselines contribute to a more comprehensive and reliable set of experimental results.

### Weaknesses
①	This article lacks a thorough analysis of the experimental results and a comprehensive interpretation of the data. It primarily presents the experimental outcomes in tables without providing detailed explanations. For instance, while the authors claim superior performance, they do not delve into why GgNet outperforms other methods in specific scenarios, such as particular spatial configurations or temporal patterns. A more granular analysis, perhaps by visualizing specific cases where GgNet excels or fails, would be beneficial.
②	The article did not include an overview diagram of the overall model structure, which made it difficult for readers to comprehend the architecture of the model. A clear diagram illustrating the flow of data through the nested graph structure, including the interaction between the inter-location and intra-location graphs, would significantly improve the paper's clarity. The absence of such a diagram makes it challenging to understand the model's complexity and how different components interact.
③	The experiment evaluated accuracy-related metrics such as MAE and MRE but did not provide information on the computation time and performance on large datasets. As a result, readers cannot assess the efficiency of this model. The lack of computational performance analysis, especially concerning the scalability of the model with increasing sensor network size, is a significant omission. It is important to understand the trade-offs between accuracy and computational cost, especially for practical applications.
④	The experimental training methods have the potential to enhance the robustness of the network, but in the end, no robustness test results for the model were provided. While the masking strategy during training is a good step, it is crucial to demonstrate the actual robustness of the model by testing it on datasets with varying levels of missing data or noise. Without these results, the effectiveness of the training method remains unclear.
⑤	The experiment did not conduct tests of this framework with different data types of other domains, which makes it difficult to assess the comprehensiveness of its application in various fields. The evaluation is limited to a few datasets within similar domains. Testing the model on diverse datasets, such as traffic data, financial time series, or biological signals, would provide a more comprehensive understanding of its applicability and limitations.

### Questions
①	Why is GgNet only applicable to transductive learning settings in its current form? What are the limitations? How to extend GgNet to support inductive learning?
②	How does the efficiency of Ggnet compare to other models? What is the impact of missing data in the dataset used in the experiment on the experimental results? Can you offer a more detailed explanation of the results?

### Summary
The paper presents a novel framework for virtual sensing of missing multivariate spatio-temporal data in settings with limited sensor coverage. The authors introduce GgNet, a deep learning architecture capable of leveraging inter-location dependencies and relationships between covariates for accurate data reconstruction. 
The contributions of the paper include: 
•	The introduction of a novel deep learning architecture designed for multivariate virtual sensing tasks, particularly in sparse scenarios. 
•	Nested Graph Structure: GgNet employs a nested graph structure to capture both spatial relationships between locations and dependencies between covariates, learning them end-to-end for improved reconstruction accuracy.

### Strengths
•	The problem formulation of multivariate virtual sensing in sparse scenarios is itself an original and significant contribution, as it addresses a practical challenge across various domains. The introduction of GgNet leverages a nested graph structure to capture dependencies between covariates and relations across locations, is highly original. The combination of graph-based modeling and deep learning techniques to address the problem is innovative and distinguishes this work from prior methods in the field. 
•	The technical content, methodology, and experimental design are well-supported with empirical evidence. The thoroughness of the experimental evaluation, conducted across multiple datasets, with different degrees of sparsity and temporal resolutions, enhances the paper's quality. The extensive experimentation, use of real-world datasets, and evaluation further emphasize the paper's significance.

### Weaknesses
•	The paper, while generally well-structured, could benefit from more explicit and detailed explanations in certain technical aspects. For instance, the paper could provide a more comprehensive explanation of the nested graph structure used in GgNet, which is a key component of the proposed method. Specifically, the description of how the inter-location dependencies and covariate relationships are modeled within the nested graph structure is not sufficiently detailed. The paper lacks a clear explanation of how the graph adjacency matrices are constructed and updated during training, and how the node features are initialized and propagated through the network. Furthermore, the paper does not provide sufficient details on the specific graph neural network layers used within GgNet, such as the type of message passing mechanism, activation functions, and aggregation methods employed. This lack of detail makes it difficult to fully understand the technical contributions and to reproduce the results.

### Questions
•	The paper mentions the computational time for GgNet and other baselines but does not discuss scalability. How does GgNet's performance scale with more extensive sensor networks or larger datasets?

### Summary
This paper aims to address the data sparsity problem by using multivariate data. The authors proposed a model GgNet which can leverage the correlations/dependencies between the target variable/channel and the covariates to reconstruct the target values at certain locations. Extensive experiments are conducted.

### Strengths
1. The paper is well-presented and well-organized.
2. The paper proposed a new model GgNet aiming to reconstruct the target values at certain locations.
3. Extensive experiments are conducted to validate the proposed model, and the results seem promising.

### Weaknesses
1. This paper has a lot of assumptions, for example, it assumes the covariates are always available, and the mutual dependencies between target and covariates are invariant and can be leveraged at all locations. Here are some concerns: we cannot guarantee that those assumptions hold for all cases (at least, there should be more examples or references to support them), and if they do not hold, does the proposed method still work?
2. It seems the method requires the latent representations of locations where the target values need to be reconstructed are close, so is it possible to deal with the cases where the latent representations of locations are remote?
3. The model somewhat lacks novelty, it seems the final model just combines several existing models.
