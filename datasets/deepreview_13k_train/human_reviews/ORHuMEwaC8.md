- Decision: Reject
- Scores: 6, 3, 6, 5

## Abstract
Counterfactuals provide guidance on achieving a favorable outcome from a model, with minimum input perturbation. However, counterfactuals can also be exploited to leak information about the underlying model, causing privacy concerns. Prior work shows that one can query for counterfactuals with several input instances and train a surrogate model using all the queries and their counterfactuals. In this work, we analyze how model extraction attacks can be improved by further leveraging the fact that the counterfactuals also lie quite close to the decision boundary. Using polytope theory, we derive a novel theoretical relationship between the error in model approximation and the number of queries, when the queries exactly return the "closest" counterfactual. Noting the practicalities of counterfactual generation, we also provide additional theoretical guarantees leveraging Lipschitz continuity, that hold when the counterfactuals are reasonably close but may not be the closest ones. Our theoretical results help us arrive at a simple strategy for model extraction, which includes a loss function that treats counterfactuals differently than ordinary instances. Our approach also alleviates the related problem of "decision boundary shift". Experimental results demonstrate the performance of our strategy on synthetic data as well as popular real-world tabular datasets.

### Summary
This paper studies model reconstruction attacks by using the proximity of counterfactuals to the decision boundary. The authors aim to establish theoretical guarantees for such attacks. To this end, they characterize the number of queries required for the attacker to achieve a given error in model approximation using results from polytope theory (Theorem 2). The authors’ main result from Theorem 2 relies on the decision boundary being convex. To relax the convexity assumption, the paper additionally assumes Lipschitz continuity of the underlying model to provide approximation bounds, which depend on the Lipschitz constant which is typically unknown. 
Finally, the authors propose a strategy for model extraction.

While the paper offers some strengths in terms of proposing new tools to analyze model extraction attacks, there are several weaknesses that require improvement, including a limited evaluation and theoretical results that are (mostly) confined to models with convex decision boundaries. Overall, the paper provides a good starting point for future research in the area of model extraction attacks through counterfactual explanations but further improvements are necessary to meaningfully generealize the analysis to general non-linear models.

### Strengths
- **New theoretical approach to study extraction attacks**: The paper introduces a fresh approach to studying model extraction attacks using counterfactual explanation algorithms, employing methodologies from polytope theory that I have not seen explored in this context before.
-  **New method**: The authors propose a new model extraction method.
- **Clearly structured**: The paper is overall well written and clearly structured.

### Weaknesses
The empirical evaluation is limited: (1) The paper lacks comparison with more recent model extraction techniques via counterfactual explanations, such as those by Wang et al. (2022). Specifically, the paper does not address the iterative counterfactual querying strategy proposed by Wang et al., which could significantly enhance model extraction. (2) Further, the dependence on dimensionality ($d$) is a critical factor influencing convergence (e.g., see Theorem 2), yet the paper lacks results concerning this aspect in the empirical evaluation of their attack. The experiments do not explore how the number of queries required for a given fidelity scales with increasing dimensionality, which is a key theoretical prediction. (3) There is also a disparity between the primary theoretical results (Theorem 2) and the subsequent sections of the paper. The theoretical analysis focuses on convex decision boundaries, while the experiments are conducted on non-convex models without a clear justification for this discrepancy. (4) I would expect that experimental results verify the validity of Theorem 2. This requires to fit a model with a convex decision boundary and to execute the proposed attack. The paper should include experiments on models with convex decision boundaries to validate the theoretical claims. Finally, (5) the attacks are exclusively conducted using one type of neural network and might not generalize well to other models or other network architectures. For example, it would strenghten the paper's empirical results to explore the suggested method's impact of varying model parameters, etc. on fidelity. The paper should include experiments on different model architectures, such as decision trees or SVMs, to demonstrate the generalizability of the proposed attack.

Confined theoretical results: (1) The paper does not to adequately reconcile the theoretical analysis with commonly used sparsity-inducing loss functions in standard counterfactual explanation methods. The theoretical results do not account for the impact of L1 regularization or other sparsity constraints on the counterfactual explanations, which are often used in practice. (2) The main (interesting) theoretical results are confined to convex decision boundaries. Hence, the analysis on the number of required queries to reach a given error in fidelity (see Theorem 2) might be substantiialy underestimated. The paper needs to address how the theoretical bounds change when the decision boundary is non-convex, as this is a common scenario in practice.

### Questions
- Can the authors provide insights into their attempts to estimate the Lipschitz constant in practical applications? Considering the inherent difficulty in obtaining low Lipschitz constants for neural networks of reasonable size, the practicality of the Lipschitz result may be questionable.
- How did the authors determine the criteria for retaining explanations when generating multiple explanations using the method from Mothilal et al. (2020)?
- Can the authors offer empirical verification of Theorem 2 to strengthen its validity?
- It would be valuable to visualize the convergence rate from Theorem 2 in Figure 9, allowing for an evaluation of whether the empirical predictions for convex boundaries closely align with the empirical behavior for non-convex models.

### Summary
This paper introduces two model extraction strategies that use counterfactuals. The first strategy exploits the properties of closest counterfactuals, while the second strategy leverages the Lipschitz continuity of target and surrogate models. The authors provide theoretical guarantees and address the issue of decision boundary shift in a system that provides one-sided counterfactuals. Experimental results show improved fidelity compared to a baseline method.

### Strengths
1. Remark 1 gives a false sense about the difficulty of the problem. The difficulty of approximating a non-convex body is way more difficult than this. A convex body can be approximated by the intersection of many half spaces, and this is what the authors are using in Section 3.1. However, it is unclear how to approximate a non-convex body using half spaces without logical rules (like boolean variables). Figure 4 is two-dimensional, and we can easily identify the intersections of two hyperplanes; however, for higher dimensions, it is absolutely not clear how to find these intersections. Thus, a similar representation using red piecewise linear curve like Figure 4 does not generalize to higher dimensions.
There is no clear message in Section 3.2: Theorem 3 is too simple to be a theorem, and there is no definitive description of the extraction strategy.
Section 3: the authors claim ``Even though the attack is valid for a decision boundary of any shape”, but there is no clear direction on how to generalize the attack to a non-convex boundary.
The extraction attack omits the queries that are predicted 0 by $m$ in the objective function (5). Why?
The paper provides some sample complexity results for the extraction attacks.

### Weaknesses
1. Remark 1 gives a false sense of the difficulty of the problem. The difficulty of approximating a non-convex body is way more difficult than this. A convex body can be approximated by the intersection of many half-spaces, and this is what the authors are using in Section 3.1. However, it is unclear how to approximate a non-convex body using half spaces without logical rules (like boolean variables). Figure 4 is two-dimensional, and we can easily identify the intersections of two hyperplanes; however, for higher dimensions, it is absolutely not clear how to find these intersections (the intersection is again a $d-2$ dimensional manifold). Thus, a similar representation using red piecewise linear curve like Figure 4 does not generalize to higher dimensions. Furthermore, the claim that a concave region can be approximated by the intersection of half-spaces is misleading, as the required number of half-spaces can be significantly higher than for a convex region, and the process of finding these half-spaces is not trivial. The authors should clarify how the proposed method scales to higher dimensions and more complex decision boundaries, especially when dealing with non-convex regions that require a much denser set of query points.
2. There is no clear message in Section 3.2: Theorem 3 is too simple to be a theorem, and there is no definitive description of the extraction strategy. The connection between Theorem 3 and the proposed attack is not clearly established. The authors should provide a more detailed explanation of how the Lipschitz continuity property is leveraged to guide the extraction process and how the proposed objective function (5) is derived from the theoretical result. The description of the extraction strategy is vague, lacking specific details on how to choose the value of k and how the surrogate model is updated based on the objective function.
3. Section 3: the authors claim ``Even though the attack is valid for a decision boundary of any shape”, but there is no clear direction on how to generalize the attack to a non-convex boundary. The paper lacks a concrete approach for handling non-convex decision boundaries. While the authors mention that the Lipschitz-based attack does not assume any particular shape, they do not provide any practical guidance on how to adapt the attack to complex, non-convex boundaries. The theoretical analysis and experimental results are primarily focused on convex boundaries, and it is unclear how the proposed method would perform in more realistic scenarios with highly irregular decision boundaries.
4. The extraction attack omits the queries that are predicted 0 by $m$ in the objective function (5). Why? The rationale for excluding queries predicted as 0 by the target model in the objective function is not clear. This omission could lead to a biased surrogate model, especially if the target model's decision boundary is complex. The authors should justify this design choice and discuss its potential impact on the fidelity of the extracted model.

### Questions
1. Concerning Remark 2: suppose that MLaaS is using a robust recourse method. How can we estimate the value of $k$ so that we can perform model extraction?
2. Figure 7 and 8 are too simple. Could the authors provide some illustrations for (i) harder dataset, and (ii) $\tilde m$ of lower model complexity than $m$?
3. How would the model behave for an unbalanced dataset, or when the number of counterfactuals is small?
4. Is there any easy active learning method to query that can help us perform an extraction attack with a limited number of targeted queries?

### Summary
This paper presents a theoretical analysis and practical approach to model extraction using counterfactual explanations.
In the theoretical analysis, the authors investigate the query complexity of model extraction under ideal assumptions, where the positive region is convex, and the model is Lipschitz.
In terms of practical methods, the authors focus on the observation that many counterfactual explanations are only required in the direction how the negative decisions can be altered to positive ones.
The authors proposed a method for model extraction from such biased counterfactual explanations. 
Specifically, they assumed that counterfactual explanations lie on a decision boundary where the prediction probability is constant, and proposed a modified binary cross-entropy loss based on this assumption.
In the experiments, the authors demonstrated that the proposed method outperformed conventional methods, particularly in addressing the phenomenon known as "decision boundary shift."

### Strengths
This paper exhibits two key strengths: a theoretical analysis and a development of practical method for model extraction using counterfactual explanations.
In theoretical analysis, the authors established ideal assumptions such as a convex positive region and a Lipschitz model. Even under these ideal conditions, it would be important to theoretically elucidate query complexity, leading to an important step forward in the advancement of model extraction research.
Regarding the practical method, the authors demonstrated that "decision boundary shift" can be easily addressed by a simple modification of the cross-entropy loss function.

**Originality, Quality**

This study demonstrates originality in identifying conditions such as a convex positive region and a Lipschitz model as factors influencing query complexity in model extraction.
While these conditions may be limited and idealized, the theoretical clarification of query complexity remains a crucial step in moving the model extraction research forward.

**Clarity**

Throughout the paper, the fundamental concepts and contributions of the research are clearly stated.

**Significance**

Demonstrating that "decision boundary shift" can be addressed through a straightforward modification of the cross-entropy loss is considered particularly significant.
On the other hand, the theoretical analysis of query complexity is still confined to ideal conditions, necessitating further in-depth analysis for this result to have a broad impact within the research field.

### Weaknesses
This paper has two weaknesses: "Novelty and Effectiveness of the Modified Cross-Entropy Loss" and "Gap Between Theoretical Analysis and Methodology."

**Novelty and Effectiveness of the Modified Cross-Entropy Loss**

An inherent aspect of counterfactual explanations is that they correspond to points on the decision boundary, making it natural to consider their class probability as 0.5.
When using counterfactual explanations as training data for model extraction, it is also natural to use them as data points with a class probability of 0.5.
Viewing the problem of model extraction in this light, it can be reduced to a learning problem involving soft labels.
The question that arises is whether the modified cross-entropy loss proposed in this study is a novel and particularly effective method for this problem.
While this is not necessarily a fatal weakness, the paper appears to lack a discussion regarding the relevance of the modified cross-entropy loss to the broader context of soft label research and its unique effectiveness and novelty in this specific problem. Specifically, the authors do not discuss if the proposed loss function is simply a re-parameterization of the standard cross-entropy loss with a soft label of 0.5, or if it offers any unique advantages over such a standard approach. The paper should clarify whether the proposed loss function is fundamentally different from using standard cross-entropy with a target probability of 0.5 for counterfactual examples, and if so, what specific benefits it provides.

**Gap Between Theoretical Analysis and Methodology**

In the theoretical analysis, the assumptions of the convexity of the positive region and the Lipschitz property of the model play essential roles.
However, these assumptions are entirely disregarded in Section 4.
While it is understood that models in real world do not exhibit convex positive regions, it appears that the paper currently contains two largely independent sections: one focused on theory and the other on methodology.
In Section 4, the authors mention, "While the primary contribution of this work is theoretical, in this section we further present an empirical performance evaluation of the model extraction attack devised in the previous section for one-sided counterfactuals."
This statement likely refers to the content in Section 3.2.
However, Section 4 lacks explicit mention of the Lipschitz property.
Therefore, questions arise about whether the Lipschitz assumption plays a fundamental role in Section 4, as suggested in Section 3.2. Furthermore, the paper does not provide any empirical evidence to support the theoretical claims, specifically regarding the relationship between the Lipschitz constant and the query complexity. The experimental section should include an analysis of how the Lipschitz constant of the target model affects the performance of the proposed model extraction method, and whether the observed behavior aligns with the theoretical predictions.

### Questions
* Are there any other possible alternatives of the proposed modified cross entropy loss, in particular in the context of soft label? If not, what is the essential difference or advantage of the proposed the proposed modified cross entropy loss?
* Do the Lipschitz assumption plays a fundamental role in Section 4, as suggested in Section 3.2? Or, all we need is the proposed modified cross entropy loss alone?

### Summary
The paper studies how counterfactual explanations can be used for model extraction attacks.

### Strengths
- Highly relevant research question
- Paper is well structure and mostly well written (only a discussion of limitation of the proposed method is missing)
- Nice intuitive geometric approach, although I think that there are some limitations (see Section "Weaknesses")

### Weaknesses
 - Only closest counterfactuals are considered. However, in practice, plausibility and actionability are also very important aspects of recourse. Some explanation generation method might not output closest counterfactuals but plausible ones.
- Lipschitz continuity and monotonicity are both very strong assumptions -- they might not hold for many models in practice. Specifically, the assumption of global Lipschitz continuity is particularly restrictive, as many neural networks exhibit varying degrees of local Lipschitz continuity, and assuming a single global constant may not accurately reflect the model's behavior. Furthermore, while monotonicity can be a desirable property in certain contexts, it is not generally guaranteed in most machine learning models, and imposing this assumption limits the applicability of the theoretical results.
- Authors should also discuss limitations of their proposed method

### Questions
- How can the proposed method be extended to deal with plausible and actionable counterfactuals? As mentioned above, these two aspects are highly relevant in recourse, and might be used instead of closest counterfactuals.
- What to do in case of really large Lipschitz constants? Would the proposed method still work?
