## Abstract
We present Neural Spectral Methods, a technique to solve parametric Partial Differential Equations (PDEs), grounded in classical spectral methods.
Our method uses orthogonal bases to learn PDE solutions as mappings between spectral coefficients. In contrast to current machine learning approaches which enforce PDE constraints by minimizing the numerical quadrature of the residuals in the spatiotemporal domain, we leverage Parseval's identity and introduce a new training strategy through a \textit{spectral loss}.
Our spectral loss enables more efficient differentiation through the neural network, and substantially reduces training complexity.
At inference time, the computational cost of our method remains constant, regardless of the spatiotemporal resolution of the domain.
Our experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms previous machine learning approaches in terms of speed and accuracy by one to two orders of magnitude on multiple different problems, including reaction-diffusion systems, and forced and unforced Navier-Stokes equations.
When compared to numerical solvers of the same accuracy, our method demonstrates a $10\times$ increase in performance speed.

### Summary
The paper introduces Neural Spectral Methods (NSM) for learning solutions to Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) in the spectral domain, with a model that parameterizes spectral transformations. The authors introduce a new class of spectral-based neural operators and leverage Parseval's identity to derive a spectral loss that does not require auto-grad or finite-differences to approximate derivatives. Adopting a *data-constrained* setting, they conducted a set of experiments to validate their approach on three different PDEs.
Their method demonstrates significant speedup and accuracy improvements over considered baselines (FNO + PINN loss, SNO + spectral loss , NSM + PINN loss).

### Strengths
The paper is well written and the method section is easy to follow. The spectral loss seems like a promising direction for solving PDEs with Neural Networks. Experimentally, the method outperforms all considered baselines in terms of L2 relative error. Reaction-diffusion and  Navier-stokes experiments were done for different values of diffusion and viscosity coefficients, which highlights the robustness of the method. Figures 2 and 3 show that NSM converges faster during training and is also insensitive to the spatial resolution at inference.

### Weaknesses
The motivation of the paper is not transparent to me. The authors propose in this paper two novelties for PDE-based neural networks : a spectral loss and a general design for spectral-based neural operators. While I understand that the first is supposed to simplify the training of PINNs, the second one seems to be a new architecture for solving operator learning tasks like FNO or SNO. Therefore, their method is not a PINN-like solver with a new loss, but rather a deep surrogate model that can approximate the PDE solution from an initial condition or forcing term, without data in the domain. This positioning should be stated explicitly. 

As a consequence, the selected baselines and chosen setting cannot lead to a fair comparison between the different methods. Neural operators such as FNO or SNO have been proposed to learn mappings between functions that can be accessed through point-wise evaluations. Therefore, they require data for training and should not be trained with a PDE loss only. I think the authors should focus their comparison with classical PINN methods, and show first that their model is capable of solving a single equation for diverse types of PDEs, and then compare it to PINN approaches that target generalization through meta-learning such as [1], [2].

I also do not understand why NSM is claimed to be insensitive to the grid size. Is a grid ever used for NSM ?  The forcing terms or initial conditions seem to be queried at the collocation points. This avoids aliasing problems rather than preventing them.

There is overall a lack of details regarding the implementation of the proposed method. We do not know if the experiments were done with fourier or chebyschev basis, or both. The truncated number of basis functions considered is also not mentioned.

### Questions
The exposed approach has been tested when $\phi$ is either an initial condition or a forcing term in the equation. While this is encouraging, I wonder if the method would remain applicable if we changed the boundary conditions between samples ? Let's say on a circle or a square. Would there be an issue between the change of dimensions between the 1D input parameter function and the 2D output ?

I am also curious to understand the inference of NSM. For a new input function, is it purely operator-based or do you also finetune the model to reduce the PDE loss ? What kind of guarantee do you provide on the PDE solution for a new parameter function ?

The operators $T$ and $T^{-1}$ are not detailed. What is their complexity with respect to the input length ? How do you choose the collocation points ? Does the number depend on the difficulty level of the PDE ?

Could you elaborate on this point ? ```The Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) in the forward pass of FNO escalates to quadratic in batched differentiation```.

What is $\mathcal{H}$ throughout the paper ?

### Summary
The paper proposed a novel spectral-based neural operator, Neural Spectral Method (NSM), trained by self-supervised loss, i.e., it needs no data. Previous methods including FNO usually are trained with data, though they can also be trained in self-supervised way with PINN loss. This work extends the idea of self-supervised neural operators and proposes a new loss by Parseval's identity. 

For periodic and non-periodic boundary conditions, NSM uses Fourier basis and Chebyshev basis respectively. 

Under self-supervised setting, the paper compared NSM with some baseline modes, e.g., SNO, FNO combining with PINN loss. It shows that the proposed method has advantages including faster training convergence, higher accuracy, especially at super-resolution inference.

### Strengths
**Originality:** The paper has several novelties, including a new design of neural operator with fixed bases. A novel residual loss by Parseval's identity.

**Quality:** The paper has carefully benchmarked the proposed method in training cost, inference cost and accuracy. It exhibits advantages over several baseline methods.

**Clarity:** The paper is well organized and clearly presented.

**Significance:** The proposed method can in inspiring to the community in both

### Weaknesses
More comparison can be done, for example, Transform Once

which can be combined with PINN loss or the loss proposed here.

Regarding aliasing error, it seems to me the solution proposed in the paper is to fix the resolution of grids and do interpolation in higher resolution. If this is correct, it is essentially advising people not to use super resolution inference like FNO does. Hence, this is not an advantage of NSM, but an insight about super resolution, which can be also applied to FNO, i.e., fixing resolution grids + interpolation.

### Summary
The paper introduces Neural Spectral Methods (NSM) as a novel approach to solving partial differential equations (PDEs). What makes NSM unique in comparison to the numerous ML methods out there is that it's structurally integrated with spectral representations, Parseval's Identity, and orthogonal basis functions, all of which are classic numerical receipes that were well studied. It's a solid step towards hybrid NN and classic numerical method.

### Strengths
Like discussed in the summary, the strength of the paper is the elegance integrating NNs with existing spectral methods. In particular, spectral basis are used to represent the functions and NNs are only used to map from spectral coefficients to spectral coefficients (with neural operator architecture). In addition, by leveraging the Parseval's Identity, the proposed method is able to train without using the expensive PDE residual norm (PINN loss). The authors mathematically proved the equivalence of the spectral loss and the PINN loss. This approach avoids sampling a large number of points and the numerical quadrature.

The author backed up these theoretical advantages with experiments that demonstrate 100X training time speedup.

The intro is well written. The short summary on of the the limitations of existing methods (data availability, optimization, computation cost) are very good. And the paragraph above it clearly place the author's work in the literature.

### Weaknesses
The paper briefly mentions some limitations of existing ML methods for solving PDEs, but it could benefit from a more extensive discussion of the potential drawbacks and challenges specific to NSM.

Basis are predefined manually. It's unclear how to choose these basis functions.

### Questions
Since the proposed resesarch is embedded in the spectral method, it's clearly limited by the issues of many spectral method. For example, as discussed in "Implicit Neural Spatial Representations for Time-dependent PDEs (ICML 2023), spectral methods also have a global support, just like neural networks. So I would be curious to understand more of these limitations. What are some disadvantages of spectral method, in comparison say grid-based neural methods. Also how does the spectral approach compare to Implicit Neural Spatial Representations for Time-dependent PDEs (ICML 2023) which avoids grid completely and only user a MLP architecture.

"Focus on scenarios with no solution data." This is understandable but the scope of the paper. Since the author's method is a very general spectral formulation, why not try it on some data? My biggest concern right now is that the examples shown are all 2D toy example. Would it make sense to try the method on large scale 3D problems where data is already available?

"Dresdner et al. (2022); Xia et al. (2023); Meuris et al. (2023) use spectral representations in the spatial domain. These studies differ in problem settings and deviate from our method in both architecture and training" I looked in details of these papers and can confirm that the author's work is unique. But I think for a complete paper, the author should discuss their similarities and differences.

### Summary
The authors propose an improvement upon Spectral Neural Operators, essentially proposing to train these architectures in spectral space using Parseval's identity and input data in form of spectral coefficients rather than signals evaluated on grid points. As such, the approach has some novelty and is relevant to the ML+PDE community. The authors show that this approach can outperform existing methods on 3 simple PDE problems (Poisson, Reaction-Diffusion, 2D NS).

### Strengths
The paper introduces some novel ideas and is well-written. These are:
- novel approach for training with spectral inputs + spectral evaluation of the Loss via Parseval's identity
- relevant baselines and ablations that show the effect of the individual components
- good motivation for the overall approach

### Weaknesses
Some interesting claims are made, for which I would hope for more clarification and theory if possible. These are:
- Why is training in spectral space better? analytically both approaches should be identitcal (due to the identity) and gradients should be the same. Some theoretical analysis on this would have made the paper better.
- how aliasing effects are avoided by using spectral coefficients as input data rather than the signal itself. Ideally, this should come with an ablation study on its own
- the baselines could be better explained - I would like to see parameter counts and spectral resolutions of all approaches.

### Questions
Major:
1. NSM is trained using Parseval's identity using a spectral loss. From the results I can see that NSM outperforms CNO (the same but PINN loss). Why is that? Mathematically speaking, the two loss functions are identitcal and so should be the gradients. The only difference I can spot is potentially an added spectral transform in the gradients due to the summation in spectral space. Numerically, this would make a difference but I have a hard time understanding why this should lead to better performance. Any ideas?
2. Results specify resolutions for FNO but do not disclose the spectral resolution/param count for the NSM. I encourage the authors to add this information
3. Figure 2b - why is there only a single point for all resolutions of NSM?

Minor/Clarity:
1. in eq. 5 what is phi? It doesn't seem to be defined
2. The statement that the neural operator is a mapping between grid points is limiting. It is simply realised as such and trained at a fixed resolution but conceptually, nothing stops the user from evaluating it on another grid. I believe this is what the authors mean with "implemented" in the last sentence of page 4 but I find this sentence to be somewhat misleading. A clarification would help in my opinion.
