# Learning to Generate Better than your Large Language Models

- Decision: Reject
- Scores: 6, 5, 5, 3

## Abstract
Reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs) for text generation. In particular, recent LLMs such as ChatGPT and GPT-4 can engage in fluent conversations with users after finetuning with RL. Inspired by learning-to-search algorithms and capitalizing on key properties of text generation, we seek to investigate RL algorithms beyond general purpose algorithms like Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO). In particular, we extend RL algorithms to allow them to interact with a dynamic black-box guide LLM and propose RL with guided feedback (RLGF), a suite of RL algorithms for LLM fine-tuning. We experiment on the IMDB positive sentiment, CommonGen, and TL;DR summarization tasks. We show that our RL algorithms achieve higher performance than supervised learning (SL) and RL baselines, demonstrating the benefit of interaction with the guide LLM. On both CommonGen and TL;DR, we not only outperform our SL baselines but also improve upon PPO across a variety of metrics beyond the one we optimized for.

### Summary
The paper systematically adapts known techniques from reinforcement learning, imitation learning and learning to search for the purpose of fine-tuning a large language model to maximize a set reward. Authors combine these techniques to formulate concrete algorithms (e.g. PPO++ and D^2LOLS) under the common umbrella of "reinforcement learning with guided feedback" (RLGF). In short, the main unifying trait of new algorithms is the use of "guide" policy, typically in the form of another LLM that can generate reasonable, but not necessarily optimal candidate sequences. Authors evaluate their algorithms on IMDB (sentiment), CommonGen and Reddit Summarization and compare against standard (for LLM community) baselines for RLHF, supervised fine-tuning and zero-shot prompting. The paper also contains sensitivity analysis and theoretical justification for some algorithmic choices.

### Strengths
1. The paper manages to combine a diverse set of ideas from prior RL research and formulate multiple algorithms within the 9 page limit, which is no small feat.

2. Authors conduct comprehensive evaluations with multiple realistic tasks and near-SoTA language models. The experiments are using standard llm fine-tuning best practices and report multiple seeds (in most cases). While this is not outstanding, many recent papers do not pass this bar, therefore it feels like a strength.

3. For a paper about so many different ideas and algorithms, this one is reasonably well written and easy to follow.

### Weaknesses
My main concern is the choice of baselines. While authors compare against SFT and basic PPO, prior research developed alternative algorithms for fine-tuning LLMs on human feedback that also claim superiority to PPO and SFT. Authors even cite some of those works in the paper. Some of those algorithms are: DPO[1], APA[2], P3O[3], SLiC-HF[4] though there may be more.

These works adopt different means to learn from human feedback: some of them compatible to RLGF while others can only be used as competitors. I believe that the paper would be improved if, for each competitor, authors either compare against it in the experiments or prove that it has no chance of outperforming RLGF algorithms or, if authors claim that RLGF algorithms are orthogonal, demonstrate how it performs in combination with those approaches.

Another, less important concern is about the paper structure. Authors manage to cram multiple algorithms (PPO++, AggreVaTeD, LOLS in Appendix B, D2LOLS) and evaluate all of them within the few allowed pages. As a result, the paper fills "crammed" despite authors' considerable effort.
Perhaps it would be better to explore one or two of those algorithms **in more detail** and leave the rest to appendix? Though, I will understand if authors deliberately choose otherwise.

For the last (and least) of issues, the idea of guiding the search for optimal policy is technically not novel outside the LLM fine-tuning domain, and the same can be said about other ideas presented in the paper. To reiterate, it is not a "problem" to be solved, and a good practical adaptation of existing methods is valuable in and of itself.

### Summary
This work extends RL algorithms to allow them to interact with a dynamic black-box guide LLM and propose RL with guided feedback (RLGF). Experiments show that this method achieves higher performance than supervised learning (SL) and RL baselines.

### Strengths
1. The method looks novel and presents a good extension to PPO.
2. The theoretical justification look rigorous.

### Weaknesses
1. Experimental results on both the sentiment sentence generation and TLDR dataset do not show that the proposed methods can outperform PPO, let alone significantly. The reported RM score increase on the TLDR dataset, from 6.01 to 6.11 when comparing SFT+PPO with SFT+PPO++, is marginal and does not demonstrate a substantial improvement. The close performance numbers between SFT+PPO and SFT+PPO++ across various metrics in Table 1 further weaken the claim of significant outperformance.
2. I am wondering what is the difference between the LLM policy \pi_{\theta} and the guide policy \pi_g. It is said that \pi_g is the SFT+nucleus sampling. But in PPO, the LLM policy model should also be a fine-tuned LLM on some tasks. In this case, the distinction between the two policy models is not clearly defined. Specifically, if both policies are initialized from the same SFT model, the difference in their sampling strategies (nucleus vs. softmax) alone may not justify the claim that the guide policy provides meaningfully distinct feedback.

### Questions
1. What is the size of the LLM policy model? GPT2-large or GPT2-medium? Have you tried larger LLM models?
2. What is the model for evaluating the output-perplexity?
3. Why didn't you use GPT4 to evaluate the win-rate? I don't think LLAMA2-13B-Chat is able to provide good and fair evaluation over model outputs for the win rate.

### Summary
The paper proposes an RL framework for natural language generation, which involves two distinct policies: one providing a trajectory from a given prompt and the other completing the sequence from a state sampled from the trajectory. In this framework, one policy is trained, while the other remains fixed and serves as a guiding policy, producing useful states for the learning process of the other policy. The authors introduce three variants within the framework and demonstrate their effectiveness on three distinct NLP tasks.

### Strengths
- The idea is simple and interesting. It could easily lead to others building on the core concept and approach.
- The paper reviews a line of literature on imitation learning and presents a connection between those and the proposed framework.

### Weaknesses
 - The motivation is not clear.  Why guide policy should be integrated into RL finetuning especially in text generation? How the rollin & rollout scheme leads better text generation than PPO?
- The theoretical justification section of the paper does not self-contained enough for readers.
- Performance gain seems marginal compared to PPO.
- Lack of ablation study for the mixing parameter $\beta$ which might be crucial in the framework.

### Questions
- It would be interesting to observe the utilization of a more powerful guide policy,  such as larger LMs like LLaMA, than the other policy in the framework.
- I am confusing on the setting $\beta = 1.0$ of AggreVaTeD in TL;DR. How $\pi_{\theta}$ of AggreVaTeD can be trained in this setting despite that it does not use $\pi_{\theta}$ at all?
- missing result for SFT + D2LOLS in TL;DR
- missing related work that presents similar concept of the proposed algorithm

### Summary
This paper proposes D^2LOLS, an RL optimization technique that can take advantage of the use of a guide policy to overcome some of the limitations of RL algorithms currently used with LLMs, such as PPO. The basic intuition is to use guidance from a superior model to ensure that the target model does better than the guidance model, by biasing rollouts to more optimal paths that the superior model might have taken and updating the target model with the reward within this superior set of rollouts. Related work is reviewed, and the proposed method is described clearly in steps as updates and combinations of previous work. Theoretical justification is given for why D^2LOLS should do better, due to restarting on states according to the guidance model, though an assumption is made that does not seem to be clearly evidenced, see Questions.

Experiments are performed on 3 datasets: IMDB, CommonGen, and TL;DR. The first two are rather simple (write a movie review with a given sentiment, include words in a given generated sentence), and IMDB is further handicapped to only consider one sentiment. Furthermore, the gains over baselines are relatively small. Additionally, the authors do a study of the tradeoff between optimizing for the RL reward and perplexity, which can be interpreted as a partial proxy for the acceptable space of generated outputs. In a similar vein, hyperparameter sensitivity is discussed with further experiments.

The authors conclude by suggesting that the proposed technique allows for superior optimization using only black box access to a guidance policy, making it especially useful in the era of powerful LLMs which can only be accessed through APIs.

### Strengths
- Clear explanation of both the algorithm and the key intuitions

- The basic idea is definitely worth pursuing—using a guide for rolling out possible scenarios in order to ensure some coverage of the space of near-optimal policies is clearly something that might benefit current RL methods in LLMs.

- The study of reward optimization tradeoff is interesting and very welcome. It’s pretty clear that our metrics only work under “normal conditions” where complete gibberish isn’t being measured, so using the KL divergence as the other axis shows a potential pareto frontier that we’re working with in these problems.

- The fact that the proposed technique seems to generalize slightly better than previous techniques to harder examples (with less train-test overlap) on CommonGen is interesting, and does validate the technique to some extent, though the margin is relatively small.

### Weaknesses
 - The benchmarks used are somewhat lacking. For text generation in 2023, most comparisons for state of the art methods are made by comparisons to other LLMs because fixed metrics have been found to be lacking. A comparison using a framework like Chatbot Arena (Zheng et al. 2023). would have made the results significantly more convincing. These often use GPT-4 as an evaluator, which has now been shown to be provisionally better than traditional metrics (Liu et al 2023, Min et al 2023, Zhou et al 2023, inter alia).

- Even with these quite simple benchmarks, the resulting differences on metrics are small for the task where control is more significant, CommonGen. In IMDB the task-specific metric really only checks if the sentiment score is correct, which is very little information to be using to validate outputs.

- The fact that perplexity goes up but output perplexity goes down on IMDB is worrying. I can understand why perplexity would go up: the model is likely collapsing onto a smaller subspace of possibilities, which may still be higher quality. However, the fact that the output perplexity also goes down is worrying: it indicates that after optimization the resultant model is more predictable to LMs which is usually not a good sign for tasks that LMs are bad at in the first place. The results on TL;DR are similarly quite small.

- I’m disappointed to see there’s no study of how this technique scales across model sizes: one could imagine doing this for smaller models, incurring relatively low compute expenses, but no such experiments were conducted. As it is, it is not clear how much these results will generalize to the ever-growing zoo of LLMs.

### Questions
- On page 6 you write “While we do not expect the SFT policy π g is as good as the optimal π ⋆ , it is reasonable to expect that d π g provides coverage to d π ⋆ .” Why is this reasonable to expect? It is not a prior clear to me that language models cover the space of optimal solutions well, rather than only covering a small percentage of them. Where is the evidence for this claim?

-  What model do you use to calculate output perplexity? I only see you mention GPT-J in passing as an example, not definitively stating what model was used.

-  On page 7 you write “For training supervised SFT baselines, we consider only the examples with positive labels.”—This is a somewhat unorthodox decision, as it gives little for the model to contrast with or for the user to control at inference time. It basically reduces this to a finetuning problem. Why was this choice made?
