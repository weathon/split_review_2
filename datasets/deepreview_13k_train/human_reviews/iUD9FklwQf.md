- Decision: Reject
- Scores: 5, 6, 5, 5

## Abstract
Graph neural networks (GNNs) have recently emerged as a promising approach for solving the Boolean Satisfiability Problem (SAT), offering potential alternatives to traditional backtracking or local search SAT solvers. However, despite the growing volume of literature in this field, there remains a notable absence of a unified dataset and a fair benchmark to evaluate and compare existing approaches. To address this crucial gap, we present \model{}, the first benchmark study that establishes a comprehensive evaluation framework for GNN-based SAT solvers. In \model{}, we meticulously curate a large and diverse set of SAT datasets comprising 7 problems with 3 difficulty levels and benchmark a broad range of GNN models across various prediction tasks, training objectives, and inference algorithms. To explore the learning abilities and comprehend the strengths and limitations of GNN-based SAT solvers, we also compare their solving processes with the heuristics in search-based SAT solvers. Our empirical results provide valuable insights into the performance of GNN-based SAT solvers and further suggest that existing GNN models can effectively learn a solving strategy akin to greedy local search but struggle to learn backtracking search in the latent space.

### Summary
The authors present a comprehensive benchmark for the development of Graph Neural Network (GNN)-based approaches for satisfiability (SAT) solving. They compile all relevant work in the field into a unified benchmark, facilitating direct comparison of various methods. This benchmark is poised to be a pivotal resource, bridging the research efforts in deep learning and SAT solving. The paper also offers an extensive empirical analysis of different GNN architectures, providing insights into their performance across the benchmark's datasets, and highlighting certain limitations in current methodologies.

### Strengths
**Consolidation of GNN-Based SAT Solving:** The paper's primary strength lies in amalgamating all existing GNN-based SAT-solving methods into a single codebase and publication. This centralization is an invaluable contribution to the field and sets a firm foundation for subsequent research.

**Innovative Comparison Techniques:** The authors introduce inventive strategies for comparing GNN-based SAT solvers with traditional heuristics. These comparisons are crucial for contextualizing the performance of the proposed methods within the broader landscape of SAT-solving techniques.

### Weaknesses
 **Benchmarking Against Traditional Heuristics:** Despite the thorough comparison within GNN-based methods, the benchmarking against traditional SAT-solving heuristics remains unclear. For this study to significantly impact SAT-solving, a more explicit comparison using time-to-solve metrics (preferably both arithmetic and geometric means, in accordance with standard practices) with leading industrial solvers or mainstream heuristics is needed. The current evaluation lacks crucial details, such as the specific configurations of the compared solvers, the hardware used for benchmarking, and the number of runs performed to obtain the reported results. This makes it difficult to assess the practical relevance of the proposed GNN-based methods in the context of real-world SAT solving.

**Gap Analysis:** There is a lack of detailed discussion on where GNN-based SAT solvers fall short when compared to state-of-the-art (SOTA) SAT solvers. The authors should elaborate on the deficiencies of GNN-based methods and propose what advancements are necessary to surpass traditional SOTA SAT solvers. For instance, the paper does not delve into the limitations of the message-passing framework in capturing the dynamic aspects of clause learning, a core component of CDCL solvers. Furthermore, the analysis should discuss the scalability issues of GNNs when applied to very large SAT instances, a common challenge in practical applications.

**Addressing Gaps:** While the paper stands as a considerable contribution to the field, I think it could have been better with novel contributions by proposing solutions to address the gaps identified in the work, e.g., a proposal to increase generalization performance. The paper should explore specific techniques to improve the generalization capabilities of GNNs, such as data augmentation strategies, curriculum learning, or novel architectural designs that are less prone to overfitting on specific training distributions. The current discussion lacks concrete proposals on how to overcome the limitations of current GNN-based approaches.

### Questions
1. There appears to be a typographical error in the paragraph following Equation 1. Aggr(a)gation → Aggr(e)gation 

2. In Section 4.3,  "Training Objectives," the relationship between S(x), S_min, and S_max could benefit from clarification. Additionally, the use of N(a) within this context is ambiguous.

### Summary
This paper studies Graph neural networks for the Boolean Satisfiability Problem. As claimed by the authors, previous research pays little attention on the dataset and benchmark to evaluate and compare existing approaches. In this work, the authors propose G4SATBench, which accounts those aspects ignored by previous research works. The authors claim that their proposed G4SATBench is  the first benchmark study that establishes a comprehensive evaluation framework for GNN-based SAT solvers.

### Strengths
1. This paper focus on benchmark studying, which is a foundational work in GNN-based SAT solvers.
2. G4SATBench contains a diverse set with enough domain areas and difficulty levels.
3. Publicly available source code is provided.

### Weaknesses
I have several comments regarding this submission.

1. As described in this submission, the G4SATBench benchmark consists of 3 instance families, including random instances, pseudo-industrial instances, and combinatorial instances. However, SAT is so fascinating because of its great importance in real-world industrial applications. As a top-tier conference submission that focuses on proposing a SAT benchmark, it is needed to include industrial SAT instances. Hence, the lack of industrial SAT instances degrades the significance of this work.

2. It seems that the technical merit of this work is a bit thin. This paper describes a SAT benchmark, rather proposing new SAT solving techniques. Also, the authors claim that an insight obtained from this paper is that GNN models can effectively learn a simple greedy local search strategy (such as GSAT algorithm), but it is difficult to learn backtracking search strategy (such as DPLL and CDCL). Since it is well-known that, for solving application SAT instances, CDCL-based SAT solvers greatly outperform local search SAT solvers. The insight of this work seems to argue that GNN-based SAT solvers are not promising to solve application SAT instances, which also degrades the significance of this work.

### Summary
Despite GNNs showing promise in SAT solving, a standard dataset and comparison benchmark were lacking. The paper introduced G4SATBench, the first benchmark for evaluating GNNs in solving SAT.  G4SATBench, comprising 7 problems with 3 difficulty tiers, assesses several GNN models across various prediction tasks, training objectives, and inference algorithms. Empirical evaluation using G4SATBench indicate GNNs excel at greedy local search strategies but struggle with backtracking search in latent spaces.

### Strengths
1. The problem the paper is trying to address is important. Indeed, we should have a uniform way for evaluating the GNN-for-SAT approaches emerging in recent years.
2. I appreciate the large amount of experiments (consuming 8,000 GPU hours) and data the author put effort to in studying GNN for SAT. 
3. The way of comparing the training and solving processes of GNNs with both CDCL and local search in SAT solvers is interesting to me.

### Weaknesses
1. G4SATBench contains only small scale formulas with at most 400 variables. However, industrial-level SAT formulas and formulas in SAT competitions can easily have thousands or even millions of variables. In order to make GNN-for-SAT approach practically applicable, the benchmarks using in the evaluation should also consider real-world level cases, such as large SAT formulas. I would encourage the authors to include such cases in G4SATBench.

2. GNN models evaluated in the study only contains basic ones, including NeuroSAT (the first GNN-for-SAT model), GCN, GGNN, and GIN. It would be interesting to compare GNN models applied by recent GNN-for-SAT approaches, and see how they perform in G4SATBench,  instead of only considering basic GNN models. Specifically, the benchmark should include models that incorporate attention mechanisms or more sophisticated message-passing schemes, which have shown promise in other graph-based learning tasks.

3. For experiments comparing with CDCL heuristics, the authors apply contrastive pretraining to pretrain the representation of CNF formulas to be close to their augmented ones with learned clauses. I have some doubts on the experimental setup. The learned clauses are not static and can vary depending on which CDCL solver we use. Studying whether GNN can learn these learned clauses is not quite reasonable to study if CNN can mimic CDCL. Furthermore, even though GNN can infer a bunch of learned clauses, can we say that CNN can learn a solving strategy akin to CDCL? As we know that CDCL not only involves clause learning, but also variable branching, and conflict analysis, which are not explicitly modeled in the current experimental setup. The contrastive pretraining setup, while interesting, does not directly address the core mechanisms of CDCL, making the comparison less convincing.

### Questions
1. Why only small scale SAT formulas are included in the benchmark?
2. Why only basic GNN models are applied in the paper?
3. What is the rationale behind the comparison between GNN and CDCL heuristics? Can you illustrate in more details?
