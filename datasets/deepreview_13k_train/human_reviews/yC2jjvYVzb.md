# Confidence-Based Model Selection: When to Take Shortcuts in Spurious Settings

- Decision: Reject
- Scores: 8, 5, 3

## Abstract
Effective machine learning models learn both robust features that directly determine the outcome of interest (e.g., an object with wheels is more likely to be a car), and shortcut features (e.g., an object on a road is more likely to be a car). The latter can be a source of error under distributional shift, when the correlations change at test-time. The prevailing sentiment in the robustness literature is to avoid such correlative shortcut features and learn robust predictors. However, while robust predictors perform better on worst-case distributional shifts, they often sacrifice accuracy on majority subpopulations. In this paper, we argue that shortcut features should not be entirely discarded. Instead, if we can identify the subpopulation to which an input belongs, we can adaptively choose among models with different strengths to achieve high performance on both majority and minority subpopulations. We propose COnfidence-baSed MOdel Selection (COSMOS), where we observe that model confidence can effectively guide model selection. Notably, COSMOS does not require any target labels or group annotations, either of which may be difficult to obtain or unavailable. We evaluate COSMOS on four datasets with spurious correlations, each with multiple test sets with varying levels of data distribution shift. We find that COSMOS achieves 2-5% lower average regret across all subpopulations, compared to using only robust predictors or other model aggregation methods.

### Summary
This paper studies the problem of confidence-based model selection in an effort to address the issue of distribution shifts in the testing phase by equally considering invariant and shortcut features. Given multiple base classifiers trained on the source dataset, the COSMOS algorithm is proposed that (1) first clusters test examples in K clusters, and (2) then uses a confidence score to select one out of the base classifiers to perform classification of the examples for each cluster. The performance of the proposed algorithm is evaluated on 4 datasets  and compared with methods that use only invariant features, only shortcut features and ensemble methods.

### Strengths
+ The problem of addressing distribution shifts in the testing dataset is addressed when spurious correlations are present.
+ The idea of using different models for different inputs is very neat.
+ The proposed algorithm is simple and very intuitive and has a nice formal intuition.
+ The performance of the proposed algorithm is validated using 4 datasets, illustrating its superior performance compared to existing works.
+ The proposed algorithm improves classification performance in real-world scenarios that are prevalent with distribution shifts and spurious correlations.
+ The paper is in general well-written and makes it easy for the reader to understand both the problem statement and the solution.

### Weaknesses
 - I believe that the solution presented in the paper relates also to the problem of dynamic or instance-wise classifier selection, where the goal is to select the best classifier to use during testing for each test example. The related work section does not seem to include any relevant work in this area. Some example references follow:

 - I am a little bit confused about the relationship between the index variable of the subpopulation and the label. Initially, I thought that the test set could be split into subpopulations based on the possible values of the labels. However, as I continued reading, it seems that subpopulations are not necessarily constructed based on the possible values of the labels. In this case, what is the meaning of subgroups and how do you justify this?

 - Can you explain what is the meaning of the invariance assumptions in Sec. 3?

 - I am now also thinking that the proposed approach must relate to research focusing on imbalanced datasets since you are changing the proportion for subpopulations. In that sense, it is wise to discuss how the proposed approach differs from prior work in the area.

Minor:
(a) I believe there is a small typo in notation. Namely, shouldn't p_{T_i} be p_{T^i} in Sec. 3 or am I confused?
(b) In pg. 5, dist(.) should be properly defined as a divergence measure.
(c) The statistics of the datasets (e.g., number of instances, features, etc) are not reported.

### Questions
(1) It would be great if the authors discuss how the proposed method differs from the problem of dynamic or instance-wise classifier selection, and depending on the relevance, they will consider extending their related work section accordingly.

### Summary
The paper discusses the challenges and solutions in machine learning related to feature learning, model robustness, and calibration. It highlights the importance of identifying shortcut features, which are often ignored in favor of robust predictors. The authors propose a technique called COnfidence-baSed MOdel Selection (COSMOS) that uses model confidence to guide model selection without the need for target labels or group annotations. They show that COSMOS outperforms other methods on datasets with distributional shift. Additionally, the paper introduces a fewshot recalibration approach to improve model calibration for specific data slices, demonstrating its effectiveness in various downstream tasks.

### Strengths
1) The paper introduces a unique approach (COSMOS) for model selection based on model confidence, which does not rely on target labels or group annotations, addressing a common challenge in machine learning.
2) The paper demonstrates that COSMOS performs better than other model aggregation methods on datasets with distributional shift, achieving lower regret across subpopulations.
3) The approach is general to be applied to a wide range of models.

### Weaknesses
1) There exists gap between the formal intuition and practical approach. Some assumptions are strict to stand in practice. The rationality of theories and the gap between theories and methods need to be addressed. Otherwise, we have no way of knowing the scope of the method.
2) More methods, as well as some SOTA , should be considered in experiment.

### Summary
This paper concentrates on introducing a training method known as COnfidence-baSed MOdel Selection (COSMOS). The paper presents the COSMOS framework, which utilizes model confidence to adaptively select among models with varying strengths for distinct subpopulations. COSMOS does not necessitate target labels or group annotations, making it suitable for situations where obtaining such information is challenging. Nevertheless, this approach lacks adequate experimental analysis and falls short in the interpretability of its algorithm design.

### Strengths
- The paper presents a novel framework, COSMOS, which tackles the issue of distributional shift by selectively using suitable classifiers based on model confidence. COSMOS adaptively chooses models depending on their appropriateness for various inputs, taking into account both shortcut and invariant classifiers. The proposed approach does not depend on target labels or group annotations, making it applicable in situations where such information is inaccessible or challenging to obtain.

- This paper has a clear and rational motivation that advocates for treating shortcut and invariant classifiers equally, with both being experts in different regions of the input space.

- This paper provides a comprehensive formal definition of the problem, including the problem setting and formal intuition.

- To a certain degree, the algorithm in this paper demonstrates experimental results that the model can maintain satisfactory performance for majority groups while enhancing the performance of minority groups.

### Weaknesses
 - The COSMOS framework assumes that test data is provided in a batch format, with multiple inputs available at once for model selection. However, in real-world situations, particularly in medical diagnosis where subpopulation shifts are common, test data may be received in a streaming manner, processing one sample at a time.

- The algorithm's design lacks interpretability. The analysis did not take into account the relationship between the algorithm's design and the use of shortcut and invariant features, nor did it explain why different classifiers can use various combinations of these two features instead of relying on the same shortcut features.

- COSMOS' performance depends on the abilities of the base classifiers. If the base classifiers are similar, COSMOS may not offer significant improvements.

- Another drawback related to numerous base classifiers is the need to train multiple base classifiers, each with potentially different architectures or training backbones. This increases the complexity and computational cost of the training process, as each base classifier must be trained and calibrated individually. Managing and optimizing multiple training pipelines can be difficult, particularly when working with large-scale datasets or complex models. In comparison to many existing methods that only require one base encoder (e.g., see [1, 2] and benchmarking methods in [3]), COSMOS displays increased training complexity.

- As the paper focuses exclusively on spurious correlations as a type of subpopulation shift, it neglects the wider variety of subpopulation shift types found in the literature. According to [3], subpopulation shifts can take many forms, such as attribute imbalance and class imbalance. Real-world datasets often exhibit multiple types of shifts at the same time, and the paper does not discuss how COSMOS would perform in these situations. As a result, the paper's limited scope undermines its generalizability and applicability to real-world datasets that may display different types of subpopulation shifts.

- The paper does not offer a comprehensive comparison with current state-of-the-art methods, making it challenging to evaluate COSMOS' relative performance and advantages compared to other techniques.

- Although the paper proposes considering metrics beyond worst-group accuracy (WGA), it only evaluates regret and does not acknowledge the tradeoffs between other essential metrics and their interactions. Recent research on subpopulation shifts [3, 4] has shown that metrics such as calibration error (ECE) or worst-case precision may conflict with WGA. As a result, it is crucial to carefully consider the limitations and potential trade-offs of alternative metrics when assessing the performance of the proposed COSMOS framework. How does COSMOS perform on those metrics?

- The ablation experiment is insufficient. The authors did not examine whether this advantage is due to the presence of TS. Moreover, if random selection or other selection methods are used among K classifiers, it is unclear whether the results will differ. It remains uncertain whether the advantage of the results is due to the integration of multiple classifiers.

### Questions
Please refer to the Weaknesses. In addition to the points raised above, I have the another question it seems the k should be k^i = \frac{D^i_T}{N}, since i denotes multiple target test sets.
