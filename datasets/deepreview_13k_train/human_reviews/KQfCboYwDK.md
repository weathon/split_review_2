# Adiabatic replay for continual learning

- Decision: Reject
- Scores: 3, 3, 5, 3

## Abstract
Conventional replay-based approaches to continual learning (CL) require, for each learning phase with new data, the replay of samples representing all of the previously learned knowledge in order to avoid catastrophic forgetting. Since the amount of learned knowledge grows over time in CL problems, generative replay spends an increasing amount of time just re-learning what is already known. In this proof-of-concept study, we propose a replay-based CL strategy that we term adiabatic replay (AR), which derives its efficiency from the (reasonable) assumption that each new learning phase is \textit{adiabatic}, i.e., represents only a small addition to existing knowledge.
		Each new learning phase triggers a sampling process that selectively replays, from the body of existing knowledge, just such samples that are similar to the new data, in contrast to replaying all of it. Complete replay is not required since AR represents the data distribution by GMMs, which are capable of selectively updating their internal representation only where data statistics have changed. As long as additions are adiabatic, the amount of to-be-replayed samples need not to depend on the amount of previously acquired knowledge at all. We verify experimentally that AR is superior to state-of-the-art deep generative replay using VAEs.

### Summary
The paper proposes adiabatic replay, a method for replay in continual learning that tailors the replay sample retrieval step to the incoming samples to be learned. This approach can theoretically avoid replaying all previous tasks, by focusing only on the modes of the distribution which overlap the most with the new task in the model's latent space. The proposed approach is a variant of deep generative replay, using a VAE with a GMM prior as a generative model. The authors argue that this choice of prior is better suited for *variant generation* which enables sampling of datapoints most likely to be interfered from the new task. The authors explore their method in offline class incremental settings, comparing to ER and DGR.

### Strengths
1.  The motivation for the paper is sound : there is significant value in carefully selecting the replay data and avoid full replay of past samples, as the latter is very computationally demanding.

### Weaknesses
1.  Overall, the paper's empirical execution is weak. The experimental protocol is limited to small sequences of tasks using arbitrarily small models. There is no discussion about the computational cost of the method. This is disappointing, as I do believe that the essence of the method has potential in different settings (for example targeting compute restricted settings, with pretrained models).
2. The baseline numbers are very weak, which raises concerns about the empirical rigor of the work. For example, deep generative replay with a VAE of similar complexity in MIR [1] gets 80% on split mnist, *trained online* with 2 classes per task, which is arguably a much more difficult setting than the one in the paper. On that note, the paper would benefit from including this baseline in the paper. 
3. To the best of my understanding, the conceptual differences with MIR are small : the idea of fetching points close in the VAE's latent space is exactly what MIR does. In other words, AR is similar to Gen-MIR where 0 gradient ascent steps to maximize interference are done. 
4. The paper could benefit from some tweaks in the main paper. For example, it is unclear at which level latent replay operates; adding a detailed figure would greatly aid understanding. Moreover, I think the authors' interpretation of Foundation Models are merely any pretrained model, rather than a "generalist" model trained on vast, diverse data.

### Questions
1. What is the buffer size used for ER ?
2. When is latent replay (vs standard replay) performed ? it seems that only SVHN and CIFAR use latent replay ?

### Summary
This paper focuses on replay-based approaches to continual learning and proposes a new method called AR which results in the following contributions:

1. Selective replay: Previous knowledge is not replayed indiscriminately, but only where significant overlap with new data exists.

2. Selective update: Previous knowledge is only modified by new data where an overlap exists.

3. Near-Constant time complexity.

### Strengths
The high time cost of replay methods is a significant problem in continual learning. I appreciate the motivation of this paper which tries to solve this problem by GMM.

### Weaknesses
1. The writing needs to be improved.

2. I usually don't focus too much on the experiments, but i do believe that the experiments should be improved where more baselines and time cost experiments are necessary.

3. The reasonable way of chosing hyperparameter $K$ is necessary. Please discuss more about $K$.

4. Lack of novelty. The key technique in this paper is well-known.

5. It seems that the main text of this paper is over the limit of 9 pages, where Section 5.1 is in page 10.

### Questions
First, I am concerned about the writing and the presentation of this paper. Specifically, the descriptions of proposed method should be transparency and easy to follow. It is better to show your method by pseudo codes.

Second, I am concerned about the proposed method AR. 

1. Is the hyperparameter $K$ fixed and how to determine a reasonable $K$? 

2. In my view, one component of GMM corresponds to one distribution of several classes. When $K>$ the number of seen classes, is it possible to chose an unknown component at the query step and what dose the generated samples look like in this scenario? It seems that the ability of preventing forgetting is determined by $K$. When there are so many classes whose number $\gg K$, it is hard to prevent forgetting due to the overlapping. If I was wrong, please correct it.

 Thrid, I usually don't focus too much on the experiments, but i do believe that the experiments should be improved.

1. There are only two old replay methods (DGR and ER). It is better to compare it with more and new replay baselines.

2. In my opinion, the potential low time cost of proposed method is a significant advantage. It is better to demonstrate this by more time cost experiments.

3. The splited tasks $T_2, T_3, \dots$ contain only one class. How dose the proposed method perform if there are more classes in one task?

### Summary
This paper first describes an important issue with replay in continual learning: whenever learning something new, it is generally required to replay all past tasks to avoid forgetting. This means there is an unbounded linear growth of to-be-replayed samples. The paper then proposes that this might be addressable with *adiabatic replay*: when learning something new, we should only replay samples – and only update the parts of the network – that are closely related to the newly learned information. To provide a proof-of-principle demonstration of this idea, the authors turn to GMMs in which they only replay and update the mixture component(s) most similar to the new data samples.

### Strengths
The paper addresses an important problem in an original way. It is a fundamental limitation of current replay approaches that all tasks thus far need to be replayed. In the last few years there have been several continual learning studies that explored whether benefits could be gained by deciding what to replay in a smart way, but generally the conclusion of these studies has been that it is very hard to do better than simply doing balanced, random sampling from all tasks so far. This study takes a novel and promising approach to this problem by using GMMs, in an attempt to provide a proof-of-principle demonstration that it is possible to do better.

### Weaknesses
 **Issue 1: important comparisons are missing**

I am afraid critical comparisons are missing for a convincing proof-of-principle demonstration that selective replay can provide substantial benefits. The paper compares AR (using GMMs) with DGR and ER (both using VAEs), and because AR performs better than DGR, the authors conclude that selective replay is beneficial. But I do not think that this can be concluded from this comparison. There are several important differences between AR and DGR – not only the use of selective replay, that could explain the difference in performance. Perhaps the authors would argue that DGR is a “state-of-the-art” technique, and that showing improved performance with a method using selective replay would be enough demonstration, but I do not agree with that. Firstly, it is not clear how DGR is implemented and it seems this is not done in an optimal way (see issues 2 and 3). Secondly, the performance obtained by DGR is simply not good (e.g., for MNIST it is substantially lower than a linear classifier could obtain). Improvements on top of that are thus not necessarily meaningful.
I would like to encourage the authors to instead include a comparison that directly assesses the benefit of using selective replay over normal replay (e.g., AR against the exact same version but using normal replay).

**Issue 2: relevant past work is not discussed (appropriately)**

Discussion of past literature is insufficient, and some important aspects are ignored. Firstly, it is claimed at several places that current replay methods must replay an amount of samples proportional to the number of past tasks, but Van de Ven et al. (2020) empirically showed that it is possible to do better than this because “preventing forgetting is easier than learning”. Although to make this possible, it is important that the loss terms from the replayed data and the current data are balanced appropriately. (It is also unclear to me whether this is done in the current study when a limited amount of data is replayed with DGR and ER, see also the last question under issue 3 below.) Another paper that would be good to discuss is Klasson et al. (2023, TMLR; https://openreview.net/pdf?id=Q4aAITDgdP), as they show that benefits can be obtained by being smart about what to replay. I think it is also relevant to discuss McClelland et al. (2020, Phil Trans R Soc B; https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/full/10.1098/rstb.2019.0637), as they make a conceptual argument that it should not be necessary to replay everything.

While I think it is important that these past studies on this topic are appropriately discussed, I do not think that the existence of these studies means that the novelty of the current study is compromised, as the current study approaches the problem in a novel and original way. In fact, these past studies illustrate the importance of the topic that is addressed by the current study.

**Issue 3: insufficient experimental details**

- How is the solver of AR trained? Is the solver also trained with “adiabatic replay”? Or is the solver trained with “regular replay”, and suffers from a linear increase in the amount of replayed data? How are the labels for the replayed data obtained?

- For DGR, how are the labels obtained for training the solver?

- For ER and DGR, how are the loss terms from the replayed data and the current data weighed? Are they balanced as in Van de Ven et al. (2020), or are they simply added?

Minor issues:

- Many of the in-text citations are formatted incorrectly

- Towards top of p3: Maximally interference replay -> Maximally interfered replay

- Bottom of p4: the notation DX-Y is used, but has not (yet) been introduced

- Given the importance of ER in the current manuscript, the buffer size that is used should be mentioned in the main text

### Questions
For the main issues to address, please see the first three issues raised under “Weaknesses”.

As I think this paper takes an original angle to an important problem, I hope the authors will be able to address these raised issues.

I would be happy to actively engage in the discussion period.

### Summary
The paper studies the problem of continual learning. The paper focuses on the generative replay approach for continual learning and proposes a new setting where the new information from the incoming task is not too significant but rather incremental based on the previous tasks (the AR setting). The paper proposes to use a Gaussian mixture model to simultaneously act as the generator as well as the learner for continual learning under the AR setting. The paper shows superior performance of the proposed method under some of the restricted settings.

### Strengths
1. The paper proposes a new setting that might be interesting to inspire new research direction where the information of the new incoming task is not too significant compared to the old ones.

2. The paper uses a Gaussian mixture model, which can be used both as the generator and the learning model, and shows improved performance on multiple settings.

### Weaknesses
1. The paper lacks justification for the adiabatic assumption. The paper creates specific settings for the experiments and makes some discussions, but are there many real-world scenarios in which such adiabatic assumptions can be applied? Also, there seems to require a more detailed formulation of such an adiabatic assumption. Say if the new information is too little, then it gets back to the ordinary training and there is no reason to do continual learning. Some mathematical formulation of the adiabatic assumption should be defined. Specifically, the paper needs to clarify what constitutes 'small' or 'incremental' information. Is it a relative measure based on the size of the existing dataset, or an absolute measure based on the information content of the new task? A more precise definition is needed to understand the scope and limitations of the proposed approach. Furthermore, the paper should discuss the potential impact of violating this assumption. What happens when the new task introduces a significant amount of novel information? Does the method degrade gracefully, or does it fail catastrophically? These questions need to be addressed to fully evaluate the robustness of the proposed method.

2. In addition to the mathematical definition of the adiabatic assumption, it is also not clear why the selected settings in the experiments satisfy such an assumption. Why the tasks are chosen in such a way? From a more practical perspective, if we are dealing with real-world tasks, how do we check if the incoming task satisfy the adiabatic assumption and we can use the proposed method? The paper needs to provide a clear methodology for determining whether a given task sequence adheres to the adiabatic assumption. Simply stating that the tasks are chosen to satisfy the assumption is insufficient. What specific properties of the tasks ensure that the new information is indeed incremental? For example, if the tasks are based on splitting a dataset by class, how does the method handle the case where the new classes are significantly different from the old ones? The paper should also discuss how to quantify the 'distance' between tasks to determine if the adiabatic assumption holds. Without such a metric, it is difficult to assess the applicability of the proposed method in real-world scenarios.

3. The paper only tests for certain restricted settings and uses a relatively simple model (GMM). Though the paper mentions that there could be more advanced version of the GMM model that could solve the capacity problem, but there does not seem to be much evidence to support such a claim. The experimental validation is limited by the use of a relatively simple GMM model. While the paper suggests that more advanced versions could address capacity limitations, this claim is not supported by empirical evidence. The paper should provide some preliminary results with more complex models to demonstrate the scalability of the proposed approach. Furthermore, the paper should discuss the limitations of using GMMs for high-dimensional data. How does the method handle the curse of dimensionality? Are there any specific techniques used to mitigate this issue? The paper should also compare the performance of the proposed method with other continual learning approaches that use more complex models.

4. It is claimed that the proposed method does not have the problem of scaling up as the number of tasks increases. However, for GMM, there is the number of clusters and I wonder should such a number be set according to the total number of tasks? If there are infinite number of classes coming in a stream, should the number of clusters also increase? Even though the change of size could be small, if we want to use a much more capable model as mentioned in the paper, will the model size go up as the tasks increase? The paper needs to clarify how the number of GMM components is determined and how it scales with the number of tasks. If the number of components is fixed, how does this limit the capacity of the model to learn new tasks? If the number of components increases with the number of tasks, how does this affect the computational cost and memory requirements? The paper should also discuss the potential for catastrophic forgetting if the number of components is insufficient to represent the data from all tasks. Furthermore, the paper should address the practical limitations of using GMMs for an infinite stream of tasks. How does the method handle the case where the number of classes is unknown or unbounded?

### Questions
Please check the weaknesses part.

After rebuttal update:
Thanks to the authors for the detailed response. My concerns about the paper remain, mainly about the precise definition of the adiabatic assumption. I keep my score unchanged.
