# Improving Offline RL by Blending Heuristics

- Decision: Accept
- Scores: 5, 8, 8, 8

## Abstract
We propose \textbf{H}e\textbf{u}ristic \textbf{Bl}ending (\algo), a simple performance-improving technique for a broad class of offline RL algorithms based on value bootstrapping. 
\algo modifies the Bellman operators used in these algorithms, partially replacing the bootstrapped values with heuristic ones that are estimated with Monte-Carlo returns. %with Monte-Carlo returns as heuristics.
For trajectories with higher returns, \algo relies more on the heuristic values and less on bootstrapping; otherwise, it leans more heavily on bootstrapping.
\algo is very easy to combine with many existing offline RL implementations by relabeling the offline datasets with adjusted rewards and discount factors.
We derive a theory that explains \algo's effect on offline RL as reducing offline RL's complexity and thus increasing its finite-sample performance. 
Furthermore, we empirically demonstrate that \algo consistently improves the policy quality of four state-of-the-art bootstrapping-based offline RL algorithms (ATAC, CQL, TD3+BC, and IQL), by 9\% on average over 27 datasets of the D4RL and Meta-World benchmarks.

### Confidence
3: You are fairly confident in your assessment. It is possible that you did not understand some parts of the submission or that you are unfamiliar with some pieces of related work. Math/other details were not carefully checked.

### Summary
The paper introduces the HUBL technique for offline RL algorithms, which partially replaces the bootstrapped values with heuristic ones estimated using Monte-Carlo returns.
Theoretical analysis has been made to understand the improvements brought by HUBL to the original offline RL algorithm, as well as its associated bias and regret.
Experimentally, results on the D4RL datasets and Meta-World benchmarks show that HUBL offers an average improvement of 9% over the current four SOTA offline RL algorithms.

### Strengths
* The proposed HUBL is a general technique that can be seen as a correction to the offline dataset itself, improving the performance of offline RL algorithms.
* Through theoretical analysis, the introduction of HUBL is discussed as an MDP reshaping, and the analysis of bias and regret is conducted.
* Extensive experiments empirically demonstrate that HUBL is indeed an effective enhancement technique.

### Weaknesses
 * **Presentation**:
    * The presentation of the experimental results in the graphs lacks clarity. The absence of a horizontal baseline at 0 makes it unclear whether there's an improvement or decline. I believe a horizontal baseline at 0 should be added, and different colors could be considered to depict increases and decreases. Specifically, the y-axis represents the performance difference between HUBL and the baseline, but without a clear zero line, it's difficult to quickly assess if HUBL is beneficial or detrimental for a given task and algorithm. This makes it harder to compare the relative performance across different algorithms and tasks.
    * The experimental tables in the appendix have a similar problem. The best performances should be bolded for easier readability. This is especially important when comparing multiple algorithms across various tasks, as the lack of visual cues makes it difficult to quickly identify the best performing method for each scenario. The reader has to manually scan each row, which is inefficient and prone to errors.
* **Limitations**:
As the authors discussed in the limitations section, offline datasets based on disconnected transition tuples are challenging to utilize with the HUBL trick unless heuristic values are computed during the construction of datasets. This limitation restricts the applicability of HUBL to scenarios where trajectory data is readily available or can be easily constructed, potentially excluding datasets where only individual transitions are recorded.

### Questions
* Please improve the presentation of figures and tables in the paper as i mentioned above.
* I've noticed that on tasks where baseline offline RL algorithms already perform well, HUBL might decrease the performance. Is there a way to ensure that its enhancements are consistently non-negative?
* On D4RL, HUBL shows significant improvements over baseline algorithms for the hopper task several times. I wonder whether there exist any shared or general characteristics in situations where HUBL offers substantial advantages. Could this be discussed, or did I perhaps overlook any mention of this aspect?

### Summary
This work presents Heuristic Blending (HUBL), a new technique that can be attached to offline RL methods to improve their performance. 

HUBL works by modifying the rewards and discounts in the dataset that the offline RL algorithm consumes, blending heuristic values to partially replace bootstrapping. 

Theoretical and empirical results show HUBL consistency when improving several offline RL algorithms performance by 9% on average over D4RL and Meta World datasets.

### Strengths
* This paper meets very good originality, quality, clarity and significance criteria. Good job!

* Section 2 does analyze the main differences of the proposed approach with respect to cited works. It is clear that no previous model has addressed the data relabeling as it has been proposed in this manuscript for the particular setting of offline RL. The use of both data relabeling and heuristic in combination with RL has been explored before, but not in the offline scenario.

* HUBL is an original method to incorporate into existing offline RL methods. It improves them without any need for a complicated modification within any algorithm; only a relabeling of the dataset is needed. It is indeed done dynamically depending on the return of every trajectory. This makes this method quite significant, especially when working with low-quality data.

* All the claims made by the authors are addressed through a comprehensive theoretical and empirical study. The paper is very well written; the notation is excellent, and all the details and formulas are clear.

* The experimental setup proposed is thorough. The paper analyzes how the modification of up to four state-of-the-art offline RL methods behaves across more than 25 different benchmarks.

* The theoretical analysis developed in Section 5 (and the corresponding annexes) is very robust and truly helps to understand what implementing HUBL entails.

### Weaknesses
 * For someone not already familiar with offline RL, it can be challenging to follow the comprehensive theoretical analysis developed in this paper, especially in the appendices. 

* This claim should be justified: "Despite their strengths, existing model-free offline RL methods also have a major weakness: they do not perform consistently." It would be fantastic if the authors could provide some evidences regarding this issue, as they do in section 3.2 (second to last paragrpah), but providing more details.

* In the experiments section I miss the learning curves where a reader can compare how the reward evolves with an without HUBL.

* I believe the manuscript needs a brief discussion on how the proposed model would be applied to problems with sparse rewards. For instance, in environments like Antmaze, has it been tested?

Minor comments:

-Section 4.1 HUBL introduce -> HUBL introduceS

### Questions
I've tried to detail most of the limitations and weaknesses of the proposed model in previous section, with some points that would need to be addressed in a rebuttal.

Overall, I see here a strong manuscript with some ideas that are adequate for an ICLR conference.

### Summary
The paper deals with offline RL. It focuses on Q-function based offline RL methods and presents a heuristic to increase the performance of these methods. In extensive experiments a performance increase is observed on average.

### Strengths
* The presentation is very good.  I would like to emphasize that the limitations mention both the restriction to trajectories and the lack of stochastic MDPs among the benchmarks used. This is exemplary. Also that already in the first sentence `We propose Heuristic Blending (HUBL), a simple performance-improving technique for a broad class of offline RL algorithms based on value bootstrapping` it is clearly stated to which class of algorithms the paper refers.
* The method is investigated as a modification of not just one, but four state of the art bootstrapping-based offline RL algorithms.

### Weaknesses
none

### Questions
No questions, but a few notes and comments:
* "methd" -> "method"

* At "Step 1: Computing heuristic ht" ht should be set boldmath, analogously in Step 2 and Step 3.

* At `Justin Fu, Aviral Kumar, Ofir Nachum, George Tucker, and Sergey Levine. D4rl: Datasets for deep
data-driven reinforcement learning, 2020` the indication where it was published is missing.

* In the references there are some unintentional lower case letters, e.g. mdp, Monte carlo.

* Just for completeness, I’d like to point out that there are also purely model-based batch/offline RL methods that do not use Q-function and are thus bootstrapping-free [1-4]. See [5] for a discussion. Since the authors have precisely formulated at the very beginning that this paper deals with the algorithm class with Q-function and bootstrapping, a mention of these bootstrapping-free algorithms is probably not necessary.

### Summary
The authors propose a technique known as Heuristic Blending (HUBL) to enhance the performance of model-free offline Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithms that are based on value bootstrapping. The primary aim of this approach is to mitigate the challenges associated with bootstrapping and achieve stable performance. 

HUBL essentially adapts the rewards and discount factor within the offline dataset utilized by the base offline RL algorithm. It achieves this by modifying the reward through a blending process, combining it with a state-specific heuristic derived from the Monte Carlo return of the behavior policy. It also reduces the discount factor discount factor. The degree of reduction in the discount factor and the reward blending is determined by a trajectory-dependent blending factor. This factor is designed to be high for trajectories in which the behavior policy performs well and low otherwise. 

The authors offer three distinct methods for selecting this blending factor. They support their algorithm with theoretical analysis and experimental results.

### Strengths
1. The proposed algorithm is simple and can be implemented with minimal overhead. 
2. The authors provide a complete theoretical analysis, and also conduct extensive experiments, on both deterministic and stochastic environments (although just one) . 
3. The paper is well written and easy to follow.

### Weaknesses
$	ilde{r}$ **dependence on the behavior policy may cause problems when data is collected using multiple behavior policies.**

Consider a dataset with data from a mixture of policies (say  the medium replay case in D4RL), and for simplicity suppose we assume  a constant lambda, say 0.5. Now, since the reward $	ilde{r}$ is conditioned on the behavior policy, doesn’t the effective MDP (reconstructed using the relabeled dataset) become non stationary? Is the performance not affected much due to the deterministic nature of the environments chosen for evaluation?

**Choosing $\lambda$ may not be straightforward**

The choice of $\lambda$ should be such that it is high for trajectories with high returns, and low otherwise. But this is hard to determine if the dataset consists of trajectories that perform equally well. This can be seen in results shown in figure 2, as significant improvement is seen on datasets with with a mixture of behavior policies because there is a way to determine the appropriate choice of $\lambda$ based on relative performance. Now, suppose you have a dataset with low rewards (the random variant in D4RL), then the ranking method will still assign high ranks to most trajectories, and this might result in poor performance as the Monte Carlo estimates using the behavior policy might cause instability.

### Questions
See weaknesses, in addition to them, 

1. Why is the training of a value function needed during step 2?
