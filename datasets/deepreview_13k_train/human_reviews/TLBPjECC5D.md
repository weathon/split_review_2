# Unlearning via Sparse Representations

- Decision: Reject
- Scores: 5, 6, 5, 5

## Abstract
Machine \emph{unlearning}, which involves erasing knowledge about a \emph{forget set} from a trained model, can prove to be 
costly and infeasible using existing techniques. We propose a 
low compute unlearning technique based on a
discrete representational bottleneck. We show that the proposed
technique efficiently unlearns the forget set and incurs negligible damage to the model's performance on the rest of the data set. We evaluate the proposed technique on the problem of \textit{class unlearning} using four datasets: CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, LACUNA-100 and ImageNet-1k. We compare the proposed technique to SCRUB, a state-of-the-art approach which uses knowledge distillation for unlearning. Across all three datasets, the  proposed technique performs as well as, if not better than SCRUB while incurring almost no computational cost.\looseness=-1

### Summary
This paper introduces a novel approach to machine unlearning, aiming to efficiently remove data from a trained model—a process known as "forgetting"—without the significant computational overhead typically associated with such tasks. The authors propose a zero-shot unlearning technique that utilizes a discrete representational bottleneck to erase specific knowledge of a forget set from a model. This technique is claimed to preserve the overall performance of the model on the remaining data.

### Strengths
**Writing**:
The paper's logic is clear, and it is easy to follow.

### Weaknesses
 - **Incremental Novelty**: While the application of concepts from DKVB [1] to the context of machine unlearning is interesting, it may appear as an incremental advance rather than a groundbreaking innovation. Nonetheless, the practical integration of these ideas to address real-world challenges is acknowledged as valuable and can sometimes be sufficient to make significant contributions to the field. (Minor points)

- **Comparative Analysis**: The paper could benefit from a broader comparison with existing work, particularly the zero-shot unlearning approach presented in [2]. Additionally, for the specific examples of unlearning demonstrated in Figure 3, it would be advantageous to include a wider range of baselines, as referenced in [3-6], to provide a more comprehensive evaluation of the proposed method.

- **Unlearning Scenarios**: The focus on 'complete unlearning' may limit the paper's scope, given the broader spectrum of unlearning scenarios presented in [2-7], where the goal is for the unlearned model to closely resemble a model that has been retrained without the forgotten data. Although the authors claim in Appendix D that their method is applicable to traditional machine unlearning problems, detailed results and discussions within these contexts would strengthen the paper's contributions.

- **Efficiency Metrics**: For claims regarding efficiency, the absence of reported running times is a noticeable omission. Including such metrics would substantiate the claims of the method's efficiency and offer a tangible comparison with other techniques.

- **Model Diversity**: The exclusive use of the ViT model in the experiments may raise questions about the method's generalizability. As DKVB [1] also considers ResNet architectures, a discussion on the application or limitation of the proposed method to other architectures would provide deeper insights into its adaptability and utility across various models.

- **Limited Literature Review**: Given the recent surge in research surrounding machine unlearning, the paper's literature review could be perceived as insufficiently comprehensive. I included some papers published recently in the following references.

### Questions
- Could you consider including the additional baselines identified as pertinent in Figure 3? This would help provide a comprehensive evaluation against a variety of existing methods.
- Would it be possible to provide more experimental results assessed against the conventional machine unlearning benchmarks, particularly those evaluating the similarity to a model retrained without the forget set?
- Can a comparison be drawn against the baseline referenced regarding zero-shot unlearning settings, as outlined in the weaknesses?
- Could you augment your experimental results with additional insights on how your technique performs on models within the ResNet family?
- Considering the broader discussion in the literature on the role of sparsity in machine unlearning, could you discuss how your approach aligns with or diverges from these concepts, specifically referring to studies [1-2]?

### Summary
EDIT: After reading the rebuttal, I have decided to raise my score. The techniques used in this work are not necessarily very novel, but it does manage to unlearn classes in a much more computationally efficient zero-shot manner than previous works. 

This paper studies the problem of unlearning where the task is to forget a set of concepts learned during training while retaining good performance on other concepts. The paper demonstrates that sparse representations can help decompose the concepts, making post-hoc unlearning amendable. Specifically, they train an architecture with a Discrete Key-Value Bottleneck which specifically induces sparse key-value pairs. Next, given training examples that correspond with a particular concept, they propose pruning away certain key-value pairs that light up the most for these examples. On image classification tasks CIFAR10/100 and and LACUNA-100, they show that this procedure can drop a particular class’s test accuracy to 0% while retaining the same performance on the remaining classes.

### Strengths
The paper demonstrates strong performance gains, and is computationally inexpensive. The method only requires forward passes since irrelevant key-value pairs are simply pruned unlike previous methods which utilize some form of negative gradients updates or knowledge distillation. 

The paper is generally an easy read and figures are clear.

### Weaknesses
In terms of novelty, I think it’s important to point out that this paper is a direct application of Discrete Key-Value Bottleneck (Trauble 2022). 
1. DKVB was proposed for class-incremental learning, and class unlearning is quite literally the inverse task. 
2. The original work also shows improvements on CIFAR10/100, the same benchmarks in this paper. 
3. DKVB improves class-incremental learning since each class can be learned by disjoint key-value pairs, thus the model updates for learning new classes can be localized to certain parameters. Thus, why DKVB would help with unlearning might be quite trivial – simply deleting the key-value pairs corresponding with a certain class. 

There are also a couple improvements that could be made to improve the quality of the paper.

1. The paper focuses on performance evaluation, but there’s a lack of empirical analysis of their conceptual motivation. For example, how often are key-value pairs shared between classes? Is it close to 0? Can this be visualized? Specifically, the paper does not analyze the sparsity of the learned key-value pairs, nor does it provide any analysis on the distribution of the learned keys and values. It is unclear if the learned keys are semantically meaningful or if the method is simply pruning random key-value pairs. 
2. A more diverse range of benchmarks is necessary to test the unlearning capabilities of DKVB. It’s unclear how successful the unlearning method is because the evaluation benchmarks are quite similar to each other (CIFAR10/100, LACUNA100). It might be interesting to evaluate the method on more diverse benchmarks such as benchmarks with outlier classes that are quite similar to each other, or training to distinguish between superclasses and unlearning a specific class in a superclass.

### Questions
1. “Zero-shot” is thrown around in the paper, but seems like the wrong terminology here and I am unsure what it is referring to exactly since their method and the baseline method SCRUB both require utilizing training examples. Maybe they mean something closer to “zero-order”. 
2. The authors choose to unlearn a class until 0% accuracy. Is this correct, or should you be unlearning up until random chance (10%)?
3. Section 5.4 was a bit unclear.
- What do you mean by “implications of additional compute”? Are you retraining the DKVB models for longer?
- What do you mean by “retraining”? In Figure 4, you state “retraining…using the proposed methods” (It says “proposed models” but I think you meant to say “proposed methods”?) What does it mean to retrain using SCRUB. Or is the SCRUB’ed model then retrained to learn the forgotten class just by normal supervised training? 
- It seems a bit strange that the performance would ever drop during retraining with SCRUB.

### Summary
Nonetheless, every approach to machine unlearning necessitates a substantial increase in computational resources to facilitate the unlearning process. In this scholarly work, the authors posit that neural information bottlenecks offer a highly efficient and precise method for unlearning. Their research demonstrates that this proposed technique effectively unlearns the specified data, causing minimal disruption to the model's performance on the remaining dataset. The researchers assess the effectiveness of their approach in the context of class unlearning, using three distinct datasets: CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and LACUNA100. They conduct a comparative analysis between their proposed technique and SCRUB, a state-of-the-art unlearning approach that employs knowledge distillation.

### Strengths
1. Zero Shot Unlearning.
2. Low computational cost
3. Model Specific only applicable to models with Discrete Key Value Bottleneck.

### Weaknesses
 1. Even though the whole motivation of this approach is to implement a new approach with better computational efficiency no experiments on computational cost are done. This approach is not measured with current approaches of class unlearning in terms of computational efficiency.

 2. The approach is model specific, relying on the presence of a Discrete Key Value Bottleneck. This significantly limits its applicability and generalizability compared to methods that can be applied to a wider range of architectures. It is unclear how this method would perform on models without this specific bottleneck structure. The restriction to models with a DKVB is a significant limitation, as many state-of-the-art models do not inherently possess this architecture. This limits the practical adoption of the proposed unlearning technique.

### Questions
1. Is this approach model agnostic? I am not sure if this can applied to other models if the bottleneck is not present.

3: You are fairly confident in your assessment. It is possible that you did not understand some parts of the submission or that you are unfamiliar with some pieces of related work. Math/other details were not carefully checked.

### Summary
In this paper, the authors propose a compute-free method for achieving class unlearning in deep models. Their method assumes that the model is trained with a Discrete Key-Value Bottleneck (DKVB) which maps input data to key-value pairs. By removing the key corresponding to a certain class, the model is no longer able to provide a correct classification for it.

### Strengths
- The method has virtually no computation overhead (just a few inference steps) 

- It does not introduce any new parameters

- It provides an effective way for unlearning an entire class from a pretrained classification model

### Weaknesses
 - Following Xu et al., 2023, the method falls in the "Weak Unlearning" category; meaning that the unlearning only affects the final activations of the models (in this case we can identify it with the DKVB).

- Connected to the point above, weak unlearning does not guarantee that the internal parameters of the model do not still encode information about the forget set after the unlearning. In the context of this paper, given that the backbone of the model is always kept frozen and no finetuning is necessary, one could argue that, if the pretraining is done on the same dataset (Tab E.1), the final model will still contain forget samples encoded in its weights. This of course is a matter of current research, however it also limits the applicability of the proposed method.

- I wonder if this method would be similar to taking a pretrained model (without DKVB) and then just either *i)* retraining the classification layer without the forget class or *ii)* masking out the forget class from the output logits. In both cases, I would find it difficult to call it "unlearning" but rather "obfuscation" of some kind, although I am not an expert in this field.

- Unlearning an entire class seems perhaps unrealistic in practice; whereas unlearning specific instances should be more relevant. 

- I think that the experimental evaluation is a bit lacking and could be expanded to larger datasets such as ImageNet, as the proposed method is almost compute-free

### Questions
- How does your method compare to SCRUB in terms of the categorization provided by Xu et al. ? 

- What information about the forget samples remain after removing the keys? 

- Could you provide some practical examples in which: 1) whole class unlearning is relevant 2) weak unlearning is acceptable under law requirements (e.g. GDPR) 

- Can your method unlearn just a subset of the forget class? e.g. perhaps by using denser keys in the DKVB? If so, some experiments presenting this result would greatly improve the impact of this work. 

- Would your method work also if the pretrain dataset is different from the target one? 

- Can you expand more on Sec.D of the Appendix, as I think it is relevant from a practical point of view?
