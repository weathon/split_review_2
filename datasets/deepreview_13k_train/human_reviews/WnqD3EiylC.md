## Abstract
<- trailing '%' for backward compatibility of .sty file
Quantifying the difference between probability distributions is crucial in machine learning. However, estimating statistical divergences from empirical samples is challenging due to unknown underlying distributions. This work proposes the representation Jensen-Shannon divergence (RJSD), a novel measure inspired by the traditional Jensen-Shannon divergence. Our approach embeds data into a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS), representing distributions through uncentered covariance operators. We then compute the Jensen-Shannon divergence between these operators, thereby establishing a proper divergence measure between probability distributions in the input space. We provide estimators based on kernel matrices and empirical covariance matrices using Fourier features. Theoretical analysis reveals that RJSD is a lower bound on the Jensen-Shannon divergence, enabling variational estimation. Additionally, we show that RJSD is a higher-order extension of the maximum mean discrepancy (MMD), providing a more sensitive measure of distributional differences. Our experimental results demonstrate RJSD's superiority in two-sample testing, distribution shift detection, and unsupervised domain adaptation, outperforming state-of-the-art techniques. RJSD's versatility and effectiveness make it a promising tool for machine learning research and applications.

### Summary
This work introduces a divergence between probability distributions by embedding them into a Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS) called the Representation Jensen-Shannon Divergence (RJSD). The proposed divergence satisfies symmetry, positivity and boundedness and is well defined. The RJSD is upper bounded by the standard JSD, a well studied object in information theory. The RJSD corresponding to a chosen kernel K involves the von Neumann entropy of the integral operators corresponding to these kernels.

The authors propose a computable finite sample estimator for the RJSD which involves computing the von Neumann entropies of some kernel matrices (which are dual objects to the aforementioned integral operators). As such the estimator is sound, since concentration properties of kernel integral operators have been well studied [1]. Furthermore O(n^3) is not insurmountable for a first probe to consider the usefulness of the divergence object considered.

However the authors do not present any statistical properties of the estimator. Instead, they proceed to study a further approximation of this object based on Random Fourier Features (RFF) based approximates for the kernels. This approximation is somewhat limited in its scope, and does not particularly behave well when the problem dimensions is large. This is a serious confounder to the various conclusions drawn from later experiments in the paper, and needs sufficient ablation.

### Strengths
The concept of the RJSD is novel and has not received sufficient attention so far. It is worth studying in its own right. The authors make a genuine effort to explore the relation of this object to previously known information theoretic quantities. The RJSD is also well estimable using concentration properties of the kernel integral operators and going forward may present a useful divergence between distributions.

The authors have established the relationships between the information theoretic objects well.

The experimental work in this paper is extensive.

### Weaknesses
The RFF based estimator is perhaps discussed too soon. I would have liked to read the properties and performance of the kernel matrix based estimator when O(n^3) is not really prohibitive. Typically we are able to compute eigendecompositions of upto 20-30K samples easily on modern laptops.

The authors say the estimator is "differentiable" in the introduction. Is this for the RFF estimator or the kernel matrix estimator. The differentiability for the kernel based estimator is not clear, and would be good to clarify.

The writing has a lot of room for improvement.
The following notational issues bothered (and confused) me while reading this paper.
1. curly brackets for {X, B_X} that defines measure space instead of the standard round brackets. Also appears above equation (8).
2. M_+^1(X) is complicated. Can you use a simpler notation say \mathcal{P} for the set of all distributions on (X, B_X)
3. is it true that phi(x) = K(x, .) since you are saying H is the RKHS corresponding to K. if phi is mapping into H then i think phi has to be K(x,.). If that is phi(x) is in some other Hilbert space H' (not necessarily the RKHS H) such that K(x,z) = <phi(x), phi(z)>_{H'} then is this sufficient. if by phi(x) you indeed meant K(x, .) then please clarify. This would then mean that C_P is the integral operator of the kernel which is a well studied object. (see [1] in summary), and provide some background on this operator.
4. "For the bounded kernel ... and trace class", is the boundedness only needed for the trace class? If so split this sentence into 2.
5. Is E[ K(X, X)] < inf necessary for the relation E[f(X)] = <f, mu_P>. I think it would hold even otherwise, just that both sides would be infinite.
6. In section 2.2 you say unit trace. Is this an assumption for everything that follows? Should all kernel matrices also be normalized to have unit trace? Regardless, if it is clear (or even nontrivial) as to what happens to the entropy when the trace is not unity, a clarification would be useful to the reader. I think this is the general relation: S(c * C_P) = c * S(C_P) + c * log (c). Please recall the fact that trace=1 is assumed anywhere else in the paper where that is used. Is the RJSD invariance to the scale of the kernel, eg if I use K1 = c * K, the RKHSs for K1 and K are the same but their norms are scaled versions of each other. How does this change the RJSD, if it doesnt make this clear.
7. In paragraph on covariance based estimator. Is this phi same as the phi? If not please use a different letter. Next please write an equation that describes a shift invariant kernel. Unless that is used the formula for p(w) using Bochners thoerem is not clear because till then kappa is a bivariate function. Use a different function name in that formula to avoid confusion. Also state that w_i are iid samples from p(w). Also use a different letter for phi_w since phi is already used in Section 2.1 for something else. State at the end of this paragraph how to choose D (perhaps point to Theorem 2)
8. Formally define entropy H and cross-entropy H(P,Q) otherwise Theorem 1 doesnt make any sense. Also is this differential entropy, please state this clearly. Differential entropy doesnt enjoy all the properties that entropy from information theory does. eg it can be negative.
9. In definition 1 you use K(x,x)=1 but that is not true when you are using trace(C_P) = 1. Please make sure things are consistent here.
Next in this definition, please use a different letter than P for the LHS. It is very confusing to see P both on the left and right side. This issue complicates things further when you are assuming some phi* exists in Theorem 3. Theorem 3 was incomprehensible and needs a significant edit after definition 1 has new notation for the LHS.
10. In Theorem 3 which space does phi* lie in. Please again use a different letter here. phi has been overloaded by being used 3 times at this point in the paper.
11. Theorem 5 has a ||.||* which is undefined. Here again you are using K(x,x)=1, does that clash with trace=1. Also formally define MMD_K clearly before stating the lemma. I feel Theorem 5 should just have 2 objects RJSD >= MMD. the other objects can be pushed to the proof.
12. Avoid using pi1 and pi2, it would perhaps be easier to read with the N/(N+M).
13. Section 4, is the omega in phi_w o f_w same for phi and w? It seems weird that the networks earlier and last layers have the same parameterization
14. Figure 1, please mention that the black line is for the closed form expressions between the Cauchy distributions. Please also mention in the caption why the steps are appearing, ie, because you are manually changing the parameters of the distributions at those points. Related to this, please give full forms of the different estimators you have used. 
15. Figure 3, doesnt really add much value as such. What are we supposed to make of these letters? Are they good?

The comment about the kernel learning strategy is important, but mentioned in a fleeting manner. Please either elaborate on this or avoid it.

### Summary
The paper introduces a novel divergence measure, coined representation Jensen-Shannon Divergence (RJSD). The contributions of the paper, as outlined by the authors, are primarily theoretical and can be summarized as follows:

* The introduction of a new type of divergence that avoids the need for density estimation.
* A method of estimating empirical covariance matrices needed for divergence computation.
* Establishing a connection between RJSD and other measures of discrepancy and tools in information theory.

The authors conducted a series of experiments to empirically demonstrate the usefulness of RJSD in constructing two-sample tests and in other machine learning applications.

### Strengths
The underlying mathematical concept of this divergence is intriguing and, as far as I know, original. In my opinion, the key insight can be easily grasped by contrasting different summary statistics derived from finite-dimensional kernels or random Fourier features. One common approach for comparing distributions involves evaluating empirical mean embeddings using L2 distance or calculating Hotelling's t-squared statistics. In contrast, the proposed method suggests using the traces of the covariance matrix of random features. While a significant portion of the paper is dedicated to demonstrating that this approach indeed results in a valid divergence, it intuitively makes sense that the trace can serve as a useful summary statistic.

### Weaknesses
A hard question seems to be why RJSD outperforms the "Learning Deep Kernels for Non-Parametric Two-Sample Test" experimentally or establishing the relationship between its power and power of MMD-like algorithms. To explore the latter, a promising starting point could be a comparison with "Interpretable Distribution Features with Maximum Testing Power," particularly without optimizing random Fourier features, employing identical random features for both tests and using only a small number of features.

Generally, I would appreciate a qualitative discussion around the situations in which a test relying on RSJD should be used over the alternative tests. Without practical guidance, this approach might be perceived as an academic novelty.

### Summary
In this paper, a new notion of diferegence between probability distributions is introduced.
This notion is similar to the well studied quantum version of Jensen-Shannon divergence. 
The construction is as follows:
1)  A new entropy notion of a single distribution is defined by taking the von Neumann entropy of the 
covariance matrix of the data in a given RKHS.  
2) The Jensen-Shannon divergence of a pair of is based solely on the entropy notion, and so a corresponding notion can be defined based on the entropy above. 

Two main things are proved: 
1)  A relation between the new JS divergence and the classical (non quantum) one. 
  In particular, the the classical dominates the new one, for any properly normalised kernels. 
  Some cases of equality are outlined. 
2) A sort of consistency result, for the case when the kernel is approximated (to reduce computation), based on existing results for the actual kernel and the existing approximation results. 

Small dataset experiments are performed to demonstrate the usability of the new notion for data generation 
and for two point tests.

### Strengths
This is mostly a well written and well executed paper. 
The subject of developing diveregnce notions between probability distributions, which are useful and easily computable, is important throughout machine learning. 
The particular notion introduced in this paper is natural and should be studied.

### Weaknesses
 The paper would have been much stronger if the performance improvement over MMD had been shown more clearly.  As it stands, there is a rather small performance gain, and it is not completely clear why.   

I also have a question on the theory. 

 
Q1) 

Regarding the theory, how important is the requirement in def. 2 that the kernel should satisfy $k(x,x)=1$?  On the one hand, it is easy to arrange. On the other hand, it seems that consistency results require **probability normalized** Gaussain kernels (i.e. integrate to 1, so the Parzen estimator would be a density), and these have $k(x,x) \righrarrow \infty$ with $\gamma \rightarrow \infty$.    Thus it appears the method would not compute the true  JSD.  Please comment. 
 Note that MMD does not have such problems. 

Q1.1)  

I'm using $\gamma \rightarrow \infty$ above to be consistent with the paper. However, for standard definitions of scale, one should have $\gamma \rightarrow 0$ instead. Is this a typo? What definition of kernel and scale is being used? 


Q2) 


In the data generating experiment, the formulation (16) is not a GAN, as the authors note themselves. 
To me, it is much more simular to a VAE, perhaps an Wasserstein VAE. Thus I'm not sure why a copmarison to GAN's is being made, these results do not seem to be  informative.  The comparson should be with VAE, and with MMD based ones such as InfoVAE. 
 
Q3)


 Results on two sample tests: 
In Table 3, there is no clear advatage of RJSD-D, over MMD-D, as the gaps at (400,500) are very small. 

Results in Figure 4 do show an advantage of RJSD-D over MMD-D, but this is not a large advantage in almost all cases.  While it is interesing, this can hardly justify a new information notion. I'd suggest either performing additional experiments, or analysing the current ones in more detail, to see why RJSD performs better.


EDIT: The proof of Theorem 2 is vague and does not state clearly which result from  (Dmitriev & Tarasenko, 1974) is used. I believe their results can only be applied when the kernel is normalised. Since it is not normalised, Theorem 2 does not apply as stated.

### Summary
This paper proposes a novel metric, the representation Jensen-Shannon divergence (RJSD), betweeen probability distributions. RJSD generalizes quantum Jensen-Shannon divergence to the covariance of a (potentially infinite-dimensional) RKHS embedding of the data. A few different estimators of RJSD are proposed. A simple experiment on synthetic data demonstrates the consistency of these estimators. Then, several experiments (on mostly synthetic data) demonstrate the utility of RJSD for (a) training GANs to avoid mode collapse and (b) nonparametric two-sample testing.

### Strengths
The paper presents a theoretically interesting new metric that relates RKHS embeddings with standard information-theoretic quantities. Experiments are performed on several different problems to illustrate the utility of this new quantity and its estimators.

### Weaknesses
**Major**

1. The paper frequently uses notation and terminology that has not been previously defined, and seems to assume some familiarity with quantum mechanics/quantum information theory. Reading this paper with backgrounds in information theory and in functional analysis, but not in quantum information theory, I think I was able to make the right educated guesses to understand most of what the paper is doing, but this guesswork shouldn't be necessary to read the paper, and I don't think this would be accessible to much of the ICLR community.
    *   Equation (2): What is $\otimes$? It seems like an outerproduct, but it's not clear. Specifically, the paper should clarify whether this refers to the tensor product of operators or another operation in this context.
    *   Bra-ket notation is used for inner products (e.g., in Definition 1 and Theorem 4) without any introduction. I happen to have heard of this notation, but have never seen it in a paper, and doubt many people in ICLR are familiar with it. A brief explanation or a reference to a standard text explaining this notation would be helpful.
    *   Theorem 5: It's unclear what the norms $||\cdot||*$ and $||\cdot||_{\text{HS}}$ are. The paper should explicitly define these as the nuclear norm and the Hilbert-Schmidt norm, respectively.
    *   Section 3, just before Definition 2, "The Quantum counterpart of the Jensen-Shannon divergence (QJSD) between density matrices $\rho$ and $\sigma$ is defined as... where $S(\cdot)$ is von Neumann’s entropy.": What is a "density matrix"? The paper should provide a definition or a reference for this term.
    *   Page 4, First Sentence: The univariate function $H$ is never defined; only the bivariate cross-entropy function was introduced in Eq. (6). The paper should explicitly define $H(P)$ as the Shannon entropy.

2. I don't understand the point of much of Section 2 (Background). For example, Theorems 1 and 2 are never referenced or related to the remainder of the paper. These theorems seem to relate kernel-based entropy estimation to Shannon's differential entropy, but this connection is not made explicit. I suggest reducing some of this material to make space for (a) clear definitions of the notation used throughout the paper and (b) further motivation and details regarding the experiments in Section 5.

3. The abstract and contributions section both claim that the paper presents consistency and convergence rate guarantees for the proposed estimators, but I couldn't find any of these guarantees in the paper. The only guarantee presented (Theorem 2) applies only for finite-dimensional feature representations ($D < \infty$), so it doesn't seem to apply to the new estimators proposed. The paper should either provide these guarantees or clarify that they are not included.

4. Given the lack of supporting theoretical results (previous point), I was not very convinced by the experimental results. All of them are on simple, mostly synthetic datasets. While RJSD does perform well on many of the tasks, the improvements are mostly small, and, more importantly, there is no discussion of *why* RJSD might perform better than other metrics on these tasks. The paper should provide a more thorough analysis of the experimental results, including a discussion of the conditions under which RJSD is expected to outperform other metrics.

5. Section 5.3 only presents the average power of various tests, and I didn't see any evidence that the tests obey their nominal significance levels. The paper should provide evidence that the tests maintain their nominal significance levels, for example, by reporting the empirical Type I error rates.

**Minor**

1. Page 2, Second Bullet, "An estimator from empirical covariance matrices.... Additionally, an estimator based on kernel matrices... Consistency results and sample complexity bounds for the proposed estimator are derived.": It's unclear here which of the two estimators the consistency results and sample complexity bounds apply to. Please clarify the wording here.

2. Page 5, just after Theorem 5, "From this result we should expect RJSD to be at least as efficient as MMD for identifying discrepancies between distributions": To give contextualize this statement, perhaps it should be noted that, among proper metrics between probability distributions, MMD is quite weak [1,2].

### Questions
**Minor**

1) Abstract: "Our approach embeds the data in an reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS)... Therefore, we name this measure the representation Jensen-Shannon divergence (RJSD).": I didn't understand the use of "Therefore" here; i.e., how does the second sentence follow from the first?

2) Page 2, Last Sentence, "If we normalize the matrix $K_X$ such that, Tr$(K_X) = 1$...": There are many ways such normalization could be performed. Is this done by scaling (i.e., replacing $K_X$ with $\frac{K_X}{\text{Tr}(K_X)}$)? If so, this should be clearer.

3) Page 3, Last Two Sentences, "Let $\hat P_\gamma(x)$ be the empirical kernel density function by a Gaussian kernel with scale parameter $\gamma$. Dmitriev & Tarasenko (1974) demonstrate that $H(\hat P_\gamma)$ converges to $H(\mathbb{P})$ as both, $N$ and $\gamma \to \infty$, with probability one.": I was quite confused by the meaning of $\gamma$ here. Typically, for the kernel density estimate (KDE) to be consistent, the bandwidth (which I think of as synonymous with the "scale parameter") should shrink (approach $0$, not $\infty$). Does "scale parameter" here mean the reciprocal of the bandwidth (i.e., the "precision" of the Gaussian)? Also, are there no additional assumptions required here? For example, consistency of the KDE requires that the bandwidth $h$ not shrink too quickly (e.g., $N h^d \to \infty$).

4) Page 5, Equation (12): Typo: I think $D_{JS}$ should be $D_{JS}^\phi$, correct?

5) I don't understand why the exponential moving average (EMA) is applied in Section 5.1, as this doesn't tell us anything about the performance of RJSD and many of the baseline compared could similarly be modified to up-weight recent data.

6) How exactly is the RJSD metric utilized for two-sample testing in Section 5.3? Usually, either a permutation test or an analytically derived asymptotic null distribution is used, but I didn't see any explanation of this.

### Summary
This paper studies kernel-based divergence and applications. Firstly, the probability distribution P is mapped to the non-central covariance matrix, C_P. Then, the corresponding probability density P_phi is defined from C_P. From such transformed probability distributions, the standard cross entropy and discrepancy measure called representation Jensen-Shannon divergence (RJSD) on probability distributions is defined. The authors investigated the relationship between discrepancy measures for C_P and that for P_phi. The random Fourier feature is employed to derive a tractable method of computing RJSD. The authors provide a theoretical analysis of the empirical estimation for the RJSD. Various numerical experiments indicate the statistical reliability of learning methods using the RJSD.

### Strengths
- The authors proposed a computationally efficient method to estimate the RJSD using the conjugate representation of the covariance matrix and the random Fourier feature.
- The authors established the theoretical analysis of the convergence rate of the proposed estimator for the kernel-based discrepancy measure.
- Some interesting and useful inequalities are derived. 
- As applications of RJSD, the authors conducted various numerical experiments.

### Weaknesses
 - The proposed divergence measure, RJSD, is regarded as a discrepancy measure for normalized kernel embeddings using the kernel function, kappa square. I think that there is no clear reason why the kernel embedding should be normalized to be a probability density. One could assess the discrepancy between unnormalized kernel embeddings by divergences for unnormalized functions, (pseudo-)distance measures, etc. What is the benefit of thinking of the normalization or the mapping to the set of probability densities for the non-negative kernel embeddings? 

- In numerical experiments, the authors observed that learning algorithms based on the proposed divergence measure outperform existing methods. However, any insight into the numerical results is not sufficiently mentioned. For example, GAN using RJSD is found to be robust to the mode collapse. What makes the RJSD so reliable? 

- The data size in numerical experiments is not necessarily large. When the proposed method is used for larger data set, how much is the computation cost?
