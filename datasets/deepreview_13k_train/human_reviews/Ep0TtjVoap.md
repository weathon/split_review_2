- Scores: 8, 8, 5, 6

## Abstract
Large language models have made significant progress in various language tasks, yet they still struggle with complex mathematics.
In this paper, we propose \model{}, a series of \underline{To}ol-integrated \underline{R}easoning \underline{A}gents designed to solve challenging mathematical problems by seamlessly integrating natural language reasoning with the utilization of external tools (e.g., computation libraries and symbolic solvers), thereby amalgamating the analytical prowess of language and the computational efficiency of tools.
To train \model{}, we curate interactive tool-use trajectories on mathematical datasets, apply imitation learning on the annotations, and propose output space shaping to further refine models' reasoning behavior.
As a result, \model{} models significantly outperform open-source models on 10 mathematical reasoning datasets across all scales with 13\%-19\% absolute improvements on average.
Notably, \model{}-7B reaches 44.6\% on the competition-level dataset MATH, surpassing the best open-source model WizardMath-70B by 22\% absolute.
\codemodel{}-34B is also the first open-source model that achieves an accuracy exceeding 50\% on MATH, which significantly outperforms GPT-4's CoT result, and is competitive with GPT-4 solving problems with programs.}.\looseness=-1

### Summary
The authors present a framework for improving mathematical reasoning by combining natural language descriptions with program synthesis and execution. A hybrid tool-integrated reasoning context is used to sample candidate reasoning trajectories for the GSM8K and MATH datasets. Candidate trajectories are then verified and those that are successful are added to the ToRA corpus. This corpus is used to fine-tune intermediate models. Such models are then employed as in the initial setting to sample candidate trajectories with feedback from teacher correction to aid the completion of partial trajectories. This final set of valid trajectories is used for further fine-tuning and finally producing the ToRA fleet of models, extended from the LLaMA-2 and CodeLLaMA base families. The resulting models show considerable performance boosts on a range of diverse mathematical reasoning datasets.

### Strengths
The idea is clear, well-constructed, and well-explained. The figures are excellent and the algorithm is clearly laid out. The resulting models show considerable performance increases under a range of evaluation settings confirming the efficacy of the strategy.

### Weaknesses
While the authors have presented what worked well, there is a considerable amount to be gleaned from the failure modes. The authors loosely allude to failure cases including geometric problems and program timeouts, and provide single examples in the appendix, but there are surely more interesting patterns. It would be wonderful if the authors could provide more specific examples and comment on more systematic classes of errors beyond these simple categorizations. For example, are there certain patterns in the natural language specification of the original problem or rationale construction that fail to formalize well as programs? Were the patterns informative in terms of which problems were amenable to imitation learning vs which required output space shaping in order to produce initial valid reasoning trajectories?

### Questions
As noted above, additional discussion of failure modes would be beneficial.

### Summary
This paper introduces TORA (Tool-integrated Reasoning Agents), which seamlessly integrates natural language reasoning with external tools to solve complex mathematical problems. By combining language models' analytical capabilities with computational efficiency tools, TORA significantly outperforms open-source models on 10 mathematical reasoning datasets.

### Strengths
1.This paper proposes a two-stage training framework that utilizes training data alternating between natural language and code language to enhance the reasoning ability of language models in mathematical reasoning tasks. The experimental results demonstrate the significant improvement of this approach across 10 datasets.

2.The paper is generally well-written and the figures and tables presented are clear and easy to understand.

### Weaknesses
1.From Figure 5, it can be observed that the performance of the model does not significantly decrease when output space shaping is removed. More experiments are needed to demonstrate whether the performance improvement in this stage is due to this training strategy rather than additional data and more training epochs.

2.Regarding the TORA-corpus proposed in this paper, more detailed information is needed regarding the data construction process, quality evaluation, and dataset statistics.

### Questions
1.It appears that the method proposed in this paper shows more significant improvements on smaller models, as the performance of the 7B, 13B, and 70B models shown in Figure 1 does not appear to differ significantly. How to explain this phenomenon?

2.The alternating reasoning approach between natural language and tool usage proposed in this paper is fundamentally similar to the plan paradigm of Thought, Action, and Observation alternation in REACT [1]. Do you think this paradigm will become the dominant paradigm for agents to solve complex reasoning problems?

### Summary
This paper introduces TORA,
 a series of Tool-integrated Reasoning Agents designed to enhance mathematical problem-solving by combining natural language reasoning with external tools. TORA models are trained using interactive tool-use trajectories, employing imitation learning and output space shaping techniques. Experimental results demonstrate that TORA outperforms open-source models on various mathematical reasoning datasets.

### Strengths
- The paper is easy to follow
- TORA achieves good performance on math datasets

### Weaknesses
 - **Limited of technical novelty**: 
  - Using imitation learning to improve the mathematical reasoning ability of open-source models has been proposed in many recent works, e.g.,
    - Scaling relationship on learning mathematical reasoning with large language models, https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.01825
    - WizardMath: Empowering Mathematical Reasoning for Large Language Models via Reinforced Evol-Instruct, https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.09583
    - MetaMath: Bootstrap Your Own Mathematical Questions for Large Language Models, https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.12284
    - MAmmoTH: Building Math Generalist Models through Hybrid Instruction Tuning, https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.05653
  - At the Output Space Shaping step, the authors use nucleus sampling to generate more reasoning paths and pick the corrected paths. This is a technique widely used in the works listed above. The only difference is that this paper fixes some of the preceding portions of wrong trajectories, while existing works resample the whole trajectory. However, validating which portions of trajectories are correct is very challenging, and the authors need to **enumerate** possible preceding portions of wrong trajectories, which is time-consuming. In my opinion, the existing method (i.e., re-sampling and picking the correct paths) is simpler and may be more effective.

- **Concerns on reproducibility**: As training data are not provided, reviewers and readers can't check the reproducibility of this paper. Note that existing works like WizardMath, MetaMath, and MAmmoTH have released their training data for the community to reproduce their results. Moreover, checkpoints of TORA are not provided in the appendix for checking reproducibility.


- "TORA outperforms WizardMath by around 45% in Algebra and Number Theory, **which is attributed to stimulating and shaping tool-use behavior**." From Table 3, we cannot conclude that the better performance of TORA is due to stimulating and shaping tool-use behavior, as 
WizardMath uses augmented data **from LLaMA**, while TORA uses data generated **from GPT-4**. Note that GPT-4 is much more powerful than LLaMA. 

- In section 2.2, greedy decoding is used for generating trajectories from GPT-4. Thus, only one path per question can be obtained in TORA-CORPUS dataset. In my opinion, the accuracy of LLaMA trained on TORA-CORPUS has yet to saturate (e.g., plot the accuracy w.r.t. #samples of TORA-CORPUS).  To generate more trajectories, a simple approach (which is widely used in the above works) is to use temperature sampling (rather than greedy decoding)  and pick the correct ones for training.

- As temperature sampling can generate more samples from GPT-4, TORA-CORPUS can be more diverse (compared with greedy decoding). To verify the effectiveness of Output Space Shaping in Section 3.5.2, it is better to **augment more data from GPT-4 and let the accuracy of LLaMA trained on the TORA-CORPUS saturates first**. Otherwise, it is difficult to say whether the improvement of LLaMA is from more training data or the proposed Output Space Shaping.

- Ablation study of hyperparameter $n$ (maximum rounds). in experiments, $n=3$ is used. Question: is the performance of TORA sensitive to $n$?

- writing:
  - "forward and backward reasoning, as well as result verification": references for forward/backward reasoning, verification
  - "Addressing these challenges requires complex symbolic reasoning over algebraic expressions": references for symbolic reasoning 
  - where is the definition of $\theta$ in (4)?

### Questions
- In the Conclusion section, the authors mention that "our systematic analysis ... paving the way for the development of more advanced and versatile reasoning agents". **How and why does this analysis pave the way?** 
- What is the difference between Tool-Integrated Reasoning (Algorithm 1) and existing methods (e.g., PAL (Gao et al., 2022), PoT (Program of Thoughts Prompting: Disentangling Computation from Reasoning for Numerical Reasoning Tasks, https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.12588))?
- "For numerical values, we perform **rounding**, while for expressions, we employ **sympy** for parsing." Are these two techniques used in the baseline methods? 

- Are there any empirical results can support the ``Output Space Shaping improves **diversity**''. Furthermore, the diversity measure is not defined in the paper.

### Summary
The paper presents ToRA, a method of utilising interleaved reasoning and tool-use traces to improve language models' capability in mathematics. The authors used GPT-4 to get a collection of interactive tool-use trajectories for mathematical problem solving, and fine-tuned open-sourced language models on this collection to improve their performance.

### Strengths
- The performance gains on the downstream mathematical reasoning benchmarks is impressive.
- The ablation studies convincingly proved the necessity of both the rationale and the program parts of the ToRA pipeline.

### Weaknesses
 - Adopting complicated mathematical fonts when unnecessary only takes from the readability of the paper. There is no need to use them when the default fonts suffice.

### Questions
How should we improve upon ToRA? Since the pipeline relies on a proprietary model to generate the dataset, and the final performance of the strongest ToRA is still inferior to GPT-4, how can we further improve?
