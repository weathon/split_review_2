## Abstract
Diffusion models represent an emerging topic in generative models and have demonstrated remarkable results in generating data with high quality and diversity. However, diffusion models suffer from two limitations (1) the notorious problem of computational burden such as large sampling step and train step needed due to directly diffusion in Euclidean space and (2) a global-structure representation for each sample that is implicitly considered in the process due to their very limited access to topological information. To mitigate these limitations, recent studies have reported that topological descriptors, which encode shape information from datasets across different scales in a topological space, can significantly improve the performance and stability of deep learning (DL). In this study, inspired by the success of topological data analysis (TDA), we propose a novel denoising diffusion model, i.e., Topo-Diffusion, which improves classical diffusion models by diffusing data in topology domain and sampling from reconstructing topological features. Within the Topo-Diffusion framework, we investigate whether local topological properties and higher-order structural information, as captured via persistent homology, can serve as a reliable signal that provides complementary information for generating a high-quality sample. Theoretically, we analyze the stability properties of persistent homology allow to establish the stability of generated samples over diffusion timesteps. We empirically evaluate the proposed Topo-Diffusion method on seven real-world and synthetic datasets, and our experimental results show that Topo-Diffusion outperforms benchmark models across all the evaluation metrics in fidelity and diversity of sampled synthetic data.

### Confidence
2: You are willing to defend your assessment, but it is quite likely that you did not understand the central parts of the submission or that you are unfamiliar with some pieces of related work. Math/other details were not carefully checked.

### Summary
The manuscript integrates topological data analysis (TDA) into diffusion models for point cloud and image generation. The model is called Topo-Diffusion.

### Strengths
I could not find any previous work integrating TDA and diffusion models in this manner, so props for creativity. The results uniformly seem improved.

### Weaknesses
The paper is not very clearly written and could do with one more round after this one (if it does not make it this time). Suggestions for the rewrite.

1. Persistent homology (PH) etc. are well established in TDA
2. We need to include this information in the forward and back processes in diffusion
3. There are technical challenges that need to be overcome.
4. Forward process: list and qualitatively explain the technical challenges and the approach taken
5. Reverse reconstruction: do the same
6. Explain the payoff

### Questions
What happened to the ELBO-based approximation at the heart of the diffusion process. Does it get modified when you include PH information. Use https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.00848 to explain if necessary.

### Summary
This work introduces Topo-Diffusion, a new denoising diffusion model that efficiently incorporates local topological information. 
This works claims the first one that brings the concepts of persistent homology and topological representation learning to diffusion generative models, providing theoretical stability guarantees and improved performance on point clouds and real-world images.

### Strengths
The derive theoretical stability guarantees of the proposed topological features of generated data. 
Extensive empirical evaluations on both point cloud and read images demonstrate that TopoDiffusion yields state-of-the-art performances.

### Weaknesses
Experiments on more complex real world images and point cloud dataset is missing, and current results are limited to toy examples like MNIST and simple point cloud structure.

### Questions
refer to the weakness session, I wonder the performance on more complex dataset like shapenet point cloud.

### Summary
In this manuscript, a novel diffusion model known as Topo-Diffusion has been proposed. In this model, the topological properties of the data are extracted, and the diffusion process is done within the topological domain. More specifically, by using the persistent homology, both local topological properties and global structural information can be characterized and served as a reliable signal for generating a high-quality sample. The author(s) also provide a theoretical prove of the stability properties of the model. Finally, the mode has been tested on seven real-world and synthetic datasets. It has been found that Topo-Diffusion can outperforms classical diffusion models in various evaluation metrics.

### Strengths
This manuscript is to propose a novel diffusion model, known as Topo-Diffusion, which is to employ the classical diffusion model in the special topological domain and sample from reconstructed topological features. The key innovation is to identify data structural features through a topological degrading and reconstruction process and further use them for data generation in the diffusion model.

### Weaknesses
Even though TDA is very powerful in characterizing the structural topological information, either local or global, it has limitations in the detailed description of local geometric features. It seems that the current model is more suitable for data with strong topological properties but may fall short when the detailed geometric information also plays an important role.

1) The author(s) claim that “we introduce two persistence point transformation methods (see Eq. 2), i.e., (i) birth-lifespan transformation and (ii) differentiable distribution transformation”. These transformation methods “can transform a PD (i.e., a multi-set of persistence points) into a topological feature vector or function which can be easily integrated into any type of models”. However, all the transformation methods used in the paper are just standard Betti curve, persistent landscape, and persistent image. In fact, the so called “birth-lifespan transformation and differentiable distribution transformation” are just rename or summarization of existing methods. In fact, the vectorization of PD is a hot research area and various models have been proposed, including Barcode statistics, Algebraic functions and tropical functions, Binning approach, Persistent codebook, Persistent paths and signature features, 2D/3D representation, etc. Various topological kernels have also been developed. A detailed discussion of these models can be found in various review papers, such as, 
Pun, Chi Seng, Kelin Xia, and Si Xian Lee. "Persistent-Homology-based Machine Learning and its Applications--A Survey." arXiv preprint arXiv:1811.00252 (2018).

The authors should not overclaim their contributions and properly cite the related works. 

2) The author(s) state that “A notable benefit of the birth-lifespan transformation is its parameter-free definition. This parameter-free Birth-lifespan transformation thus eliminates the necessity for any adjustments, negating the potential for overfitting”.  This is not proper! The transformation can only generate a continuous function, which needs to be further discretized or vectorized. The size of the final topological vector depends on the the process of discretization, and it can be very large if a refined mesh or grid is used!  In contract, if Barcode statistics model or Algebraic functions are employed, the final topological vectors are always of limited sizes. In this way, they are really “parameter-free”. 

3) Figure 19 is very weird. The barcode is not consistent with the data! For instance, in the second simplicial complex (from left to right), it contains 7 0-dim homology generators, but the number of the corresponding 0-dim barcodes is just 6! Further, in the third simplicial complex (from left to right), it also contains 7 0-dim homology generators, but the number of the corresponding 0-dim barcodes is just 1! Moreover, it contains only 2 1-dim homology generators, but the number of the corresponding 1-dim barcodes is 3!

4) Page 4, “where $K$ denotes the maximum dimension of simplices of $x_t$”. Normally the dimension of PD can be different from the highest order of simplices. 

5) The citations in the paper are very messy.  For instance, Page 1, “Gao et al. Gao et al. propose”; Page 2, “Liu et al. Liu et al. (2019)”…
