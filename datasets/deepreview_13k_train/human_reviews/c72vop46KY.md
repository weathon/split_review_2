# CogVLM: Visual Expert for Large Language Models

- Decision: Reject
- Scores: 5, 6, 6, 6

## Abstract
We introduce CogVLM, a powerful open-source visual language foundation model.
Different from the popular \emph{shallow alignment} method which maps image features into the input space of language model, CogVLM bridges the gap between the frozen pretrained language model and image encoder by a trainable visual expert module in the attention and FFN layers. As a result, CogVLM enables a deep fusion of vision language features without sacrificing any performance on NLP tasks. 
CogVLM-17B achieves state-of-the-art performance on 17 classic cross-modal benchmarks, including 1) image captioning datasets: NoCaps, Flicker30k, 2) VQA datasets: OKVQA, TextVQA, OCRVQA, ScienceQA, 3) LVLM benchmarks: MM-Vet, MMBench, SEED-Bench, LLaVABench, POPE, MMMU, MathVista, 4) visual grounding datasets: RefCOCO, RefCOCO+, RefCOCOg, Visual7W.

### Summary
In this paper, the authors studied multimodal LLM and pushed the limit of multimodal LLM by developing a new module called Visual Expert for LLMs. Along with the new model design, the authors curated a large-scale pretraining and instruction-tuning data for the model training. When evaluated on a wide range of vision-language tasks, the proposed model CogVLM exhibits outstanding performance across the board, and surpass models with even much larger size.

### Strengths
1. The authors argued that most of the previous multimodal LLMs used shallow connections between vision and models, and thus proposed a new module called visual expert. This new module prompts a more intimate interaction between visual and language tokens in LLMs.

2. The authors curated a large-scale dataset for first-stage pretraining and second-stage instruction tuning. Based on the large-scale training data and the proposed visual expert module, the proposed method achieves a number of state-of-the-art results across a wide range of vision-language tasks.

3. Finally, a number of ablation studies are performed and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method to some extent.

### Weaknesses
The main concern to me about this paper is its limited novelty and scientific merit. First of all, the dense interaction between vision and language tokens has been heavily studied prior to the so-called multimodal LLM era. For example, a lot of BERT-style models exploit dense interactions. Second, it is really hard to capture which part is really making the main contribution to the final performance. There are many confounding factors such as the number and type of pretraining data, the instruction-tuning data, different architecture designs, and finetuning strategies. According to Table 6, I can hardly see a clear improvement brought by the introduced new VE modules. The authors start with some good motivation for building more intimate interaction between vision and language, but it finally becomes the emphasis of the benefit of scaling up.

Another missed piece of this work is what we can learn from this work. The state-of-the-art performance should be appreciated. But from the paper, I can hardly tell what the researchers should proceed to further improve the performance. Do we need better model design, or more data and computations? As mentioned in the paper, the authors also used some in-house data, which I guess cannot be released to the public. Given the barrier of reproducing the reported results and also the limited insights delivered by this work, I am sharing a huge concern regarding the current trend of building multimodal LLMs manifested by this work or other related ones.

### Questions
As I mentioned above, I have some concerns regarding the scientific merit of this work. I appreciate the effort of pushing the limit of open-sourced multimodal LLMs but do see some potential issues with the current trend of scaling up multimodal LLMs. Given the current state of this paper, I think it is a very good engineering work, but may not be suitable to this research venue.

### Summary
This paper presents CogVLM, a new state-of-the-art vision-language model. To address some issues of previous shallow alignment methods, the authors propose to insert visual expert modules in pretrained language model. Extensive experiments are conducted to evaluate CogVLM, and several SOTA results are achieved.

### Strengths
- Strong performance. As tables in the submission, CogVLM shows strong performance compared to other models of equal magnitude. It also exhibits competitive results compared to PaLI-X which has much more parameters.
- Open Source. Open source multimodal fundation model with strong performance has significant impact on the whole society.
- Extensive experiments from different angles and extensive ablation studies. The authors evaluate the superiority of CogVLM in various different kinds of benchmarks (e.g., caption, VQA, text-oriented VQA, grounding, instruction following and etc.).

### Weaknesses
 - The perhaps biggest weakness with this paper is the writing.
  - This paper starts by raising two possible drawbacks of shallow alignment methods: (i) converge fast but perform worse. (ii) weak visual understanding ability, expecially hallucination. However, both these two disadvantages proposed by the authors are just **hypothesises**, not **compelling** nor **conclusive**. First, the performance gap between BLIP-2 and PaLI-X cames from several possible differences between two framework (e.g., the visual encoder size, the way that visual encoder is pre-trained by). And both MiniGPT-4 and LLAVA have extremely little trainable parameters in the alignment between visual features and language features.
  - Some blanket statements are used. For instance, the author claims that NLP ability is weakened when jointly train the language model in image-text training. However, there are some evidences show that jointly training can benefit both vision task as well as language task, at least in some aspect (e.g., [1]).
  - The motivations and starting points are inconsistent with the experiments. In other words, despite the strong performance, the ablation studies cannot demonstrate that two problems of shallow alignment raised by the writers are well resolved. The ablation studies in Table 6 can prove the effectiveness of CogVLM design. But these numbers cannot prove that deep alignment is better than and solves the issues of shallow alignment, due to the results of shallow alignment method with larger visual encoder (same parameters as vision encoder + vision adapter) are remain unknown.
- Section 2.2 mentions that CogVLM is trained via two-stage process, with 120K and 60K steps respectively. The ablation studies in Table 6 are trained for just 6K steps. However, despite with much fewer iterations, the performance gap between ablation model and the final model is not that significant (e.g., in Table 6, CogVLM achieves 142.8 COCO CIDEr, only ~4 CIDEr score less that the results in Table 3). So does this phenomenone implies that too much iterations in the two-stage training process are unnecessary?
- The visual expert in CogVLM includes FFNs in both attention block and FFN block. Which one is more important for better performance?

### Questions
- In section 2.3, the author claims that errors in LLAVA-Instruct dataset are corrected by mannual inspection and annotation. Will the corrected dataset be made publicly available?

### Summary
This paper introduces a powerful open-source visual language foundation model, CogVLM, which adds a trainable visual expert module in the attention and FFN layers, to allow for deep fusion between visual and textual features. By pretraining on a large-scale image-text aligned data and benchmark datasets and utilizing a multi-stage training strategy, it achieves state-of-the-art performance on a variety of classic cross-modal benchmarks.

### Strengths
1. Strong performance on a variety of popular benchmarks, including VQA, Image Caption, Visual Grounding, Document Visual Tasks, and some GPT-4 based evaluation. 
2. One pioneering work to address the shallow alignment problem for cross-modal learning by introducing visual expert module in MLLM.
3. Open-source MLLM for better promoting the cross-modal research.

### Weaknesses
1. The idea is not that novel, compared with BEIT-3 and VLMo, which also introduces different modality expert structures, although this work makes some changes to make it work in the era of LLM. 
2. The VQA/Image Caption model, Visual Grounding model and Chat model are three different models, I am wondering how the performance can be if all these models are a unified one? Since GPT-4V may be a unified one. 
3. Although I appreciate the excellent performance it achieves, the visual backbone is ViT-e, and the input resolution is 490 * 490, also the parameter size of LLM doubles, which makes the comparason a little hard.

### Questions
1. Do you have more experiment on the archtecture of visual expert module and more insight about which part of the layers should be shared and which module should have separate parameters? 
2. For the generalist performance, is it possible that a model can achieve best performance on both real-world chat and benchmark datasets? since this paper has three separate training procedures to make it best in each individual dataset. If there exist some gaps between different kinds of datasets, how can the architecture be designed to better address this problem?
3. Have you observed some new emergent ability in this strong MLLM?

### Summary
This paper introduces an innovative VLM framework that integrates a pre-trained image encoder and a language model through a deeper fusion and fine-tuning process. The method has demonstrated SOTA performance on multiple Vision-Language benchmarks. Furthermore, the model incorporates an alignment stage to further enhance its capabilities.

### Strengths
1. The proposed method represents a novel approach to multimodal techniques, distinguishing itself from previous Vision-Language Models (VLMs) like Flamingo and PaLI. The method's innovative and effective feature fusion into the language model sets it apart.

2. The proposed method has achieved SOTA performance on a range of Vision-Language benchmarks, spanning image captioning, Visual Question Answering, and visual grounding tasks.

3. The paper meticulously provides all experimental details, and the ablation study helps to validate the design components, enhancing the overall robustness of the research.

### Weaknesses
Comparing the proposed method to earlier approaches such as PaLI, CoCa, and Flamingo may not be entirely fair. These prior methods do not incorporate the SFT stage, making it unclear how the model performs before this crucial phase.

Since the pretrained image encoder and LM and went through VLM finetuning, their original behavior may have changed. I wonder what the visual eval (linear probe, zero shot) will be for this finetuned encoder, compared to original model. How LM performance got affected?
