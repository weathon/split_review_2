## Abstract
Realistic synthetic electronic health records (EHRs) can be leveraged to acceler- ate methodological developments for research purposes while mitigating privacy concerns associated with data sharing. However, the training of Generative Ad- versarial Networks remains challenging, often resulting in issues like mode col- lapse. While diffusion models have demonstrated progress in generating qual- ity synthetic samples for tabular EHRs given ample denoising steps, their perfor- mance wanes when confronted with missing modalities in heterogeneous tabular EHRs data. For example, some EHRs contain solely static measurements, and some contain only contain temporal measurements, or a blend of both data types. To bridge this gap, we introduce FLEXGEN-EHR– a versatile diffusion model tai- lored for heterogeneous tabular EHRs, equipped with the capability of handling missing modalities in an integrative learning framework. We define an optimal transport module to align and accentuate the common feature space of hetero- geneity of EHRs. We empirically show that our model consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art synthetic EHR generation methods both in fidelity by up to 3.10% and utility by up to 7.16%. Additionally, we show that our method can be successfully used in privacy-sensitive settings, where the original patient-level data cannot be shared.

### Summary
This paper presents a latent diffusion model for heterogeneous tabular EHR generation. More specifically, the method aims to generate static and temporal EHR data jointly while taking into account of the missing modalities of EHR data. The authors aim to capture intrinsic relationships between static and temporal data via a unified latent space and address missing modalities through an optimal transport problem in the embedding space. The model is evaluated against various baselines including VAE, GAN, and other diffusion models (DM). Their results show that their method outperforms other models in generation fidelity and utility.

### Strengths
The main contributions of this paper include formalizing the problem of generating heterogeneous EHR data with missing modalities as well as the use of the optimal transport problem to solve this issue. It also discusses their latent space alignment, an important feature when dealing with missing modality data, in ample detail. The authors evaluate their results against multiple generation methods and uses data from the MIMIC-III and eICU database. The baselines include models of various architectures including VAEs, GANs, and other DMs. In addition, three areas of data evaluation are also considered, namely data fidelity, data utility, and data privacy. The paper presents their architecture in a clear manner that is easy to understand. There is also sufficient breadth covered in the Related Work section.

### Weaknesses
In the Related Work section, the authors bring up TabDDPM as a recent model that addresses heterogeneous tabular generation. They claim that existing diffusion-based EHR models are either unable to “generate categorical features or their tendency to treat numerical and categorical features independently.” However, if I am not mistaken, TabDDPM combines multinomial and Gaussian losses which implies that it treats categorical and numerical features dependently. In addition, as the authors mentioned, TabDDPM was also applied to EHR generation (Ceritli et al., 2023). If there is no misunderstanding, then this paper’s novelty lies in its approach of using a unified latent space to consider static and temporal correlations and dependencies (rather than being the first diffusion model to capture joint relationships). If this is the case, it was unclear as at first read, it could be misunderstood that the paper was also novel in capturing dependent relationships between static and temporal EHR amongst diffusion models.

It would also be helpful to clarify what feature dimensions (static and temporal) match to in the context of MIMIC-III and eICU in the Appendix. Even though a table is provided in the Appendix, the corresponding dimensionality is not the most clear.

In sections 4.1 and 4.2, the authors assume an individual patient EHR to take one of the three forms (all static features exclusively present, all temporal features exclusively present, or all features are present). However, in real EHR data, there are often patients with some (not all) static features present and some (not all) temporal features present. 
In addition to designating p% and q% missing for static and temporal features, it would also help to see results from randomly sampling patients from the datasets to obtain a realistic distribution of missing data/modalities for training data (as to my knowledge, datasets such as MIMIC already have patients with missing measurements).

Since addressing the problem of missing modality seems to be the primary goal of the paper, more experiments in general (perhaps showing more baselines other than EHR-M-GAN or other evaluation metrics/scores for fidelity and utility) would be helpful. Currently, only R-squared values are depicted for generation fidelity and only eICU for utility. More results in the Appendix would help support the claims. It would also be very helpful to include results from training on real data for Figures 2-4 to compare as it would provide more context. Currently, EHR-M-GAN is the only comparison.

Lastly, a couple of brief mentions of future work or limitations in the conclusion would also help clarify and reaffirm their current goals and progress. For example, addressing lower privacy scores or lack of ablation studies and their implications.

Some minor edits found:

- Section 4.1: First sentence “where ___ contains time-invariant features” should have “S” superscript for x instead of T?

- Section 4.2: Second sentence “embedding the patient information as ___” should have “S” superscript for z instead of T?

- Section 5.5: Second sentence “randomly designate p% of samples as lacking temporal features” should be “static”?

### Questions
- Table 1 is a bit confusing to read. There is no label for the temporal feature dimensions (d) for MIMIC-III in the table. Does that mean it is the same as eICU? Similarly, is the T for eICU also the same? 

- Is the paper also claiming novelty in joint static and temporal diffusion?

- What about considering generating samples that include missing modalities? Should generating missing modalities also be a point of consideration in terms of data fidelity?

### Summary
The authors address the challenge of generating realistic synthetic EHRs, especially in the presence of missing modalities in heterogeneous tabular data. Introducing FLEXGEN-EHR, a tailored diffusion model, they propose an optimal transport module to handle missing modality issues. Their empirical results indicate that this model surpasses existing methods in fidelity and utility, with promising implications for privacy-sensitive contexts.

### Strengths
- The authors present a practical problem definition that is aptly suited for real-world scenarios involving incomplete data.
- Furthermore, they introduce an innovative approach to address the issue of missing modality, notably by formulating it as an optimal transport problem within the embedding space.

### Weaknesses
 - While the manuscript underscores the significance of proficiently addressing missing modality, it lacks experimental validations. To effectively highlight the merits of optimal transport, I would suggest incorporating a comparative analysis between doing an imputation for missingl modalities via kNN in the FLEXGEN-EHR framework, and leveraging Optimal Transport for missing modality imputation.

### Questions
- In Table 2, could you elucidate how your method contrasts with baseline models that are solely focused on synthesizing Discrete codes? Specifically, how did you employ MedGAN in generating the Labevents data for MIMIC-III?
- I noted the statement, "we observed that latent space embedding models, trained on disparate features, manifested analogous geometric patterns and behaviors." Could you provide further clarity on the specific geometric patterns and behaviors that were identified during this observation?

5: You are absolutely certain about your assessment. You are very familiar with the related work and checked the math/other details carefully.

### Summary
The author proposes diffusion model for generating EHR. They model the static measurements and temporal measurements separately, and using optimal transport module in the hidden space to deal with missing modalities.  They evaluate FLEXGEN-EHR on two datasets against six baseline methods.

### Strengths
The idea that aligning the temporal features and static features is novel. This method helps to deal with missing modality of EHR.

### Weaknesses
1. The author should bold the best results in Table 4 as Table 2 and Table 3. There exists a trade-off between generation quality and privacy guarantee. The method achieves worse performance on some datasets under some criteria is not a serious problem. However, the author should not neglect it.

2. Minor
* In the second line from the bottom, the author states "their tendency to treat numerical and categorical features independently". Although TabDDPM deals with numerical and categorical features separately, TabDDPM learns the dependency between them. This is because although the diffusion process is different, they concatenate the numerical and categorical features to the network, which is the same as the latent diffusion model used in this paper. 
* Typo in the second line of paragraph "Heterogeneous Tabular EHR Generation": x^{S}_i instead of x^{T}_i

### Summary
The paper presents "FLEXGEN-EHR", a flexible generative model tailored for heterogeneous tabular Electronic Health Records (EHRs) with a specific focus on handling missing modalities. EHRs often contain a mix of static (e.g., race, gender) and temporal (e.g., heart rate, blood pressure) data, and there's a challenge in generating realistic synthetic data that can replace real EHRs while maintaining privacy. Addressing the prevalent issues of missing data and heterogeneity in EHRs, the proposed model leverages an optimal transport module to align and accentuate common feature spaces. Empirical evaluations demonstrate FLEXGEN-EHR's superiority over existing methods in terms of data fidelity and utility, even in scenarios with missing modalities.

### Strengths
S1. The paper addresses a novel and crucial problem of generating synthetic EHRs that handle both heterogeneous data types and missing modalities.

S2. Empirical results showing superior performance in terms of fidelity (by up to 3.10%) and utility (by up to 7.16%) compared to state-of-the-art methods validate the model's effectiveness.

S3. The paper provides clear problem formalization, methodological details, and is well-structured, making the approach and its implications comprehensible.

S4. With growing concerns over patient privacy and the challenges in obtaining real EHRs, a robust generative model like FLEXGEN-EHR holds potential to take a step for research in precision medicine without compromising patient confidentiality.

### Weaknesses
W1. While the model showcases empirical strength, discussions or case studies on how it might be applied in real-world healthcare settings would enhance its practical value. The paper lacks an important motivation beyond patient privacy on why generating synthetic EHR is useful in practice. Providing this motivation is essential for the paper to be useful in the healthcare setting and should not be high-level only and be supported by experiments. For example, is this useful for data augmentation? If so does having data augmentation provided by this paper’s model improve downstream prediction tasks? And other questions in a similar vain.

W2. It would be beneficial to understand the model's performance across diverse EHR datasets to gauge its broad applicability. 

W3. One big challenge in generating synthetic data for EHR is the heterogeneity of the data with respect to specific groups (based on e.g. gender, age, race, etc). The paper is missing this analyses completely as it would benefit the validity of the generated data. Without identifying these spurious correlations, it is not at all clear where such fake patient data would be useful.

W4. The paper combines various components, like optimal transport and diffusion models, which might make the model computationally intensive or challenging to implement.

W5. The paper considers missingness in only static features or only temporal features. This is not a useful separation for missingness of modalities. Missingness in healthcare and specifically in EHR is not in this manner. Missingness is often not at random which in an on by itself provides information for prediction models (e.g. not doctors not ordering urine sample for a specific patient from a point onwards does not indicate missingness at random but rather urine sample is not required for the specific diagnosis that is being made). Additionally, missingness is not for the entire trajectory of the patient but rather at different points in time each covariate could either be missing or not and the method provided in this paper does not delve deep into these cases.

W6. The paper does not handle irregular sampling property of the EHRs which is in fact more important for handling than the type of missingness handled in the paper.

W7. The final results although beating the baselines, the uncertainty is large enough that the model’s performance improvement relative to LDM, EHR-M-GAN is not significant.

### Questions
Q1. What are the computational costs associated with FLEXGEN-EHR, especially when scaling to larger EHR datasets?

Q2. How does the model handle extremely diverse datasets, for instance, EHRs from different countries or medical practices?

Q3. Can FLEXGEN-EHR be extended or adapted to handle other forms of medical data, such as medical images or unstructured clinical notes?

Q4. Given the significance of missing data in EHRs, how does the model ensure that the synthetic data generated doesn't inadvertently introduce biases or inaccuracies, especially in predictive tasks?

Q5. How can the model handle time-varying labels? (e.g. health status of patient at any point in time instead of mortality just at the end of the trajectory.)

Q6. Please provide more information for Equation 6 and what is trying to be achieved in the paragraph above it.

Q7. Have an algorithm section either in main text or appendix that shows a step by step overview of the model both for training and for generation.

Q8. How are the uncertainties calculated for the tables?

Q9. How can the model handle more realistic missingness? (see W5).


Minor comments:

q1. “Numerical and temporal” and “static and categorical” are not the same and using them synonymously is not correct. You could have numerical static features and categorical temporal features (e.g. binary indicator of using mechanical ventilator at different points in time).

q2. There are multiple typos and clarity issues in the paper. 
“It’s” is not formal.
Empty brackets ([]) before equation 1.
	Section 4.2 line 3, typo for static embeddings.
	End of paragraph one of section 4.2 missing “i” index for z’s.

q3. What is H and W in page 4? 

q4. What is Π  before equation 4?

### Summary
The authors introduce FLEXGEN-EHR, a new model designed to generate synthetic EHR data, capturing heterogeneity in tabular data. Unlike most existing models, which focus on generating either static or temporal features, FLEXGEN-EHR is a flexible approach that can generate both static and temporal features simultaneously, even in the presence of missing values in the original data. The model uses a latent diffusion process for EHR generation with a novel optimal transport objective for latent space alignment. In experiments, FLEXGEN-EHR demonstrates superior performance in terms of fidelity and utility while ensuring that privacy is maintained.

### Strengths
- The motivation of the paper and the problem setting are realistic and convincing.
- The authors provides a clear and comprehensive review of related works in the literature.
- The method of latent space alignment is convincing and novel for the particular task.
- The experiment results demonstrate superior performance compared to other EHR generation baselines.

### Weaknesses
 - The paper needs ablation studies. For example, it would be more convincing if the authors were to include a comparison of the performance gap: (1) between scenarios with and without the use of OT on complete data; (2) between FLEXGEN-EHR and FLEXGEN-EHR - OT + KNN imputation on partially missing data.
- There seem to be a few typos in the manuscript (e.g., column names in Table 1, MMCAR, the notation for time-invariant features, adversarys)

### Questions
- Could you explain what R^2 is? The papers referred to use MMD and KS-statistics.
- What are the architectures of the decoder? Are they MLP and LSTM?
- How much better is imputation with OT compared to nearest-neighbor imputation if implemented in FLEXGEN-EHR?
- Could you provide more details about the statement "[Equation 7] can achieve alignment when the sample sizes between static
and temporal aren’t the same." Does this refer to the sample sizes of the non-missing data?
- It would be great if the authors could provide details about the membership attack implementation (possibly in the Appendix).
