## Abstract
Saliency-based representation visualization (SRV) ($e.g.$, Grad-CAM) is one of the most classical and widely adopted explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) methods for its simplicity and efficiency. It can be used to interpret deep neural networks by locating saliency areas contributing the most to their predictions. However, it is difficult to automatically measure and evaluate the performance of SRV methods due to the lack of ground-truth salience areas of samples. In this paper, we revisit the backdoor-based SRV evaluation, which is currently the only feasible method to alleviate the previous problem. We first reveal its \emph{implementation limitations} and \emph{unreliable nature} due to the trigger generalization of existing backdoor watermarks. Given these findings, we propose a generalization-limited backdoor watermark (GLBW), based on which we design a more faithful XAI evaluation. Specifically, we formulate the training of watermarked DNNs as a min-max problem, where we find the `worst' potential trigger (with the highest attack effectiveness and differences from the ground-truth trigger) via inner maximization and minimize its effects and the loss over benign and poisoned samples via outer minimization in each iteration. In particular, we design an adaptive optimization method to find desired potential triggers in each inner maximization. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets are conducted, verifying the effectiveness of our generalization-limited watermark. Our codes are available at \url{https://github.com/yamengxi/GLBW}.

### Summary
This paper proposed a generalization-limited backdoor watermark (GLBW), an evaluation method for saliency-based representation visualization (SRV). The author claimed that the existing watermark-based evaluation has a problem with trigger generalization: a typically trained poisoned classifier has a gap between potential (universal adversarial perturbations) and original triggers. Based on this observation, the author proposed GLBW, constructed as a combination of benign, backdoor, and generalization losses to generate generalized samples for training a poisoned model. The author showed that the poisoned model trained with GLBW has better benign accuracy and watermark success rate compared to the baselines. Also, they showed that their standardized version of the backdoor-based saliency map evaluation method has a lower variance than the vanilla method.

### Strengths
- This paper addressed a challenging and essential problem: evaluating explanation methods without human annotation.
- They found the implementation problems that exist in the previous watermark-based evaluation method (Lin et al., 2021)

### Weaknesses
 - Unnecessity of the consideration of trigger generalization in evaluating XAI
  - If I know correctly, the main idea underlying the evaluation of XAI using a backdoor attack is that the poisoned model would refer to the watermarked regions to make a prediction, and a good XAI would highlight these regions as well. In other words, the watermark region is treated as a ground truth of the saliency map. Meanwhile, the author claims that the existence of potential triggers is a problem because it has almost zero cross-entropy loss, but their visualization differs from the original trigger. However, for me, it is unclear why the potential triggers should be considered in evaluating XAI based on watermark regions. For example, assume that there is a cat image and a poisoned model predicts it as a cat. If the prediction results changed by adding a watermark on the image, then it is due to the watermark in a high probability. 
- Limitation of IoU based evaluation methods
  - Since the saliency map is not a segmentation, comparing the ground truth segmentation label with the saliency map could not be the best evaluation method. The classifier would not uniformly refer to the ground truth area.
- Week explanation for the intention of BWTP/GLBW
  - Many of the details of BWTP and GLBW are in the appendix, which makes it hard to understand them at first sight. 

- Minor corrections
  - In Eq (1), $\mathcal{L}$ receives $y\in${$0,...,K-1$} for benign and backdoor loss, but $\mathbf{y}\in\mathbb{R}^K$ for penalty loss. 
  - In Eq (2), $|\mathbf{b}'|$ is not defined

### Questions
- Could you describe how the existence of potential triggers affects the watermark-based saliency map evaluation?
- How do we evaluate which saliency map evaluation metric is better?

### Summary
In this paper, the authors aim at the evaluation problem of saliency-based representation visualization (SRV). For that, they firstly argue that the current backdoor-based SRV evaluation methods have the implementation limitations and unreliable nature. Based on that, they propose the faithful XAI method to overcome these issues. A variety of experiments verify the effectiveness of proposed method.

### Strengths
1. The writing or story is good, they provide a solid experiment to show the issues of current backdoor-based SRV evaluation, and then give a reasonable solution to address these issues.  I think this may give some insights to the community. 

2. The experiments are solid, the authors give many detailed experiments to show their effectiveness, as shown in the manuscript and that in the appendix.

### Weaknesses
Actually, I am not very familiar with the backdoor attack and SRV evaluation problem, and just have some background knowledge about them. According to my understanding, there exist some concerns as follows:

1. In my opinion, the trigger in backdoor attack and the real object are different in essence. In an image, the trigger is an out-of-context object, and the real object is in context. Therefore, although a SRV evaluation method can show good performance on the trigger, it does not ensure the effectiveness on the real object. I wonder that the authors whether provide some analysis about this difference. Specifically, the trigger is often a simple, low-level pattern (e.g., a small patch), while real objects are complex, high-level semantic entities. A saliency method that highlights a simple patch well might not be able to capture the relevant features of a complex object. The authors should discuss this discrepancy and its implications for the evaluation of SRV methods.

2. In the experiments, although they conduct many experiments, it seems that there are not some comparisons with the SOTA SRV evaluation methods. In Section 2.2, the authors discuss many existing SRV evaluation methods, they should give the comprehensive comparisons with these methods. It is not sufficient to only compare against a vanilla backdoor method. The authors need to show how their method performs relative to the established state-of-the-art in SRV evaluation. Without such comparisons, it is difficult to assess the true contribution and effectiveness of the proposed method.

### Summary
This paper explores how to faithfully evaluate XAI methods based on backdoor watermarks. Specifically, the authors first reveal the implementation limitations and unreliable nature of using standard backdoor watermarks due to trigger generalization. Based on their analyses, the authors propose the first generalization-limited backdoor watermark to further design more faithful XAI evaluation. The authors evaluate their method on CIFAR-10 and GTSRB datasets.

### Strengths
1.	This work cleverly links two seemingly unrelated (i.e., backdoor attacks and model interpretability) yet important research fields. In particular, the proposed method circumvents the harmful nature of backdoor attacks since the watermarked model is only used for evaluating models instead of for deployment. Although this perspective is first proposed in a previous work, further non-trivial exploration of this angle is also very meaningful and valuable.
2.	I enjoy the analyses of the limitations of existing backdoor-based XAI evaluations, especially their unreliable nature. These findings are non-trivial and are critical for practical backdoor-based XAI evaluations. 
3.	The proposed method is novel and reasonable. I think the authors have comprehensively demonstrate the design philosophy of their methods.
4.	The experiments are comprehensive to a large extent. In particular, the authors exploit different trigger inversion techniques to evaluate trigger generalization, which should be encouraged.
5.	The paper is well-written and its main idea is easy to follow.

### Weaknesses
1.	It would be better if the authors can provide more details about the differences between GLBW and BWTP. They seem similar in terms of formulas alone.
2.	Regarding the selection of M pixels, I do not think it is significantly better than the previous method. One example is that the size of the calculated saliency is significantly larger than M, while the size of the trigger is small. Because of M, the IoU value is high, but in reality, it is small due to the union.
3.	The paper treats the universal adversarial perturbations and the triggers the same, while their characteristics differ. However, the proposed method treats them the same. Please provide more explanations about why it is not a problem or how to address it.
4.	It would be better if the author could provide more details and discussions about why trigger generalization is very important for XAI evaluation in the appendix.
5.	The explainability metric is based on simple backdoored patterns, but why would it be a good reference for complicated features in real images for practice?

### Summary
The paper revisits the evaluation techniques for saliency-based representation visualization (SRV). The authors uncover the unreliable nature of current backdoor-based SRV evaluation methods, particularly due to the trigger generalization of backdoor watermarks. They also highlight implementation limitations. From these insights, they introduce a generalization-limited backdoor watermark and, based on this, design a more accurate XAI evaluation. The aim of their research is to enhance the understanding of XAI evaluation and aid in the creation of more interpretable deep learning methods.

### Strengths
1. The paper highlights a crucial insight into the shortcomings of the current backdoor-based SRV evaluation and presents a new method called GLBW for a more accurate XAI assessment.
2. The authors have conducted extensive experiments on benchmark datasets to verify the effectiveness of their GLBW, adding credibility to their claims.
3. The authors have provided detailed descriptions of datasets, models, training, and evaluation settings in the appendix. They also commit to releasing training codes upon acceptance, promoting transparency and reproducibility.

### Weaknesses
The only weakness I consider is that the authors haven't provided enough empirical evidence demonstrating the superiority of their proposed method over traditional backdoor-based techniques. For instance, they don't experimentally address why the minimum bounding box approach might yield inaccurate results as they claim. Specifically, the paper lacks a direct comparison showing the quantitative differences in Intersection over Union (IoU) scores when using the minimum bounding box versus their proposed method. This makes it difficult to assess the practical impact of their approach. Furthermore, the authors do not provide sufficient justification for their claim that taking the absolute value of gradients across all SRV methods is necessary. While they mention inconsistencies in existing evaluations, they don't show a clear empirical study demonstrating the negative impact of these inconsistencies. The paper would benefit from a more thorough ablation study that isolates the effects of each proposed change.
