# Certified Adversarial Robustness for Rate Encoded Spiking Neural Networks

- Decision: Accept
- Scores: 8, 5, 6, 8

## Abstract
The spiking neural networks are inspired by the biological neurons that employ binary spikes to propagate information in the neural network. It has garnered considerable attention as the next-generation neural network, as the spiking activity simplifies the computation burden of the network to a large extent and is known for its low energy deployment enabled by specialized neuromorphic hardware. One popular technique to feed a static image to such a network is rate encoding, where each pixel is encoded into random binary spikes, following a Bernoulli distribution that uses the pixel intensity as bias. By establishing a novel connection between rate-encoding and randomized smoothing, we give the first provable robustness guarantee for spiking neural networks against adversarial perturbation of inputs bounded under $l_1$-norm. We introduce novel adversarial training algorithms for rate-encoded models that significantly improve the state-of-the-art empirical robust accuracy result. Experimental validation of the method is performed across various static image datasets, including CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100 and ImageNet-100. The code is available at \url{https://github.com/BhaskarMukhoty/CertifiedSNN}.

### Summary
The manuscript investigates the adversarial robustness of spiking neural networks (SNN). It establishes a connection between rate-encoding used for SNNs and the randomized smoothing framework from adversarial robustness. It clarifies why rate-encodings are more adversarial robust than constant-encodings, as observed previously in empirical studies. The established theory confirms the empirical observation that this benefit diminishes with increased SNN inference latency. In addition, empirical robustness is investigated using a variety of adversarial training techniques optionally combined with randomized smoothing for both constant and rate encodings.

### Strengths
* **Original Contribution:** The paper offers a unique perspective on adversarial robustness for SNNs using rate encoding. The connection between rate encoding and randomized smoothing is a novel and interesting insight contributing to the field.
* **Theoretical work**: The authors provide a theoretical foundation for the robustness of rate-encoded SNNs. While the results rely on previous work, the extension to SNNs is novel and non-trivial (lemma 3 and 4). 
* **Comprehensive empirical results**: Additionally to the theoretical contributions, the authors combine their results with various adversarial training settings to improve empirical robustness. 
 * **Clarity of introduction and background:** The paper is well-structured and provides clear explanations of the relevant concepts, making it accessible to a wide audience, including those not specialized in spiking neural networks or adversarial robustness.

### Weaknesses
## Major issues
* **Claims and limitations**: The manuscript claims to "introduce a novel adversarial training algorithm ... improves state-of-the-art ...". Yet it is not very clear what the novelty exactly is (e.g. as also stated by the authors Stalman et al. 2009 did combine adversarial training and randomized smoothing. Is it the adaption to SNNs? The modifications required for the attack?). This should be more clear. Further, the manuscript claims new state-of-the-art performance in the abstract. But only "compare the performance of the proposed methods with state-of-the-art adversarial training algorithms" in the Experiments. These are two slightly different statements, and they should be clearly formulated (i.e. what is state-of-the-art (is there a well-established state-of-the-art in the field?), and exactly which proposed method beats it?). While the authors do discuss the obtained certified radius in section 5.3, these certifications seem way smaller than for the ANN case [2]. While a direct comparison is not necessary, this should be discussed more explicitly. The lack of clarity regarding the specific novelty of the adversarial training algorithm and the precise definition of 'state-of-the-art' makes it difficult to assess the true contribution of the work. The manuscript should clearly state if the novelty lies in the specific adaptation of randomized smoothing to SNNs, or in the modifications to the attack algorithm, and provide a more precise comparison to existing methods in the field, including a discussion of the significant gap in certified robustness compared to ANNs.

* **Empirical details and clarity of experimental results**: The manuscript lacks a more comprehensive description of experimental details, which should be added to the appendix i.e., how many PGD iterations, all the training details for all adversarial training methods, the cost of training with the different methods (GPUs, time), … . There also is only a brief discussion of the empirical results, and some of the results are unclear/surprising to me (see questions). This should be discussed in more detail. The absence of crucial experimental details, such as the number of PGD iterations, training parameters for all adversarial methods, and computational costs, hinders reproducibility and a thorough understanding of the results. A more in-depth discussion of the empirical findings is needed to address the surprising and unclear aspects of the results.

* **Comparison between certified and empirical robustness**: The manuscript does analyze both the empirical and certified robustness. Yet, does treat them mostly independently. It would be helpful to e.g. take Fig 1 (d) (i.e. the empirical robustness for various epsilon) and also plot the certified robustness (with radius r=epsilon). This information is already displayed in Table 3 (although for a much smaller radius). This would nicely showcase the gap between empirical and certified robustness. While the authors do not claim tightness of the certifications, this at least should be discussed/visible. The lack of direct comparison between empirical and certified robustness makes it difficult to assess the practical implications of the theoretical results. Plotting the certified robustness alongside the empirical robustness in Figure 1(d) would provide a clearer visualization of the gap between these two measures and facilitate a more comprehensive analysis of the proposed methods.



## Minor issues and recommendations:

* The authors state that certified defense methods based on convex relaxations and branch and bound are restricted to ReLU activations. This is incorrect as [1], does generalize to general activation functions. The claim that these methods do not apply to SNNs may still hold and should be checked by the authors.
* Some of the proofs rely on the differentiability of g with respect to x. It might be good to point out that g is differentiable with respect to x, even if f is not differentiable with respect to z (as is the case for SNNs, just for clarity).
* There are some language errors (e.g. page 2 row 25) and formatting errors (whitespace in front of citations e.g. page1 first paragraph last row, page 2 row 11, ...).

### Questions
Multiple open questions about results in Table 1, for example:
* Why do fgsm(R) and pgd(R) attacks not work on models trained with constant encoding? As fgsm(C) and pgd(C) do work well as expected, shouldn't this indicate that rate-encoding messes up the attack algorithms (i.e., because the gradients become noisy)?
* As one tests attacks on both encodings (C/R), it might be good also to have clean (C/R), no? (it is rather interesting to me that models trained on C, do work that well on fgsm(R) and pgd(R) and visa versa)
* Adversarial training is performed both for FGSM and PGD. As PGD is the “stronger” adversary, I would expect it to be more robust, yet it is not. Especially, the PGD-adversarially trained network performs worse than an FGSM-adversarially trained network if tested against a PGD adversary. This result seems counterintuitive and is consistent across different datasets. Why? What PGD adversary was employed during training (as the evaluation PGD is as expected better than FGSM) ?

### Summary
Firstly, the author established a connection between rate coding and randomized smoothing, theoretically providing robustness guarantees against adversarial perturbations under the l1 norm. Additionally, a novel adversarial training method was introduced for rate coding, significantly enhancing state-of-the-art empirical robust accuracy results.

### Strengths
1. The author establishes a connection between rate coding and randomized smoothing, providing a robustness proof for adversarial perturbations under the l1 norm.
2. The introduction of a new adversarial training strategy for rate coding notably enhances the state-of-the-art empirical robust accuracy.

### Weaknesses
The connection between encoding and robustness has indeed been explored in many previous studies, as evidenced by the references provided:
1.	"Rate Gradient Approximation Attack Threats Deep Spiking Neural Networks" from CVPR 2023
2.	"HIRE-SNN: Harnessing the Inherent Robustness of Energy-Efficient Deep Spiking Neural Networks by Training with Crafted Input Noise" from ICCV 2021
3.	"Rate Coding Or Direct Coding: Which One Is Better For Accurate, Robust, And Energy-Efficient Spiking Neural Networks?" from ICASSP 2022
4.	"Spike timing reshapes robustness against attacks in spiking neural networks" from Neural Networks
Given the substantial amount of existing work on this topic, it does seem that the author's contributions might not be as groundbreaking. Additionally, some studies, like [1], have indicated that SNNs encoded with Rate Coding using LIF neurons can be vulnerable. This further suggests a need for more innovative approaches or a unique perspective to truly stand out in this field. The theoretical contribution, while present, seems incremental given the existing body of literature exploring similar connections between encoding and robustness. The practical contribution, while showing improved empirical results, lacks a thorough exploration of different SNN architectures and a more diverse set of attack methodologies.

### Questions
1.	If the author believes that rate coding is crucial for the robustness of SNNs, then it is essential to conduct experiments on converted SNNs and provide a comprehensive theoretical analysis. This will not only strengthen the validity of the claim but also offer insights into how rate coding impacts the robustness across different SNN architectures.
2.	The author should indeed expand the literature review to include more recent works related to SNN's attack and defense mechanisms. Relying solely on PGD and FGSM limits the scope and depth of the study. By incorporating a broader range of attack methodologies, the author can present a more holistic view of SNN's vulnerabilities and strengths in the face of adversarial attacks.

### Summary
This work presents a certified robust training framework for SNN. They mainly consider the Bernoulli noise in input and bounded by l1-norm. During robust training, they adopt STE for BP.

### Strengths
Apply certification based robust training on SNN is an interesting topic.

### Weaknesses
1.  Based on my understanding, the bound is conducted through repeated sampling (m times), which is a statistic boundary instead of a rigorous boundary. Please make it clearly. 
2.  The robust training framework is not clear. Based on my understanding, the robust training is more like adding noise to inputs repletely to conduct the boundary, which seems trivial.
3.  The labels in experiments are misleading, i.e. I did not find RAT in tables. 
4.  Please discuss [1]

### Summary
This paper pointed out that rate-encoded SNNs have superior robustness compared to constant-encoded SNNs, and then proposed an adversarial training method based on rate encoding.

### Strengths
1. The author's relevant mathematical derivation about the perturbation degree $\boldsymbol{\delta}$ is quite convincing, especially the connection between $\boldsymbol{\delta}$ and $T$ established in Theorem 5.

### Weaknesses
1. As shown in Tab.1, compared to constant-encoded SNN, rate-encoded SNN seems to have a significant loss in its clean accuracy (CIFAR10: 91.29% v.s. 83.22%, CIFAR-100: 70.85% v.s. 55.27%). I think this will significantly hinder the practical application of rate-encoded SNN.

2. In Tab.1, the author's comparative perspective is that the robustness of constant-encoded SNN under PGD (C) is weaker than that of rate-encoded SNN under PGD (R), so rate-encoded SNN is better. However, I noticed that the robustness of constant-encoded SNN is better than that of rate-encoded SNN under GN attacks (CIFAR10: 90.62% v.s. 78.62%, CIFAR-100: 66.46% v.s. 50.43%), and at the same time, constant-encoded SNN maintains good defense against FGSM (R) and PGD (R). **Therefore, it seems that the so-called superior robustness of rate-encoded SNN does not have a good generalization effect, and it cannot maintain good defense ability under different attacks, which is an obvious limitations.**
