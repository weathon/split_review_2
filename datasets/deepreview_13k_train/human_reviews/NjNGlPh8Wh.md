## Abstract
Recent theoretical work has identified surprisingly simple reasoning problems, such as checking if two nodes in a graph are connected or simulating finite-state machines, that are provably unsolvable by standard transformers that answer immediately after reading their input. However, in practice, transformers' reasoning can be improved by allowing them to use a "chain of thought" or "scratchpad", i.e., generate and condition on a sequence of intermediate tokens before answering. Motivated by this, we ask: *Does such intermediate generation fundamentally extend the computational power of a decoder-only transformer?* We show that the answer is *yes*, but the amount of increase depends crucially on the amount of intermediate generation. For instance, we find that transformer decoders with a logarithmic number of decoding steps (w.r.t. the input length) push the limits of standard transformers only slightly, while a linear number of decoding steps, assuming projected pre-norm (a slight generalization of standard pre-norm), adds a clear new ability (under standard complexity conjectures): recognizing all regular languages. Our results also imply that linear steps keep transformer decoders within context-sensitive languages, and polynomial steps with generalized pre-norm make them recognize exactly the class of polynomial-time solvable problems—the first exact characterization of a type of transformers in terms of standard complexity classes. Together, this provides a nuanced framework for understanding how the length of a transformer’s chain of thought or scratchpad impacts its reasoning power.

### Summary
This paper investigates how the formal reasoning power of decoder-only transformers change if they are allowed to generate intermediate outputs that can be read in subsequent steps, akin to chain-of-thought or scratchpad reasoning.  The authors show that for an input of size n, adding log n intermediate steps doesn't add much to the power of transformers without intermediate steps.  However, adding a linear number of intermediate steps results in a significant increase in reasoning power -- allowing transformers to recognize languages somewhere between regular and contex-sensitive languages in the Chomsky hierarchy.  The authors also show that using t(n) intermediate steps allows a transformer to mimic t(n) steps of a Turing machine.  Finally, they also show that allowing a transformer poly(n) intermediate steps precisely captures the class of problems solvable in deterministic polynomial time.  The paper presents complexity-theoretic lower and upper bounds of the computational power of transformers with the ability to use t(n) intermediate steps, for various functions t(n).

### Strengths
The paper establishes both lower and upper bounds on the computational power of transformers with intermediate steps (akin to chain-of-thought or scratchpad reasoning).  The lower and upper bounds are almost tight.  Although I'm not an expert in this area, I find that this work significantly extends state-of-the-art in relating the computational power of transformers to classical complexity classes.  The notion of norm-hash is likely useful in other contexts as well.

### Weaknesses
The paper is technically intricate, and may not be accessible to the general ICLR audience.  The core idea of using norm-hash is not illustrated well.  Using examples to explain the intuition will help in improving the readability of the paper.  The paper assumes a lot in terms of prior knowledge of the reader in the formal language theoretic modeling of transformers.  The notation is at times unnecessarily complicated -- I understand this was done for the sake of rigour, but this does hurt readability of the paper.

### Questions
1. Please explain the intuition behind norm-hash using examples.  Otherwise, its introduction appears too abrupt.  This is an important concept for the proofs, and hence it should have been explained more clearly with examples.
2. Why is it necessary to consider a multi-tape Turing machine when you want to show that a move of a Turing machine can be simulated by one move of a transformer with intermediate steps?  Wouldn't showing this for a single tape Turing machine suffice?
3. The result concerning characterization of P is not adequately explained in the paper.  For example, there is no subsection devoted to it. It is only mentioned as a bullet on page 3.  Please elaborate on this a bit more, like the other results.
4.  The paper presumes a lot about prior knowledge of the reader in the formal language theoretic modeling of transformers.  A more gentle introduction would help the readability of the paper.

### Summary
A series of recent theoretical work has analysed the limitations of transformers when it comes to solving certain simple sequential problems. In this work, the authors analyse whether these negative results remain when transformers are enriched with a chain-of-thoght. The main results show that these extensions extend the power of transformers to beyond TC^0 and firs-order logic.

### Strengths
The theoretical results are interesting. In particular, the authors have proved that transformers with a linear number of decoding steps have the capacity to regocnize regular languages. Nevertheless they cannot recognised all context sensitive languages.

### Weaknesses
The paper focus on the analysis of the expressive power of transformers enriched with chain of thought. For the audience of ICLR, it would be interesting to have some results analysing aspects related to learnability of such models. Specifically, while the authors demonstrate that these models can recognize regular languages with a linear number of decoding steps, it remains unclear how efficiently these models can be trained to do so. For instance, what is the sample complexity required to learn these regular languages? Furthermore, the paper does not discuss the generalization capabilities of these models. It is possible that while the models can express certain languages, they may not generalize well to unseen examples, which is a crucial aspect for practical applications.

### Summary
This paper studies the reasoning ability of transformer models, which underlie some state-of-the-art deep neural networks such as ChatGPT or GPT-4, in solving sequential reasoning problems such as simulating finite-state machines, deciding connectivity of two nodes in a graph, and solving matrix equalities, which are formalized as classical language classes (context free grammars or regular languages in the Chomsky hierarchy) or traditional complexity classes (bounded-depth threshold circuits $TC^0$, logarithmic space $L$, polynomial time $P$).

The paper shows that the number of intermediate steps (length of Chain-of-Thought, or amount of scratchpad space) is closely related to the sequential reasoning ability of a decoder-only architecture transformer. In particular, Equation 1 shows that the class of problems solvable with $t(n)$ intermediate steps are those solvable by multitape Turing machines using similar time or space.

### Strengths
The connection to traditional complexity classes (Equation 1) effectively refactors out all recurrence/use of scalable memory into the intermediate steps in chain of thought/scrathpad using transformers. This is as expected, and such intuition shows up also in studying traditional complexity classes such as $L$ and $P$ in a natural way, contrasting the need of memory to sequential reasoning.

The proof of this connection (Equation 1) is also natural. In particular, the simulation of Turing machines by decoder-only transformers using an encoding based on layer-norm hash is also natural.

### Weaknesses
The study of log-precision transformer models with $h$ heads, $d$ layers, dimension $m$, and feedforward width $w$, while capturing some of the trends in Machine Learning in recent years, may not apply when the trend changes to other non-transformer architectures in a decade or two.

The first equivalence between a transformer-defined classes (the chain of thought class) with a standard complexity class ($P$) is not too unexpected, given that both sides allow for a more lenient notion of equivalence/reductions, namely closed under polynomial time reductions instead of more strict notion of reduction such as logarithmic space reductions. Equating under polynomial time reductions are easier targets to hit. Specifically, the paper shows that the class of problems solvable with $t(n)$ intermediate steps (CoT($t$)) is equivalent to multitape Turing machines using $O(t^2)$ time, which is a quadratic blowup. This quadratic blowup in the simulation of transformers by Turing machines, and the fact that both sides are closed under polynomial time reductions, makes the equivalence less surprising. A tighter connection would be to show that CoT($t$) is equivalent to Turing machines using $O(t)$ time, or to show that CoT($t$) is equivalent to some class closed under logarithmic space reductions.

### Questions
While some future questions are mentioned (for example to study how different kinds of fine-tuning such as reinforcement learning or improving a model's ability to use chain of thought), how could such learnability problems be approached at a high level? The current paper studies expressive power by simulation results (between chain-of-thought transformers and Turing machines in both directions), which are somewhat standard in the computer science literature and appears unable to answer learnability questions by far.

### Summary
This submission studies theoretical expressive power of transformer models equipped with chain of thought reasoning. The authors provide theoretical lower and upper bounds for different decoding step sizez, log (L), linear (Time n^2; Space n), and polynomial (P). Their proof for the lower bounds relies on a construction that enables retrieval across different columns in the transformer (“Layer-norm hash”), which is used to simulate automata and Turing machines in transformer forward passes. The upper bounds are proven by straightforwardly simulating attention via a TM.

### Strengths
- Interesting theoretical work on the expressive power of transformers that sheds light on the limitations (and possible capabilities) of transformers for researchers and practicioners alike
- The theory is well developed and well presented

### Weaknesses
 - The paper is not very well self-contained and relies on the reader being familiar with two previous papers
- The last paragraph in the conclusion should be clearly marked as limitation of this theoretical bounds (the lower bounds and upper bounds might not have any relecance in practice).

### Questions
- For the upper bounds: Doesn’t the same reasoning as for the lower bounds apply? For fixed data distributions, complexity classes are irrelevant. How does this mismatch fit into the theory work?
