- Decision: Accept
- Scores: 8, 3, 6, 6

## Abstract
Event cameras are bio-inspired sensors that respond to local changes in light intensity and feature low latency, high energy efficiency, and high dynamic range. Meanwhile, Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) have gained significant attention due to their remarkable efficiency and fault tolerance. By synergistically harnessing the energy efficiency inherent in event cameras and the spike-based processing capabilities of SNNs, their integration could enable ultra-low-power application scenarios, such as action recognition tasks. However, existing approaches often entail converting asynchronous events into conventional frames, leading to additional data mapping efforts and a loss of sparsity, contradicting the design concept of SNNs and event cameras. To address this challenge, we propose SpikePoint, a novel end-to-end point-based SNN architecture. SpikePoint excels at processing sparse event cloud data, effectively extracting both global and local features through a singular-stage structure. Leveraging the surrogate training method, SpikePoint achieves high accuracy with few parameters and maintains low power consumption, specifically employing the identity mapping feature extractor on diverse datasets. SpikePoint achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on five event-based action recognition datasets using only 16 timesteps, surpassing other SNN methods. Moreover, it also achieves SOTA performance across all methods on three datasets, utilizing approximately 0.3\% of the parameters and 0.5\% of power consumption employed by artificial neural networks (ANNs). These results emphasize the significance of Point Cloud and pave the way for many ultra-low-power event-based data processing applications.

3: You are fairly confident in your assessment. It is possible that you did not understand some parts of the submission or that you are unfamiliar with some pieces of related work. Math/other details were not carefully checked.

### Summary
This paper proposed a novel and efficient network approach for event based action recognition. The network leveraged spike neural network as backbone. The preprocessing of the events includes grouping, sampling and rate coding to feed in spike format. The grouping takes special consideration to avoid asymmetric information pass-through. The proposed approach also has shown improving the mean relative error and coefficient of variation. 

The SNN learns from both the point cloud centroids and the processed representations. The feature learning part contains both local and global feature extractors as well as residual connection to avoid weight explosion/vanishing.

The approach has been tested on various datasets including small and large ones. The paper has also compared with SOTA methods for similar tasks. 

The proposed approach has significantly low power consumption, especially compared to other non SNN based networks. The results are strong and the advantages are salient.

### Strengths
The paper has proposed several novel processing steps accompanied by theoretical derivations. The paper first looked at how to convert the events into SNN acceptable format. One of the issues is that directly normalizing delta positions will result in asymmetric information passthrough. The paper calibrated this offset by using the delta of the absolute values. In the SNN part, the paper incorporated residual learning modules to prevent weight explosion/vanishing. 

The performance of the proposal has been demonstrated on several datasets and has strong improvement over existing methods.

### Weaknesses
I don't find notable weaknesses. I only find the proposed methods could also be extended to other relevant tasks, which this paper has deferred to future work. Otherwise, I think the paper results are pretty solid.

### Summary
This paper proposes an SNN framework for event stream processing, termed SpikePoint. It first processes the event stream into point groups and encodes using the rate coding method. Then, the local and global feature extractors are proposed to learn the deep features based on spiking activation neurons.

the writing of this work needs further polishment; a lot of typos can be found all through the paper;
the idea of pure snn for event point stream processing is not new; as the key components are all off-the-shelf modules;
the experiments on large-scale event-based recognition datasets are missing; which is hard to judge whether the proposed method works.

4: You are confident in your assessment, but not absolutely certain. It is unlikely, but not impossible, that you did not understand some parts of the submission or that you are unfamiliar with some pieces of related work.

### Summary
In this study, the authors present a spiking neural network tailored for event-based action recognition, utilizing event cloud data. The designed network adeptly captures both global and local features. Notably, the introduced method sets new benchmarks by achieving state-of-the-art results on four distinct event-based action recognition datasets.

### Strengths
The proposed method is novel and interesting. 

The proposed method achieves sota performances on four event-based action recognition datasets.

### Weaknesses
1. It is suggested to explain why employing the ResFB in the local extractor and the ResF in the global extractor.

2. Regarding the experiments conducted on DVS Gesture, please specify whether the setting encompasses 10 classes or 11.

3. For clarity in Table 1, it would be more efficient to consolidate all pertinent information within a single row.

4. Could you clarify the term "Single-stream"? Based on Figure 1, the entire network appears to consist of two distinct streams.

5. In the related work section, consider incorporating more contemporary research related to both 'event-based action recognition' and 'point cloud network in ann'.

Minor issues:

There's an inconsistency in the experimental outcomes for SEW-Resnet as presented in Table 2 and Table 6.

### Summary
The authors propose a spiking neural network that applies to event-driven camera output and is applied to action detection (agents moving in the visual scene). The authors show that their method achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art methods, but with significantly lower latency and energy consumption.

### Strengths
The method is clearly presented in the paper and is built around the use of point clouds, which are used to represent events. The method uses a relatively classical global architecture that consists in extracting local features, in order to group them intermediately to form a representation that will be efficiently processed by a final classification layer. Overall, the paper is well written and the results are clearly presented.

### Weaknesses
A major argument of the paper is to propose a method that deals directly with events that are constituted by the output of an event camera. The authors' argument is to be able to transform events into point clouds and thus improve network performance: "SpikePoint, is an end-to-end point-based SNN architecture". However, the figure shows that after the grouping and sampling stage, the information is transformed by coding the firing rate: "The coordinate is converted into spikes by rate coding, and the results of action recognition are obtained by the local feature extractor, global feature extractor, and classifier in turn". This point needs to be clearly justified, and in particular why isn't the temporal information kept precisely at this point in the processing process. Is that information rather represented in the previous stages?

In addition, I think the paper could be improved by the following points:

- Numerous methods have been developed in the past to study dynamic scenes, such as particle importance sampling, and in particular the "condensation" method by Isard and Blake. What parallels do you see between your method and these methods?
- In Table 7, you show that performance is optimal for a given number of time steps... What can you deduce from this result in relation to the complexity of the data representation?

Minor:
- "C represents the set of moments" - you mean instants?
- The point "A detailed derivation can be found in Appendix A.4, which describes how this connection solves the problem of backpropagation." is vaguely introduced, please describe minimally the method in the main text.
- The syntax of the paper did not allow me to fully follow all arguments. I have not taken this into account in my evaluation, but the authors should use a service, even an automatic one, that allows clarification of certain points. Fix for instance "bionic neurons" > "biological neurons" or vague statements like "to harmoniously extract local...", . Also check the sentence "We do identity mapping by changing the residual module to the following equation in SNN refer (Hu et al., 2021; Fang et al., 2021a; Feng et al., 2022). And the coefficient σ′ (Il+m−1 + Sl ) in Eq. 29 of error propagation of the corresponding residual term is canceled."
- The LaTeX formatting of the paper could be improved. In particular, quotations in the text should be enclosed in parentheses, e.g. using `citep`. Text appearing in equations ("erf", "clip", "centroid", "lif", ...) should be formatted as text, e.g. using `\text``.
