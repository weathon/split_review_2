- Decision: Reject
- Scores: 6, 3, 5, 6

## Abstract
Geometric deep learning, which extends deep learning techniques to non-Euclidean spaces, has gained significant attention in machine learning. To better classify non-Euclidean features in geometric deep learning, researchers started exploring intrinsic classifiers based on Riemannian geometry. However, existing approaches suffer from limited applicability due to their strong reliance on specific geometric properties. In this paper, we propose a general framework to design intrinsic Riemannian classifiers. Our framework exhibits broad applicability while requiring only minimal geometric properties, enabling its use with a wide range of Riemannian metrics on various Riemannian manifolds. Specifically, we focus on symmetric positive definite (SPD) manifolds and systematically study five families of deformed parameterized Riemannian metrics, developing diverse SPD classifiers respecting these metrics. The versatility and effectiveness of the proposed framework are showcased in three applications, including radar recognition, human action recognition, and electroencephalography (EEG) classification.

### Summary
This paper presents a unified framework for designing Riemannian classifiers for geometric deep
learning.  In this paper, we presented a  framework for designing intrinsic Riemannian classifiers
for matrix manifolds, with a specific focus on SPD manifolds. The paper studies five
families of deformed parameterized Riemannian metrics. Each of them develops an SPD
classifier respecting one of these metrics.

### Strengths
- Extensive experiments conducted on widely-used SPD benchmarks demonstrate that our proposed SPD classifiers achieve consistent performance gains, outperforming the previous classifiers by about 10% on human action recognition,
and by 4.46% on electroencephalography (EEG) inter-subject classification.

### Weaknesses
 - The presentation of the paper doesn't help the reader to understand the main contributions of the paper.

- The novelty is not clear. Using SPD matrices for human action recognition and EEG is not new.

### Summary
The authors present an approach to build classifiers on Riemannian manifolds. This approach is then applied to SPD manifolds with 5 different Riemannian metrics. The proposed method is validated on radar recognition, action recognition, and electroencephalography (EEG) classification.

### Strengths
* Summary of notations and mathematical proofs are provided.
* The proposed method improves SPDNet on radar recognition and action recognition, and improves SPDDSMBN on EEG classification.

### Weaknesses
 * The contribution is incremental as it is heavly based on the works of Nguyen & Yang (2023) and Thanwerdas & Pennec (2019a; 2022a).
* Experimental results are poorly presented (the text size in some tables, e.g. Tabs. 3 et 6 is too small to read).
* Lack of evaluation to show the benefit of the proposed method. 
* Limitations are not discussed.

I have several concerns about the paper (please also see the question):

First of all, there are definitions and statetements that look strange to me. 

As stated by the authors, the main motivation behind the proposed approach is that it can be applied to Riemannian manifolds that only require geodesic connectedness as opposed to existing works. However, the definition of geodesic connectedness (Definition 3.1) given in the paper does not seem to be corrected. I'm wondering if "geodesic connectedness" means "there exists a unique geodesic line connecting any two points". As far as I know, the existence of a unique geodesic in Definition 3.1 is too strong. See for instance:

https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~cis6100/diffgeom-n.pdf

It says that a Riemannian manifold is connected iff any two points can be joined by a broken geodesic (a piecewise smooth curve where each curve segment is a geodesic, Proposition 12.10).

Am I wrong ? Please clarify.

This also leads to another question: What are the requirements for the proposed approach to be applicable ? If the requirement is that there must exist a unique geodesic line between any two points of the manifold, then I'm wondering if the range of applicability of the proposed approach is as limited as the approach in Nguyen & Yang (2023) ? Please clarify.

I also doubt the statement at the end of Section 4.2 "our work is the first to apply EM and BWM to establish Riemannian neural networks, opening up new possibilities for utilizing these metrics in machine learning applications". Note that Han et al. (2021) has thoroughly studied the Bures-Wasserstein (BW) geometry for Riemannian optimization on SPD manifolds, where different machine learning applications have been presented. 

It is also claimed in the paper that the proposed method is applicable to a broader class of Riemannian manifolds compared to existing works. However, the derived MLRs are all built on SPD manifolds and it is not clear if the proposed method is also effective in improving existing neural networks on other manifolds, e.g. Huang et al. (2017; 2018).

Concerning the experiments, the authors only present comparisons against SPDNet and SPDDSMBN. I could not find any other comparisons against state-of-the-art methods on the target applications in the supplemental material. This makes it hard to make rigorous judgments about the effectiveness of the proposed approach with respect to other categories of neural networks. Taking action recognition application as an example. Many DNNs have been proven effective in this application on large-scale datasets. Experiments on large-scale datasets are thus important to show the advantage of learning on SPD manifolds over other manifolds (e.g. Euclidean, hyperbolic, Stiefel,...). 


**Questions:**

In Remark 3.2, it is not clear if item (a) is an observation made by the authors or it is a well-known result in the literature. In the first case, could the authors give a brief proof for that ? Otherwise, the result should be properly cited.

### Summary
This paper studies five families of deformed parameterized Riemannian metrics, developing diverse SPD classifiers respecting these metrics. The proposed methods were examined in radar recognition, human action recognition, and electroencephalography (EEG) classification tasks.

### Strengths
The paper studies different metrics for classification on SPD manifolds.  The theoretical discussions provide nice insights covering different metrics extending the current solutions proposed in the literature.

### Weaknesses
The proposal on the “unified framework” is an overclaim.  The paper provides nice results and in detailed theoretical discussions for different metrics. However, there are still rooms for exploration to develop a “unified framework” such as extension of the work for SPD manifolds with different structures, transformations and classifiers. Therefore, I suggest authors revising their claim considering the concrete results given in the paper, i.e. employment of 5 additional metrics for classification on SPD manifolds.

Although theoretical discussions on different formulation of the metrics are nice, they should be extended considering their complexity and equivalence properties.  In addition, experimental analyses should be extended with additional datasets and backbones.

### Questions
-	Can you provide a comparative analysis of complexity (memory and running time footprints) of different metrics, both theoretically and experimentally (e.g. even for one task)?
	
-	The accuracy of models are sensitive to hyperparameters of the metrics. How can researcher estimate these hyper-parameters in practice?

### Summary
Geometric deep learning has gained attention for extending deep learning to non-Euclidean spaces. To improve the classification of non-Euclidean features, researchers have explored intrinsic classifiers based on Riemannian geometry. However, existing approaches are limited due to their reliance on specific geometric properties. This paper introduces a general framework for designing multinomial logistic regression on Riemannian manifolds. This framework requires minimal geometric properties. The focus is on symmetric positive definite (SPD) manifolds, and the study includes five families of parameterized Riemannian metrics to develop diverse SPD classifiers. The versatility and effectiveness of this framework are demonstrated in applications such as radar recognition, human action recognition, and EEG classification.

### Strengths
The paper addresses the problem of supervised classification on Riemannian manifolds with a focus on the SPD manifold. The latter is used extensively to classify biosignals such as MEG or EEG.
Several applications are considered: classification of radar, human action and EEG data.
The deformation $\theta$ shows promising results in application and can be used in placed in many classical classification algorithms.

### Weaknesses
The paper is quite hard to follow.

First of all, the authors claim their approach is general in terms of classifiers and Riemannian manifolds. However, they only derive results for multinomial logistic regression on the SPD manifold.

Second, the contributions are not very clear. For example, the derivation of Theorem 3.4 has already been done in eq 17 of "Riemannian Multiclass Logistics Regression for SPD Neural Networks" from Chen et al. Furthermore, it can be directly derived from eq (3) by parametrizing $b_k$ as $\langle p_k, x \rangle$ and then interpreting the subtraction as a Riemannian logarithm.
The distance $d(S, \tilde{H}_{A, P})$ is defined twice: in eq (8) and eq (11). One should be a proposition and the other a definition.
There is a mistake in $b_k$ in Appendix C.

Third, the section 4 is really hard to understand. Specifically, the first paragraph of sub-section 4.1 discusses metrics that have not been presented so far. An example of how to apply theorem 4.2 and lemma 4.3 to a Riemannian metric should be added to understand their implications better.

Forth, the tables in the experiment section are not very clear. For example, in table 4, the authors mention methods [93, 30] and then [93, 70, 30]. What does it mean? The second row of results utilizes the same methods as the first row?

### Questions
1) Can you explain more precisely the contributions of the paper? The one presented in the introduction are too broad.
2) Can you provide an example of how to apply Theorem 4.2 and Lemma 4.3?
3) Can you explain the rows in tables of the numerical experiments?
