# Pure Message Passing Can Estimate Common Neighbor for Link Prediction

- Decision: Reject
- Scores: 5, 5, 5, 8

## Abstract
Message Passing Neural Networks (MPNNs) have emerged as the {\em de facto} standard in graph representation learning. However, when it comes to link prediction, they are not always superior to simple heuristics such as Common Neighbor (CN). This discrepancy stems from a fundamental limitation: while MPNNs excel in node-level representation, they stumble with encoding the joint structural features essential to link prediction, like CN. To bridge this gap, we posit that, by harnessing the orthogonality of input vectors, pure message-passing can indeed capture joint structural features. Specifically, we study the proficiency of MPNNs in approximating CN heuristics. Based on our findings, we introduce the Message Passing Link Predictor (MPLP), a novel link prediction model. MPLP taps into quasi-orthogonal vectors to estimate link-level structural features, all while preserving the node-level complexities. We conduct experiments on benchmark datasets from various domains, where our method consistently outperforms the baseline methods, establishing new state-of-the-arts.

### Summary
This paper proposes to assign each node with a quasi-orthogonal (QO) vector as its id (signature) and then run pure message-passing over them, so that the obtained node embeddings can be used to estimate link-level structural features (e.g. common neighbors), which is unattainable by vanilla GNNs. A new framework based on estimated pairwise features is proposed for the link prediction task, whose effectiveness is evaluated on 13 non-attributed and attributed graphs.

### Strengths
- Similarly to subgraph sketching, the author proposes an estimation-based approach to obtain pairwise structural features of link prediction heuristics under the message-passing framework. 
- The authors exploit the property of quasi-orthogonal (QO) vectors so that neighbor overlap-based heuristics other than CN can be estimated by the simplified MPNN framework.
- The paper is well-written and easy to follow.

### Weaknesses
 - In order to estimate pairwise features, the pure message passing adopted in MPLP loses the non-linearity of MPNN, which comprises the expressiveness of the framework.
- The adopted QO vector from DotHash enables more types of pairwise structural features (AA, RA), but it is still heuristic-based. Those features are empirically helpful for link prediction but also lose flexibility and capacity since they are fixed and predefined.
- The feature estimation of Eq. (5) still depends on the $r$-hop induced subgraph for estimating $r$-order intersection and difference of neighborhoods. Meanwhile, Theorem 3 shows that $\mathbf{h}_u^{r}$ and $\mathbf{h}_v^{r}$ can not be used for CN. This raises my concern over its scalability (feature propgation+subgraph extraction), and it would be great to see a clearer side-by-side runtime comparison with BUDDY [1], including preprocessing (node-wise) and estimating structural features (link-wise).


### Questions
- How would the sampling of neighborhoods in SAGE affect Thereom 1 and the estimator in Eq. (3)?
- What is the cost of generating QO vectors? Is there a principal way to pick its dimension? Will it scale to graphs larger than collab? How would the density of the graph affect its performance of runtime and estimation error?
- The order of features $r$ used in experiments is 2. Is it based on computation concerns? Can MPLP be applied beyond 2 hops?
- Sec 4.3 mentioned that Eq. (7) can be used for estimating triangles. Can MPLP be used for the triangle estimation task in Sec 6.1 of [2]?
- Is the $\text{GNN}(\cdot)$ in Eq. (4) and Eq. (8) referring to valina GNNs or the linearized version proposed in Eq. (3)?
- It would be great to provide more details regarding the baselines, especially differentiating ELPH and BUDDY [1], and NCN/NCNC-k [3] for interpreting the results of Table 2 and Fig 4.
- It is a standard procedure to remove target links in training for inductive settings. Similar approaches have been adopted in SEAL [4] and SUREL (mini-batch subgraph training) [5].

### Summary
In this paper, the authors explore the use of pure Message-Passing Neural Networks (MPNNs) for link prediction in graphs. The paper starts by exploring the known limitations of MPNNs related to their permutation invariance property for link prediction and introduces an approach called Message Passing Link Predictor (MPLP) that leverages a node "signature". This feature vector essentially consists of a one-hot quasi-orthogonal vector, which the authors claim as a solution for MPNNs and more accurate link prediction. Experimental validation on 13 different graph datasets, both attributed and non-attributed is performed in order to concretely validate the claims made in the paper.

### Strengths
- Originality: Pure Message-Passing for Link Prediction is not as well-understood as it should be, so the idea of enhancing GNNs to better handle the estimation of heuristic methods is a strong avenue for generating original work. MPLP does a fine job of this through it's problem formulation, equations, and theorems. It also takes care of tying in their motivations to numerous other relevant papers. 
- Quality: The spread of datasets captures a variety of domains and the experiments are structured in a ways that directly supports the author's claims.
- Clarity: The principles for the theorems and experiments are well-founded, it respects the reader's background in understanding related GNN works and keeps the discussion about any innovation presented in the paper succinct.
- Significance: The use of quasi-orthogonal vectors as a means of enhancing the message-passing capabilities of GNNs is entirely novel as far as I know, albeit it does extend principles from SOTA models. Future research could be inspired by a high-level approach that is similar to MPLP. MPLP's ability to estimate CN and DE is also a promising and significant improvement for GNN's ability to conduct link prediction. The non-attributed benchmark test, as shown in Table 1, is an interesting inclusion that speaks to the power of MPLP to handle non-standard link prediction scenarios. The inference experiments are thorough, considering the estimation of multple labels in regard to signatue dimension, inference, and ablation studies on batch-size.

### Weaknesses
 - The link prediction results for attributed benchmarks, as shown in Table 2 is limited in that it does not include results from all of the standard datasets: ogbl-ppa, ogbl-ddi, ogbl-citation2. The OGBL datasets are included as baselines in all of the included SOTA models, the results from which would serve as a direct comparison for MPLP's performance versus any SOTA method. 
- The first concern is compounded in that it is difficult to truly tell how well MPLP improves estimation of labels given that it only considers ogbl-collab versus ELPH and not the more scalable BUDDY. 
- The experiments, as shown in Table 1 and 2 only consider results for Hits@50. This seems relevant for the subsequent evaluations of inference, dimensions, and batch sizes. But, is still limited since the current SOTA models run experiments with Hits@100, Hits@20, and MRR.
- The test for the estimation capabilities seems limited by testing just GCN and SAGE. The inner product calculation seems like it should be extended to other types of popular GNNs such as: GIN and GAT. The results from which would lend more credence to the claims made about expressiveness and the effects of implementing quasi-orthogonal vectors into link prediction models. 
- The node-label estimation of CN and DE is promising. However, it seems limited in scope since it approximates just CN or DE and does not extend further to DRNL or DE+. This may be due to concerns of tractable computation but given SEAL's explicit testing of both DRNL and DE++ as labelling tricks, this seems like an important inclusion to evaluate MPLP fully.

### Questions
- What was the reasoning behind not including the remaining OGBL datasets? It seems that MPLP's scalability is an important component based on the inference, dimensions, and ablation studies but why not bring the scalability to the forefront of the paper instead of placing the ablation studies in the appendix.
- The extent that GAT could be effectively tested against MPLP seems limited given that GAT relies on attention and MPLP does not have explicitly have a mechanism to consider this. However, when considering the expressiveness of MPLP with random features and it's ability to estimate triangles, why not include a provably expressive GNN to test like GIN?
- What sort of limitations would integrating DRNL into GCN or SAGE pose? Is it concern over tractability and the fact that in certain instances DRNL is similar to DE and CN?

### Confidence
4: You are confident in your assessment, but not absolutely certain. It is unlikely, but not impossible, that you did not understand some parts of the submission or that you are unfamiliar with some pieces of related work.

### Summary
In this paper, the authors propose that by harnessing the orthogonality of input vectors, pure message-passing can capture the common neighbor heuristics. This idea is very straightforward. My main concern is that the ablation study (as evaluated in Table 5) shows that the main working component is the shortcut removal. Also, the main results reported in Tables 1 and 2 show that the new method only brings marginal improvements. Overall, I give a weak rejection.

### Strengths
1. It is an interesting topic to study the connection between GNNs and common neighbor heuristics.
2. It is great to see the theoretical analysis of GNNs on capturing the common neighbor heuristics.
3. The authors have a very comprehensive experiment for the evaluation of the proposed method.

### Weaknesses
1. The results show that the improvements of the new method in many cases are marginal.
2. The paper writing of this paper needs to be heavily improved.
3. The ablation study shows that some of the proposed components do not work well.

### Questions
It is common sense that in many link prediction datasets, the common neighbor heuristics can outperform GCNs. Therefore, I think it is very interesting and important to study the connection between the message passing and the common neighbor heuristics. It is straightforward to establish a one-hot vector to encode the neighbor node information. I like the theoretical analysis in Theorem 2. However, I do not get how you derive the CN from the product operation and use them in the GNNs. I am trying to understand Figure 3, but there is no caption explaining what colors stand for. Also, in Theorem 3, you introduce a walk operation counting the number of length-l walks between nodes u and node v. I wonder how you conduct this operation in practice. I suspect this operation would be super time-consuming to enumerate all the possible walks. For the experiment section, I consider your method as a general method that can be applied to various GNNs. So, I expect the authors to compare their method with the baselines under the same GNN base such as GCN or SAGE. Another main issue is that the proposed method only gets marginal improvement (not significant improvement according to the mean and the std) compared to the baselines in many cases. Therefore, overall, I would like to give a weak rejection, but if the authors can answer my above questions or point out my misunderstanding part, I will be happy to raise my score.

### Summary
Given that the representations of isomorphic nodes are the same, their link that aggregates the representations cannot capture some structural representation like CN, and thus it is intractable to perform the link prediction task. Based on this observation, this paper investigates the widely-used MPNN and finds that MPNN is capable of capturing joint structural features theoretically and empirically. The solution is to inject orthogonality into input vectors. Equipped with the orthogonality of the input vectors, the authors propose MPLP to estimate link information and accomplish the link prediction task. The experiments show that MPLP promotes significantly in the link prediction on both attributed/non-attributed datasets.

### Strengths
+ This paper is a meaningful discussion of the previous work (Zhang et al., 2021) on whether GNNs/MPNNs can capture structural link representation. As I understand, the previous work believes that GNNs/MPNNs cannot do this supposing that isomorphic nodes have the same representation. So, this paper exploits the orthogonality in the input vectors, which is reasonable and does not totally contradict the previous work. This paper is basically valuable for supplementing the link prediction capability of GNNs/MPNNs in both theorems and experiments.
+ The authors propose a further discussion that some GNNs have the ability to perform link prediction tasks on attributed datasets due to the orthogonality of attributes. This is an interesting discussion that might contribute to the incense reason why GNNs/MPNNs can perform link prediction on attributed benchmarks. The empirical findings in Table 4 bring about the phenomenon and leave the issues that are worth discussing.
+ The results demonstrate that MPLP outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines on both attributed/non-attributed benchmarks.

### Weaknesses
- The assumption of Gaussian distribution in the initialization of input vectors and weight matrices is reasonable for non-attributed benchmarks but it seems not to be correspondent for attributed benchmarks. Specifically, while the use of random Gaussian vectors might be suitable for capturing structural information in the absence of node attributes, it's unclear why this same initialization would be optimal when node attributes are available. The paper does not adequately justify why the random vectors should be treated on par with, or even as a supplement to, the potentially informative node attributes.
- The research focuses on the capability of MPNN for estimating common neighbors which is a critical heuristic for link prediction. In other words, MPLP injects the CN heuristic into MPNN. So, what about the link prediction performance when we directly regard CN as the node attribute? For example, the first elements of the input vectors could be substituted with CN value. This raises concerns about the novelty of the approach, as it is not clear if the performance gains are due to the novel use of orthogonality or simply due to the injection of common neighbor information, which could be achieved through simpler means.

### Questions
- Why are the results of SAGE on some benchmarks (Computers/Photo) different between Table 2 and Table 4?
- I am curious about when we concatenate the attribute vector with random feats, would the results be better than those with only attributes or only random feats? Since it is hard to evaluate whether attribute vectors are more important than random feats before conducting the experiments, the concatenation might achieve the better one automatically.
- What does the author mean by `MPLP holds its own’? What proves that?
- What is the potential impact when you find MPNN can promote link prediction? In what cases or scenarios will MPLP be used and benefit the industry?
