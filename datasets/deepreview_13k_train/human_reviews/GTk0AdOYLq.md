# DiffAR: Denoising Diffusion Autoregressive Model for Raw Speech Waveform Generation

- Decision: Accept
- Scores: 6, 6, 6, 5

## Abstract
Diffusion models have recently been shown to be relevant for high-quality speech generation. Most work has been focused on generating spectrograms, and as such, they further require a subsequent model to convert the spectrogram to a waveform (i.e., a vocoder). This work proposes a diffusion probabilistic end-to-end model for directly generating the raw speech waveform. The proposed model is autoregressive, generating overlapping frames sequentially, where each frame is conditioned on a portion of the previously generated one. Hence, our model can effectively synthesize an unlimited speech duration while preserving high-fidelity synthesis and temporal coherence. We implemented the proposed model for unconditional and conditional speech generation, where the latter can be driven by an input sequence of phonemes, amplitudes, and pitch values. Working directly on the waveform has some empirical advantages. Specifically, it allows the creation of local acoustic behaviors, like vocal fry, which makes the overall waveform sounds more natural. Furthermore, the proposed diffusion model is stochastic and not deterministic; therefore, each inference generates a slightly different waveform variation, enabling abundance of valid realizations. Experiments show that the proposed model generates speech with superior quality compared with other state-of-the-art neural speech generation systems.io/DIFFAR/}}

### Summary
This papers fills in a notable missing piece in the matrix of state of the art TTS methodologies - namely probabilistic diffusion based end to end TTS using an AR model. It does not rely on potentially limited intermediate representations (adopted by acoustic models) such MFCC, Mel-spectrograms and directly generates the raw waveform using overlapping frames. The author's claim that the data driven intermediate representation more effectively captures prosody (specifically, *vocal fry* in the paper) due to the presence of both amplitude and phase information. It offers an architecture that enables explicit conditioning of desirable information (energy, pitch and duration)

### Strengths
The key strength of the paper lies in providing a method for high quality speech synthesis, which can be conditioned not only on the input text but also vocal features such as energy and pitch. 

The following points summarize the main strengths of the paper
- Arbitrary length waveforms can be generated because of an AR approach, both with respect to modelling but also computationally since memory consumption does not scale with sequence length (unlike the NAR approaches compared with in the paper)
- Experimental results include MUSHRA as a metric which is more robust/less subjective compared to MOS, outperforming sensible baselines
- Comprehensive ablation of different model components, which demonstrates their efficacy
- It allows variation of stylistic (prosody) features both by explicit conditioning and the inherent stochasticity of the proposed model (vs practically deterministic approaches like FastSpeech 2)

Overall, this paper represents a good, sound contribution to the TTS literature providing a method to synthesize high fidelity sound using a combination of theoretical and practical (overlapping frames) techniques.

### Weaknesses
The primary weakness of the paper lies in the somewhat limited experimental evaluation (with respect to dataset size/variety), and lack of references/comparisons to recent relevant literature.

The papers fails to adequately analyse closely related variants which are cited but not evaluated against - specifically DiffTTS (Jeong et al., 2021) and GradTTS (Popov et al., 2021). Due to the similarity in methodology, it is important to differentiate DiffAR where the only justification provided is the potentially better representation compared to using MelSpectrograms (which contain only amplitude information). However, capturing vocal fry without more comprehensive experiments (the work only compares against 2 model classes - FastSpeech2 + HiFi GAN and Wavegrad 2) is not enough to establish superiority of the proposed technique over variants which use acoustic features.

Moreover, an entire class of models which have established SOTA are not mentioned (VITS -> YourTTS -> VALL-E -> Voicebox (recent, past the ICLR cutoff)). All of these models outperform baselines mentioned in the current paper, and therefore the paper fails to establish its position and tradeoffs with respect to recent literature.

The overall theme is that due to either omission or lack of comparison (quantiative/qualitative), the paper feels like an alternative methodology that isn't convincing enough in its evaluation about outperforming/matching SOTA (which it does claim to do so). This is especially critical because of the key choice of choosing an *AR model* which are substantially slower than their non auto-regressive counterparts. Consequently for one to inherit the caveat of slow inference (RTF not measured in the paper), the model must have high quality and/or other advantages in order to justify the tradeoff.

### Major
- Single speaker dataset, with limited samples vs larger, multi speaker datasets (LibriTTS (Kahnetal et al, 2020), LibriSpeech, VCTK(Veauxetal et al,2016), LibriTTS(Zenetal et al, 2019))
- Quantitative/qualitative comparisons are provided against models (Fastspeech2 + HiFi GAN, Wavegrad 2) which are no longer SOTA (even as of Jan 2023) - missing important relevant references such as VITS, YourTTS, VALL-E.
> I acknowledge the difficulty of obtaining implmentations which is alluded to in the footnote mentioning that implementations of fastspeech 2s (Ren et al., 2020), Wave-Tacotron (Weiss et al., 2021) could not be obtained.
- Authors claim "Although there is a plethora of TTS systems available, our objective was to benchmark against the most high-performing and relevant models WaveGrad 2 and FastSpeech 2." without defining clearly how relevance is established since one can argue based on alternative methodologies and/or performance DiffTTS, GradTTS, DiffGAN-TTS, VITS, YourTTS are also extremely viable candidates. Even a qualitative, written explanation of the critical tradeoffs between the current work and the aforementioned models would help one understand the contribution of the work significantly better.

### Minor
- No benchmarks on synthesis speed (Real time factor), but based on the chosen schemes (DDPM + AR) it seems evident that the model will be quite slow
- No discussion on extending the current model to multi speaker and other prosodies (it is mentioned in the conclusion as future work)

### Questions
- What were the criteria for choosing baselines which are just said to be relevant? Why were the other E2E models (VITS, YourTTS, EATS) or Acoustic models (GlowTTS, DiffTTS, GradTTS) not compared against?
- How stable is the training of the model? Do you backpropagate into the energy and duration predictors (I do not think so based on the model)? 
- How is pitch predicted at inference time?
- What was the proportion of intelligible vs random words in unconditional generation?

### Summary
This paper describes an audio waveform synthesizer based on a diffusion process that can be conditioned on previous overlapping output frames so can be used in an autoregressive manner. The diffusion model itself only captures dependencies between overlapping frames and not between distant frames except through conditioning variables (e.g., speech synthesis parameter trajectories) that might stretch across longer timescales. The audio instantiations are assumed to be conditionally independent given this information. In the experiments, these frames are 500ms long and overlap by 250ms with each other. 

The system is evaluated on TTS for the LJ Speech single-talker corpus. It uses separate models for predicting duration, energy, and pitch, and pronunciation of a given transcript, then this diffusion model as vocoder to synthesize it. Listening tests with 45 raters rate the proposed method as 3.9 percentage points higher than WaveGrad 2 and 2.0 percentage points higher than FastSpeech 2 improved in a MUSHRA task. Putting the synthesized speech through a Whisper ASR yields lower CER and WER on the proposed method than WaveGrad2, while the same comparison shows slightly lower CER and WER for FastSpeech 2 improved than the proposed approach.

### Strengths
* Paper is well written and well organized 
* Excellent literature review
* Good derivation and mathematical exposition of the method 
* Listening tests seem well conducted, clear task, well executed.

### Weaknesses
One of the main benefits of diffusion models is that they can accurately model all of the samples in a waveform jointly. This paper proposes breaking this into a series of conditionally independent frames to allow them to be created in order, to expedite generation, but does not acknowledge this strong change in assumptions from full joint modeling to conditional independence. Given this change in assumptions, it is not clear to me what the difference is between this approach and other diffusion-based vocoders. This difference should be emphasized and elaborated in the paper.

The comparison with other methods does not seem able to distinguish between differences in the TTS front end and back end between the methods. The different methods differ in both, so it is not clear if differences in performance can be attributes to the proposed method, which is really only concerned with the backend vocoder and not the system for generating the conditioning information. It is also not clear why the particular TTS front end was selected, as it seems less sophisticated than tacotron2, for example, which has been around for several years.

### Questions
What is the difference between this method and other diffusion-based vocoders?

### Summary
This proposes a novel form of generative models, which modifies the prominent denoising diffusion probabilistic models into an autoregressive model for end-to-end speech synthesis. The main idea in DiffAR is to sequentially condition each frame on a portion of the previously generated one for diffusion noise prediction. An extensive performance analysis is presented in the paper, demonstrating high-fidelity synthesis and temporal coherence.

### Strengths
The strengths of this work are summarized in the following:
1. Novelty: The proposed DiffAR is novel and technically sound. This modeling approach is fundamentally superior over other non-autoregressive diffusion models with its support of unlimited speech duration.
2. Reproducibility: The authors also provide the codes and samples on anonymous github, which make the proposed model transparent and reproducible.

### Weaknesses
There are two fatal issues in this paper:

1. Weak baselines and limited reference: The author should acknowledge and compare their proposed model against other works in a relevant research direction (i.e., diffusion-based TTS), e.g., FastDiff, Diff-TTS, Grad-TTS, PriorGrad, ProDiff, etc. It is understandable that comparing with all the conventional methods is computationally prohibitive, yet the authors should at least discuss the pros and cons of these methods in comparison to DiffAR. The latest diffusion-based TTS model that the authors referred to was WaveGrad 2 (released in 2021), which is not up-to-date and not the SOTA in this research direction. I am skeptical whether this baseline is strong enough, and I suggest the authors to use a more recent TTS model as for a stronger baseline.

2. Implicit description on synthesis time: In section 5.4, while the section is titled "COMPUTATIONAL LIMITATIONS AND SYNTHESIS TIME", I expect to see exact numbers or a graph reporting the inference speed of DiffAR. However, the authors only show the memory usage of DiffAR and implicitly describe the limitation of DiffAR in synthesis time, which makes it unclear how much we need to sacrifice in efficiency to exchange for an improved quality. It would be unfair if we focus on quality and compare DiffAR with FastSpeech 2, since FS2 is clearly much more efficient in time. And, conceivably, as an autoregressive model similar to WaveNet, DiffAR should be quite sensitive to the length of the waveform to be generated.

### Questions
My questions are stated in the weakness above.

### Summary
The paper proposes an auto-regressive diffusion TTS framework that can continuously generate long sentences with almost constant GPU memory cost. The model generates more natural speech, especially details like vocal fry, compared to baseline models. System comparison experiments and ablation study on the conditional information are conducted.

### Strengths
1. The proposed method can generate some voice details including vocal fry, which is more natural than the baseline models.
2. The paper is easy to read.

### Weaknesses
1. Compared with FastSpeech2 and WaveGrad2, the proposed method consumes even more GPU memory in normal-length sentences.
2. Lack of comparison with simple baselines. See questions.



### Questions
1. More details about the linguistic representation need to be clarified. In the conditional setting, is the linguistic representation ${y}^l$ aware of the whole sentence text information or just aware of the text information of the corresponding frame? Is there a length regulator to align the text representation to the sample points? 
2. What is the practical scenario of synthesizing extremely long sentences (>512 words)? Such long sentences are rare in natural language. Compared with FastSpeech2 and WaveGrad2, the proposed method consumes even more GPU memory in normal-length sentences, which is below 512 or 32 words. There are obvious baseline methods to generate long sentences, such as splitting sentences or linguistic representation into chunks, synthesizing them separately, then concatenating the waveform. Under this setting, both of FastSpeech2 and WaveGrad2 can generate unlimited waveform durations while preserving the computational resources, and with even lower computation. Could the proposed method outperform these baselines by scaling down the computation cost to match these models? 
3. Although there is a justification of the choice of a long frame length in the unconditional setting, the author did not explain why they also used such a long frame in the conditional setting. There is also no ablation study on this. Note that these two settings are different in aspect of the global information. The global information provided by the long frame length in the unconditional setting can be provided by linguistic representation ${y}^l$ in the conditional setting. If the frame length can be shortened without performance drop in the conditional setting, the GPU memory could be reduced further, but the proposed method would be like a vocoder rather than a TTS system.
