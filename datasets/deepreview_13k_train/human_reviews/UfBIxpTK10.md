# Deep Confident Steps to New Pockets: Strategies for Docking Generalization

- Decision: Accept
- Scores: 6, 8, 5, 5, 6

## Abstract
Accurate blind docking has the potential to lead to new biological breakthroughs, but for this promise to be realized, docking methods must generalize well across the proteome. Existing benchmarks, however, fail to rigorously assess generalizability. Therefore, we develop \textsc{DockGen}, a new benchmark based on the ligand-binding domains of proteins, and we show that existing machine learning-based docking models have very weak generalization abilities. We carefully analyze the scaling laws of ML-based docking and show that, by scaling data and model size, as well as integrating synthetic data strategies, we are able to significantly increase the generalization capacity and set new state-of-the-art performance across benchmarks.  Further, we propose \textsc{Confidence Bootstrapping}, a new training paradigm that solely relies on the interaction between diffusion and confidence models and exploits the multi-resolution generation process of diffusion models. We demonstrate that \textsc{Confidence Bootstrapping} significantly improves the ability of ML-based docking methods to dock to unseen protein classes, edging closer to accurate and generalizable blind docking methods.

### Summary
A new docking benchmark called DockGen is introduced in this paper. Molecular docking methods based on machine learning do not perform well when confronted with unknown binding pockets, and this issue is not adequately addressed in previous benchmarks. In this benchmark, the validation and testing datasets are extracted from a different database, Binding MOAD, which contains new classes of binding pockets (based on clustering). The testing binding pockets are ensured to have a different shape than those in the training dataset. The ML-based docking methods fail in this benchmark, so a new training strategy is proposed to improve the results of the diffusion-based models. This strategy is called Confidence Bootstrapping and can be used to train (or fine-tune) DiffDock. The paper demonstrates that this methodology is effective in improving the results of DiffDock in the proposed benchmark, which focuses on model generalization.

### Strengths
- The motivation of this paper is very clear, and new benchmarks for ML-based docking are needed.
- The new benchmark is sourced from a different database than used in previous benchmarks, and the data is carefully curated.
- Poor performance of the known ML-based docking methods is proven using the new benchmark.
- A new method for training diffusion models is proposed to mitigate the problems with generalization.
- The proposed Confidence Bootstrapping method achieves good results for the introduced benchmark.
- Confidence Bootstrapping is implemented for DiffDock, where some architectural components (score and confidence models) were optimized.
- Two ways of expanding the training datasets are proposed, and they lead to better testing results.
- The benchmark and code were published along with this paper.

Overall, the idea behind the paper is clear, and the propositions are original and significant for the field of study (improving ML-based molecular docking).

### Weaknesses
 - The mathematical formulas in the paper should be corrected. Some parentheses are missing, and there are some symbols that were not introduced in the text, e.g. $p_{0t}$. I understand that the equation in Section 4.1 should correspond to the equation introduced in the cited publication (Song et al., 2021), but the new undefined symbols and missing parentheses make this equation hardly readable.
- In Table 1, the results of DiffDock with modification explained in Section 4.4 and without dataset extension should also be presented.
- In this benchmark, the only evaluation metric (besides computation time) is the percentage of the poses with RMSD below 2 or 5 A. Given the recent criticism of ML-based docking models, it would be advised to include conformation quality metrics like those proposed in PoseBusters [1].
- It would be interesting to quantify the similarity between the binding pockets used in training, fine-tuning, and testing. I am curious if using complexes from the same dataset for fine-tuning and testing could create biases in the data due to the way the data is preprocessed and filtered. Furthermore, you should also try fine-tuning using only PDBBind structures, and see if the results for the DockGen benchmark improve in this setup.

### Questions
1. Why have you decided to call your method Confidence Bootstrapping? This setup does not remind me of the classical bootstrapping method. The sampling is done from the continuous distribution (not a discrete distribution with replacement), and each sample is processed independently (not resampled as a subset of the population sample). Why is this method not called, e.g., Confidence Sampling?
2. What do you think about including conformation quality metrics in the benchmark, like those proposed in PoseBusters? Do you think that self-training using the confidence model can impact the pose quality in any significant way?
3. Based on the description in the paper, I was not sure which dataset was used for fine-tuning. I checked in the code, and `DistillationDataset` uses the Binding MOAD data. Could you confirm that? (see also the last point in Weaknesses)

### Summary
The authors address the general question of assessing and improving generalization of blind docking.
Their contribution are two-fold.
First, they establish a new benchmark for blind docking, coined DockGen, aiming at assessing better the generalization capabilities of docking methods to unseen binding pockets.
This benchmark is mostly built upon building new validation and test sets, composed of complexes with binding pockets that are not present in the "classic" training set of PDBBind.
Using this new benchmark, they show that there exist an important generalization that existing methods, especially ML-based ones, fail at bridging (and which was largely invisible with the classic PDBBind benchmark).
Second, after showing that classic data augmentations strategies fail at bridging this gap, they suggest a new training paradigm, coined Confidence Bootstrapping, that aims at leveraging the feedback from a confidence model to guide the diffusion of a pre-existing (although modified for this purpose) method called DiffDock.
After justifying the approach and formalizing it, the authors benchmark their bootstrapping method, showing great improvement over the already published DiffDock it is based on (and other methods).

### Strengths
The first contribution itself (DockGen) is already very valuable in itself as it sheds light on some of the shortcomings of current ML-based docking methods.
While it is very common that widely used benchmarks in the biomedical field fail at capturing the real (and meaningful) difficulty of the task at hand, it is always a great contribution when this comes to light and when a novel benchmark is suggested to address it.
The use of the ECOD classification to cluster complexes in a more "meaningful way" than the more traditional chronological or sequence similarity -based approach is well motivated and using separate external complexes from MOAD allows to maintain the training set of PDBBind that everyone has been using in the field, making it easy for researchers of the field to use DockGen to take a deeper look on the generalization properties of their method.
The results coming from that benchmark give interesting insights on further limitations of current ML-based docking methods.
Despite the very positive results that Confidence Bootstrapping obtains on that benchmark, it does not give (by any mean) the impression that it has has been established for the sole reason of making their new method "look good" (which can sometimes happen).

The second contribution is also well-motivated by well-known yet crucial observations on the nature of the docking task (i.e. it is hard to generate a good pose but "easy" to check if a pose is good).
Before jumping into its formalization, the authors do a very good job at explaining their approach on a higher level, risking some insightful analogies to seemingly loosely related approaches (e.g. AlphaGo), making the reading of the paper a very pleasant experience.
Despite the importance of the contributions and the very limited length of the appendices, the authors also make a good job at giving enough details to extensively describe their approach and allow to reproduce the results.

Last but not least, the results obtained by the new bootstrapping strategy seem to produce very encouraging results in terms of generalization to unseen clusters, although it is still completely failing at generalizing to some of the clusters.
In fact, the results seem so good that they may offer a proper, practical alternative to search-based approaches.

### Weaknesses
One main concern I have is related to the relationship of the current manuscript with the already published DiffDock. While the Confidence Bootstrapping is very specific to diffusion models and clearly builds on top of DiffDock, the authors have made a number of somewhat significant changes to it, even before testing the Confidence Bootstrapping (i.e. the results in Table 1). I think it makes things a bit confusing for readers that are already very familiar with the field and the method (which I was not). On a side note, while I do not think that the anonymity of this work has been technically breached, I think that this lack of clear separation between (Corso et al. 22) and the current manuscript gives hints that they are likely to have been authored by the same people.

Although the writing and presentation is overall very good, I find a few small parts to lack clarity. For instance in Section 4.2 (paragraph 4), it is not really clear to me why the more local and easier task of testing the goodness of a pose can make it easier to generalize to unseen targets (although the experimental results sure seem to suggest so). The relationship to the multi-resolution structure of diffusion models is also not very clear to me. I understand that the manuscript is already dense, but in Section 4.4 the explanation and justification on the choice to limit the order of the spherical harmonics is a bit cryptic, especially compared to the level of details of the rest.

To get a clearer overall picture of the performance of the proposed approach(es), I think it would make sense to add the Confidence Bootstrapping results in Table 1 (even if results would only be reported in the DockGen-clusters column). In addition to be able to see more clearly the improvement in terms of performance, it would also be useful to see the runtime of this approach. I have no insight on how costly the confidence bootstrapping is, from a runtime perspective.

### Questions
In addition to comments / answers to the points I raised in the weaknesses section, I have very few extra additional question.
The choice, during the update step, of using a ratio of half-half training samples coming from real, and from the buffer seems a bit arbitrary to me, especially combined with the choice of using only training samples for small t.
Wouldn't it make sense to use a ratio that varies more smoothly, i.e. an increasing proportion of buffer samples as t increases?

Also, the results in Table 1 look at the percentage of top-ranked predictions with RMSD smaller than 2 and 5A.
2A certainly is a commonly used and satisfactory threshold.
On the other hand, 5 is admittedly a very high threshold (cf the remark at the end of Section 4 stating that a RMSD larger than 4A constitutes a negative example).
Do you have any comment about this?

### Summary
This paper proposes a new benchmark and training method for evaluating and improving the generalization ability of machine learning models for molecular docking. The key points are:

- Existing docking benchmarks are limited in diversity, focusing on common binding modes. A new benchmark DOCKGEN is proposed based on binding protein domains to better test generalization.
- ML docking models show very weak generalization on DOCKGEN. Increasing training data and data augmentation do not help much.
A new training approach "Confidence Bootstrapping" is proposed. It trains a diffusion docking model using high-confidence poses judged by a separate confidence model, without ground truth data.
- Confidence Bootstrapping significantly improves model accuracy on DOCKGEN, doubling search-based methods. It is more sample-efficient than self-training.

### Strengths
- DOCKGEN is a valuable new benchmark to rigorously test model generalization in docking. I really like this work about this kind of new evaluation of the current dataset problem and create a new split setting.
- Thorough experiments demonstrate current ML methods generalize poorly, motivating new approaches.
- Confidence Bootstrapping is innovative, exploiting diffusion model structure and confidence feedback.
- Strong gains shown on DOCKGEN highlight its potential for advancing blind docking.

### Weaknesses
 - Confidence boostrapping is much like a RL-based method, therefore the authors need to add more discussions about RL and its related works in docking and science. 
- There is one recent work that achieves strong performance on unseen targets (though split by UniProt ID), the authors are strongly encouraged to compared the performance on that model: FABind, https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.06763
- More analysis needed on what protein features DOCKGEN probes that past benchmarks missed. 
- Ablation studies could better isolate benefits of different components of Confidence Bootstrapping. 
- Computational cost and sample efficiency could be compared to alternate training schemes.

### Summary
The paper proposed a new benchmark in the field of docking. Under more strict data split, the authors claimed that currently developed deep learning methods failded to generalize to unseen proteins. A series of efforts were made to tackle such limitations, including architecture modifications, increasing the training data, Van der Mer-inspired docking and most important confidence bootstrapping. However, despite of a brilliant research idea and meaningful topic, the paper failed to justify their contributions with convincing and reproduciable experiments.

### Strengths
- The DockGen Benchmark provides a new perspective to the evaluation of ML docking methods. Taking the similarity of binding pockets into account is more reasonable.
- Confidence bootstrapping provides a new data-free methodology to improve docking models on unseen proteins.

### Weaknesses
 - The paper mentioned a lot of works in terms of neural network architecture and data augmentation. However, I could not see their connections to the main topic of generalization. In Table 1, all those attempts failed to improve DIFFDOCK performance in the DockGen benchmark in terms of success rate(<2A). It is unclear why these specific architectural changes and data augmentation strategies were chosen, and how they were hypothesized to address the generalization issue. The lack of a clear rationale makes it difficult to assess the value of these experiments.
- Although a code repo is provided, I can not find any details about how baselines are benchmarked with the DockGen dataset. Specifically, when new data-split is provided, it is important to report whether baselines are re-trained or not. I am also confused by unclearified marks like EX. 64. The absence of explicit details regarding the training/testing protocol for the baselines makes it difficult to reproduce the results. The meaning of 'EX. 64' is not defined, and it is unclear how this parameter affects the results.
- The effect of confidence bootstraping is not approperately evaluated. Although the performance is demonstrated on 8 clusters, it is documented that there are 63 clusters in the test set. It is not convincing to claim the proposed method is effective before a more systematic and quantitative evaluation. The selection of only 8 clusters for evaluation raises concerns about the generalizability of the findings. The paper needs to justify why these 8 clusters are representative of the entire test set, and provide a more comprehensive evaluation on a larger subset of clusters.


### Questions
- Why is ECOD used for data split? Best to my knowledge, SCOP(e) and CATH are more widely acknowledged.
- 1QXZ and 5M4Q have a sequence similarity of 22% but not 16%. I blast it myself.
- In Table 1, do you retrain GNINA or other machine learning methods under the DockGen split?
- Why do traditional methods like SMINA not perform well on the DockGen benchmark?
- Only 4 out of 8 clusters are proved to be improved by confidence bootstraping. Why are other clusters not improved?
- In the paper Do Deep Learning Models Really Outperform Traditional Approaches in Molecular Docking? (https://arxiv.org/pdf/2302.07134.pdf), a new baseline of DIFFDOCK+Vina(UniDock) is proposed. It would be more approperate to be compared with than P2RANK+SMINA.
