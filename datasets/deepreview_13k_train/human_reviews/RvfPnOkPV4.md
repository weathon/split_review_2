## Abstract
Large text corpora are the backbone of language models.
However, we have a limited understanding of the content of these corpora, including general statistics, quality, social factors, and inclusion of evaluation data (contamination).
In this work, we propose \wimbdaccronym{} (\wimbd{}), a platform and a set of \nanalysis{} analyses that allow us to reveal and compare the contents of large text corpora. \wimbd{} builds on two basic capabilities---count and search---\textit{at scale}, which allows us to analyze more than 35 terabytes on a standard compute node. 
We apply \wimbd{} to \ndatasets{} different corpora used to train popular language models, including \textit{C4}, \textit{The Pile}, and \textit{RedPajama}.
Our analysis uncovers several surprising and previously undocumented findings about these corpora, including the high prevalence of duplicate, synthetic, and low-quality content, personally identifiable information, toxic language, and benchmark contamination. 
For instance, we find that about 50\% of the documents in \textit{RedPajama} and \textit{LAION-2B-en} are duplicates. In addition, several datasets used for benchmarking models trained on such corpora are contaminated with respect to important benchmarks, including the Winograd Schema Challenge and parts of GLUE and SuperGLUE.
We open-source \wimbd{}'s code and artifacts to provide a standard set of evaluations for new text-based corpora and to encourage more analyses and transparency around them.

### Confidence
4: You are confident in your assessment, but not absolutely certain. It is unlikely, but not impossible, that you did not understand some parts of the submission or that you are unfamiliar with some pieces of related work.

### Summary
The premise of the paper is, that we have a poor understanding of the datasets that have been used during the past years to pretrain LLMs. While the curation and preprocessing steps for many popular pretraining datasets have been described, we still lack an understanding on a common set of dimensions with comparable measurements. 

This paper proposes a platform that produces a set of dimensions, such as duplication, top-repeated n-grams, domain statistics ect. to characterize a dataset. Throughout the paper, it demonstrates this approach on a set of popular pretraining datasets, such as C4, mC4-EN, Redpajama, OSCAR and others and summarizes findings and provides anecdotes that have been discovered with this approach.

### Strengths
The paper is a timely contribution to increase our understanding of data properties that are feeding the LLMs during pretraining. I am not aware of any comparable publication. The techniques used in the approach do not contain any novelty by themselves, but this would not be necessary for the scope of this publication. The paper is easy to follow and well organized.

### Weaknesses
While I really like the premise and the execution of the paper, I feel it often falls short of delivering enough insights into the data and could increase its impact. I like the various anecdotes and statistics of those popular datasets, yet many of the dimensions are slightly underdeveloped or lack clarity (see questions).

- Datasets: Some datasets (e.g. PILE, Redpajama) consist of several datasets, yet it seems the paper only considers the web-crawls in those datasets?
- Token counts: What is a token here? Are you counting whitespace tokens or tokens from a subword tokenizer (which one, the same for all datasets)?
- Domain counts: As the text tells us "C4 contains documents from a diverse set of domains, and even the percentage of the most common one, patents.google.com, is less than 0.05%. [...]. Similarly, arxiv.org is responsible for more than 12% of the documents in RedPajama." While this is interesting, it feels like this topic is just scratching the surface and its still unclear how the rest of the data looks like.
- N-Grams: Over tokens or characters?
- Document duplication: The text says MD5, but then refers to "Compressed counts", which seems to describe MinHash?
- Benchmark contamination: Frankly, the Llama2 technical report set a high bar for investigating contamination of relevant benchmarks. The selection here is not helpful for SOTA research, and the selection criteria is questionable: Why are benchmarks with less than one input field discarded? Why Promptsource? This part should either left out or fleshed out considerably with more details.

### Summary
This paper proposes a tool for analyzing the contents of big textual datasets efficiently. It describes the implementation of the platform and gives examples for data statistics and data quality findings from 10 different large corpora for English as a result.

### Strengths
- The implemented solution seems efficient and uses scalable methods, making use of simple tools and scaling techniques. 
- The proposed tool could be useful to basically any NLP practitioner working with data to be analyzed. It fills a gap of existing tools.
- The shown examples illustrate well how the tool can be used to unearth surprising and previously unknown quality issues and outliers. The appendix has a generous number of analyses and results that might be helpful for anyone working with these datasets.
- The report of benchmark overlap is a nice side finding that will hopefully affect how future models trained on this data are evaluated. It is hard to publish such findings individually, so I am grateful for the authors to include these here and prevent future misinterpretations of results.

### Weaknesses
 - What the paper doesn’t address is how these instances that are problematic can be efficiently filtered from the data. Would the same tool be able to serve that purpose? Then one could nicely iterate with inspection and cleaning. This is not strictly a weakness as it goes beyond the scope of the proposed tool, but this should at least be discussed to make the observations more actionable.
- The tool is only evaluated on English, and this is not explicitly stated. It is unclear if there are any English-specific biases in the way that e.g. PII regexes are designed, or if the tool can be expected to seamlessly generalize to other languages.
- Given that it is a tool that is supposed to be user-friendly, it would be good to evaluate the usability, as the main contribution of the paper is not a method but a tool. How hard was it to dig out these quality findings, would an average user spot these quickly? Some kind of user study would be good to confirm that the tool is indeed usable. Are the statistics and summaries presented with visualizations to browse? The competitor, Know Your Data, might be good to compare against in that aspect, even if it doesn’t come with the same efficiency.

### Questions
- It would be helpful for each inspected corpus to describe briefly what kind of quality guards/filters were employed at its creation (if known), so that e.g. the presence of PII can be interpreted in context. If a corpus is supposed to be PII-filtered already, it would be very surprising to find more PII with this tool - or the regexes used here should be used to make the next generation of PII filter.
- What are the limitations of the platform?

### Summary
The authors present a platform and set of analyses to explore the large-scale datasets used for training LLMs.

### Strengths
1. The presentation and writing of the paper is good
2. The insights are presented from multiple large-scale datasets and the proposed methodology could be extended to other large-scale datasets
3. The authors document the set of observations from the dataset that several researchers and practitioners of LLMs in part experience.

### Weaknesses
I feel the analyses presented in the paper could be extended or strengthened along multiple lines such as:
1. Can we look beyond the n-gram repetition to measure the duplicity? Is every n-gram duplication bad for training LLMs?
2. What might help to better understand the relevance of the proposed platform is to (re)train the LLMs after removing the unwanted artifacts from the dataset. 
3. The impact on the output generated by the LLMs due to such unwanted artifacts in the dataset is still not clear. Some analysis/exploration along this line may help to better motivate the link of work

### Confidence
5: You are absolutely certain about your assessment. You are very familiar with the related work and checked the math/other details carefully.

### Summary
The paper introduces an automated system called WIMBD. WIMBD is a framework for processing and analyzing large text corpora, with a variety of evaluation tools. In the work, using WIMBD the quality of ten different corpora widely used train language models (or vision and language models, etc.) has been evaluated. Insightful findings were found and provided, along with a data quality & impact assessment.

### Strengths
I think this work is a substantial contribution to the ML community in general, and even broader (like the NLP community). It covers how important good and qualitative data is, above the quantity of the data. As a consequence, I believe it is crucial to adopt tools like WIMDB in order to make sure ML models are trained on good, non-toxic, data in order to avoid reinforcing existing societal biases, and exhibition of toxic language that is negatively impacting as ML models used in day-to-day lives. Systems like WIMDB could also play an important role (as data is) in the interpretability and expandability of ML models' performance + reproducible models.

### Weaknesses
Not a weakness per se, but it would have been good to see the authors discuss how scalable the tool is (they tested 10 massively huge datasets) to 100, 1000, etc datasets (with different lengths of magnitudes).
