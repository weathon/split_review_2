# DNCs require more planning steps

- Decision: Reject
- Scores: 3, 3, 5, 5

## Abstract
Many recent works use machine learning models to solve various complex algorithmic problems. 
However, these models attempt to reach a solution without considering the problem's required computational complexity, which can be detrimental to their ability to solve it correctly.
In this work we investigate the effect of computational time and memory on generalization of implicit algorithmic solvers. To do so, we focus on the Differentiable Neural Computer (DNC), a general problem solver that also lets us reason directly about its usage of time and memory.
In this work, we argue that the number of planning steps the model is allowed to take, which we call ”planning budget”, is a constraint that can cause the model to generalize poorly and hurt its ability to fully utilize its external memory.
We evaluate our method on Graph Shortest Path, Convex Hull, Graph MinCut and Associative Recall, and show how the planning budget can drastically change the behavior of the learned algorithm, in terms of learned time complexity, 
training time, stability and generalization to inputs larger than those seen during training.

### Summary
The paper proposes an extension to the differential neural computer (DNC, originally presented in a 2016 Nature paper) which proposes an end-to-end differentiable architecture based on LSTMs for learning algorithms from input/output example. Focusing on one of the original experiments (the classical graph problems shortest path and min-cut), the idea presented in this submission is to introduce variable processing time (LSTM steps) between inputs and outputs (for these problems, the original DNC used a fixed amount of 10 processing steps. This processing time is computed based on manually specified dependency on the input length. The authors perform experiments with a setting the processing time to the input length, which works well for the shortest path problem (as in, the trained model demonstrates better extrapolation to problem sizes not seen during training compared to a fixed number of processing steps. In min-cut, the improvements are less significant.

### Strengths
The paper is, for the most part, clearly written and presents the idea in an easy-to-understand manner. The authors devote a lot of room for additional experiments that aim to investigate how adaptive processing time improves extrapolation. They also present interesting results on how extrapolation to a large amount of memory can benefit from an adaptive processing time which appears to have been a long-standing issue in DNC extensions.

### Weaknesses
The contributions of the paper concern shortcomings of the DNC, which, at least to my knowledge, has not gained a strong foothold in learning general algorithms from data. While it's refreshing to see non-LLM submissions, I'm afraid that the paper at hand might not be of high interest to the community at the moment.

The paper is built around two claims (adaptive planning budget during training leads to learning more general algorithms, and adaptive planning budget allows for memory usage that generalizes better) that are marked as important and general insights, whereas they require 1-2 paragraphs regarding the specific settings they apply to. I would like it better if the formatting would be tuned down a bit given the experimental evidence.

For claim 1, I do not see how the paper supports clearly demonstrates how an adaptive planning budget generalizes to larger inputs in the general case. While the idea in itself makes sense and does work better on shortest path, there's no significant benefit on min-cut (the authors give a good explanation why that's the case, but in the end there's no evidence for the claim on this problem). More importantly, there is no baseline taking, let's say, a fixed amount of 100 planning steps instead of 10. The claim also seems to leave out the part where, with an adaptive planning budget, the model appears to perform worse on short inputs. Lastly, the claim focuses on using adaptive processing time during training, whereas it seems to required during testing as well (and that's not mentioned in the claim).

For claim 2, I found the formulation a bit ambiguous. What do you mean with "use its memory addresses in a more general way"? I also don't think there's enough evidence to support this claim, assuming it means that the resulting model can benefit from increasing the memory size at inference time. In contrast to what the authors write in the last paragraph of section 5, the memory reweighting scheme  also benefits the DNC with a fixed amount of processing steps (Fig 5a); this should become clear if the figure is being zoomed in. To me it seems like we see similar improvements, relatively speaking, for fixed and adaptive planning budgets.

In summary, my view is that (1) the paper concerns a topic of marginal interest; and (2) the claims as they are made to be are not sufficiently supported by the evidence that's presented.

### Questions
I was wondering why the fact that the DNC is already taking an adaptive number of steps based on the problem size is not discussed? What is the sensitivity of the DNC to the amount of processing steps in general? Is 10 just a good number for the problem sizes considered in the original paper?

Regarding the requirement for quadratic processing time on min-cut: have you considered training and testing on smaller instances of the problem instead?

### Summary
The paper leverages differentiable neural computers (DNCs), and proposes to improve their generalization capabilities by training them with a flexible number of planning steps, i.e. computation steps between processing the inputs and producing the outputs. Experiments on shortest path and min-cut graph reasoning problems show that a DNC trained with a number of planning steps that is linear in the input size instead of constant, can generalize better to graphs that are larger than those seen during training and leverage differentiable memory modules that are larger than those it was trained with.

### Strengths
The paper is well-written and easy to follow. It is interesting to see that the DNC models learn algorithms that can indeed generalize beyond the graph sizes seen during training (both with and without adaptive planning time). The introduced scheme to allow DNCs to leverage larger memory modules at training time by adding a temperature rescaling to the softmax over memory slots is intuitive and a nice auxiliary contribution.

### Weaknesses
The main claim of the paper is that the DNC can only learn a generalizable algorithm because it is trained with a flexible planning budget. In other words, the paper claims that one cannot learn a generalizable algorithm with a DNC trained with fixed planning budget. To prove this, the paper compares a DNC trained with a fixed planning budget of 10 steps, to a DNC trained with a flexible budget, equivalent to the size of the input. In the experiments, both DNCs are trained on input graphs with up to 75 edges.

I have two problems with this argumentation:

1) the DNC with constant planning budget of 10 steps has much less computation available than the DNC with flexible planning budget, which uses up to 75 steps during training. At test time, the difference becomes even larger as we evaluate the DNCs on graphs with up to 200 edges. It does not seem fair to compare models with such different compute budgets.

2) It may be that the fixed planning budget of 10 steps is simply too small to learn general algorithms. To prove the point that flexible planning budgets are required for learning generalizable algorithms, the authors should show that a baseline with a fixed planning budget **equivalent to the longest graphs** the model is evaluated on (i.e. 200 steps in the experiments) still fails to learn generalizable algorithms.

For the latter point, one could argue that it is impractical or wasteful to train with the max planning length even for small inputs. But still, the fixed planning budget should be set in a way that it matches the compute flops used for the flexible planning model during training. It is unclear how the current value of 10 was chosen and it seems to result in a baseline that has overall less compute and thus an unfair comparison.

The same argument holds true for the "increased memory utilization" experiments.

A separate concern is the stability of the proposed approach. The results in appendix C suggest that the models' generalization capability heavily varies between different seeds. This is concerning since the model presented in section C does not exhibit the central generalization capabilities that the paper claims.

Finally, the paper uses the simple heuristic of setting the number of planning steps to be equivalent to the length of the input. This is an arbitrary choice that may not generalize well to other tasks and may require hand-tuning on any new task family.

### Questions
- It would be interesting to understand whether similar benefits of adaptive computation / planning time can be observed in modern transformer models, e.g. by giving LLMs the ability to ponder for a number of steps that's proportional to some measure of the input complexity before producing output tokens.

- How does the training compute used for the DNC with fixed planning steps compare to that of the DNC with adaptive planning steps?

# Post-Rebuttal Comments

Thank you for answering my review.
It seems that the authors agree with the points in my review -- the new experiments with longer *fixed* planning length seem to change the main claim of the paper from "adaptive planning budgets are required to learn generalizable algorithms" to "adaptive planning budgets make training more compute efficient", which is a reasonable claim, but maybe less surprising. I also skimmed the other reviews and all of them seem to agree that the current paper does not meet the bar for acceptance. Thus I maintain my score.

### Summary
The authors hypothesize that Differentiable Neural Computers (DNCs) require adaptive planning budgets in order to generalize effectively to different input sizes. They claim that current methods that train DNCs with fixed p cannot learn more general purpose algorithms since the minimization of the training error often makes these existing approaches learn heuristics/non-general algorithms that cannot effectively generalize to OOD data. Moreover, this also means that such approaches cannot utilize additional memory effectively further limiting their generalization capabilities.

To show that adaptive planning strategies are necessary, the authors conduct an empirical evaluation on two graph problems: Shortest Path and MinCut. The authors propose a linear planning budget on the size of the input graph and show that DNCs training with such a planning budget are able to better generalize to graphs with larger sizes than seen during training. The authors also show that DNCs cannot learn generic algorithms if trained with a fixed budget and allowed a variable budget during inference.

Finally, the authors also show that such adaptive models can also better utilize addtional memory whenever it is available and thus generalize to larger inputs more effectively.

### Strengths
1. The paper is quite clear and provides adequate background on DNCs. The empirical section is well-explained and the organization of the paper is smooth.

2. The ideas put forward by the authors are intuitive. The runtime (and memory) complexity of algorithms is often a factor of the input and thus it is not surprising that neural networks that can mimic Turing machines might require something similar.

### Weaknesses
I think that the ideas are very interesting but I am afraid that the empirical evaluation might require more experiments for the authors to make the claim that adaptive planning budgets are needed. I post my questions here itself.

1) I appreciate the clarity of the plots in the paper but I feel that the total number of domains is rather limited. The authors run their experiments on only two problems and the performance differential is significant on only one of the problems (Shortest Path).

Q: Could you please motivate the choice of using a single performant domain for the analysis?

2) There is no analysis about the resources expended for training with the adaptive vs. fixed scheme. Simple plots or data showing that training times vs performance tradeoff would have enhanced the clarity of the paper.

Q: Do you have any data pertaining to the training time required for the adaptive case?

3) Building upon my previous statement, currently there is no way to automatically determine the adaptive planning budget but relying on some human-expert input such as "the total number of edges".

Q: Do you have any general intuition as to how to better select the adaptive planning budget as opposed to an empirical approach? (I recognize that this is a hard problem in itself but I would like to know if an easier training scheme exists)

4) For Fig 3b: The purple (edges=40) line drops starkly in performance when given more planning steps. ie. the adaptive scheme was not able to maintain steady state performance (as the authors put it in Sec 4.2)

Q: Do you have any intuition as to why this happened for the purple case?

### Questions
I've listed my questions to the authors under the section on Weaknesses. I hope that the authors can help clarify my concerns.

### Summary
The authors investigate the impact of the planning budget on the performance of Differentiable Neural Computers (DNCs) in two algorithmic tasks: shortest path and mincut. They assert that an adaptive computation budget results in improved generalization for algorithmic tasks. Additionally, they explore the effects of increasing both the budget and the DNC memory during inference.

### Strengths
*  The topic is relevant and the paper raises interesting questions.
*  Adaptive computation budget is practically useful as well as interesting from the ML perspective (out of distribution generalisation, using the model in different regime compared to training).
* I like the idea of adjusting the softmax temperature when increasing the memory size.

### Weaknesses
 * I find the story incoherent. Often this might be because the story is built around the computation budget, whereas the underlying story, in my opinion, is about out-of-distribution input size generalisation and using planning budget and memory increase for that. I think this leads to some unnecessary complications and breaks the flow of the argument, e.g. as with Section 5 resulting from 3.2.1. and having a two-page section in between.
* Some of the important topics are glanced over whereas more relevant parts could have been explored in more details. For the readers, unfamiliar with DNCs, this paper would be hard to grasp. I think, more time should be spent on Section 2, including an illustration would greatly help. This can be done by reducing Section 3.1. to a single paragraph describing the general inspiration.
* The paper is sometimes too loose when it comes to the results interpretation and some phrasings. I will put more details on this in the 'questions' subsection of the review, but here are some examples:
  - Section 3.2 is called that 'adaptive planning budget improves generalisation'. Figure 1 shows that training with budget = n is better than training with budget = 10. However, we don't know what will happen when we train with n=20 which is fixed, but more than the original n=10. 
  - Section 3.2 proposes an explanation that is not scrutinised in the experimental section: "Since the model was only allowed a constant planning budget during training, it was forced to find an average-case algorithm that can be efficiently run, and whose internal representation of the data can be efficiently written to and read out of memory." To clarify things, I find this hypothesis extremely interesting and worth exploring. But it has to be tested in some way.
  - I find phrases like 'learning a more general algorithm' to be quite vague and misleading. Furthermore, in my opinion they make it much harder to read the paper as it would be if the reasoning was just about generalisation properties of the model. For example, instead of 'learning a more general algorithm' on can say 'generalise to a wider range of input sizes' or smth. I believe reasoning about the effect of a particular experiment from the perspective of out-of-distribution generalisation would be easier to interpret and reason about.

### Questions
I left some major suggestions in the 'weaknesses' section above. I will put concrete major questions below and will have a separate subsection for smaller comments/nits.

Major Qs:
* Could you provide supporting evidence that adaptive planning budget improves generalisation and it's not just about the max number of steps the model was allowed to use during training? What if we pick the constant number of steps that is the upper bound on the number you used for the adaptive computation curve on Figure 1?
* Could you explain the difference between your claim 1 and claim 2 stated in the intro? As far as I understand, claim 1 means "adaptive planning budget -> better generalisation", claim 2 means: "adaptive planning budget -> better use of memory -> better generalisation". Is claim 2 a more refined version of claim 1, or I'm missing something?
* Do you think it's possible that Figure 4 result is an artefact of giving the model n planning steps during training? It would be extremely curious to see a similar line for the model trained with n/2 budget or 2n budget.
* "we [ ] empirically prove", "provide experimental proof", "this proves claim 2": one cannot prove something empirically. We can empirically disprove a hypothesis, or provide some evidence supporting a hypothesis. But proving a hypothesis is impossible empirically. Please, rephrase.

Minor Qs/comments:
* I'm curious, why did you choose to work on DNCs instead of other alternatives (e.g. GNNs or transformers)?
* Interestingly, for Figure 1b, the non-adaptive curve is higher than the adaptive one for n_edges>160. What do you think happened there?
* Could you explain what 'model learns to perform the algorithm rather than describe it' mean?
* nit: Figure 1 is easy to parse when reading from a black&white print out, Figures 2, 4 and 5 are impossible to parse. Maybe increasing the space between the dashes or adding other line markers might help?


## Post rebuttal update
I appreciate the authors addressing some of my claims and raise the score from 3 to 5. However, I still think the paper requires more work to be published at ICLR: story coherence, DNC exposition, new experiments seem to affect the 'adaptive computation -> generalisation' claim.
