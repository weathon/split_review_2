# SpaCE: The Spatial Confounding Environment

- Decision: Accept
- Scores: 6, 6, 8

## Abstract
Spatial confounding poses a significant challenge in scientific studies involving spatial data, where unobserved spatial variables can influence both treatment and outcome, possibly leading to spurious associations. To address this problem, we introduce \Space: The Spatial Confounding Environment, the first toolkit to provide realistic benchmark datasets and tools for systematically evaluating causal inference methods designed to alleviate spatial confounding. Each dataset includes training data, true counterfactuals, a spatial graph with coordinates, and smoothness and confounding scores characterizing the effect of a missing spatial confounder. It also includes realistic semi-synthetic outcomes and counterfactuals, generated using state-of-the-art machine learning ensembles, following best practices for causal inference benchmarks. The datasets cover real treatment and covariates from diverse domains, including climate, health and social sciences. \Space facilitates an automated end-to-end pipeline, simplifying data loading, experimental setup, and evaluating machine learning and causal inference models. The \Space project provides several dozens of datasets of diverse sizes and spatial complexity. It is publicly available as a Python package, encouraging community feedback and contributions.

### Rating
6

### Rating Number
6

### Confidence
4: You are confident in your assessment, but not absolutely certain. It is unlikely, but not impossible, that you did not understand some parts of the submission or that you are unfamiliar with some pieces of related work.

### Summary
The authors describe a framework for evaluating methods for causal inference in spatial data.

### Strengths
The authors propose an environment for producing realistic benchmark data sets. Opinions may differ about whether this is a significant contribution, but it is certainly an important step toward verifiable research progress in causal inference.

Despite the problems outlined below, this paper is still worth accepting. The paper itself is well-written and detailed, and the work itself provides valuable infrastructure for later research.

### Weaknesses
The decision to defer work on interference is dubious. There are many ways in which the treatments, outcomes, and covariates of neighboring units can interact, including treatment of one unit causing outcome in neighboring units, treatments causing treatments, and outcomes causing outcomes (and even outcomes causing treatments). It would seem reasonable to construct semi-synthetic data generation methods that could, in principle, produce all of these effects.

The authors produce a variety of data sets that use real treatments and covariates (and synthetic outcomes). Given that real treatments are used, there clearly could be spatial correlations among those variables. Thus, generated data sets may already have some degree of treatment-to-treatment spillover or covariate to (multiple) treatment dependence that produces that spatial dependence among treatment values.

The authors do not cite a large and recent literature on evaluation methods for causal inference. While this literature is not about spatial confounding specifically, it provides a large number of analogs in the context of non-spatial confounding and it is worth citing. These include:

### Summary
The authors introduce SpaCE, to provide benchmark datasets and tools for systematically evaluating causal inference methods designed to alleviate spatial confounding. In SpaCE, each dataset includes training data, true counterfactuals, a spatial graph with coordinates, and smoothness and confounding scores. It also includes realistic semi-synthetic outcomes and counterfactuals, generated using state-of-the-art machine learning ensembles, following best practices for causal inference benchmarks.

### Strengths
The paper targets a meaningful problem and tries to provide a solution. The structure of the paper is good, and code is provided. The authors provide examples and experiment results to show the effectiveness of the dataset.

### Weaknesses
The reviewer has several concerns that need the authors to address.

1. In equation 1. if R_s is the autocorrelation with neighbors, why do the authors consider only an additive model? What if Y = f(X, a, R)? Does the method fail in the cases of Y = f(X, a, R)? 

2. Counterfactual inference/generation typically starts from the abduction step that infers the value or distribution of exogenous variables. However, in causal model (1), it is not clear which letter(s) denotes the exogenous variable(s). 

3. What is the relationship between the residual R and the exogenous variable in the generation of Y? If R is the exogenous variable for Y, the authors need to consider a more general causal mechanism, rather than just the additive noise model (ANM). If R is not the exogenous variable, why the authors can use equation 1 for counterfactual inference?

### Questions
See the weaknesses.
If the authors address my concerns, I will increase the score.

### Summary
The authors focus on the problem of latent spatial confounding, where a number of latent variables that vary smoothly across space causally affect both treatment and outcome.  Some algorithms have been proposed to account for this.  However, evaluation of these algorithms is hindered by a lack of empirical datasets with known ground truth.  To fill this void, the authors propose a method for generating semi-synthetic data with realistic dynamics and spatial confounding.  The spatial variables can then be removed from the training data to create a dataset with latent spatial confounding.  The authors create sets of empirical data in 6 domains, describe the process of generating the semi-synthetic data, and evaluate the performance of multiple spatially-aware causal discovery algorithms across various data settings.  The entire processing framework is encapsulated in a Python package.

### Strengths
This is a well-written paper!  As someone familiar with causal modeling but largely unaware of advances in spatial modeling, this paper does a great job of motivating the problem.  While the contribution (generating semi-synthetic data from realistic treatment, outcome and confounders) isn't novel in and of itself, the combination of the extension to a spatial setting, the curation of six data collections, and the creation of a Python package to support the full pipeline are important enough contributions on their own.  I think this paper has a logical flow and explains each piece well, making it a smooth read.  While I can not speak to the algorithms compared, the hyper-parameters varied (smoothness, level of confounding, and binary vs continuous treatment) provide a nice coverage.  I also appreciate the authors' treatment of future work and ethical considerations.

### Weaknesses
In Section 2, Figure 2 is described as illustrating that "The closer locations s and s' are, the more correlated X_sMiss and X_s'Miss become.  While Figure 2 does show correlation between two locations s and s', the graphic certainly doesn't show that the correlation increases as s and s' get closer...

Given how information-dense Figure 4 is, I wish more analysis were provided of the results.  As it stands, there is only a single paragraph in Section 5 that discusses findings in Table 4.  In addition, With table 4 being aggregated across all 6 datasets, we're unable to assess how the performance differs across them.  While Figure 10 in the Appendix does show the breakdown by dataset, there is no discussion of the results.  I understand that space is tight, but I think including a bit more analysis in the paper, or at the very least in the appendix, would help the experimental results feel more impactful.

At the end of the second paragraph of Section 2, it says "When a confounder is not unobserved, identification is not guaranteed" - did you mean to say 'When a confounder is not observed" or "unobserved"?

Minor error: in the second to last paragraph of the Introduction, there's the line "SpaCE offers Each dataset has a set of known missing confounders [...]"
