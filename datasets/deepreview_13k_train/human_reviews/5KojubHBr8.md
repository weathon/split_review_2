- Decision: Accept
- Scores: 5, 6, 6, 8, 3

## Abstract
Since the resurgence of deep learning, vision-language models (VLMs) enhanced by large language models (LLMs) have grown exponentially in popularity. 
However, while LLMs can utilize extensive background knowledge and task information with in-context learning, most VLMs still struggle with understanding complex multi-modal prompts with multiple images, making VLMs less effective in downstream vision-language tasks.
In this paper, we address the limitation above by 1) introducing vision-language Model with \textbf{M}ulti-\textbf{M}odal \textbf{I}n-\textbf{C}ontext \textbf{L}earning(\model), a new approach to allow the VLM to deal with multi-modal inputs efficiently; 2) proposing a novel context scheme to augment the in-context learning ability of the VLM; 3) constructing the Multi-modal In-Context Learning (\dataset) dataset, designed to enhance the VLM's ability to understand complex multi-modal prompts.
Our experiments confirm that \model~achieves new state-of-the-art zero-shot performance on a wide range of general vision-language tasks, especially for complex benchmarks, including MME and MMBench. Our analysis demonstrates that \model~effectively tackles the challenge of complex multi-modal prompt understanding and emerges the impressive ICL ability. Furthermore, we observe that \model~successfully alleviates language bias in VLMs, a common issue for VLMs that often leads to hallucination when faced with extensive textual context.

### Summary
# Summary
The paper introduces MMICL (Multi-modal In-Context Learning), a novel approach designed to enhance Vision-Language Models (VLMs) in understanding complex multi-modal prompts, which include multiple images and text. The authors highlight that while Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in in-context learning from text prompts, VLMs lag behind, especially when dealing with prompts that involve intricate text-to-image references and relationships among multiple images. To overcome these limitations, the paper proposes a new context scheme that includes an image declaration section and image proxy tokens to improve the in-context learning capabilities of VLMs. Additionally, the authors have constructed a new dataset tailored to train VLMs on complex multi-modal prompts. The experimental results suggest that MMICL sets a new state-of-the-art in zero-shot performance on various vision-language tasks and benchmarks, demonstrating a significant improvement in understanding text-to-image references and relationships between images. MMICL also shows a reduction in language bias, which often leads VLMs to overlook visual content.

### Strengths
# Strengths

1. **Enhanced Multi-modal Understanding:** MMICL's approach to handling complex prompts with multiple images and text could significantly improve VLMs' performance on downstream tasks.

2. **State-of-the-Art Performance:** The paper reports new benchmarks in zero-shot performance on vision-language tasks, indicating a substantial advancement over existing models. On MME, MMICL seems to achieve the best average scores compared with current VLMs on cognition and perception tasks, indicating a strong performance. On MMBench, they also achieved SOTA performance which demonstrate the prominent ability of MMICL.

3. **Reduction in Language Bias:** MMICL reduces the chances of VLMs ignoring visual content, which is crucial for accurate multi-modal reasoning. Their experiments provided promising results.

### Weaknesses
# Weaknesses

Although I can spot many advantages in MMICL and I truly believe its a wonderful model. This paper also did a lot of experiments to demonstrate its ability. But here I should address few weaknesses and the authors should better clarify it to make the work's claims more sound.

1. The paper emphasizes the use of interleaved image-text data pairs and in-context learning data for training, suggesting this approach is beneficial for understanding complex multi-modal prompts. However, without experimental comparisons, it's unclear if interleaved pairs offer a substantial advantage over single image-text pairs. It's possible that similar results could be achieved without the interleaved structure. The authors should clarify whether the interleaved structure is a key contributor to performance improvements or if it primarily serves to enhance demonstrations and applicability to real-world scenarios. Specifically, the paper lacks a controlled experiment where the model is trained with single image-text pairs and compared to the interleaved approach on the same tasks. This would isolate the impact of the interleaved structure.

2. The paper's focus on MME and MMBench, which involve fixed-format questions, might not fully represent the model's ability to handle freeform answers. Benchmarks like MM-VET[1], which require freeform answers and are evaluated by GPT-4, could provide a different perspective on the model's capabilities. A more diverse set of benchmarks, including those requiring freeform answers, would offer a more comprehensive evaluation of the model's performance and generalizability. The current evaluation does not sufficiently demonstrate the model's ability to generate coherent and contextually relevant free-form responses, which is crucial for real-world applications.

3. The paper does not fully discuss why MMICL's architecture is superior to the Flamingo or other paradigms[2] or other existing methods, which leaves the comparison incomplete. Many claims and designs in Section 2.1/2.2 seems just the author's considerations and are lacking sufficient reasons. Although conducting more comparative experiments may be challenging, the author should at least provide more explanations in these aspects to make the arguments in this paper more substantial. Instead of presenting a final result by combining all designs together, the author should provide further explanations to justify their choices. For example, the paper should elaborate on why the Q-former is the optimal choice for feature extraction compared to other methods, and why the specific architecture is better suited for interleaved image-text processing than the Flamingo's cross-attention mechanism. The lack of ablation studies on architectural choices makes it difficult to assess the necessity of each component.

For the dataset and training methodology to be validated, the authors should ideally show that the interleaved image-text pairs lead to better model performance than traditional single image-text pairs, across a range of tasks that include both fixed-format and freeform response requirements. Additionally, the paper should discuss any limitations of the proposed methods, such as potential overfitting to a specific data structure or benchmark, to provide a balanced and transparent evaluation of the approach.

### Questions
Most of my considerations are at the Weaknesses part. The authors may refer it and consider to address these questions.

1. Why using interleaved image-text data for instruction tuning an VLM would be considered beneficial? In terms of the model performance, is there any experimental comparison to support this claim?

2. Is there any quantitative results to support the models ability in free-form answering (evaluated by GPT-4)?

3. Why the MMICL's design is better for image-text interleaved chatting than Flamingo-based or other architectures?

### Summary
The paper explores a pioneering context schema, designed to bolster the VLM's proficiency in effectively handling multimodal inputs and facilitating in-context learning. This method mainly aims to construct the Text-Image Interleaved Dataset (MIC dataset) with the objective of enhancing the VLM's in-context learning capabilities. There are three distinct formats in the MIC dataset, including single image format, multiple interconnected images format, and in-context format, which respectively are tailored for different instances of various vision-language tasks. In experiments, the authors demonstrate that the proposed method (MMICL) outperforms baselines on a wide range of general vision-language tasks, especially on MME and MMBench benchmarks. Moreover, MMICL also shows in-context learning ability on some traditional vision-language tasks in the few-shot setting.

### Strengths
+ This paper offers a novel perspective on how to construct image-text interleaved instruction datasets. It highlights how VLM (Vision-Language Model) can simultaneously acquire in-context learning ability during the visual instruction tuning process.
+ The MIC dataset proposed by this paper covers a wide range of vision-language tasks, including Image Captioning, Video Caption, VQA, VideoQA, Visual Reasoning, Visual Dialogue, and Image Classification.
+ The experiments conducted on a wide range of general vision-language tasks are very comprehensive. The average results on the MME and MMBench benchmarks demonstrate the impressive zero-shot performance of MMICL compared with other baselines.

### Weaknesses
 + The few-shot performance improvement of MMICL appears to be somewhat limited. For instance, in Table 4, except for the VizWiz dataset, in some cases (e.g., FLAN-T5-XXL and Instruct-FLAN-T5-XL), MMICL does not demonstrate significant improvements on other test datasets when adding in-context examples.
+ The lack of exploration of various interleaved image-text data formats for VLM's in-context learning ability is evident. It is unclear whether only the in-context format (equation 3) can enhance in-context learning ability or if the multiple interconnected images format (equation 2) can also play a certain role.
+ In Table 4, I observe that MMICL with different backbones exhibits significant performance differences in certain tasks. For instance, the performance gap between MMICL (Instruct-FLAN-T5-XL) and MMICL (Instruct-FLAN-T5-XXL) on Flickr 30k is as large as 34.6. A similar trend can be seen in the VizWiz dataset, with InstructBLIP (Flan-XL) scoring 32.08, while InstructBLIP (Flan-XXL) drops to 15.11. This phenomenon is absent in InstructBLIP. What could be the reason for this? 
+ In Table 4, MMICL (FLAN-T5-XL) shows an improvement of approximately 25.13 in the 4-shot setting compared to 0-shot, whereas MMICL (FLAN-T5-XXL) only improves by 3.82. It's perplexing that increasing the backbone's size leads to a significant decline in few-shot performance. What could possibly be the underlying reason for this?

### Summary
The paper introduces a context learning scheme for multimodal large language models and constructs a instruction dataset. It demonstrates the model's comprehension ability when dealing with complex multi-modal prompts and uncovers its potential for in-context learning. Overall, this work leans more towards a technical report, but it is comprehensive.

### Strengths
1. Compared to open-/flamingo, kosmos, the model can more easily handle multiple image inputs and their relationships.

2. Through prompt engineering, it unifies more tasks.

3. More instruction tuning data has been obtained through chatgpt.

### Weaknesses
The synthetic dataset, training paradigms, and model structure have not undergone an ablation study, so the specific gain is unclear.

This work has expanded further on the data level compared to works such as InstrutBlip and LLaVA, and has achieved better results, which I am not surprised by. However, its design is slightly complex, and it contains a lot of prompt engineering. I believe this work is above the borderline, but it may not be classified as a 'good' paper here.

### Summary
The author proposed a new kind of in-context learning, called multi-modal in-context learning, to deal with multi-modal inputs. To train model, the author proposed a novel context scheme and constructed the Multi-modal In-Context Learning (MIC) dataset. Experiments are conducted to show the advantages on several well known datasets.

### Strengths
1. The targeting problem is interesting.

2. Improvements are achieved on several well-known datasets.

3. Extensive experimental results are provided.

### Weaknesses
1. It seems that the explicit meaning of MMICL is not mentioned in this paper. Some explanations might be helpful.

2. The experiments are conducted on T5 family models, which are encoder-decoder architecture models. Why not use the decoder-only models?

3. Model sizes should be included in some tables. Otherwise, it is not easy to compare the competing models.

4. It seems that bigger model does not always have better performance. Is there any explanations for that?

### Summary
The paper introduces an interleaved image-text dataset built upon public VQA/captioning/Reasoning datasets such as Flickr/VQAv2/MSRVTT. It proposes several schemes to convert existing datasets into interleaved-image-text formats. The proposed dataset is used to train a VQA model that can take multiple images as input to answer questions (following user instructions). It shows state-of-the-art results on recent VQA benchmarks such as MME/MMBench, and demonstrated ability to improve downstream task performance using few-shot image-text samples. However, the writing of this paper is extremely bad, consisting of numerous typos, grammatical mistakes, and sentences that are difficult to understand. There are lots of missing details regarding dataset curation and evaluation protocols.

### Strengths
The proposed dataset with 5.8M samples could be useful for the multimodal community. The proposed MMICL model demonstrates top-tier performance on recent VQA benchmarks (MME/MMBench) compared to earlier models such as LLaVA and MiniGPT-4.

### Weaknesses
First, I find it **extremely hard to follow the methodology** in this paper. For example, as dataset curation is one of the most important contributions of this work, I am not able to understand what efforts the authors put in order to gather a massive 5.8M interleaved-image-text datasets. For instance, Could you explain how you manage to collect the sample as shown in Figure 3(b) and 4? In these two figures, it is shown two people quarreling with each other; this requires the original dataset to not just have bounding boxes for person1 and person2, but also the action relation (quarreling) between these two bounding boxes. I would appreciate if the authors could point us to the actual dataset used to gather this particular example, and explain if extra (and perhaps costly) human annotation is required to get such samples.

The authors should also provide more visual examples from each dataset and more detailed description on how you convert them into instruction-following formats. For example, the current Section 2.3 is very hard to understand. It says *“Next, we employ ChatGPT to rewrite the instructions to describe the key characteristics of each task accurately”* — what does it mean by *“key characteristics of each task”* and how did ChatGPT come up with them?

There are **lots of missing details** regarding model evaluation. 

- For one example, in Table 4, how did the authors select the few-shot samples? Will different few-shot samples affect the performance? No variance/std is provided in Table4.

- How did you manually split ScienceQA-IMG into two groups that require images or not? Did you hire human annotators for this task? What rationales did the annotators employ?

- Table 8 shows that Flickr/VQAv2 are used in your training set. Then how could Table 4 claim that your model achieves good “zero-shot” and “few-shot” performance on Flickr/VQAv2?

- Table 8 attempted to show the licenses for all training datasets, but almost half are labeled with “Unknown” license. This is counter-intuitive because some widely used datasets such as Flickr have well-documented licenses listed on their websites. 

- Do you use the same datasets during both stage-1 and stage-2 pre-training?

- As you show on Table 8, Winoground only has 800 samples. How could there be an image score of 44.99?

Finally, it is unclear if the performance boost really comes from having more interleaved-image-text data, because the current paper does not perform ablation on the selection of training data.

The paper has way too many typos. To list a few:
- Figure 1: missing a white space “MMICLtypically”.
- Page 2: fall should be fail? “their context schemes fall to”
- Page 3: missing a period “multiple images In Fig. 2.b”
- Figure 3: missing a period “unified format”
- Page 4: missing a white space “MMICLin”
- Page 8: hinds or hints “provide hinds”

### Questions
I think the current writing really hurts the paper. In addition to improve the writing quality, it is unclear what the key innovation / scientific insight is. The authors should ablate the use of training data in order to highlight the advantage of including interleaved image-text samples, which seems extremely costly to obtain.
