# Meta Continual Learning Revisited: Implicitly Enhancing Online Hessian Approximation via Variance Reduction

- Decision: Accept
- Scores: 8, 8, 1

## Abstract
Regularization-based methods have so far been among the *de facto* choices for continual learning. Recent theoretical studies have revealed that these methods all boil down to relying on the Hessian matrix approximation of model weights. 
However, these methods suffer from suboptimal trade-offs between knowledge transfer and forgetting due to fixed and unchanging Hessian estimations during training.
Another seemingly parallel strand of Meta-Continual Learning (Meta-CL) algorithms enforces alignment between gradients of previous tasks and that of the current task. 
In this work we revisit Meta-CL and for the first time bridge it with regularization-based methods. Concretely, Meta-CL implicitly approximates Hessian in an online manner, which enjoys the benefits of timely adaptation but meantime suffers from high variance induced by random memory buffer sampling. 
We are thus highly motivated to combine the best of both worlds, through the proposal of Variance Reduced Meta-CL (VR-MCL) to achieve both timely and accurate Hessian approximation.
Through comprehensive experiments across three datasets and various settings, we consistently observe that VR-MCL outperforms other SOTA methods, which further validates the effectiveness of VR-MCL.

### Summary
The paper introduces a novel approach called VRMCL (Variance Reduced Meta Continual Learning), integrating a hyper-gradient variance reduction technique for Meta Continual Learning (CL). Furthermore, it offers theoretical regret bounds for the proposed method. The paper extensively evaluates the VRMCL method across three datasets, with diverse continual learning scenarios.

### Strengths
1. Clarity: The paper is well written and easy to follow.
2. Technical Proficiency: The paper showcases a highly technical.
3. Originality and Novelty: The paper introduces a novel concept focused on diminishing variance in gradient computations concerning memory buffers in online settings.
4. Comprehensive Empirical Validation: The paper includes extensive experiments and comprehensive ablation study which support the claims made in the paper.

### Weaknesses
 1. Limited Comparison:
    1. While the authors have made comparisons with recent baselines, the paper could benefit from a more extensive comparison by including well-established methods such as FTML[1] and LFW[2]. A broader comparison would provide a more comprehensive evaluation of the proposed method's strengths and weaknesses.
2. Limited Experimental Width:
    1. Although the authors have conducted evaluations on popular datasets like CIFAR10, CIFAR100, and TinyImageNet, it would be good to test the effectiveness of the proposed method on larger datasets, such as ImageNet-1K. This would offer insights into the algorithm's performance in handling catastrophic forgetting in longer sequences.
    2. Additionally, the experiments could be enhanced by varying the number of tasks on each dataset, thereby showcasing the adaptability of VR-MCL under different task configurations.
3. Lack of Memory Update Strategy Explanation:
    1. The paper could benefit from a more thorough explanation of the memory update strategy employed in the VR-MCL algorithm. Given the algorithm's reliance on the Memory Buffer, a clearer and more detailed description of the update mechanism is essential to provide a comprehensive understanding of the methodology.

### Questions
1. Regarding the algorithm, the paper mentions that the memory buffer is updated to ensure a balanced storage of tasks. Could you provide more details on how this task-balancing process is implemented within the algorithm?
2. It would be valuable to include additional experiments as mentioned earlier, especially those assessing the method's performance under scenarios involving varying task lengths across each datasets.

### Summary
This paper focused on the branch of Meta-Continual Learning (Meta-CL) methods in the context of Continual Learning (CL). By characterizing the Meta-CL algorithms as a new perspective of up-to-date Hessian matrix approximation, the authors tried to bridge the gap between the Meta-CL and the regularized-based CL methods. Under this viewpoint, Meta-CL implicitly approximated the Hessian in an online manner through the use of hypergradient in the bi-level optimization process. To address the erroneous information during the Hessian estimation due to the sampling process from the random memory buffer, the authors proposed Variance Reduced Meta-CL (VR-MCL) to control the high variance of the hypergradient under online continual learning. With a theoretical analysis, the authors showed that the proposed VR-MCL is equivalent to the inclusion of a penalty term within the implicit Hessian estimation in Meta-CL. The experimental results on three benchmarks indicated that the proposed method outperformed the regularization-based and Meta-CL baselines.

### Strengths
1. The motivation of this work is clear and easy to follow.
2. It is interesting to see that an inherent connection can be built between the regularization-based methods and Meta-CL methods via the roles of the Hessian information in these two methodological streams.
3. This work provided theoretical analyses and empirical verifications to help to better understand the motivation.

### Weaknesses
1. Most parts of the mathematical derivations are easy to follow. However, some detailed notations are not clear in the context, which reduces the readability. For instance, the precise definition of \(G_{\theta_{b}}\), which appears after Eqn.(4), is not immediately clear, making it difficult to understand the meaning of \(\Delta_{b}\). The lack of clarity around how this relates to the full batch gradient hinders a straightforward comprehension of the variance estimation process.
2. The motivation of some experimental designs was not too clear, such as the imbalance CL setting. It is not apparent how the imbalanced setting directly relates to the core contribution of the paper, which is variance reduction in Hessian estimation. The paper does not provide a clear explanation of why superior performance in this setting validates the proposed method's effectiveness in controlling the variance of the hypergradient. The connection between the imbalance in the memory buffer and the Hessian estimation process needs to be more explicitly addressed.
3. It seems the math derivation process needs some strict assumptions. I doubt the gap between the theoretical findings and the empirical applications. Specifically:
   - In Proposition 2, the assumption that \(\theta_{(K)}\) is located in the \(\epsilon\)-neighborhood of the optimal model parameter seems quite strong and lacks justification. The practical implications of this assumption and its validity in real-world scenarios are not discussed.
   - In Proposition 3, the assumption that the batch size of the inner step adaptation is sufficiently large is vague. The paper does not specify how large is 'sufficiently large' to ensure the theoretical analyses hold, nor does it discuss how this was determined in the experiments. The lack of clarity on this point makes it difficult to assess the practical relevance of the theoretical results.
4. In Proposition 2, the authors mentioned the assumption of \(\beta\). However, it was not contained in the final main conclusion, which raises questions about its role and impact on the overall result.

### Questions
1. I wonder whether the assumptions during the mathematical derivation always hold in the practical scenarios. For example:
   - In Proposition 2, the authors assumed that $\theta_{(K)}$ is lolcated in the $\epsilon$-neighbourhood of the optimal model parameter. Is it too strong?
   - In Proposition 3, the authors assumed that the batch size of the inner step adaptation is sufficiently large. I wonder how large is enough to make the following analyses hold. And how did the authors set it during the practical training?
2. The motivation for the evaluations under the imbalance CL setting was not clear to me. I did not get the relationship between the superior performance under this setting and the main objective of this paper. Or does the author just intend to show that the proposed method could still perform well under this challenging setting? Besides, it was disappointing to see that the authors did not provide further analyses about why the proposed method could address this challenging setting.
3. In Proposition 2, the authors mentioned the assumption of $\beta$. However, it was not contained in the final main conclusion.
4. After Eqn.(4), $G_{\theta_{b}}$ appeared without further explanations, which made the reader fail to have a straightforward comprehension of the meaning of $\Delta_{b}$.
5. How about the time and memory complexity of the proposed method compared to the baseline approaches, especially the Meta-CL methods, like LA-MAML? Could the authors provide quantitative comparisons? I believe such a comparison will help the readers to better understand the superiority of the proposed VR-MCL.

### Summary
In this paper, the author revisited the methodology of Meta-Continual Learning (Meta-CL) and, for the first time, provides a formal connection between meta-continual learning and seminal regularization-based methods (like Elastic Weight Consolidation (EWC)) which mainly exploits the empirical Hessian matrix to provide the regularization to counter forgetting. The main finding is that Meta-CL methods implicitly utilize the second-order Hessian information through the hypergradient obtained by bi-level optimization for meta-learning. From this new perspective, the author further points out the issue existing in the methodology of Meta-CL, i.e., the presence of erroneous information in the Hessian information due to insufficient memory data. To resolve the problem, the author correspondingly proposes a momentum-based Variance-Reduced Meta-CL (VR-MCL) method and provides extensive theoretical analysis to demonstrate how the proposed method can impose a penalty on the online estimated Hessian such that the model can be updated with caution to preserve crucial parameters. Extensive experiments are conducted on standard continual learning benchmarks, and the proposed theoretical method outperform both representative and state-of-the-art (SOTA) continual learning methods.

### Strengths
1. The reviewer really enjoys reading this paper. This should be the first paper that formally and clearly dissects the relationship between seminal regularization-based methods and the methodology of meta-continual learning. The key message and insights are conveyed smoothly in the whole paper, and the author does a really good job of presenting them in a decent way. Table 1 provides a very precise and clear summary and comparison of the seminar and the state-of-the-art regularization-based method for the reader to get their main idea in common, making it easier for the reader to comprehend the novelty and contribution made by the present paper. Figures 1 and 2 are also compact and reduce the difficulties for the reader to understand the technical details of the iterative update process, which also highlights the difference made in this paper.

As the Hessian information is widely used not only in continual learning but also in many different areas of deep learning (e.g., meta-learning and flatness-aware optimization), the reviewer believes that the theoretical findings provided by this paper may not only motivate novel methods on Meta-CL but may also motivate novel methods for other areas in general.

2. The unification of the Meta-CL and Regularization-based method is sound. Although there exist papers that try to unify different regularization-based CL methods in a unified framework, the CL methods they considered are mainly for CL in a fully-supervised setting, to the best of my knowledge, this paper should be the first one to connect the regularization-based CL methods with the methodology of Meta-CL, which may stand as a new research direction in the future.

3. The reviewer also appreciates the understanding provided by the author in Section 4.2 after Proposition 3. It is refreshing to see that the variance-reduce method can ensure cautious updates such that the model can prevent excessive updates triggered by the wrongly estimated low-curvature direction of the Hessian, which may mitigate the partiality and erroneousness in the insufficient memory data, which should also be a desideratum about the kind of model update we should purse for. The insight may also motivate future work in continual learning and may also in areas like parameter-efficient finetuning.

4. The extensive comparison with state-of-the-art methods in both CL and Meta-CL further demonstrates the significance and effectiveness of the proposed method. The questions listed in each subsection of the Experiments section provide good guidance for the reviewer to focus on and reason about the results. It is also great to see that the author also conducts many empirical analyses in both the main paper and supplementary to validate the correctness of the proposed theorem.

### Weaknesses
1. In Proposition 3, the author assumes that the batch size for inner step adaptation is sufficiently large. How do we quantify the term "sufficiently large" in reality? Is there any principle we can obtain from the proposed theorem to guide us in choosing the batch size?
