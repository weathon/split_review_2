# BayOTIDE: Bayesian Online Multivariate Time series Imputation with functional decomposition

- Decision: Reject
- Scores: 8, 5, 5, 5, 5

## Abstract
In real-world scenarios such as traffic and energy management, we frequently encounter large volumes of time-series data characterized by missing values, noise, and irregular sampling patterns. While numerous imputation methods have been proposed, the majority tend to operate within a local horizon, which involves dividing long sequences into batches of fixed-length segments for model training. This local horizon often leads to the overlooking of global trends and periodic patterns. More importantly, most methods assume the observations are sampled at regular timestamps, and fail to handle complex irregular sampled time series in various applications. Additionally, most existing methods are learned in an offline manner. Thus, it is not suitable for applications with rapidly arriving streaming data.  To address these challenges, we propose \ours: Bayesian Online Multivariate Time series Imputation with functional decomposition. Our method conceptualizes multivariate time series as the weighted combination of groups of low-rank temporal factors with different patterns.  We employ a suite of Gaussian Processes (GPs),each with a unique kernel, as functional priors to model these factors. For computational efficiency, we further convert the GPs into a state-space prior by constructing an equivalent stochastic differential equation (SDE), and developing a scalable algorithm for online inference. The proposed method can not only handle imputation over arbitrary timestamps, but also offer uncertainty quantification and interpretability for the downstream application. We evaluate our method on both synthetic and real-world datasets.

### Summary
This paper proposes a data imputation framework of multivariate nonstationary time series. The framework follows the classical Bayesian PCA (BPCA)-like imputation technique with the exception that the prior distribution is designed so the trend and seasonal components are captured.
 
Specifically, the model assumes the observation at each time point to be a linear combination of a few static basis vectors, where the coefficients of the linear combination are time-dependent. To allow seasonal and trend decomposition, the authors introduce specific prior distributions in the form of the Gaussian process (GP), where the temporal correlation is represented with the kernel function.
 
Although the inference procedure is analytically intractable, the authors leverage a variational Bayes approximation and derive a closed-form online updating equation.

### Strengths
- Solid formulation.
- Derivation of an analytic form of online updating equation for data imputation/model updates.
- The capability of splitting the trend and seasonal components, which is actually not straight forward when nonlinear temporal correlations are considered.


This is a good work. To the best of my knowledge, the framework is new. The basic concept of the BPCA-based imputation approach has been known for decades, but the paper adds a few new elements. 

I vote for accepting the paper.

### Weaknesses
 - Section 3.2 does not seem to play any role. Perhaps this paper has been rejected before, and the authors just wanted to add a "modern"-looking section. I got it. But it looks hardly related. The introduction of a state-space GP in section 3.2 feels disconnected from the core methodology presented later. The connection between the state-space GP and the actual imputation framework remains unclear, making its inclusion seem superfluous and potentially misleading. The paper does not adequately explain how the state-space representation facilitates the online learning or the trend/seasonal decomposition, leaving the reader questioning its purpose.
- Very poor proof-reading quality. Basic latex commands such as \eqref, \cite, etc. are not properly used. I know this might be re-re… submission, but PLEASE be respectful to the reviewers by meticulously proof-reading the manuscript before submission.

### Questions
- How does the well-known non-identifiability with respect to the unitary transformation in the UV-factorization form (1) take effect on the result?
- I am not clear how the almost linear trend could be separated in the result presented in Fig.1. How did the kernel expansion with the GPs produce the linear-looking trend component? What is the intuition behind it? 
- Although I support accepting this paper, I am not 100% sure about the novelty. Bayesian PCA-based imputation is well-established. I know the main novelty comes from the time-series part, but your paper was not very clear about the "delta" from the pre-deep learning imputation works. To defend your work, please elaborate on the novelty in light of existing works. I just want to help you --- I suspect many ICLR reviewers do not have a strong understanding of the machine learning basics such as Bayesian PCA, and hence, papers like this one tend to receive unfairly low ratings.

### Summary
This paper highlights the limitations of conventional time-series data imputation methods, which often disregard global trends, presume consistent sampling intervals, and are constrained to offline processing. To address these shortcomings, the authors introduce BayOTIDE, a groundbreaking imputation approach tailored for irregularly sampled data. Central to BayOTIDE's methodology is the interpretation of time series as amalgamations of low rank temporal factors, harnessing Gaussian Processes with varied kernels. By adeptly transitioning these processes into a state space model using stochastic differential equations, the method ensures computational efficiency and real time inference capabilities.

### Strengths
1. The paper tackles prevalent issues in time-series imputation, such as neglecting global trends, assumptions of regular sampling, and offline-only operation.

2. The introduction of treating time series as combinations of low-rank temporal factors is a novel perspective.

3. The transformation of Gaussian Processes into a state-space model using stochastic differential equations ensures the method is computationally efficient, which is crucial for real-world applications.

### Weaknesses
1. My main concerns regard writing/presentation and theoretical results.

2. The writing is rough, with some unclear and insufficient descriptions. 

3. Unclear theoretical support.

### Questions
1. The paper requires improved structuring, particularly in terms of presenting the supporting theoretical guarantees.

### Summary
This paper proposes BAYOTIDE, a novel Bayesian model for online multivariate time series data imputation. BAYOTIDE models the data as a weighted sum of temporal factors governed by Gaussian processes. Here, the Gaussian processes can be discretized on a random collection of time steps as a Markov model with Gaussian transition. This enables the model to deal with irregularly sampled data. By viewing the model as a state-space model, an online inference procedure is derived using Kalman filtering. Thus, the model can handle missing data. Experiments on real and synthetic data show the competitiveness of the model.

### Strengths
- The paper tackles the problem imputing missing values of an irregularly sampled time series data. The setting is very practical. A lot of existing methods only consider regularly sampled data, and it is non-trivial for them to handle irregular data.
- This paper extends the idea of TIDER and put it in a novel framework combining Gaussian process and state-space model. This allows the model to perform 1. online imputation 2. uncertainty quantification on missing values and 3. handle irregular data
- Analysis on the complexity of running cost is given
- Experiments on real and synthetic data show the competitiveness of the proposed method

### Weaknesses
 - There are typos and indentation issues in the paper
- Although there are no existing online multivariate imputation model, the comparison with online univariate & probabilistic imputation models, e.g. state-space model with Kalman filtering, can be included in the experiment
- RTS smoother is listed in Algorithm 1 as an option to compute the full posterior. However, it seems that the formula is not given in the paper or the appendix
- The main advantage of considering multivariate time series is that the correlation between dimensions can be captured. It seems that all the evaluation metrics are univariate. I suggest the authors to also include multivariate metrics (e.g., energy score [1] and sum CRPS [2]) in the experiments to evaluate if the propose method can better capture the correlations than baselines
- The model size (e.g., number of parameters) is not reported in the experimental results. It is recommended to also report model size. The proposed model seems to be outperforming, but could it be because that it is using a larger model?

### Summary
The paper proposes a Gaussian processes-based method for online multivariate time series imputation. By considering a Linear time-invariant stochastic differential equation, a solution to which is a Gaussian process, and representing it as a Markov process, the paper aims to impute missing values at arbitrary time stamps. Furthermore, the model decomposes time series into multiple channels to account for factors such as trend and seasonality. The resulting approach is capable of providing probabilistic missing data imputation in online streaming tasks.

### Strengths
Overall, the idea of the paper is appealing; in particular, the continuous modelling with developing methods in Neural ODEs/GPs seems a natural direction to consider. From a methodological point of view, the method is able to provide missing data imputation ability in very relevant realistic scenarios (online, continuous setting) which is definitely a notable strength.

### Weaknesses
The evaluation approach remains weak: I am not sure the considered data sets are not varied enough, as missing data patterns considered in the paper are quite limited. At this point, I cannot give a rating above 2 for contribution because of limited evaluation (i.e., it is unclear how well the proposed approach performs in a more general settings).

-- Only 50% and 70% of observed ratios are considered in the simulation results. To evaluate how the proposed method compares in more general to other benchmarks, it is important to consider various benchmarks: 90%, 80%, 70%, 60%, 50%. Is the approach beneficial at all levels of missing values or do the benefits come only at a certain level?

-- Only missingness at random is considered. GP-VAE paper considers the following mechanisms: random, spatial, 2 temporal and missing, not at random.  While spatial would not be relevant here I presume, a more relevant multivariate time series mechanisms of missingness can be considered. 

-- The approach considers trend and seasonality explicitly. I am not sure any of the compared benchmarks explicitly consider these channels of the time series. Therefore, I would at least include a standard multi-output GP framework with linear + periodic kernels or a spectral kernel (the implementation of the latter should be available in gpytorch). In particular, on the example represented in Figure 1 I would expect these standard methods to perform well. 

-- Results in Table 2 appear over a single run; a more extensive Monte Carlo study should be considered with corresponding standard deviations in the results.

### Summary
This paper introduces BayOTIDE (Bayesian Online Multivariate Time series Imputation with functional decomposition), a novel approach for handling missing data in multivariate time series. BayOTIDE views multivariate time series as a combination of various low-rank temporal factors with distinct patterns. A group of Gaussian Processes with different kernels is utilized as functional priors. To enhance computational efficiency, the GPs are transformed into a state-space prior using an equivalent stochastic differential equation, enabling the development of a scalable online inference algorithm. One of the key advantages of the proposed method is its ability to perform imputation over arbitrary time points in the time series.

### Strengths
The strengths include: 
1. Representing multivariate time series data through low-rank temporal factors with distinct patterns for improved insight. 
2. Robust handling of missing data using probabilistic reasoning and uncertainty quantification. 
3. Efficient online inference through a conversion of Gaussian Processes into a state-space prior. 
4. Suitable for imputing data at arbitrary time points.

### Weaknesses
I am not an expert in the field of time series imputation, and therefore, I am unable to assess the novelty of this work within the imputation domain. However, I have a strong background in Bayesian frameworks and Gaussian processes. From a methodological perspective, key techniques employed in this work, such as the conversion of Gaussian Processes into a state-space model and the use of conditional Expectation Propagation for posterior approximation, are all existing methods. The methodological aspect of the paper does not introduce significant innovations. Nevertheless, it is possible that these methods could hold value within the imputation field. 

Furthermore, the notation used in this paper is not ideal. As a common practice, scalars are typically represented using lowercase letters, vectors using bold lowercase letters, and matrices using bold uppercase letters. The notation employed in the paper is confusing. For instance, in Equation (1), F (a matrix) and L (a vector) are presented in the same format. Additionally, $\omega(t)$ (a scalar) in Equation (1) and $\mathbf{y}_n^d$ (a scalar) in Equation (5) are both scalars but are denoted differently. Similar issues can be found with various other symbols such as $U$, $V$, and so forth. These concerns are not exhaustively listed here.

### Questions
Why use Matern kernel to model the trend factors, not other kernels? Any explanation?

I understand that the conversion of Gaussian Processes into a state-space model is a computationally efficient approach to bypass the costly kernel matrix computation and facilitates the derivation of subsequent online inference. There are also other techniques based on low-rank approximations to reduce the computational complexity of GPs. Is it possible to incorporate such methods into your framework?

Recommendation: Move "We highlight that all the parameters of the LTI-SDE....can be derived from the given stationary kernel function." under equation (2). This will help readers gain a clearer understanding of how the parameters of LTI-SDE are obtained.
