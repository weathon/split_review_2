- Decision: Accept
- Scores: 8, 5, 6, 5, 1

## Abstract
The carbon footprint associated with large language models (LLMs) is a significant concern, encompassing emissions from their training, inference, experimentation, and storage processes, including operational and embodied carbon emissions. An essential aspect is accurately estimating the carbon impact of emerging LLMs even before their training, which heavily relies on GPU usage. Existing studies have reported the carbon footprint of LLM training, but only one tool, mlco2, can predict the carbon footprint of new neural networks prior to physical training. However, mlco2 has several serious limitations. It cannot extend its estimation to dense or mixture-of-experts (MoE) LLMs, disregards critical architectural parameters, focuses solely on GPUs, and cannot model embodied carbon footprints. Addressing these gaps, we introduce \textit{\carb}, an end-to-end carbon footprint projection model designed for both dense and MoE LLMs. Compared to mlco2, \carb~significantly enhances the accuracy of carbon footprint estimations for various LLMs.

### Confidence
3: You are fairly confident in your assessment. It is possible that you did not understand some parts of the submission or that you are unfamiliar with some pieces of related work. Math/other details were not carefully checked.

### Summary
This paper introduces LLMCarbon, a comprehensive cost model developed to estimate the carbon footprint associated with various stages of LLM computation, such as training, inference, experimentation, and storage. LLMCarbon extends its applicability beyond previously established models by incorporating support for a broader range of LLM architectures, with a specific focus on the mixture-of-experts architecture and more types of hardware. The paper provides an in-depth discussion of LLMCarbon’s cost model, covering aspects like parameter count, FLOPs, and hardware efficiency. To validate LLMCarbon’s efficacy, we present experimental results across different LLMs and hardware configurations.

### Strengths
This paper is both well-written and well-motivated, addressing the critical issue of environmental sustainability by studying the carbon footprint of LLM computation. The authors have proposed a cost model that appears to be both fine-grained and carefully designed, reflecting a thorough approach to this significant topic.

### Weaknesses
 - the procedure of how LLMCarborn figures out the optimal parallelism is not quite clear.
- It is not clear how to use LLMCarborn to guide the design of future generations of LLM architectures and figure AI accelerators.
- The relationships and connections between the proposed hardware efficiency and metrics like arithmetic intensity and MFU are not clear.

### Questions
- For figuring out the optimal parallelism strategy using LLMCarborn, how different are the strategies returned by LLMCarborn compared to the one solved using the compilation approach, e.g., the one proposed in [1]?
- Instead of scaling law, recent LLM pre-training efforts usually leverage a certain training number of tokens, e.g., 1T/1.4T in LLaMA. Would it be sufficient to directly use the number of training tokens instead of loss/perplexity?
- How can one use LLMCarborn to guide the designs of future generations of LLM architecture/training procedures or even AI hardware design?

### Summary
In this paper, the authors proposed an end-to-end carbon footprint predictor for llm services. Specificall, the predicted carbon footprint is the sum of two parts: operational carbon footprint and embodied carbon footprint. The former one is calculated with a model by taking model parameters, hardware efficiency as input; The latter one is calcuated with another model by taking hardware type, chip area, system power as input. Through extensive comparison experiments, the predicted results shows a better performance with at most 8.2% error.

### Strengths
- Compared with baselines, the proposed llmcarbon generalize the carbon prediction to various network architectures (dense llm and moe llm), various hardwares (gpu and tpu) and various phase (training, inference, experimentaiton and storage).

- The key submodels in llmcarbon are elaborated with mathematic formulation and detail description. All the architecture is easy to follow.

### Weaknesses
 - Some parameter is crucial to the final predicted results, the process of setting parameters should be clarified. For example, in equation 3, \alpha, \beta are the fitting parameters. However, the fitting dataset and fitting method are missing.

- Apart form the parameters discussed in the paper, more factors also affect the footprint. e.g., the paramter precision (fp16, int8, int4) and the implementation of kernel operation.

- There are not any text description about figure 3 and figure 4.

- The proposed llmcarbon is somewhat like a system design with many prior experience from sota, the algorithm contribution are not notable.

### Summary
The paper provides a tool for estimating the carbon footprint of large language models (LLMs). The tool accounts for each life-cycle phase of an LLM: embodied carbon, training, inference, storage. The energy used by hardware is accounted for by considering data center characteristics and model architecture attributes. Comparison with published carbon numbers shows less than 10% error in estimation.

### Strengths
- Problem statement is clear
- Carbon footprint considers a comprehensive view of LLM life-cycle
- Use of real-world data points from literature to perform carbon footprints
- Validation against published carbon footprint numbers
- Low error rates in estimation

### Weaknesses
 - It is not clear how the "ground truth" carbon footprint numbers were established by prior works. Did they perform actual measurements? This is a concern because if the numbers are estimated, and there is an overlap in estimation methods, then it's not surprising that the error rate is low.
- It is difficult to separate the contributions of the paper from the prior works. Much of the equations and parameters of the equations are based on prior work. Is the contribution of the paper to sum up carbon numbers from prior work equations? It is not clear what research questions the paper addresses. Are all of the equations well-known, and did prior works estimate similar metrics (such as cost or energy use) for ML architectures using them?
- There is no measure of utility of an LLM. For example, one can reduce the emissions by increasing test loss, but a high test loss can lead to poor performance which cannot be used in the real-world. It'll be interesting to measure the utility across classical ML models such as those used for classification, regression, translation, etc. 
- It would be good to discuss the utility of the measurement tool. Is the expectation that model designers pick an appropriate data center, architecture, or training dataset to use based on carbon footprint? Much of the time such decisions are constrained by other requirements. For example, model designers have little control over the embodied footprint of the ML model.

### Questions
- Are ground truth carbon footprint values based on actual measurements? 
- Did you tune your equations or its parameters to reduce the error? If so, how do we know that LLMCarbon is not "overfitting"?

### Summary
The main contribution of this paper is to present a comprehensive model for end-to-end carbon footprint of LLMs. Observing that LLMs can be a major contributed to overall carbon footprint, the authors model its carbon footprint from both operational and embodied perspectives, and presents detailed results for different types of architectures.

### Strengths
Modeling carbon footprint is an interesting (and increasingly important) research direction. This submission is probably one of the early papers on the topic.

### Weaknesses
Not clear whether the authors' definition of embodied carbon is accurate.
Not clear where the carbon coefficient factors in in the model formulation.

### Questions
While the paper certainly addresses an important topic, there are at least three issues with it, from the perspective of this reviewer:


1) It seems to me that the authors definition of embodied carbon is the carbon emitted during the production of the hardware on which LLM models run. If that is the case, why? Because that hardware is not just used for running LLM workloads; it is. probably used for running other workloads as well. In my humble opinion, the embodied carbon -- in the case of LLMs -- should represent the carbon emitted during the training, as trained model is the main product/output of LLM. What do authors think about this?

2) It is not immediately evident to me how carbon (emission) factor is accounted for in this modeling. In principle, this coefficient is location dependent and consequently depending on where you are ruining your LLMs, you should get a different carbon footprint. Can the authors clarify that?

3) While I appreciate the importance of carbon modeling of LLMs, it is not clear from this work i) whether the paper is relevant to ICLR as it does not address any core topic in learning, and ii) how it can be used for optimization purposes.

### Confidence
4: You are confident in your assessment, but not absolutely certain. It is unlikely, but not impossible, that you did not understand some parts of the submission or that you are unfamiliar with some pieces of related work.

### Summary
The work builds an analytic model that predicts carbon equivalent emissions of LLM training and deployment. The model is extensive and contains variables and functions such as scaling laws, parallelism used, mixture of experts, data center efficiencies, and embodied carbon footprint.

Recommendation: While the model could further be extended to include more detailed variables, it is a groundbreaking effort that will lay the foundation for all future carbon models. I recommend this work to be highlighted at the conference.

### Strengths
- a very comprehensive model that captures previously neglected variables that led to widely inaccurate carbon emission predictions
- uses scaling laws and other variables to make accurate predictions of the carbon emissions of any training run
- validation of the model with reported carbon footprints in the literature.

### Weaknesses
 - the mixture of expert models seems to use regular scaling laws equations for performance prediction. More appropriate would be to use the equations from the routed scaling laws paper.
- some factors are not very well discussed. For example, experimentation can have a large variance of CO2eq used. For deployment, more experimentation is usually undertaken to improve model efficiency through speculative decoding and distillation. A short discussion on the most CO2eq intensive factors and how they might differ between companies/institutions would be appropriate (no need to model this)
- the inference benchmarking setup using 16 A100s, batch size 32 and 128 tokens seems arbitrarily chosen and not representative of common deployment scenarios. This limits the practical relevance of the inference carbon footprint analysis.

### Questions
Comments:
- Figure 6 and 7 caption seem to be swapped

Questions:
- why do you use 16 A100s, batch size 32 and 128 tokens for inference benchmarking? I would assume the most common deployment strategies for inference are (1) 8x A100 + NVSwitch with batch size of 64-128 for token-by-token generation and (2) personal deployment with batch size 1 (this can be significant for T5 and other open source LLMs which enjoy large widespreadnn use)
