- Decision: Accept
- Scores: 6, 6, 5, 3

## Abstract
Machine Learning (ML)-based optimization approaches emerge as a promising technique for solving large-scale Mixed Integer Linear Programs (MILPs). However, existing ML-based frameworks suffer from high model computation complexity, weak problem reduction, and reliance on large-scale optimizers and large training datasets, resulting in performance bottlenecks for large-scale MILPs. This paper proposes Light-MILPopt, a lightweight large-scale optimization framework that only uses a lightweight optimizer and small training dataset to solve large-scale MILPs. Specifically, Light-MILPopt can be divided into four stages: Problem Formulation for problem division to reduce model computational costs, Model-based Initial Solution Prediction for predicting and constructing the initial solution using a small-scale training dataset, Problem Reduction for both variable and constraint reduction, and Data-driven Optimization for current solution improvement employing a lightweight optimizer. Experimental evaluations on four large-scale benchmark MILPs and a real-world case study demonstrate that Light-MILPopt, leveraging a lightweight optimizer and small training dataset, outperforms the state-of-the-art ML-based optimization framework and advanced large-scale solvers (e.g. Gurobi, SCIP). The results and further analyses substantiate the ML-based framework's feasibility and effectiveness in solving large-scale MILPs.

### Confidence
4: You are confident in your assessment, but not absolutely certain. It is unlikely, but not impossible, that you did not understand some parts of the submission or that you are unfamiliar with some pieces of related work.

### Summary
Problem: this paper studies the problem of using machine learning-based approaches to solve large-scale mixed integer linear programs.

Framework: since the MILP problems can be represented as bipartite graphs, the authors use the FENNEL graph partition algorithm to split the original problem into small sub-problems with low correlations. Then use Edge Aggregated Graph Attention Network and Multi-Layer Perceptron to predict the initial predicted solutions of the small-scale MILP and concatenate them to obtain the initial predicted solutions of the original large-scale MILP. With the initial solution, they confidence threshold method to reduce variable dimension, and use KNN to predict the active constraint set. Then they use Neighborhood set updating, active constraint set updating, and the REPAIR algorithm to iteratively improve solutions.

### Strengths
- The paper is clearly structured and well-written.
- From the numerical experiments, the proposed method can obtain better objectives within a limited time than other benchmarks.
- The proposed framework requires less computational resources to train than other benchmarks.

### Weaknesses
I merge this with the Questions section.

- At the end of subsection 3.2, you mentioned “the initial predicted solutions of the split small-scale MILP can be concatenated to obtain the initial predicted solutions of the original large-scale MILP.” While concatenating the multiple predicted solutions of small-scale problems, it is possible to have an initial solution that is infeasible to the large-scale problem, which part of your framework can handle this?
- Is it possible to make your framework more flexible in the sense that the number of variables/constraints can be (slightly) different from your training data?

### Confidence
3: You are fairly confident in your assessment. It is possible that you did not understand some parts of the submission or that you are unfamiliar with some pieces of related work. Math/other details were not carefully checked.

### Summary
This paper proposes Light-MILPopt, a lightweight large-scale optimization framework that only uses a small-scale optimizer and small training dataset to solve large-scale MILPs. Experiments show that it outperforms both the SOTA ML-based approaches and modern MILP solvers like Gurobi and SCIP.

### Strengths
1. Clear writing. the paper is very clearly structured and easy to go through flow.
2. Impressive results on large-scale MILPs. The experiments on large scale MILPs (significantly larger than those used in previous research) is impressive. The results suggest that Light-MILPopt significantly improves both the efficiency and effectiveness of solving MILPs. 
3. Practical motivation. Light-MILPopt achieves such improvement with only a small-scale optimizer and small training datasets. This setting is practical for real-world applications.

### Weaknesses
1. Lack of comparison with previous work. From my perspective, the impressive results in this article are based on the results and approaches in many previous studies. However, both the detailed related work and the empirical comparisons to the previous research are missing. For example, previous research has pointed out that we can use a fixed threshold to replace the complex selective networks, which might motivate the variable reduction approach in this paper. 
2. More analysis and insights on the proposed modules are encouraged. In this paper, the authors proposed multiple techniques to improve the performance of different modules. Though I believe these techniques are all effective, can you give more clues about the motivations of them? For example, What is the logic behind your design of the EGAT with half-convolutions? Is it the only choice for this module?
3. The nomenclature "large-scale/small-scale optimizer" appears unconventional. It might be more precise to employ terminology such as "advanced/modern MILP solver" and "lightweight solver".

### Summary
The paper proposes a light-weight framework for large-scale MILP problems.  The framework consists four stages, and employs advanced machine/deep learning techniques to 1). find and improve solution 2). reduce the original problem into smaller subproblems 3). coordinate between subproblems. Numerical experiments are conducted on large-scale MILP instances to demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed method.

### Strengths
The paper proposes a framework that integrates several advanced tools from ML for MILP optimization. By breaking up the problem into subproblems, the framework only needs to be trained on small-scale datasets and exhibits less dependency on the capability of the MILP solver adopted.

### Weaknesses
Overall the presentation the paper is not accessible to the readers. There are a number of grammar and stylistic issues, making it difficult to understand the details of the proposed method.

I also have some concerns around other aspects of the proposed method. See questions below.

1. The four stages in contribution 2 are actually part of contribution 1. Can you combine them?

2. In Section 2.1, "A feasible solution is optimal if it attains the minimum objective function value of the minimum MILP". 

   What's minimum MILP here? Also it is better to mention unbounded and infeasible MILPs here.

3. How does the approach guarantee feasibility of the solution? 

   The challenge of many real-life MILPs is to find a feasible solution. Most of the testing problems in the paper (all except case-study, which is unknown) seem to admit trivial feasible solution. How does your method work on problems like set partitioning?

4. It seems that the framework has more focus on the primal side and cannot help improving dual bound. Is there a way your method can certificate optimality?

5. It is recommended the authors conduct some ablation studies. For example, what if you directly feed the initial solution from *Model-based Initial Solution Prediction* to Gurobi?

6. Table 2 says "under the same optimization solution". What if two different solutions have the same objective value?

7. While the paper suggests the approach only needs to rely on small-scale solvers. The choice of variable proportion parameter $\alpha$ still lead to subproblems of large scale. Will tiny values of $\alpha$ (e.g., 0.01) give better/worse results?

**Minor typos and stylistic issues**

1. Section 2.4: node information. while on the other hand

   "." => ","

2. Figure 2 uses MIP instead of MILP. Please be consistent.

3. Figure 2 contains much information and is a bit hard to parse due to massive legends. Is it possible to move "data-drive" stage below the first three stages? The rest of space can be used to make legends look better.

### Summary
This paper presents Light-MILPopt, a novel, lightweight optimization framework designed for large-scale Mixed Integer Linear Programs (MILPs). Conventional methods encounter difficulties, including high computational costs and complexities, when applied to large-scale MILPs. Light-MILPopt confronts these problems by adopting a four-stage strategy:

Problem Formulation: MILPs are depicted as bipartite graphs, and computational efficiency is improved through a graph partitioning algorithm.
Model-based Initial Solution Prediction: This stage involves using a specialized network to predict initial solutions for subproblems, necessitating less computational effort and a smaller, structurally coherent training dataset.
Problem Reduction: This innovative method selectively diminishes decision variables and constraints, thereby boosting the efficiency of problem reduction.
 Data-driven Optimization: This phase utilizes subgraph clustering and active constraint updating to steer the neighborhood search and optimization processes, iteratively enhancing solutions with limited computational demands.

Through exhaustive testing against large-scale benchmark MILPs and in real-world situations, the framework has proven its effectiveness. It surpasses current methods, emphasizing considerable reductions in computational requirements and improved problem-solving abilities. Light-MILPopt stands out particularly for its performance with smaller-scale training data and optimizers, establishing a new standard for the resource-efficient tackling of extensive MILPs. The contributions of this paper are crucial, offering a methodology that not only simplifies the computational procedure but also strengthens the strategy for addressing sophisticated, large-scale MILP difficulties.

### Strengths
This paper emphasizes the unique strengths of the Light-MILPopt framework for large-scale Mixed Integer Linear Programs (MILPs). Key highlights include its revolutionary four-stage process that enhances problem-solving efficiency and effectiveness, and its notable resource efficiency, being the first to tackle extensive MILPs with minimal computational resources. Light-MILPopt utilizes cutting-edge computational methods, effectively reduces problem dimensionality, and its efficacy is confirmed through rigorous testing, outperforming existing models. The framework significantly contributes to future MILP endeavors, particularly in efficiently solving substantial problems with limited resources.

### Weaknesses
The Light-MILPopt framework, despite its innovative approach to large-scale Mixed Integer Linear Programs (MILPs), faces critical limitations, including questions of scalability and generalization due to its dependence on small-scale training data. The complexity inherent in its advanced problem formulation and division techniques may hinder practical application, necessitating specialized expertise. The framework's simplification strategies in problem reduction could potentially neglect essential problem aspects, compromising solution integrity. Additionally, its heavy reliance on model-based predictions introduces risks of inaccuracies, and the lack of detailed validation experiments obscures comprehensive performance assessment. Finally, comparisons with advanced solvers appear limited to certain metrics, calling for a more exhaustive evaluation. Overall, these issues indicate the need for cautious implementation and enhanced development for broader applicability.

MILP is an NP-hard problem, and, in the worst case, finding an optimal solution in polynomial time is considered impossible (though this has not yet been proven). The No Free Lunch theorem posits that no "universal" supervised machine learning model or search/optimization algorithm exists that can efficiently solve every problem (theoretically, it's unfeasible). However, assuming a prior distribution of problem generation, it becomes possible to efficiently solve specific instances with an approach like the one used in this study. Nonetheless, a substantial gap exists, limiting the effectiveness of such methods. The explanation of the limitations and constraints of this method in this context is inadequate.

Answering all of the following questions in a necessary and sufficient manner would be an onerous task for the authors; therefore, please respond as comprehensively as possible at this juncture.

1: Representativeness and diversity of the dataset: Is the dataset chosen for benchmarking genuinely representative of the diverse spectrum of large-scale MILPs in real-world scenarios? How does the framework handle MILPs with varying attributes or those from different industries? While problems like Set Covering, Minimum Vertex Cover, Maximum Independent Set, and Mixed Integer Knapsack Set are appropriate for this method's application due to their definable problem structure, its effectiveness may be restricted for more complex practical problems. Consequently, using MIPLIB (https://miplib.zib.de/), where issues are meticulously curated for MIP benchmarking, is advisable.

2: Generalizability of results: Considering that Light-MILPopt trains on merely 1% of the large benchmark MILPs, how effectively does the framework generalize to unfamiliar or more intricate MILPs? Is there proof of steady performance across a broader problem set?

3: Fairness and consistency of benchmarks: Were the tests executed under uniform and fair conditions for all methods? Gurobi itself has numerous parameter settings, potentially leading to disputes from Gurobi's developers' standpoint.

4: Detailed comparative analysis: While the summary underscores Light-MILPopt's superior performance relative to other solvers, it doesn't delve into why specific solvers underperform. Are there fundamental inefficiencies or constraints within the baseline solvers leading to subpar outcomes?

5: Robustness and Efficiency: How does Light-MILPopt manage issues of diverse sizes and complexities? Does efficiency wane as the problem's size and intricacy escalate? What are the trade-offs between computational time and solution precision?

6: Solution Quality and Optimality: Light-MILPopt is said to procure better outcomes in a shorter period, but how do these solutions compare to the global optimum? Is there a compromise in solution quality, risking a mere local optimum?

7: Convergence Analysis: While convergence performance is broached, are scenarios where Light-MILPopt fails to converge efficiently identified? Comprehending its conduct under unfavorable conditions is also crucial.

8: Training scalability: Given the framework's high efficacy with sparse training data, has there been an exploration of how augmenting training data influences performance? Is there a threshold where the benefits diminish, or does efficiency perpetually enhance with additional data?

9: Analysis of real-world applications: The study incorporates real-world instances, but is this scrutiny exhaustive? Are the distinct constraints and hurdles present in real-world scenarios considered, and how does the system accommodate them?
