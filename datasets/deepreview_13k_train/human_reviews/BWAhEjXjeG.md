# Provably Robust Conformal Prediction with Improved Efficiency

- Decision: Accept
- Scores: 6, 8, 8, 6

## Abstract
Conformal prediction is a powerful tool to generate uncertainty sets with guaranteed coverage using any predictive model, under the assumption that the training and test data are i.i.d.. Recently, it has been shown that adversarial examples are able to manipulate conformal methods to construct prediction sets with invalid coverage rates, as the i.i.d. assumption is violated. To address this issue, a recent work, Randomized Smoothed Conformal Prediction (RSCP), was first proposed to certify the robustness of conformal prediction methods to adversarial noise. However, RSCP has two major limitations: (i) its robustness guarantee is flawed when used in practice and (ii) it tends to produce large uncertainty sets. To address these limitations, we first propose a novel framework called \algoname~to provide provable robustness guarantee in evaluation, which fixes the issues in the original RSCP method. Next, we propose two novel methods, Post-Training Transformation (PTT) and Robust Conformal Training (RCT), to effectively reduce prediction set size with little computation overhead. Experimental results in CIFAR10, CIFAR100, and ImageNet suggest the baseline method only yields trivial predictions including full label set, while our methods could boost the efficiency by up to $4.36\times$, $5.46\times$, and $16.9\times$ respectively and provide practical robustness guarantee.

### Summary
This paper identifies two limitation of Randomized Smoothed Conformal Prediction (RSCP): (1) its robustness guarantee is questionable in practical applications; (2) it often yields large uncertainty sets. To address the first problem, the paper propose a novel framework called RSCP+ to provide provable robustness guarantee. For the second issue, the paper introduces two innovative techniques: Post-Training Transformation (PTT) and Robust Conformal Training (RCT), reducing prediction set size.

### Strengths
1. This approach is novel and theoretically sound for conformal prediction. This paper considers the conformal prediction in an adversarial setting where exchangeability is violated; thus traditional methods fail to guarantee coverage. The authors improves RSCP by adjusting its non-conformity score and bounds the estimation error. 

2.  This approach is theoretically grounded and computationally efficient. This paper designs two post-training transformation functions: Ranking Transformation and Sigmoid Transformation, aim at minimizing $\alpha_{gap}$ by reducing the slope of $\Phi_{\tilde{S}}(\tau)$.

3. Inspired by conformal training, the authors propose robust conformal training to enhance efficiency at training stage. Empirical results show that this method is efficient.

### Weaknesses
1. RSCP+ fail to construct informative prediction sets independently: it tends to give the whole prediction sets (include all classes) as observed on Cifar-10, Cifar-100, ImageNet.

2. RSCP+ generates relatively large prediction sets on dataset such as ImageNet even with PTT, limiting its application.

3. The impact of number of Monte Carlo on RSCP+ remains ambiguous, since the experiment is only conducted on Cifar-10.

### Questions
1. The Theorem 1 in [R1] provides a guarantee for RSCP prediction set; moreover, I didn't find noticeable coverage violation in empirical results. Thus, I'm confused why you refine the non-conformity score to bound the estimation error?

2. Can you share the result of PTT+RCT of RSCP+ on ImageNet?

3. Can you conduct additional experiments on the impact of number of Monte Carlo on RSCP+?

4. Considering sigmoid transformation, how you determine the optimal value for $T$.

5. Although PTT and RCT successfully improve efficiency (as shown by empirical results), I don't understand your statement that the coverage gap $\alpha_{gap}$ reflects the conservativeness of RSCP. Can you provide more theoretical or empirical explanation?

6. In Section 4, the paper points out that RSCP and RSCP+ is conservative: RSCP gives a larger prediction set on both clean and perturbed data; this conservativeness then passes on to RSCP+, as supported by Table 1 and Table 2. However, the complementary results in Appendix I don't strongly indicates RSCP is conservative: for example, on Cifar-10, RSCP generates prediction sets of average size 2.751 based on APS. Is it improper to say that RSCP+ is conservative simply because it builds upon RSCP?

### Summary
This paper tackles the problem of robust conformal prediction under adversarial perturbations. The authors study the RSCP framework, a combination of randomized smoothing and conformal prediction, proposed previously, and 1) identify a technical flaw in RSCP's certification guarantee due to the Monte Carlo estimation of the non-conformity score. 2) propose a modified RSCP (RSCP+) framework that circumvents this issue to provide a solid certificate in practice, and 3) propose two new techniques for improving the efficiency of the prediction sets based. The first one (PTT) is a training-free method for computing the non-conformity scores, based on a simple yet effective transformation. The second (RCT) is a training-based approach to improve the robust conformal training of the base classifier itself. Combining PTT+RCT, the authors evaluate their new RSCP+ framework on a variety of network architectures and datasets, showcasing their effectiveness.

### Strengths
- The paper tackles an important subject: uncertainty quantification via conformal prediction in the presence of adversarial perturbations
- The paper is well written for the most part (see Weaknesses for some comments), and the authors go into great lengths to provide details, as seen by the dense Appendix. Technical contributions look sound to me.
- The paper correctly identifies a technical flaw in a prior framework (RSCP), and presents a correction based on the Hoeffding bound to establish a sound framework: RSCP+
- The proposed efficiency enhancing techniques (PTT and RCT) seem to perform well in practice.
- The authors verify their results on three vision benchmarks: CIFAR10, CIFAR100, and ImageNet

### Weaknesses
 - The paper, to its credit, tackles three different techniques, which has unfortunately degraded the reading experience. The proposed techniques have little to do with each other, and jumping between them was a bit hard to grasp in the first few reads. Having to fit all this in the page limit certainly does not help the authors. There is also an over reliance on the Appendix, which made the reading experience very choppy. I am not sure what is the best way to tackle this frankly.

- One thing I found missing was that, if the original RSCP framework is flawed (due to practical limitations of having to rely on Monte Carlo sampling to estimate the non-conformity scores), then why does it still work well in practice? The explanation in Appendix A makes it seem like the method will yield catastrophic results, but that does not seem to be the case. It would greatly improve the motivation for this work if this part is properly explained, preferably in the main text, as it is key to the main motivation for this work.

### Questions
- The PTT method requires another set of held-out, independent of the calibration set. In order for a fair comparison with vanilla RSCP+, would it make sense to have the combined holdout and calibration sets as the baseline calibration set for vanilla RSCP+? This would eliminate any notion of PTT improvement coming from having access to more data, rather than the transformation.

- How were the adversarial examples constructed? is it vanilla PGD? or similar to the SmoothAdv [Salman et al., 2019] paper?

- How well does the RSCP+ framework perform on unperturbed data? are the prediction sets also trivial for clean data?

### Summary
This paper studies the robust conformal prediction with the existence of adversarial noise. The authors first point out that the existing method **RSCP** has two major limitations in practice, and then propose a new framework named **RSCP+** to address two issues. To further reduce the size of the prediction set, this paper also develops two methods, PTT and RCT. Plenty of experiments are conducted to verify the effectiveness of RSCP+.

### Strengths
1. The background of this problem is well illustrated.

2. The framework of RSCP+ is more efficient compared with the existing RSCP. The novelty of this method is also significant.

3. Two specific methods PTT and RCT make this new framework more practical.

### Weaknesses
Overall, I think this submission is a good paper, but I have the following concerns.

**1. The literature review is not sufficient and complete.**

For the conformal prediction with adversarial noise, this author discussed only one related work Gendler et al. (2021). However, I find that a published work [1] is closely related to this problem. The authors should clarify the differences between the submission and [1]. In addition, [2] and [3] are also related works.

**2. The difference between RSCP+ and RSCP should be discussed earlier.**

As the most important contribution of this paper, the algorithmic design of RSCP+ appears until Page 4. It would be better to summarize the main idea or unique part of RSCP+ in the Introduction.

**3. The empirical comparison to [1] and [2] should be added to the experiments.**

### Questions
1. Is the ranking-transformation technique proposed in your paper or already proposed in previous work? If the latter, the citation should be added.

2. Why does the Sigmoid transformation require uniformly distributed scores?

3. For the ranking transformation, the new score $Q_{rank}\circ S_i$ is uniformly distributed when we consider the randomness from both $S_i$ and the hold-out set. In this vein, the new calibration scores $Q_{rank}\circ S_{i}: i=1,...,n$ and the test score $Q_{rank}\circ S_{n+1}$ are no longer independent. How can we guarantee the validity of RSCP+?

4. Is there any particular reason why the regression problem is not considered?

### Summary
This paper proposes three main improvements over RSCP. It first built upon RSCP and use a high probability bound for the smoothed score approximation, in order to provide a more rigorous coverage guarantee in the adversarial setting. Then, it provides two tricks to improve the efficiency of the prediction sets. The first involves a general pipeline to modify the conformity score. The second is re-training the base model by mimicking the conformal prediction steps. The results suggest that the final method works better than the RSCP baseline.

### Strengths
1. The problem (first identified in the RSCP paper itself) about the missing step of high-probability bound is real, and this paper provides a good solution.
2. The PTT steps are quite interesting and could work with any nonconformity score (although it's not clear whether the efficiency is always improved).

### Weaknesses
1. It seems like RCT is not making too much difference, and it requires retraining the model. While it is an interesting idea, I wouldn't say the experiment supports that this helps, and is kind of distracting from the main idea of the paper.

2. It is unclear how to select $T$ (and to some extend $\sigma$).

3. Missing discussion of potential failure mode (see Q1)

### Questions
1. Is the intuition behind slope reduction that we "zoom in" to the nonconformity score around its 1-\alpha quantile? My intuition is that this essentially 
	a. Section D.2 seems to be constantly flipping/inconsistent between maximizing/minimizing - are these mistakes?
	b. While the coverage guarantee always holds, are there cases where the PTT transform hurts the efficiency? For example, it seems like the optimality proof hinges on the unfiorm distribution, and if the noise is adversarial to this sigmoid transformation can PTT actually inflate more? It's just a bit difficult to imagine a transformation is dominating the original score.
2. How do we choose $T$ in practice? Obviously we have to fixed it ex-ante to avoid breaking the i.i.d. condition? In fact, given the proof/theorem, what prevents us from using $T=\infty$?
