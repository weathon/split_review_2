# Memory-Consistent Neural Networks for Imitation Learning

- Decision: Accept
- Scores: 6, 6, 6, 6

## Abstract
Imitation learning considerably simplifies policy synthesis compared to alternative approaches by exploiting access to expert demonstrations. For such imitation policies, errors away from the training samples are particularly critical. Even rare slip-ups in the policy action outputs can compound quickly over time, since they lead to unfamiliar future states where the policy is still more likely to err, eventually causing task failures. We revisit simple supervised ``behavior cloning'' for conveniently training the policy from nothing more than pre-recorded demonstrations, but carefully design the model class to counter the compounding error phenomenon. Our ``memory-consistent neural network'' (MCNN) outputs are hard-constrained to stay within clearly specified permissible regions anchored to prototypical ``memory'' training samples. We provide a guaranteed upper bound for the sub-optimality gap induced by MCNN policies. Using MCNNs on {\numtasks} imitation learning tasks, with MLP, Transformer, and Diffusion backbones, spanning dexterous robotic manipulation and driving, proprioceptive inputs and visual inputs, and varying sizes and types of demonstration data, we find large and consistent gains in performance, validating that MCNNs are better-suited than vanilla deep neural networks for imitation learning applications.\footnote{\newcontent{Our website: \url{https://sites.google.}

### Summary
This paper proposes a method for behavior cloning to address the i.i.d. assumption violation that occurs under supervised learning algorithms. Specifically, a memory-consistent neural network is proposed in which a set of "memories" are used to constrain the output of the neural network to stay within permissible regions. The proposed method is compared to baseline imitation learning algorithms across a set of standard manipulation and autonomous driving tasks.

### Strengths
* Constraining the output of the neural network such that it stays "close" to a specified set of data points is an interesting approach for tackling behavior cloning. Even more so since this can be combined with underlying network architectures.
* The empirical evaluation is fairly thorough, and shows reasonable performance gains across many of the tasks.
* The implementation seems straightforward (although this will incur an additional computational cost during training and inference).

### Weaknesses
 * As a (semi-)parametric method, the computational cost of training and inference scales with the number of memories. There is a discussion on computational complexity in the appendix, but some analysis on training time would be appreciated here as it's difficult to tell whether this is a significant factor. Specifically, it would be useful to understand how the nearest neighbor search scales with the number of memories and the dimensionality of the state space, as this could become a bottleneck for high-dimensional problems or very large memory sets. Furthermore, while the authors mention the memory usage, a more detailed breakdown of the memory footprint during training and inference would be beneficial, particularly how much memory is used for the memories themselves versus the neural network parameters.
* The performance improvement seems sensitive to the underlying network architecture and the task. E.g. in Fig. 4, different models exhibit different levels of improvement for each task. This could make it difficult to use in cases where we can't sample from the environment. It is unclear how the memory-consistent network interacts with different architectures, and whether certain architectures are more amenable to this approach. For example, does the method work equally well with convolutional, recurrent, or transformer-based networks? Understanding these interactions is crucial for practical application.
* Similarly, it seems that the clustering method requires you to be able to sample from the entire state space, is this the case? If it is not possible to sample from the environment at will, is it possible to do this clustering purely from data? If the method's performance strongly depends on sampling from the environment, then it would only be fair to compare it to interactive imitation learning methods that also sample from the environment like SQIL, GAIL, etc.

### Questions
1) Given the distance lookups that are necessary for finding neighbors, how does this impact the wallclock time for training and inference?
2) It seems like in some tasks the model is very sensitive to the number of memories, e.g. carla-town-v0 in Fig. 15. Do you know why this is the case? It seems unintuitive that 5% would perform worse than both 2.5% and 10%. Do  you think that the number of memories needed to attain sufficient performance is related to task/behavior complexity?
3) It seems like there might be a relationship to critical/important states which exhibit a large difference in the expected reward between the best and worst action, i.e. it is costly to recover from a mistake in a critical state. It may be interesting to do an analysis where you identify the critical states in a task and then ablate them from memory. Do you have any thoughts on whether you can do more intelligent memory selection?

### Summary
In this work, the authors present their work Memory Consistent Neural Networks (MCNN), that aims to improve the performance of traditional behavior cloning techniques by introducing a novel demonstration handling technique, which aims to reduce compounding errors that can commonly occur in the BC framework. The authors augment the BC procedure by incorporating demonstrations provided by the expert, directly into the policy’s decision step. They accomplish this by utilizing a convex combination between the expert’s action for the most similar state encountered in the demonstration set, and the output of a parametrized model approximating the policy. They offer both intuitive and theoretical motivation for their strategy: 1) that past similar experiences can help ground the system’s response to behaviors that have been displayed by an expert and thus avoid drifting into potentially catastrophic state-space areas and 2) offer theoretical guarantees  that indeed the system’s output is constrained within a desired area according to the provided hyperparameter L. MCNN requires that a subset of the available demos be organized in a particular form of memory buffer, referred to as Memory Code Book throughout the work. . Selected demonstrations are structured into a graph G, where each node is connected to its nearest neighbor according to some provided distance function d, defined over the state space, and the edge stands for the action used to transition to that nearest neighbor. They argue that within this framework, only a subset of the training data is required to craft graph G. This graph G, is then used to craft a function F(x) that locates the nearest known state s to x, and outputs the action a that the expert has demonstrated from that state. Using a convex combination between this action a, and the action a’ the policy network predicts for the input state x, the system finally outputs the action a_final as the predicted action for state x. Finally the policy network’s parameters are updated by standard Stochastic Gradient Descent, using a loss signal over the predicted a_final and the expert action for state x.
The method is then compared to several BC based approaches over 5 simulated tasks where reward signals are known and can be used to provide quantitative assessment.

### Strengths
The authors present all the material in a very easy to follow manner. All figures are good quality and the results are well displayed.

The authors have performed extensive experimentation and comparison to the baselines. In addition, the baselines selected are reasonable as this work aims to improve the behavior of BC methods. Finally, they offer adequate implementation details in their appendix.

Their method is predicated on a simple yet elegant idea: use expert demonstrations as a human-like memory of experiences to constrain the output of a BC model. In this manner the output is kept within a reasonable distance of the known state space. This, assuming good coverage provided by the expert, can significantly reduce compounding errors that can affect BC techniques (i.e DAGGER). Additionally, the system can potentially better handle not-too-dissimilar unseen states by virtue of projecting them to the known state space via the  nearest neighbor function capability.

Sound theoretical justification for the work’s motivation. Essentially the authors argue that by integrating known state-action  information into the decision process directly they can constrain the output range of the system. They also provide reasoning as to why the code book can only be a subset of the total amount demonstrations, as long as it is crafted in a sophisticated manner. That is, the code book can be small enough to facilitate  fast inference, as long as the selected state-actions are good representatives of the known state-action space.

### Weaknesses
The main weakness of this work, as is common with BC approaches, is assumption of representative state-action pairs and optimal behavior provided by the demonstrator. There is no insight as to how the method will behave with reasonably suboptimal demonstrations, as it being a BC based approach has no apparent mechanism that enables it to focus on the better demonstrations of a provided set. 
There is recent interest in work that can discern between useful demonstrations and harmful / irrelevant ones that can inhibit training. (i.e TREX, or Subdominance minimization (Ziebart 2022)). While understandably not the direct focus of this work, it can be inhibiting for complex tasks to assume a plethora of very carefully curated demonstrations that are both optimal and extremely descriptive of the entire problem space, hence the aforementioned attempts to augment imitation learning with such capabilities.

In the same direction, there is no experimentation for generalization. For example, with demonstration provided for task A, how would the method perform for a slightly altered task A’ there perhaps the goal has changed slightly, the demonstrations are perturbed by noise or simply slightly different. It is not unreasonable to believe that this method would not perform poorly in such a setting and good results would strengthen the method’s appeal considerably.

Finally, the distance used to select the nearest neighbor, is quite critical for this method and problem specific. For example, the distance needed for an image-based problem could be quite different from a control state-based problem. This can potentially deduct from the appeal of a traditional BC approach that doesn't need such an engineered mechanism. See question 1 and 3 below. (The authors have clarified that the distance used is a generic L2 distance across all problem spaces considered.)

Having revisited the sections pointed out to by the authors, on the parts that I had concerns, namely the generalization aspect and the problem specific distance metric, I believe this work can have utility in the low data data sample regime, and thus I have updated my rating.

### Questions
1) What distance measure did you use for your problems? How do you see the performance of your method be impacted from a different measure choice? Would a more generic measure adversely affect performance compared to a more tailored one? I.e Aggregated Manhattan distance for images compared to some kernel-based distance.

2) Relevant to the generalization point raised in the weaknesses section, how do you believe would MCNN behave to inputs based on varying levels of state - perturbation?

3) What was the motivation behind a static nearest neighbor function? Have you considered training it as well? (The authors have clarified that the distance used is a generic L2 distance)

### Summary
The paper proposes a semi-parametric method for behavior cloning, MCNN,  that combines non-parametric nearest neighbor based policy learning with paramteric neural network based policies. As a result of this amalgam, the authors show that the MCNN class of functions are bounded in width and the suboptimality gap, something that does not exist for vanilla neural networks. Further, the authors provide results across 5 environments where adding MCNN to a new architecture consistently improves the results.

### Strengths
- The paper proposes a new class of functions that combines non-parametric nearest neighbor based policy learning with parametric neural network based policies. As a result of this amalgam, the authors show that the MCNN class of functions is bounded in width and the suboptimality gap, something that does not exist for vanilla neural networks.
- The authors provide results across 5 environments where adding MCNN to a new architecture consistently improves the results.
- The authors ablate the performance of MCNN across a different number of memories and the optimal number of memories is significantly smaller than the entire dataset. This highlights the efficiency of the non-parametric portion of the algorithm as compared to approaches like VINN and 1-NN.
- The proposed method also seems to work on image inputs from the CARLA environment.

### Weaknesses
 - The authors mention that they provide results on 9 tasks across 5 environments. But I only see 5 tasks, 1 per environment. It would be great if the authors could clarify the 9 tasks that they evaluate on and where they have provided the results.
- For CARLA, the images have been embedded using a fixed off-the-shelf ResNet34 encoder. This might not be ideal for more complicated visual scenes such as the Franka Kitchen environment used in BeT and Diffusion Policy. It would be great if the authors could evaluate MCNN in this benchmark and provide some comments on possible pretraining approaches for the encoder when such an off-the-shelf encoder is insufficient.
- *“ MCNN can even improve the performance of simple MLP architectures to beyond that of more sophisticated recent architectures such as Diffusion models.”*: In quite a few cases, MCNN works better with MLP than with BeT or Diffusion Policy. Both BeT and Diffusion Policy were developed to deal with multimodal data distributions. Hence, I wonder if the tasks shown are not multimodal enough. Evaluating MCNN on the Franka Kitchen environment used in BeT and Diffusion Policy would help clarify this.

### Questions
It would be great if the authors could address the points mentioned in “Weaknesses”.

### Summary
The paper proposes a mechanism to cope with the loss of alignment between training and online evaluation in behavior cloning. It first collects state-action pairs from training datasets and then combines the nearest-neighbor state outputs with regular neural network predicted output, such that the collected output can be chosen for observed states identical to existing ones in the training dataset and the predicted neural network output can be chosen for novel states. The results are based off of 9 tasks across 5 environments and compared to 7 baselines.

### Strengths
- I appreciate the effort to formalize most of the definitions included in the paper.
- The experiments contain a good amount of baselines and model variants.

### Weaknesses
 - The proposed method seems equivalent to supervised training of a NN with the codebook entries oversampled.
- It is unclear to me why the clipping function in Fig. 12 should be referred to as "tanh-like".
- The proposed method seems to quickly drop the performance gains as the number of training data increases, which might render it irrelevant for tasks requiring a regular amount of training examples.

### Questions
- In Fig. 1, what are the absolute returns for ~10, ~100, ~1,000 and ~10,000 trajectories?
