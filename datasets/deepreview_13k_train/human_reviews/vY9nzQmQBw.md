- Decision: Accept
- Scores: 5, 8, 5, 6

## Abstract
Recent advancements in neural vocoding are predominantly driven by Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) operating in the time-domain. While effective, this approach neglects the inductive bias offered by time-frequency representations, resulting in reduntant and computionally-intensive upsampling operations. Fourier-based time-frequency representation is an appealing alternative, aligning more accurately with human auditory perception, and benefitting from well-established fast algorithms for its computation. Nevertheless, direct reconstruction of complex-valued spectrograms has been historically problematic, primarily due to phase recovery issues. This study seeks to close this gap by presenting Vocos, a new model that directly generates Fourier spectral coefficients. Vocos not only matches the state-of-the-art in audio quality, as demonstrated in our evaluations, but it also substantially improves computational efficiency, achieving an order of magnitude increase in speed compared to prevailing time-domain neural vocoding approaches.

### Summary
This paper introduces a GAN-based neural vocoding method that directly reconstructs Fourier spectral coefficients rather than the prevalent time-domain generation. The experiments showcase that recovering phase information not only improves the quantitative metrics but also results in higher human ratings. In addition, its efficient architecture makes it promising to be adopted in real applications.
The paper is well-written and the motivation is clearly described. The experiments section is comprehensive.

### Strengths
- The paper is well-structured and easy to follow. 
- The motivation of bridging the gap between time-domain and time-frequency-main is sound and the results indicate the proposed method works as expected.
- The code is open-sourced and audio samples are available.

### Weaknesses
 - Novelty is limited considering the ICLR standards. 
- It's not clear to me whether using "ConvNeXt" solely in the time-domain is already bringing all the benefits stated in the paper. The experiment of using ConvNeXt in the time-domain seems missing
- There are a few overclaims in the audio reconstruction task. PESQ/UV F1/ Periodicity numbers of EnCodec still win over Vocos by a large margin at 12.0kbps. Should we still consider "Vocos notably outperforms EnCodec?

### Questions
- Picking "ConvNeXt" as the backbone looked a bit random to me. Did you try other architectures and decide to use ConvNeXt in the end?
- Have you run experiments on ConvNeXt in the time domain?

### Summary
Vocos is a waveform synthesis (vocoder) model operating directly on the frequency scale to estimate Fourier spectral coefficients (magnitude and phase) followed by inverse Fourier transform (iSTFT). Due to the challenges in phase modeling with neural networks, previous non-autoregressive, GAN-based neural vocoders directly generate time-domain waveforms through an upsampling architecture, leading to a slowdown in inference latency (even with the non-autoregressive modeling). Vocos, to the best of the reviewer's knowledge, constitutes the first success in the direct estimation of both the magnitude and phase entirely from the frequency domain, resulting in a highly efficient neural vocoder.

### Strengths
As stated in the summary, direct phase estimation has historically been known to be challenging. The major contribution of Vocos is being the first model to succeed in high-quality phase estimation for neural vocoding through the careful design of a sinusoidal activation head that handles phase wrapping. Since the feature propagation is entirely in the spectral domain with the same I/O dimension, Vocos is significantly faster than time-domain models and more flexible in adopting modern isotropic architecture (ConvNeXt), previously proposed in other data domains, for neural vocoding tasks. Keeping the scope of a general-purpose neural vocoder is also a plus, where the proposed method is not dependent on a specific input representation (mel spectrogram) and can also be trained with the latent feature as a neural audio codec.

### Weaknesses
While the main focus of the manuscript is realizing an efficient neural vocoder operating in the frequency domain, it would also be interesting to further assess the robustness of the proposed method. Considering that the experimental setup largely follows a previous time-domain neural vocoder (BigVGAN), readers may wonder if Vocos can also achieve similar robustness. The provided samples in the manuscript only contain clean speech samples. To further convince the readers, it would be useful to add non-clean speech and audio samples to the demo (noisy speech, environmental sounds, and music, for example) similar to the results presented in the previous work. The VISQOL score in Table 3 looks promising, so letting the readers form their opinion on the subjective quality by adding such samples will be helpful as well. By adding these samples, we could also confirm that the objective VISQOL scores align with human perception as well.

In my opinion, the statement "ConvNeXt blocks can more effectively model spatially local input patterns" is not fully supported by current results; while it is true that Vocos can easily adopt modern isotropic architectures, the same can also be explored with time-domain neural vocoders. To verify this under scrutiny, adopting ConvNeXt to the time-domain GAN vocoder and measuring the performance gain/loss will be useful (probably with dilation to the depthwise conv in ConvNeXt as done by ResBlock in HiFi-GAN). If the time-domain GAN vocoder shows degradation in performance, it will make the benefits of isotropy in Vocos more convincing.

### Questions
Overall, Vocos manifests an exciting step towards enabling a neural vocoder operating entirely in the frequency domain; its fast speed will contribute to accelerating efficient speech synthesis solutions, where the speed of such models has been bottlenecked by the time-domain neural vocoder. But at the same time, I am also interested in the scalability of the method. Specifically, a neural vocoder is also recently viewed as a (de)compression model (similar to VQGAN in the image domain, with EnCodec and DAC[1] as examples) to build the audio generative model in the latent space. For this application, practitioners may want higher quality decoding with increased scale if speed is not a concern. Can we expect that the Vocos (either as a standalone vocoder or the decompression model) can be scaled up further to achieve even better quality? Or, if Vocos exhibits a performance limit at a certain scale, what would be the root cause in the author's opinion?

### Summary
This paper presents an approach to Neural Vocoding with GAN based on generating directly Fourier coefficients instead of targeting time domain signals. Overall, the paper is very well written and provides a very large set of (both qualitative and quantitative) experiments and evaluations, demonstrating the soundness of the proposed approach.

Although I think that this work is of very high quality, and I agree overall with the argument made by the authors in the spectral/temporal dilemma in generative models (which has been a central question of study in the audio domain), I am not convinced by the scientific novelty of the proposed method. For instance, the GANSynth model proposed in 2019 (but not cited in this paper) already proposed a GAN model to produce invertible spectral representations, by modeling instantaneous frequencies:
Engel, J., Agrawal, K. K., Chen, S., Gulrajani, I., Donahue, C., & Roberts, A. (2019). Gansynth: Adversarial neural audio synthesis. arXiv preprint arXiv:1902.08710.
https://openreview.net/pdf?id=H1xQVn09FX

Hence, the major novelty proposed by the paper is to use « ConvNeXt blocks », which have themselves been introduced in a previous paper (Liu et al. 2022). Therefore, it seems rather a slim contribution to be accepted in the ICLR conference. I would advise the author to resubmit the paper in a more audio-applicative type of conference.

### Strengths
- Very large array of experiments demonstrating the quality of the approach.
- Sound reasoning and scientific method for establishing the overall architecture.
- Targeting efficient and lightweight models is always a welcome addition in the current trends of deep generative modelling research.

### Weaknesses
 - Low amount of scientific novelty
- Although I agree that GANs are still dominant, neural vocoders are increasingly being driven by diffusion models over the past months.
- Pictures of spectrograms are usually unhelpful in paper and in this case, I feel it is even harder to truly understand what is the added value of this figure.

### Summary
The paper presents a new method for neural vocoding by generateing fourier spectral coefficients instead of generating wave forms in the time-domain, this leads to significant computational speed up.

### Strengths
- The paper is well-written.
- The authors release the source code.
- The authors present an extensive evaluation of the Vocoder.
- The proposed models offer significant speed-ups compared to the related work without loss in the quality.
- The proposed method is very simple and leads to impressive results.

### Weaknesses
1- Limited ablation study: The authors show the effect of replacing ConvNeXt with residual blocks, but no studies are presented on the architecture itself: the effect of the number of layers and hidden dimensions.  The effects of the resolution and overlap of the mel spectrograms.

2- Limited explanation of the backbone architecture: I think the way the backbone network is processing the mel-spectrograms is still ambigious. After digging into the code, it seems that the frequency dimension of the spectrogram is used as input channels, and 1D convolution is performed over the time dimension. The receptive field of each timeframe grows by 7 frames in each layer (right?). Therefore, the decoding of one timeframe depends on the adjacent time frames. This is controlled by the receptive field of the last layer. This raises a lot of questions: (a) Why did you choose 7? (b) how increasing the depth of the backbone network (and therefore the receptive field of the last layer over time) affects the performance. 

3- The encodec experiments Table 4 is not clear for me: How did you control the bandwidth for your model? Is it by reducing the mel-spectrogram resolution?

4- In end-to-end text-to-speech: You write, " Vocos trained to reconstruct EnCodec tokens". This is not clear: are you using Vocos) to decode EnCodec tokens?

5- (minor) Table 5 Inference speed: Is it possible to include float or multiply-accumulate operations since there is a chance that some FFT operations can be driver (or hardware) accelerated?
