# Where We Have Arrived in Proving the Emergence of Sparse Interaction Primitives in DNNs

- Decision: Accept
- Scores: 8, 6, 8, 6

## Abstract
This study aims to prove the emergence of symbolic concepts (or more precisely, sparse primitive inference patterns) in well-trained deep neural networks (DNNs). Specifically, we prove the following three conditions for the emergence. (i) The high-order derivatives of the network output with respect to the input variables are all zero. (ii) The DNN can be used on occluded samples, and when the input sample is less occluded, the DNN will yield higher confidence. (iii) The confidence of the DNN does not significantly degrade on occluded samples. These conditions are quite common, and we prove that under these conditions, the DNN will only encode a relatively small number of sparse interactions between input variables. Moreover, we can consider such interactions as symbolic primitive inference patterns encoded by a DNN, because we show that inference scores of the DNN on an exponentially large number of randomly masked samples can always be well mimicked by numerical effects of just a few interactions.

### Summary
The main contribution of this paper is to provide another line of proof that AI models (at least those which are well trained) have (sparse) symbolic interactions emerge. In the end, the paper provides a proof that symbolic interactions can appear under a set of conditions on the AI model and its interaction with the data. Most importantly is using the Harsanyi dividend as the definition of interactions in an AI model. This along with several restrictions on the set of interactions with meaningful effect, how revealing more interactions ensures more confidence from the model, and bounding how poor the model performs on masked examples and how well it performs on unmasked examples.

### Strengths
This paper does a really nice job justifying their assumptions and explaining in detail where they come from. This is especially apparent in section 3.2 where each assumption is restated in less formal detail, and often experiments are performed to justify these in large language models.

### Weaknesses
This review is from an outsiders perspective, as I have very little experience in explainable AI. Outside of some experience in causality, I am primarily a reinforcement learning researcher. These weaknesses are a set of questions, which I believe limit the scope of work as presented. Overall, I think the paper is well written and provides many of the explanations and details I needed to understand and gain a reasonable intuition on the primary contribution.

I can’t speak well enough on the novelty and significance of this work, but I believe if others are satisfied the paper is sufficiently novel I will happily agree.

1. While using language is a decent entry to test the main properties of large models, this work (specifically how interactions are encoded) seems like it might be limited when working with models for image data. Specifically, how might one actually build a set of interactions (S) such that we achieve what is illustrated in figure 1? The paper does not provide a clear methodology for selecting the set of input variables that form the basis of these interactions, which is critical for applying this framework to different data modalities. The current approach seems to rely on pre-defined, human-annotated segments, which may not be generalizable or scalable to arbitrary image data or other complex inputs.
2. While the paper says these are properties of a well trained AI model, don’t these assumptions really speak more to the data you are using to train and test the AI model? Assumption 2 does speak towards the output of the model, but isn’t this necessarily implying the input data can be well partitioned into the discrete set of interactions? The assumptions, particularly the one related to smooth inference on masked samples, seem heavily dependent on the nature of the training data. If the data does not exhibit the necessary structure to allow for meaningful masking and smooth inference, the proposed framework might not be applicable. It's unclear how to determine a priori if a given dataset is suitable for this analysis.
3. Assumption 3 is the weakest in terms of justification. While it applies to our current models, I’m not sure the upperbound on inference confidence is a property generally exhibited by “AI models”. This wouldn’t be an issue if this was stated as a part of the discussion of assumption 3, but I don’t buy the upperbound portion being undesirable. The justification for the upper bound on inference confidence seems to be based on empirical observations rather than a theoretical necessity. It is not clear why this upper bound should be a general property of AI models, and the lack of a theoretical grounding weakens the overall argument. The paper does not provide a clear explanation of when and why this upper bound may not hold, and what the implications would be for the analysis.

### Questions
1. How limiting is the focus on Harsanyi interactions in your opinion? While I believe this focus is ok for input such as an image or textual data (which are by nature sub-dividable), can this be applied to real valued inputs? This is of particular interest in many applications such as time-series forecasting, reinforcement learning and control, etc…

### Summary
The paper under review studied the emergence of symbolic concepts of deep neural networks.
Consider the set of subsets of each input data (e.g. an image or a sentence), the authors defined interaction between these subsets.
Then, the authors zoomed into DNN models satisfied three proposed conditions, showed that sparse positive interactions emerge under these conditions.
In addition, practicality of the proposed conditions are illustrated by simulations.

### Strengths
The idea of qualitatively measure whether a DNN model can emerge a few symbolic concepts is novel and grounded.
The paper is well written, easy to follow. Plots are very illustrative and helpful.

### Weaknesses
1. Soundness of assumption 2 and 3: 

- assumption 2 assumes the more unmasked subsets of an input, the higher expected output. Intuitively, if each subset carries useful info, then yes.
However, in many situation that is not the case. For instance, even in Figure 2, three unmasked regions (row 2) yield a much smaller output than two unmasked regions (row 1). The authors also mention that if there are many noisy regions, then only focus on the salient regions.
In practice, how to does one know such info apriori? This monotonicity assumption, while intuitive for ideal cases, is not universally applicable. The average output is considered, but individual subsets may not follow this trend. The paper does not address how to ensure this assumption holds for real-world data where noise and irrelevant features are common. The assumption seems to presuppose a well-trained model, making the analysis less useful for understanding model behavior during training or in less-than-ideal scenarios.

- assumption 3 assumes there exists a constant $p$ such an inequality hold. But no bound on $p$ is derived. 
From the definition, $p$ can be arbitrarily large. Then it is not clear how Thm 2 shows the sparsity of interactions for models satisfies assumption 1-3.
(See more details in Question section.) The lack of a bound on $p$ significantly weakens the theoretical claim. If $p$ can be arbitrarily large, the term $n^{p+\delta}$ could dominate the combinatorial term, invalidating the argument for sparsity. The paper needs to provide a more rigorous analysis of the conditions under which $p$ is bounded and how this affects the sparsity claim.

2. These lead to my major concern: practicality. While intuitively, the proposed three criterion all make sense, however, for a general DNN model, how to validate these three conditions, besides empirically testing after training, is somehow unclear.


3. Implication of the work: my understanding is that the authors aim to derive conditions, under which DNN models will produce sparse positive interactions (considered as small number of concepts). As detailed above, if one can't test these conditions prior training, how would these conditions be used? On the other hand, it would be nice if the authors could comment on implications of Thm 3, i.e. how would knowing many DNN are able to learn a few key concepts benefit us?

### Questions
1. Figure 3: would the authors please provide more experiment details? Didn't find much in appendix neither. Here are a few main questions:
 - did the authors train the 5 mentioned models or existing trained model were used?
 - Size of training, testing data.
 - For each of the input, how was the subsets selected? for instance, for a image from MNIST, following the paper notation $\mathbf{x} = (x_1, \dots, x_n)$, is each $x_i$ just a pixel? 


2. Thm 2 and Thm 3: any insight on coefficients $\lambda$'s in eq(4) and eq (7)? How Thm2 and Thm 3 imply sparsity are unclear. 
Based on eq (7), valid number of k-th order interactions is bound by roughly a constant times $\lambda^{(k)} * n^{p+\delta}$.
On one hand, $\lambda^{(k)}$ can be large. On the other hand, the authors claims $n^{p+\delta}$ is much less than 
$n \choose k$. Yet bound on $p$ is not required, in case where say $n-k < p$, not sure how the claim holds.

### Summary
The authors set out to prove that the knowledge in a deep neural network can be understood as a function of very few sparse interactions as compared to the total possible large space of possible interactions between input features. They define these interactions through the Harsanyi dividend, and make assumptions under which they prove that the total number of salient interactions is upper bounded by a quantity which is much smaller than the total possible interactions. These assumptions are tested empirically, and the proof shows that neural networks learn to represent complex functions using few symbolic rules.

### Strengths
1) I found the paper very interesting to read. The paper is well motivated and the authors tackle the important but challenging problem of trying to show that deep neural networks learn symbolic concepts, and not just general fuzzy and arbitrarily complex interaction functions of their inputs.

2) I found the assumptions made by the authors in the proof to be generally reasonable, and the authors give satisfactory empirical evidence that these assumptions hold for some important classes of networks.

3) The proof was worked through quite clearly, and I found I could follow along reasonably well without needing to go through related works despite not having prior background knowledge in this subfield.

### Weaknesses
While the work shows that the number of valid interactions tends to be much smaller than the total possible set of interactions, this does not mean that the number of interactions is small in an absolute sense. For high dimensional inputs such as images, there can still be an extremely large number of interactions depending on the level of abstraction of the concepts being looked at to describe these interactions. For images, would pixels, patches, or some general localized features be the right abstraction to view interactions? As such, I am not sure if thinking of neural networks as learning these sparse interactions is a useful perspective. Specifically, even if the number of *salient* interactions is small relative to the total possible interactions, the sheer number of possible interactions in high-dimensional spaces means that the absolute number of salient interactions could still be very large, potentially hindering interpretability or practical application of this framework. The paper does not sufficiently address how the choice of input variable granularity (e.g., pixels vs. patches) impacts the number of salient interactions and their interpretability. It is unclear how one would choose the right level of abstraction for the input variables to ensure that the identified sparse interactions are both meaningful and manageable in number. Furthermore, the practical implications of this sparsity, in terms of simplifying or understanding network behavior, remain unclear when the number of salient interactions, though sparse, could still be computationally intractable or conceptually complex.

### Questions
1) I would like the authors to comment on the weakness I mentioned above.

While I am not very familiar with the background work in this field, the paper tackles an important problem in deep learning, and does a convincing job justifying its claims. As such I am recommending acceptance.

### Summary
This paper attempts to prove the emergence of sparse interaction primitive inference patterns in well-trained AI models. Core to this proof, is three necessary conditions that must be satisfied for this sparse interaction between input variables.

### Strengths
* The paper is well-written and clear.
* The paper contributes novel proofs for theorems 2 onwards.
* The paper appears well-placed in the relevant literature.
* The papers theoretical results appear significant and relevant to the ICLR community.

### Weaknesses
 * The claim of to "prove the emergence of symbolic concepts (or more precisely, sparse primitive inference patterns) in well-trained AI models." (Line 1), appears too broad and un-substantiated, specifically encompassing "AI models". It appears the evidence presented in the paper is only applicable and demonstrated for Deep Neural Networks (DNNs). For example, I cannot see how this proof or claims can be applied to other AI models that are not DNNs, such as Random Forests, which considers the outputs of all trees; k-NN's, that use all features to compute distances, or Boosting algorithms (e.g., Gradient Boosting Machines). Specifically, the empirical evidence presented in the paper in Figure 3, Figure 4, Figure 5 and Table 1, only apply to deep neural network models, and there is no other AI models that are not DNN's to support this claim.
* It is not clear how the input variables should be grouped to form the set of $S$ input variables. For example, in the dog image example, "image regions" are proposed; however, there is no indication or discussion on how large these "image regions" should be for the approach and proof to work. For example, does this sparse primitive approach still hold if the "image regions" are too small, e.g., each region is a single pixel, and does it still hold if the "image regions" are too large, e.g., encompassing most of the image, or even half of the image. Some discussion on this, and how to select these groupings could be informative to the reader.
*  Missing error bars; and large error bars. There appears to be missing error bars for Figure 4, Figure 5 (a), Table 1 (top row: Percent of samples with monotonicity). The provided error bars in Table 1 and Table 2, are so large that they overlap; leading the reader to suspect that the claim of the input samples satisfying the monotonicity assumption is not empirically verified, as the numeric results in Table 1 are not statistically significant, as the error bars overlap.

### Questions
* Can you clarify if the core proof of the paper applies to other AI models that are not DNN's? If it does, can you provide evidence for this, and if it does not, perhaps think of refining your claims, and title to be only applicable to DNNs.
* Can you clarify how the reader should group input variables to form the set of $S$?
* Can you include error bars for the top row of Table 1, and include error bars for Figure 4 and Figure 5 (a). Also can you re-run with more random seeds to see if the error bars in Table 1 reduce.
