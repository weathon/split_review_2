# It's About Time: Temporal References in Emergent Communication

- Decision: Reject
- Scores: 6, 5, 3, 5

## Abstract
As humans, we use linguistic elements referencing time, such as “before” or “tomorrow”, to easily share past experiences and future predictions. While temporal aspects of the language have been considered in computational linguistics, no such exploration has been done within the field of emergent communication. We research this gap, providing the first reported temporal vocabulary within emergent communication literature. Our experimental analysis shows that a different agent architecture is sufficient for the natural emergence of temporal references, and that no additional losses are necessary. Our readily transferable architectural insights provide the basis for the incorporation of temporal referencing into other emergent communication environments.

### Summary
This paper introduces a novel dimension of emergent communication, focusing on temporal reference. In this framework, the sender is tasked with encoding temporal information about target objects, enabling the receiver to distinguish them from other distractors. To facilitate this, a temporal LSTM component is incorporated into the agents' architecture for temporal encoding. Furthermore, a loss function for temporal object classification is introduced to encourage the emergence of temporal encoding. To assess the effectiveness of this approach, an evaluation metric is devised to measure the frequency of using the same message to describe previously presented objects. The experimental findings highlight the role of the temporal LSTM in facilitating the development of temporal communication.

### Strengths
1. This paper introduces temporal reference into the emergent communication field, which is an important topic worth exploring. It leverages the sequential position of objects within the batch as a means of encoding temporal information, thereby modifying traditional referential games and their associated training frameworks.

2. The paper demonstrates a comprehensive design of the experiments. It encompasses various modifications to modeling architectures, incorporates multiple environments, and also analyzes different statistical results.

### Weaknesses
1. Example demonstration: the authors present multiple examples using integer arrays in the game design (section 2.3), agent architecture (figure 1), how to compute the temporality metric (section 3.1), as well as the sent messages (section 3.3), which I believe are of different meanings. However, using integer arrays in all the examples can make the demonstration more confusing. Different symbols used in different cases would be better. For example, objects as names, and messages using alphabets.

2. Experimental analysis clarification:

    a. In section 3.3, it is said “only networks that have the sequential LSTM are capable of producing temporal references”: From Figure 2a, we can observe all networks have cases “reaching % used as previous” above 80%. A clarification on how you make a judgment on “producing temporal references” should be made. Specifically, a threshold for what constitutes a temporal reference is needed, and it should be justified why that threshold was chosen.

    b. In Figure 3b, only the results of Temporal networks are presented because “non-temporal networks learn no temporally specialised messages”. The threshold and statistical significance between temporally and no temporally specialised messages should be made clear as well. The authors should provide a more rigorous statistical comparison, such as a t-test or Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, to support the claim that temporal networks statistically outperform non-temporal networks in generating temporal references, rather than relying on a simple cutoff.

    c. Through Figure 3a, the claim that “these messages could be a more efficient way of describing objects” needs to be further clarified. It's not clear how the messages are more efficient. A more concrete analysis of message length or complexity would be beneficial.

    d. In Figure 2, which of the six environments used for the legends about “trained RGs” and “TRGs” are not specified. It should be clearly stated which specific environment was used for training.

    e. During the experiment analysis, the results of “Never same” are not presented. Also, there is not much difference, or the difference is not underscored between “environment” and “environment Hard”. This part could be better organized based on the analysis needed.

### Questions
1. For the temporal loss, I assume it is a categorical classification about the last position the object shows up. I think it could be misleading when trained with target object classification together. There are some circumstances when the objects are the same but the temporal labels are different, which may cause the network to be confused. Have you tried to add a smaller weight to the temporal loss or try to add this loss on top of the temporal LSTM?

2. More analysis of the features that the temporal LSTM provides would be helpful to demonstrate its vital role.

### Summary
This paper introduces a variant of the common referential game in emergent
communication game: the Temporal Referential Game (TRG).  The TRG is an
iterated version of the standard referential game where recent objects have
a higher probability of being seen again compared to non-recently seen objects.
The authors introduce a temporal LSTM module and a temporal loss to better
solve this game and observe the emergence of temporally referent messages.

### Strengths
- (major) Temporal reference is a pertinent feature of language, and therefore,
  it is good to use an environment with multiple timesteps with additional
  temporal structure (i.e., recently seen object are more likely to appear
  again).
- (minor) The Temporal Referential Game (TRG) is an appropriate extension to
  the regular referential game.  It minimally adds a temporal aspect to the
  game without changing it too much, making it good for pioneering basic
  concepts about temporal reference.

### Weaknesses
This paper does not make a substantial contribution to the field.  While the
TRG could elicit potentially interesting behaviors, the primary thrust of this
paper is that it introduces a new architecture which is able to solve this game
without much further analysis about temporality.  The problem here is that the
new architecture is, to the best of my knowledge, just an LSTM where each
timestep is a single round of the referential game.  This, to me, seems like an
appropriate baseline with which to work with and does not seem like
a contribution in and of itself.  Additionally, the temporal loss seems to work
against the claim that temporal reference "emerges from functional pressures";
this claim I see as being implicit in most all emergent communication research,
otherwise we are more or less looking at a trivial supervised learning problem.



### Questions
What is the significance of the temporal loss and the temporal LSTM?  What do
they offer beyond being a commonsense baseline for the TRG?

    - social deduction game: cite related work (e.g., [this](https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/RLupus%3A-Cooperation-through-emergent-communication-Brandizzi-Grossi/d94504e5319ea1a2dc7df8a1ad25a48a4c3ae650))
- Sec 2.1
    - "attribute-value" seems more standard than "property-feature"; the latter
      sounds like "property" and "feature" could refer to the same thing
- Sec 2.3
    - Seems like you could just parameterize the threshold for $c$?
    - Alternatively, it would probably be even clearer to say that we sample
      $c$ from a Bernoulli distribution since that is in effect what is
      happening.  Also, saying $c$ is uniformly sampled integer from $[0,1]$ is
      sort of confusing since interval notation refers to real values, not
      integers.
    - "verify whether the messages" -> "determine whether or not the messages"
- Sec 2.4
    - "same as the EGG framework" is not a good way to specify the architecture
      since it is a whole framework and not a particular model.  Maybe just
      take a sentence or two to specify the defaults that are being used.

- Sec 3.1
    - The $100\\%$ seems too restrictive to determine a word is properly
      temporal reference.  For example, in English, is "yesterday" temporally
      referent?  Because it can be used in a non-temporally referent way
      (e.g., "TensorFlow is yesterday's ML library.").
- Sec 3.2
    - It seems like the non-temporal network is strictly precluded from
      performing temporal reference?  How is this a useful baseline, then?  Are
      we seeing if it can perform just as well or what the random baseline of
      temporal reference might be?
- Sec 3.3
  - Is $M_{\ominus^4}$ the max value of any message?  It seems like the
    temporality is per-message, not per-language.
- Figures 2a and 3a are difficult to read.

### Summary
The current study is the first investigation of the temporal reference in emergent communication, in which its contributions are three-fold:
- it formally defines an environment for emergent communications in referential grams that consider referent in the past using Linear Temporal Logic. 
- it proposes a new architecture for the agent
- it conducted a temporality analysis of the agent

### Strengths
- It is the first work to investigate the temporal references in emergent communication, during which it defines an environment and introduces an architecture of the agent. The subject matter is interesting and vital.
- Despite the limitations listed below, the experiments to a certain extent provide a response to the major research question of this study and support for the conclusions.

### Weaknesses
1. The notations in this paper need to be further standardised and unified. The current ones sometimes make readers (at least me) hard to follow. Here are the ones that I have spotted: (1) a vector in this paper sometimes means the feature vector of a target and sometimes a target sequence. Both of them can have arbitrary lengths and often appear without further explanation. (2) things like x \in V are not conditions in equation 2, IMO, they should not connected with the "real" conditions with AND. Also, see my questions below.
2. The paper spends quite a lot of space describing the details of the agents (e.g., the dimension of each vector during the implementation). Contrary to this is the absence of motivations for many choices made in the current study. For example, why the environment was defined in this way? Why a second LSTM in both sender and receiver? Why does there have to be an additional LSTM to capture temporal information? Actually, in terms of the architectural design, the two additional LSTMs in the sender and receiver have very different roles as the two LSTMs in the sender are parallel, and the two in the receiver are stacked. 
3. Related to my second concern, the experiment design in the present study also cannot validate the rationalities of these choices. This makes the conclusions from the experiments, namely a different batching strategy is sufficient, look narrow.

### Questions
- I do not fully understand the definition of feature space in section 2.1. If F is a feature space of a feature, then why its size N_F is the number of features rather than the number of values that the associated property can take?

### Summary
This work considers the role of temporal references in emergent communication. For example, just as humans may say, "the thing I told you five minutes ago," EC agents should be able to refer to prior expressions as well.

To formalize this problem, the authors propose a metric, $M_{\theta^n}$ for measuring how often a message corresponds to a previous operator, where $n$ specifies how many timesteps previous.

The authors further propose to increase the use of temporal expressions through changes in architecture and loss. A "temporal module" in the sender and receivers model temporal processing, and a temporal loss can explicitly guide the receiver temporal module.

Overall, the authors find that neural architectures with the temporal modules use previous expressions far more often than baseline architectures.

### Strengths
## Originality
This work is pretty original. I am unaware of others considering the problem of temporal references in EC, and I find it an interesting area. Adding further RNN modules to the neural agents to represent temporal relations also seems clever (although I have important questions about the implementation, which I raise later).

## Quality
The results from the work are strong, per the desired metrics of temporal references.

## Clarity
The writing is largely clear, and the diagrams (both Fig 1 and 5, in the appendix) help explain the architectural changes. I think the authors did a very good job explaining simple aspects of LTL; I have some background in this area, and this seemed like a good presentation of necessary details.

## Significance
I quite like the combination of temporal logic methods with EC, and I think this is an interesting area for future research. The approach also seems simple (in a good way!), which should aid wider adoption of the ideas.

### Weaknesses
## Clarity around actual approach/implementation
My biggest concern with this work is about understanding the actual approach the authors used for the neural implementation. Fundamentally, I do not understand how the authors order inputs over time and the structure of communication. I explain my question about this under "Questions" - generally, I view this uncertainty as a weakness given how central such details are to the paper. Certainly, I could be misunderstanding information presented in the paper, but I am very knowledgeable about EC, so I do not think I am missing something obvious.

Because of my uncertainty about this crucial part of the paper, I am currently leaning against acceptance. I emphasize, however, that if the authors clarify their approach and it seems sound, I am willing to revise my score.

## Clarity around notation
The authors dedicate a fair amount of effort to establishing some notation based on LTL, but then do not seem to use it fully. For example, many of the figures (e.g., Figure 2) have almost natural-language y axis labels, whereas I would have expected a single mathematical symbol.

## Clarity of examples
The authors included a few simple examples in the paper that I first found very helpful, but now I think they actually are misleading. For example, in Section 3.1, the authors write about an intuitive example where the target sequence is [1, 2, 3, 2, 2, 1] and different message sequences are considered ([1, 2, 3, 2, 4, 4, 1], [1, 2, 3, 4, 4, 4, 1], etc.). My problem with this example is that, when I read it, it made me think that the speakers only generated a single token per target. This was reinforced in Table 4 in Appendix B.1, where the same type of example appears. However, in Section 3.3., where actual results are presented, I realized that a single message was composed of multiple tokens (5 or 6). That is fine, I wish I had realized this earlier on.

## Further metrics?
The authors mostly focus on the emergence of temporal references, but further metrics would help situate the broader network performance. Notably, the authors do evaluate validation set accuracy in Figure 6, and they show a small decrease in performance for temporal networks relative to non-temporal networks. This is good analysis but then makes me 1) worry about the utility of this approach, if accuracy goes down and 2) slightly contradicts some of the claims in the main paper, which motivate temporal references to improve performance. The authors should also consider metrics that quantify the compositionality of the learned language, especially given the use of t-SNE plots in the appendix, which are often used to visualize compositional structure. It would be good to see if the temporal module impacts the compositionality of the language.

## Minor:
1. Footnote 1 appears to indicate that the authors will share code upon acceptance. I suggest the authors use https://anonymous.4open.science/ in future submissions to link to anonymized code during the review phase.

2. The figures in Appendix E are not very clear and should be cleaned up for publication. I would also strongly caution about interpreting tSNE plots as indicative of compositionality; do the authors have references supporting this link?

3. The notation around equation 2 is not right. In particular, typically I read the right text in case-based equations as specifying the conditions under which that behavior is selected. I think the cases should just be $c < 0.5$ and $c >= 0.5$, therefore, without any of the $x$ parts. 

4. Equation 3 seems to have a few things off about it. First, "objectRepeated" seems misleading as a name. I believe it just returns true if $x_n$ is present $h_v$ episodes ago, correct? What does that have to do with repetition? Second, the variable $n$ is very overloaded in the expression, which impedes readbility. It is simulatenously used to represent a fixed number of previous timestep (see left side of the equation) and is used as a counter variable (see right side of the equation).

### Questions
1. My main question, which I hope the authors address in their rebuttal, is about better understanding the exact form of the inputs and outputs of the speaker network. The key idea of this paper is that speakers should be able to refer back to previous communication if they see similar inputs. Thus, the speaker must somehow see a series of inputs, right? How is that represented? Is it a batch of inputs? I'm guessing that is the case, because the temporal module in the speaker reshapes the inputs based on batch size, so that makes me think it allows the temporal module to represent at which point in "time" an input appears. If it is the case, however, that the temporal order of inputs is represented by position in the batch, I am somewhat disappointed in the baselines used for comparison. It seems obvious non-temporal networks, which observe inputs in parallel over a batch, cannot represent temporal relations.

Overall, I am unsure about what the authors are actually doing to represent sequentially-ordered inputs, though, and really need clarity on this topic to evaluate this paper.

2. In the main paper, the authors typically present results for $h_v = 4$, but the authors mentioned that they conducted experiments for other. Results for such values are included in Appendix F, but the results end up raising lots of questions for me. Can the authors comment as to why results are seemingly so bimodal? Everything for $h_v <=4$ matches one profile, and everything for $h_v > 4$ matches another. Also, what was the actual training setup for these results?
