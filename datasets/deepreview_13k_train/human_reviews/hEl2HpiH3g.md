# FedJETs: Efficient Just-In-Time Personalization with Federated Mixture of Experts

- Decision: Reject
- Scores: 5, 5, 6, 3

## Abstract
One of the goals in Federated Learning (FL) is to create personalized models that can adapt to the context of each participating client, while utilizing knowledge from a shared global model. 
Yet, often, personalization requires a fine-tuning step using clients' labeled data in order to achieve good performance. 
This may not be feasible in scenarios where incoming clients are fresh and/or have privacy concerns. 
It, then, remains open how one can achieve just-in-time personalization in these scenarios. 
We propose \texttt{FedJETs}, a novel solution by using a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) framework within a FL setup. Our method leverages the diversity of the clients to train specialized experts on different subsets of classes, and a gating function to route the input to the most relevant expert(s). 
Our gating function harnesses the knowledge of a  pretrained model (\emph{common expert}) to enhance its routing decisions on-the-fly. As a highlight, our approach can improve accuracy up to 18\% in state of the art FL settings, while maintaining competitive zero-shot performance. In practice, our method can handle non-homogeneous data distributions, scale more efficiently, and improve the state-of-the-art performance on common FL benchmarks.

### Summary
The paper proposes a novel solution for efficient just-in-time personalization with Federated Mixture of Experts, called FedJETs. The method leverages the diversity of clients to train specialized experts on different subsets of classes, and a gating function to route the input to the most relevant expert. The approach can improve accuracy by up to 18%, while maintaining competitive zero-shot performance.

### Strengths
- The introduction of MoE in the field of federated learning has enabled neural networks to specialize in various types of datasets. Additionally, it achieves non-linear growth in testing time while increasing the model parameter scale.
- Without compromising data privacy, the overall communication cost is reduced by not transmitting the entire MoE module to all clients.
- The anchor clients mechanism addresses, to some extent, the inherent challenge in MoE where only a subset of experts receive sufficient training.

### Weaknesses
Some of the experiments supporting the proposed method might not be considered as sufficient. For FL scenarios, there are plenty of available datasets beyond the CIFAR data suite with more obvious levels of Non-IID features (e.g., the LEAF benchmark datasets). More results on such datasets might be appreciated considering the nature of this paper. Besides, the ablation study regarding the anchor client ratio might not be sufficient as to determine the claimed “optimal” ratio. It served the propose to address the significance of anchor clients, but there could be more to explore regarding such a key component of the entire method.

Updated After Response

Thanks for your response! Only CIFAR and the added EMNIST are not sufficient, considering many other large-scale datasets have natural client partitions.

### Questions
1. Could the consideration of replacing the gate function with the anchor clients mechanism be explored and the impact of the gate function on experimental results analyzed? The previously mentioned non-i.i.d. datasets, representing datasets with different features that perform well in MoE, could be further validated through experiments with additional comparative trials involving random routing to assess MoE performance.

2. During the model training process, clients select expert networks and transfer them from the server to the client for distributed parameter training. After the parameters are trained, they are sent back to the server for synchronization. While this method ensures privacy, has the potential increase in communication latency been considered? Can this method's latency be experimentally compared and analyzed against traditional methods?

### Summary
The paper proposes FedJETs, a distributed system that connects and extends Mixture of Experts in FL setting. The system features multiple independent models as experts, in contrast to common MoE settings where different parts of a model is considered as experts. The authors introduce a pretrained common expert and a novel gating functionality to guide the specialization of experts during training. The authors claim that the combined system can exploit the characteristics of each client’s dataset and adaptively select experts suitable during training. FedJETs also claims to be able to dynamically select experts and adjust to unseen clients on-site.

### Strengths
An interesting combination of Federated Learning scenario and the idea of Mixture of Experts. Viewing independent models as separated experts and guiding them respectively during training rounds of an FL setup can serve as a new attempt, although similar ideas can be found in certain meta-learning scenarios. The presentation of methods and the clarity of expression are good.

### Weaknesses
My biggest concern is the novelty of the proposed method. The general framework of having individualized models and selecting a subset of experts for performing ensemble learning is a traditional topic. The specific setting of having a pre-trained model along with a gating function to select a subset of experts to update is new. I am not entirely familiar with the current federated learning literature, so I will leave other reviewers to decide on the novelty of the paper to the federated learning community.
In addition to the concern about the novelty of the work, another concern I have is the applicability of the method when expert models need to be very large. It seems to be inefficient to use the common expert (a large pre-trained model) to just perform expert selection. Would it be more reasonable, computation-wise at least, to not have individual expert models but different expert heads so that the pretrained common expert can be used to extract a common representation to pass into different experts?

### Questions
It would be appreciated, considering the nature of this paper, if more results regarding Non-IID datasets other than the CIFAR data suite could be demonstrated. For FL scenarios, there are plenty of available datasets beyond the CIFAR data suite with more obvious levels of Non-IID features (e.g., the LEAF benchmark datasets).

Besides, the ablation study regarding the anchor client ratio might not be sufficient as to determine the claimed “optimal” ratio. It served the proposal to address the significance of anchor clients, but there seems to be more to explore regarding such a key component of the entire method. Is it possible for a higher anchor-normal client ratio to achieve faster convergence or even a better overall performance?

### Summary
The paper studies a federated learning setting where the goal is to fine-tune the models. The main framework FedJETs is given a pretrained model and contains multiple ``expert'' models and a gating function. When new client data comes in, the gating function utilizes the representation from the pre-trained model to decide which K experts to update. Then, using the client's data, FedJETs obtain updates for the gating function as well as the K experts and send them back to the server. The server aggregates and updates the new weights.

### Strengths
The paper presented the main idea as well as the FEDJETs algorithm in a clear and intuitive manner. The idea of having individual expert models and a gating function to select experts is intuitive and reasonable. The authors also discussed the technical difficulties coming with this design. The experimental results suggest the efficacy of the proposed method.

### Weaknesses
 - The contribution lacks novelty, as using a gating function and common expert is not new. Even there are multi-gate mixture of experts architectures in the literature [1].
- The architecture is similar to STAR model in paper [2] without anchor users.
- There are couple of places mention that our approach lower communication costs but there is no experimental results that show that how much improvement is there as in FedMix paper.
- There are no experiments for the cold-start problem as claimed in the paper ( this is not same as unseen new users for testing. Testing, of course, should be unseen).

### Questions
- How should the number of experts scale with the number of clients? How should one choose the ``K'' hyperparameter?
- Could the authors comment on the computation and memory costs of having individual experts? How big should the expert model be compared to the pretrained common expert model? 
- Other than using the pre-trained model for obtaining representation for the gating function, is it used in some other ways, e.g., is there a way to combine its output with the expert model?

### Summary
The paper uses Mixture of Experts architecture with a gating function to select "the most relevant" experts for each client data "just-in-time" for federated learning. They also take advantage of a pretrained model as "common expert". The authors aim i) global generalization ii) enhance global model via personalized models ii) solve "cold-start" problem.

### Strengths
- It is good to see that the authors have used MoE for federated learning, differently from the FedMix paper.
- Reducing communication costs is critical and very good.
- Using anchor users seems useful.

### Weaknesses
- The contribution lacks novelty, as using a gating function and common expert is not new. Even there are multi-gate mixture of experts architectures in the literature [1].
- The architecture is similar to STAR model in paper [2] without anchor users.
- There are couple of places mention that our approach lower communication costs but there is no experimental results that show that how much improvement is there as in FedMix paper.
- There are no experiments for the cold-start problem as claimed in the paper ( this is not same as unseen new users for testing. Testing, of course, should be unseen).

### Questions
- The claim "we partition the data samples by classes to turn full datasets into non-i.i.d. subsets", how do you make sure that samples with different class labels with same data is non - i.i.d ? 
- This work also very similar to multi-task learning, one of the main problem is conflicting gradients. Since you claim the data is non i.i.d. have you ever encountered this problem as in these papers [3] [4]
