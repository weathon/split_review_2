- Decision: Accept
- Scores: 3, 8, 6, 8

## Abstract
Large text-to-video models trained on internet-scale data have demonstrated exceptional capabilities in generating high-fidelity videos from arbitrary textual descriptions. However, similar to proprietary language models, large text-to-video models are often black boxes whose weight parameters are not publicly available, posing a significant challenge to adapting these models to specific domains such as robotics, animation, and personalized stylization. Inspired by how a large language model can be prompted to perform new tasks without access to the model weights, we investigate how to adapt a black-box pretrained text-to-video model to a variety of downstream domains without weight access to the pretrained model. In answering this question, we propose \emph{\methodname}, which leverages the score function of a large pretrained video diffusion model as a probabilistic prior to guide the generation of a task-specific small video model. Our experiments show that, by incorporating broad knowledge and fidelity of the pretrained model probabilistically, a small model with as few as 1.25% parameters of the pretrained model can generate high-quality yet domain-specific videos for a variety of downstream domains such as animation, egocentric modeling, and modeling of simulated and real-world robotics data. As large text-to-video models starting to become available as a service similar to large language models, we advocate for private institutions to expose scores of video diffusion models as outputs in addition to generated videos to allow flexible adaptation of large pretrained text-to-video models by the general public.

### Summary
The Video Adapter framework addresses the challenge of adapting black-box, large text-to-video models to specific domains such as robotics and animation, without access to the models' weight parameters. This innovative approach, inspired by the prompting mechanism in large language models, uses the score function of a pretrained video diffusion model as a probabilistic prior, guiding the generation of a smaller, task-specific video model. Remarkably, this smaller model, with only 1.25% of the parameters of the original, can generate high-quality and domain-specific videos across diverse applications. The authors advocate for private enterprises to provide access to the scores of video diffusion models, enhancing the adaptability of large pretrained text-to-video models, with video demos available in the supplementary material.

### Strengths
1. The tackled problem is important and practical.
2. The proposed idea is intuitive.
3. Some of the results look interesting.

### Weaknesses
1. The current manuscript could really use a better position to avoid over-claiming.

a. Currently the paper highlights the ability of adapting black-box pretrained large text-video model. However, it relaxes the assumption of obtaining intermediate generation results of the black-box model, which is not realistic, and even contradicts with the term "black-box". It is really inappropriate to just use an existing term in a completely different setting.

b. The current manuscript also highlights parameter efficiency. However, the current evidence is not enough to really claim this. There has been some many parameter efficient fine-tuning techniques and the comparison with such existing method is really needed to claim superiority from this part. Specifically, comparisons with LoRA and other SOTA PEFT methods should be at least provided to help the audience really know the performance of existing methods.

c. The current setup is actually not that highlighting efficiency. The largest small model can even take half of the computation of the large model. It would be much more rigorous if the authors can set a computation budget and compare methods under a fixed budget.

2. Evaluation of the video generation. From qualitative inspect, I don't really think Video Adapter in Figure 8 is really better. Is there any case study further examining the human preference and the score obtained from automatic evaluation, especially on datasets like Ego4D?

### Summary
The paper proposes an adapter-based video-generation model training methodology. They use a large pre-trained videogen model and use the output scores from the model (at each step of denoising in diffusion models) to help train a smaller model for a specific task.
The black box large pre-trained model has been used as a prior to learn a distribution of new stylistic videos in a finetuning-free, probabilistic composition framework. The small model is learned via MLE and the black box model EBM interpretation is used to sample from it. To probabilistically adopt the pre trained black-box model to new data, the denoising prediction is changed to the sum of predictions from both the black-box pre-trained model and the task-specific small model. The combined model is further refined by MCMC sampling. 
 The authors show successful experiments on controlled video generation, egocentric videos, and realistic robotic videos from simulation.

### Strengths
1. The authors tackle a novel problem of building proprietary video models which has not been addressed before in the video generation domain. The videos provided as supplementary material look great.
2. The paper is well-written and self-explanatory with well-cited results and related work

### Weaknesses
The paper is based on the fact that there will be more closed source companies willing to open source their diffusion scores.

The description of “Controllable video synthesis” is not very clear in terms of inputs. The text description as inputs is not provided very clearly hence someone without knowing the problem statement of this particular problem has difficulty in understanding what are the inputs.

### Summary
This paper proposed a new method called Video Adapter to adapt a large pretrained text-to-video diffusion model for new transfer and enviroment. Video Adapter trained a small domain-specific model to provide the score to guide the inversion trajectory of large-scale pretrained model. The proposed method was successful in many downstream tasks including animation, style transfer and egocentric modeling.

### Strengths
1. This paper is easy to follow, and the overall writing is good.
2. The proposed method, Video Adapter, is a simple yet effective way to guide the inversion trajectory to adapt for new scenarios.

### Weaknesses
1. My major concern is the lack of comparison with other baseline models like Lora, null-text inversion and prefix-tuning. Surely, these methods I mentioned above were designed for image adaptation but, correct me if I am wrong, it seems that they can be easily transplanted to the video diffusion model to serve as baselines models. Authors should explain more about why such comparison is not necessary.

2.In table 1, small+pretrained demonstrate the best quantitative performance on both Bridge and Ego4D. However, these numbers are very close to only small variant. Considering the poor generative quality of small model in Figure 7 and 8, it is questionable whether small+pretrained can generate high-quality videos consistently.

### Questions
1. The prior strength weight is constant during the sampling. It would be interesting to see if that the prior strength weight is changing with t could be helpful.

I would increase my rating if my concerns are properly addressed.

### Summary
This paper investigates how to adapt a pre-trained text-to-video model to a specific domain without modifying the pretrained model. The authors propose Video Adapter, which trained a task-specific small video model and leverage pre-trained models to guide generation during inference.

### Strengths
Since this framework only requires training a small domain-specific text-to-video model, the domain-specific model can be adapted to any pretrained models as long as their input and output definitions are same.

Experiments clearly demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

### Weaknesses
The authors assume pretrained model weights are not accessible. Table 1 and figure 9 verifies the authors’ claim. However, it is not clear how does the model perform compared to other methods, such as LoRA and prefix-tuning if pretrained model weights are accessible. Specifically, the performance gap between the proposed method and parameter-efficient fine-tuning techniques under the condition of accessible pre-trained model weights remains a significant concern. The experiments do not fully explore the potential benefits of fine-tuning the pre-trained model directly, which could provide a more comprehensive understanding of the proposed method's limitations. Furthermore, the comparison to other methods is limited to the specific scenario where pre-trained weights are not accessible, leaving a gap in the evaluation when this constraint is relaxed.

### Questions
Method in Sec 3 is not limit to text-to-video generation and should also be applicable to text-to-image generation. Have you considered other use cases?

Only two models (a pretrained model and a domain-specific model) are involved in derivation in Sec. 3. If we have more than 1 domain-specific model, can we easily extend this method to multiple domain-specific models?

I know the assumption here is that pretrained models are not accessible during training. But what if we can access the pre-trained models during training, will it outperform LoRA and prefix-finetuning?
