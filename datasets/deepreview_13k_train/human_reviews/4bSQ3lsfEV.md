# Going Beyond Neural Network Feature Similarity: The Network Feature Complexity and Its Interpretation Using Category Theory

- Decision: Accept
- Scores: 6, 6, 3, 8

## Abstract
The behavior of neural networks still remains opaque, and a recently widely noted phenomenon is that networks often achieve similar performance when initialized with different random parameters. This phenomenon has attracted significant attention in measuring the similarity between features learned by distinct networks. However, feature similarity could be vague in describing the same feature since equivalent features hardly exist. In this paper, we expand the concept of equivalent feature and provide the definition of what we call \emph{functionally equivalent features}. These features produce equivalent output under certain transformations. 
Using this definition, we aim to derive a more intrinsic metric for the so-called \emph{feature complexity} regarding the redundancy of features learned by a neural network at each layer. We offer a formal interpretation of our approach through the lens of category theory, a well-developed area in mathematics. To quantify the feature complexity, we further propose an efficient algorithm named Iterative Feature Merging. Our experimental results validate our ideas and theories from various perspectives. We empirically demonstrate that the functionally equivalence widely exists among different features learned by the same neural network and we could reduce the number of parameters of the network without affecting the performance. We have also drawn several interesting empirical findings, including: 
1) the larger the network, the more redundant features it learns; 2) in particular, we show how to prune the networks based on our finding using direct equivalent feature merging, without fine-tuning which is often needed in peer network pruning methods; 3) same structured networks with higher feature complexity achieve better performance; 4) through the layers of a neural network, the feature complexity first increase then decrease; 5) for the image classification task, a group of functionally equivalent features may correspond to a specific low-level semantic meaning.
Source code will be made publicly available.

### Summary
This paper proposes the concept of neural network feature complexity which is (claimed by the authors) a more formal and comprehensive description of the behavior of the trained neural networks. This idea, along with the technical part including theory, approach and empirical results, to my best knowledge, are basically new in literature. Specifically, the authors develop a quantitative metric to enable the reduction of neural network parameters based on the proposed concept of feature equivalence. In fact, the layer-wise feature complexity is also well supported by a number of empirical studies which also well align with the intuition: e.g. higher feature complexity with the same size of networks can achieve better performance; a larger network tends to learn redundant feaures; equivalents features may correspond to certain low-level semantics. It also well establishes the connection to linear mode connectivity (LMC).

One other interesting aspect of the paper is introducing the powerful tool of category theory to establish the (clear) theoretical foundation of the work: represent the network structure as a category and a certain neural network as a functor that maps this structure to specific parameters. The authors also give a clear discussion to differentiate their work for using the category theory. This perspective along with its technical derivation and results are new to my best knowledge and well fit with the proposed paradigm for understanding the feteature complexity.

### Strengths
The authors have well stated the contributions in their paper and my main concerns are mostly from writing and presentation. I think the authors are very familiar to the field of the paper and their presented theoretical results and methods are new, well-motivated and well verified by the experiments (espeically from the pruning perspective).

### Weaknesses
Yet the paper need to be more self-contained when introducing the ideas and background There are a few specific suggestions:
1) in the abstract, the authors are suggested to emphasize the feature complexity is layer-wise to make it more clear as this is a new concept to my knowledge; they may use the term layer-wise ASAP in the abstract.
2) it is vague to use the saying: merge of features in the first paragraph. Its exact and clear meaning need be better explained for self-containess. I think it refers to merge the weight to merge the feature; 
3) I am a bit confused with Eq. 4, how \tau_z^{l+1} is imposed on Z^{l+1}? Is it a dot operation or we shall write it as a function of \tau_z^{l+1}?
4) it would also be good to clarify what are the Functionally Equivalent Features in Definitions 3.1, I think they are layer-wise f^{l}(theta_a^{l}) vs. f^{l}(theta_b^{l})?
5) it a bit abuses the notations? does Z() also equals to f()? Please clarify it.
6) in the introduction part, the authors may mention the partial order idea to make the complexity concept more tangible to readers, rather than until give the specific definition in Section 3.

some minor typos:
In another words->In another word
it simply apply no transformation->it simply applies no transformation
in definition 3.1 Functionally Equivalent Feature->Functionally Equivalent Features
at l-th layer of network->at the l-th layer of network
in Theorem 3.3 to a itself->to itself

Finally I suggest the authors consider to put an overview of their work in the introduction part to improve the readability.

### Questions
How the proposed pruning comapre with other (SOTA) pruning method? Additional experiments will further enhance the paper.

### Summary
The paper attempts to tackle a pertinent issue in neural networks, focusing on understanding and measuring the similarity between features learned by different neural network initializations. The concepts presented seem promising, especially in defining what are termed as functionally equivalent features and the subsequent proposal of an algorithm, Iterative Feature Merging (IFM). However, there are concerns and areas of improvement that need addressing.

### Strengths
* The paper addresses a significant issue in neural networks—understanding the behavior and feature representation across different initializations.

* The introduction of the term "functionally equivalent features" offers a fresh perspective on understanding neural networks.

* The Iterative Feature Merging (IFM) seems promising as an approach to quantify feature complexity.

### Weaknesses
 * The term "functionally equivalent features" is central to the paper. It would be beneficial to the reader if a simple illustrative example or intuitive explanation accompanied its introduction.

* While the abstract and conclusion provide a concise overview, it remains unclear how rigorous the definitions and proofs, especially related to category theory, are in the main content of the paper. The paper would benefit from a detailed walkthrough of the mathematical formulations and proofs to ensure the robustness of the claims made.

* Given the recent interest in understanding neural network behavior and their feature representations, it is vital to contextualize this work concerning existing literature. How does this work differ or extend previous work on the topic? A comprehensive comparison is essential.

### Questions
* The conclusion acknowledges a limitation in testing only for image classification tasks. Why was the scope of experiments limited to image classification tasks, and how would the approach perform on other tasks? It would strengthen the paper to include experiments from a wider range of tasks or at least provide a rationale for why image classification was chosen as the primary focus. 

* Can the authors provide a more intuitive or illustrative example of "functionally equivalent features" to aid understanding?

* The Iterative Feature Merging (IFM) algorithm is a central piece of this work. How does the Iterative Feature Merging (IFM) algorithm work in detail, and what makes it efficient? A clear and detailed algorithmic procedure, possibly with pseudocode, should be provided for a comprehensive understanding.

### Summary
The paper proposes an algorithm for merging of functionally equivalent neurons in a neuron network - neurons that do the same job due to having same input weights and same output weights on the same respective input and output connections.  Empirical evaluation is provided showing that sometimes a substantial pruning of the neurons (or merging of features, as the authors call it) can be achieved for a relatively minor drop in accuracy performance.  Authors propose to use the size of the network after the pruning/merge as the means of quantifying network complexity.

### Strengths
The method is extremely straight forward - compare the distance between concatenated vector of in-going and out-going weights of two neurons in a layer, and if they are below threshold, declare them the same.

Empirical evaluation seems to show this to be an effective method of pruning neurons in larger networks.

### Weaknesses
I don't understand what the point of dragging of the reader through the group theory part of the paper is accomplishing.  It doesn't seem to me like group theory is used to arrive at the proposed feature merging/pruning algorithm.  Permutation of pairs of neurons in a network by swapping their input and output weights (provided they are connected to the same inputs and outputs) is sort of obvious, and in that light, the merging of the features/neurons is quite simple and straight forward.  Defining categories, functors and objects in this setting doesn't seem to give us any extra insight, or produce different tools for how to do the merging.  I find that the theoretical part of the paper has very little to do with the proposed practical aspect, other than perhaps we can name things using group theory terminology.  And if anything, it seems to obfuscate a very straight forward pruning technique that is proposed.  

In this race to the state of the art accuracy (which I still think we are all in) it seems that any pruning technique that sacrifices even a fraction of accuracy for some gains in computational/training time costs, is not going to be of practical use.

I can't tell if the proposed feature complexity is meaningful in any way.  Does it correlate with generalisation?

### Questions
Aside from my objection to the group theory aspect of the paper, I don't understand what the concept of shape of the features relates to.  Is it the shape of the matrix/tensor representing the features?   

Repeating my question from the previous section - is feature complexity related to generalisation?  And what is actually feature complexity?  Is it the total count of neurons in a network after pruning?  How do we know it means something?    

The statement "feature complexity corresponds to the most compact representation of a neural network" sound like something related to the minimum description length (MDL) or minimum message length (MML) principles.  Any comment how your work relates to those?

### Summary
The paper delves into the feature similarity and further proposes the feature equivalence, and finally feature complexity of a trained neural network. The authors also introduce the well-established math tool of category theory to elegantly estaiblish the theory of the introduced concepts as well as methods. Beyond new theoretical understanding, the authors further devise an iterative algorithm to achieve the computing of feature complexity based on which the functionally equivalent features can be found in a neural network such that pruning of neural networks can be fulfilled.

### Strengths
1) an important understanding to the trained neural networks by introducing the new concept of feature equivalence and feature complexity which go beyond the feature similarity.
2) an effective algorithm for computing the feature complexity and as a side-product can be used to prune the trained networks on the fly without access to the training dataset, neither with any iterations for finetuning which are needed in existing pruning methods.
3) the authors further draw a few interesting observations which are well interpretable that further consolidates the impact and soundness of this work.

### Weaknesses
The paper could be improved in some aspects: 1) due to the density of the new information in this paper, the authors may move some empirical results in plot to Section 1, to make the readers more easily to jump into the main idea and discovery of the work; 2) the related work part can be extendeded. Specifically, please discuss the difference and relation to the recent work in ICML 2023: On the power of foundation models. As far as I know, the paper also intensively uses the category theory tools for interpreting neural networks especially foundations models. Also, as the paper proposes a new pruning mehtod, the related work part need also discuess peer methods; 3) for experiment part, the authors are required to compare peer pruning methods as the main technical approach presented in this paper is a pruning technique. Also the authors shall more comprehensively discuss the pros and cons of their pruning method in the context of network pruning.

### Questions
How sensitive of the proposed IFM method to the hyperparameter \beta? The authors shall discuss it and give some ablation studies if possible.
