# Polarity-Aware Semantic Retrieval with Fine-Tuned Sentence Embeddings

- Decision: Reject
- Scores: 5, 5, 3, 3

## Abstract
This paper investigates the effectiveness of fine-tuning sentence embeddings for simultaneously retrieving sentences of equal polarity and high semantic similarity. We define two opposing metrics to support evaluation: Polarity Score and Semantic Similarity Score, used in a test suite with various lightweight sentence-transformer models, hyperparameters and loss functions. We perform evaluations on two binary classification problems from different domains: the SST-2 dataset for sentiment analysis and on detecting sarcastic news headlines.
Our findings show a trade-off between a model's capability for retaining semantic similarity while being fine-tuned to differentiate between the polarity of training data. By accepting a minor decrease in semantic similarity, however, we achieve polarity scores far higher than the baselines. The results and modeling scheme allows for using a single, efficient model for text analytics systems suitable for in-domain retrieval.

### Summary
This paper aimed to build models that retrieved similar sentences in both meaning and polarity. This paper addressed the problem of fine-tuning pre-trained sentence embedding models to a classification task while maintaining the ability to retrieve similar sentences. The authors presented two new metrics, the Polarity Score and the Semantic Similarity Score, to analyze the effect of fine-tuning using different contrastive-based losses. The authors argued that we can balance both STS (Semantic Similarity Score) and classification (Polarity Score) performances. To achieve this, the authors also proposed a new method to generate examples for fine-tuning. The example generations selected samples with similar meanings but opposite classification labels.

In the experiment, the author first established that the models achieved good scores for both semantic similarity and polarity without fine-tuning. The main results of the experiments showed that as we increased the number of samples, the model attained higher polarity scores, but the semantic similarity scores were slightly suffered. Upon further analysis, the authors suggested that the triplet loss performed best in achieving both scores and the margins (\lambda) did not have a large effect on performance.

### Strengths
1. This paper proposed a new formation of the text retrieval task.
2. This paper provided extensive experiment results on new retrieval metrics. The experiments included two datasets, and the results were consistent. It also confirmed previous findings that sentence-embedding models performed well in zero-shot classification and unsupervised retrieval.

### Weaknesses
Overall, I found the paper interesting, but some concerns regarding the significance of the proposed task and the results.

1. Although the paper proposed a new formulation of the text retrieval task, it did not mention why the task was important in the downstream applications or in further investigation of model capacity. Thus, the results of this paper provided limited implications. 
2. In the direction of the model investigation, the experiment setup was based on a single dataset, i.e., fine-tuning and retrieving the same dataset. Consequently, the author could only conclude that the proposed method retained sentence similarity performance within the fine-tuned dataset. It is unclear how this is better than the standard benchmarks that included zero-shot classifications and unsupervised sentence retrieval.
3. Since the authors introduced the example generation approach, the results would be more meaningful if the authors compared with a baseline (original example generation.)
4. The problem addressed in this paper is relevant to the "forgetting effect" and its solutions, such as Chen et al., 2020 or Luo et al., 2023. The author should discuss this in the related work.

### Questions
1. Why did you train only 3 epochs to generate Figure 4?
2. Figure 4 was quite insightful, did the "max" models remain consistent? 
3. Could you clarify why you did not test the fine-tuned models on STS using a standard benchmark?

### Summary
This paper explores the efficacy of encoding polarity into sentence embeddings while
retaining semantic similarity, done by fine-tuning models on data generated to suit the objectives of various sentence-transformers loss functions. Two metrics were introduced to evaluate the results on The Stanford Sentiment Treebank binary classification and The News Headlines Dataset Sarcasm Detection: the Polarity and Semantic Similarity Score.

### Strengths
- Sound and rigorous experimentation, with reproducible results hosted from an anonymous repository
- Polarity scores for all loss configurations and Semantic similarity scores for all loss configurations and Aggregated scores across all configurations are reported meticulously
- Crystal clear presentation on the system, training configuration, data generation and tasks

### Weaknesses
The paper offers a crystal clear presentation of a system effectively fine-tuning sentence embeddings
for simultaneously retrieving sentences of equal polarity and high semantic similarity. However, in my opinion, it is not clear what the conclusion from the paper is, and whether anything *generalizable* can be drawn from the paper. For example, why SST-2 and Sarcastic Headlines are picked as the tasks for evaluation, why were the three loss functions picked, and most importantly, are not answered. In addition, aside from "To our knowledge, no comparable work exists to let us evaluate the model performance on this joint task with well-established metrics", no discussion on the extensibility of the work was offered. Perhaps the paper is better suited for a system track in an NLP conference, or a workshop in a machine learning conference, for its rigorous description of an interesting system offering 2 well-defined metrics for evaluation, and though its relative lack of contribution to machine learning.

### Questions
> We combine the two in a metric C, weighted with β (0.5 by default to produce the average),
primarily used to illustrate overall performance: Cβ(s) := β · PM(s) + (1 − β) · SM_M(s)

Why can the two metrics be combined in the form of a weighted sum? (After all, one may argue that the "units" of the two metrics are different.)

### Summary
This paper aims to investigate the effect of fine-tuning sentence embeddings on two sentence retrieval tasks, equal polarity and high semantic similarity. This paper proposes two evaluation metric and conducts experiments on two sources of datasets.

### Strengths
1. This paper is generally self-contained for readers to understand different concepts. It provides enough tables and figures to illustrate text descriptions.

2. Experiment section contains enough implementation details, which allow readers to potentially reproduce the results in the paper.

3. This paper also identifies a few possible future works, which look promising and interesting.

### Weaknesses
Despite the above strengths, I still have the following concerns:

1. This paper lacks technical contribution. I can't see an originally proposed model architecture for sentence embedding problem. Instead, this paper looks more like a summary of why fine-tuning is an important technique for sentence embedding, but fine-tuning is also not a new concept and has been adopted by many previous works, including most LLMs. The paper does not introduce a novel approach to fine-tuning itself, such as a new loss function, a unique training strategy, or a modification to the model architecture to better adapt to the sentence retrieval task. The experiments seem to only explore different datasets for fine-tuning, which is not a significant contribution to the field of sentence embeddings.

2. When we do experiments, we usually need to repeat the same experiment multiple times and report both mean and standard deviation, in order to verify that the proposed model indeed significantly outperforms baselines. However, I can see mean but not standard deviation in the experiments.

### Summary
The paper studies the effectiveness of fine-tuning sentence embeddings for retrieving polarity-aware and semantic-aware similar sentences simultaneously. The authors propose metrics to measure polarity similarity and semantic similarity respectively. Experiments are done with four sentence embedding models of different sizes on two datasets.

### Strengths
1. The paper investigates the polarity capturing and semantic capturing of the finetuned sentence embedding methods.
2. The authors conduct experiments on two datasets with four base models.

### Weaknesses
1. The paper is poorly written, and the motivation and problem definition are not clear.
2. The problem studied is not insightful and the findings are trivial.
3. Many technique details are not well illustrated.

### Questions
1. Could you give a formal definition of the polarity? From my understanding, it is according to the label in the original dataset.
2. What is your motivation for this study and what is your takeaway conclusion? The experimental results are kind of trivial to me. “Polarity” and “Semantic” can have distribution overlap but are not exactly the same. So if you finetune the sentence embedding methods based on polarity perspective, it is quite common that it will suffer on the semantic dimension.
3. The definition of semantic score is confusing to me. Correct me if I am wrong, but it seems that if you finetune your sentence embedding models on whatever data, the semantic score will always decrease, since the finetuned model is diverging from the original parameters.
4. What is  w_i in sec 3.2.2? Is it the same as that in sec 3.2.1?
5. What is the reference model for semantic calculation used in sec 3.3 and sec 4? If I am understanding correctly, in section 4, you are using the base sentence embedding model without further finetuning as the reference model. Is it the same in sec 3.3?
6. How do you set \beta in sec 3.2.2?
