- Decision: Reject
- Scores: 5, 6, 6, 6

## Abstract
We investigate the problem of fixed-budget best arm identification (BAI) for minimizing expected simple regret. In an adaptive experiment, a decision maker draws one of multiple treatment arms based on past observations and observes the outcome of the drawn arm. After the experiment, the decision maker recommends the treatment arm with the highest expected outcome. We evaluate the decision based on the expected simple regret, which is the difference between the expected outcomes of the best arm and the recommended arm. Due to inherent uncertainty, we evaluate the regret using the minimax criterion. First, we derive asymptotic lower bounds for the worst-case expected simple regret, which are characterized by the variances of potential outcomes (leading factor). Based on the lower bounds, we propose the Adaptive-Sampling (AS)-Augmented Inverse Probability Weighting (AIPW) strategy, which utilizes the AIPW estimator in recommending the best arm. Our theoretical analysis shows that the AS-AIPW strategy is asymptotically minimax optimal, meaning that the leading factor of its worst-case expected simple regret matches our derived worst-case lower bound. Finally, we validate the proposed method's effectiveness through simulation studies.

### Summary
The authors propose a work in the field of fixed-budget best arm identification for multi-armed bandits when contextual information is available, with the goal of minimizing the expected simple regret.
The authors derive asymptotic lower bounds on the expected simple regret depending on the variances of the potential outcomes rather than considering outcomes with bounded supports. The lower bound is provided in both the cases in which contextual information is available and when it is not.
Moreover, they provide an algorithm, namely AS-AIPW, showing that it matches (asymptotically) the lower bound.
Finally, the authors present a numerical validation of the presented results just on synthetic data.

### Strengths
The proposed work faces the problem of best arm identification in MABs. The authors discuss the theoretical differences when contextual information are available or not.
Moreover, the work presents two asymptotic lower bounds (one with and the other without contextual information) and an algorithm, which asympotically matches the lower bounds. 

The analysis seems to be done properly, but I have not checked the correctness of all the proofs.

### Weaknesses
A weakness I found in the paper is linked to the feeling that the authors did not pay great attention to the details. 

Indeed:
- The abstract is not so clear since it does not introduce the fact that the setting at hand will consider contextual information and that it will compare it with the case in which contextual information is not available;
- The introductory section is not clear;
- I would appreciate (at least a paragraph) on some motivating examples (also in the appendix) with some comments.
- Some crucial quantities are not commented on, such as the meaning of the AIPW estimator.

In the experimental section (even in Appendix I) I found too simple experimental settings. Even if I have appreciated the comparison with fixed-budget BAI when no contextual information is available, I do not believe that it is fair to compare the same baselines (that are not thought for contextual settings) with the proposed algorithm. I suggest employing at least another algorithm thought for the same setting proposed by the authors if present (and if no competitors are available, please write it).

### Questions
Besides the concerns related to the "weaknesses" section, here are other questions:
1. is it possible to adapt the lower and upper bounds not to be asymptotic?
2. will you release the code of the experiments to assess if the numerical validation is reproducible?

### Summary
This paper considers the fixed-budget best-arm identification problem in (contextual) multi-armed bandits and takes simple regret minimization as the objective. It first derives an asymptotic minimax lower bound that depends on the variance of the reward distribution. Then, it proposes an algorithm called **AS-AIPW** that nearly achieves this lower bound asymptotically. Finally, sanity check experiments are also provided to validate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.

### Strengths
- The variance dependent asymptotic lower bound is considered to be highly novel.
- Under specific scenarios, the optimal allocation strategy has closed-form expression.
- The proposed algorithm nearly achieves the lower bound.

### Weaknesses
One weakness is that the current Theorem 3.8 in this paper does not generalize to the case with $K\geq 3$ and it is not clear whether the difficulty is technical or fundamental.

Another weakness is that most provided experiment results do not show advantages of **AS-AIPW** over variance-unaware algorithms. Although the paper conjectures that the superiority of **AS-AIPW** can only appear when $K$ is small, from my perspective, the number of arms should not be the essential factor. In particular, the worst-case regret of variance-unaware algorithms scales with the magnitude of the reward while that of **AS-AIPW** scales with the standard deviation of the reward. Therefore, if my understanding is correct, the advantage of **AS-AIPW** should appear if we run it on a hard instance with large reward magnitude but small variance. Is that possible to design and run experiments on such an instance?

### Questions
- In the sixth requirement of Definition 3.2, does "$\mu^a(P)(x)\rightarrow \mu^a(P^\sharp)$" means that there exists a sequence of bandit models $\lbrace P_n\rbrace$ such that $\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty} \mu^a(P_n)(x)= \mu^a(P^\sharp)$?
- Based on the given results, it seems quite tempting to conjecture that Theorem 3.8 can be generalized to the case with $K\geq 3$. Is this fundamentally not doable or does it just require more sophisticated techniques?
- What are the disadvantages of using $\arg\max_{a\in[K]}\widehat{\mu}^a_T$ as the arm recommendation rule? Do these disadvantages exist when there is no context information?
- If my understanding is correct, when there is no context information, we have $\widehat{\mu}^a_t=\frac{1}{t}\sum_{s=1}^{t}\mathbf{1}\lbrace A_s=a\rbrace Y_s$. Then, it looks weird that $\widehat{\mu}^{\mathrm{AIPW}, a}\_T$ contains the term $$\frac{1} {T}\sum_{t=1}^{T}\widehat{\mu}^a_t=\frac{1}{T}\sum_{t=1}^{T}\left(\sum_{s=t}^{T}\frac{1}{s}\right)\mathbf{1}\lbrace A_t=a\rbrace Y_t,$$ since it means that more weights are explicitly put on earlier samples. Why will this happen?
- Suppose there are not many possible contexts and we can encounter each contexts for sufficiently many times, can we treat **AS-AIPW** as doing BAI for each context independently? That is, if we define $$\widehat{a}^{\mathrm{AIPW}}\_T(x)=\arg\max_{a\in[K]}\frac{1}{T}\sum_{t=1}^{T}\mathbf{1}\lbrace X_t=x\rbrace \varphi^a_t(Y_t, A_t, X_t),$$ can we bound the simple regret condition on $X=x$ by $$\max_{a, b\in[K]: a\neq b}\sqrt{\log(K)\left(\frac{(\sigma^a(x))^2}{w^*(a\vert x)}+\frac{(\sigma^b(x))^2}{w^*(b\vert x)}\right)}+o(1)?$$

### Summary
This paper considers the problem of fixed budget best arm identification, with the goal of minimising the expected simple regret. Asymptotic lower bounds of the worst-case expected simple regret are provided, where the bound depends on the variances of potential outcomes. The bound gives possible analytical solutions for the target allocation ratio, based on which, the authors proposed Adaptive-Sampling Augmented Inverse Probability Weighting (AS-AIPW) strategy. AS-AIPW relies on the adaptive estimation of variances. AS-AIPW is proved to be asymptotically minimax optimal. The proposed algorithm is evaluated in simulation studies.

### Strengths
- The paper presents the first asymptotic lower bounds for the worst-case expected simple regret based on the variances of potential outcomes, contributing to the theoretical foundation of the field.
- The introduction of the Adaptive-Sampling Augmented Inverse Probability Weighting (AS-AIPW) strategy, using the target allocation ratio from the lower bounds
- The theoretical proof of AS-AIPW being asymptotically minimax optimal provides strong theoretical support for the proposed algorithm's performance.
- The paper includes simulation studies comparing the proposed algorithm to baselines, enhancing the practical understanding of its performance.

### Weaknesses
 - only asymptotic theoretical results are provided. For fixed budget settings, non-asymptotic bounds can provide a better understanding of algorithm performance under a fixed budget. 
- The proposed algorithm AS-AIPW highly depends on the variance estimation. It is unclear how poor estimations at the early stage and for more general distributions influence non-asymptotic performance. A discussion can be provided. 
- The experimental results verify the above concern, the proposed algorithm tends to outperform baselines when variances significantly vary across arms. It is worth showing how variances and different variance estimators influence the performance of the proposed algorithm.

### Questions
- can you define w(a|x) in Theorem 3.4? 
- A related work: On Best-Arm Identification with a Fixed Budget in Non-Parametric Multi-Armed Bandits, Barrier et al 2023. Can you discuss this? 
- in Figure 1, can you also draw the standard deviation of the independent trials?

### Summary
This paper considers Best Arm Identification problem under the fixed-budget setup. It aims at minimizing the expected simple regret, i.e., the expected difference between the oracle best arm and the recommended arm. An asymptotic worst-case lower bound concerning the variances of the arms is provided. An algorithm AS-AIPW strategy is devised with almost matching worst-case upper bounds. Compared to the existing literature, it utilizes more information of the distribution (i.e., the variance) to refine the arm allocation rules. Additionally, it considers the benefit of taking contextual information into account. Experiments are also conducted to illustrate the empirical performances.

### Strengths
- The paper extends the BAI problem under the fix-budget setup to the context-aware setup. Both the lower bounds and upper bounds involve a context-aware variables that tighten the bounds.

- The lower bound result is appreciated. While the proof is complicated, the result yields theoretical foundations on why we should pull the arms according to the allocation proportional to their variances in order to hit the lower bound. It also resolves the remaining lower bound problem in [1] to some extent (as [1] considers the misidentification probability instead of the expected simple regret). I believe this is the main novelty of the paper and is of theoretical interest.

- An algorithm AS-AIPW is designed whose upper bound asymptotically matches the lower bound in the worst-case up to a factor of $log K$. A non-asymptotic upper bound is also given, which helps us to understand the convergence rate.

- Empirical studies of the algorithm are carried out to illustrate the performance.

### Weaknesses
 - While experiments are conducted to compare multiple algorithms, little improvement has been observed of the proposed algorithm compared to the existing ones, even in the case where the variances are heterogeneous (which is claimed to be favorable for the proposed algorithm). In addition, the algorithm design is somewhat expected given the G-optimal design and the intuition in [1].

- [1] also considers incorporating variances into the algorithm. The proposed algorithm is similar to [1] under the sole context case in the sense that both pull arms according to the (empirical) variances. So a more detailed discussion/comparison with [1] in terms of the algorithm design, the bounds (on the misidentification probability and expected simple regret) and the empirical performances is appreciated.

Minors:
- Page 3 Line 3: Instead of "$A_t$ is $\mathcal{F}_t$-measurable", I think $A_t$ is only $\sigma(X_1,A_1,Y_1,\dots,X_t)$-measurable. Please kindly check.
- Is $\pi^{Uniform-EBM}$ a typo? Should be $\pi^{Uniform-EBA}$
- Page 6, Line 3 in subsection 4.1, the numerator of the allocation for arm 1 is $\sigma^1$ 
- Page 6, Line 2 after Theorem 3.8, I suppose $X_t$ should be $X$ in the inequalities? In addition, I do not follow why $E^X[\frac{(\sigma^1(X))^2}{w(1|X)}+\frac{(\sigma^2(X))^2}{w(2|X)}]\geq\max_{a\in[2]}\sqrt{E^X[\frac{(\sigma^a(X))^2}{w(a|X)}}]$, as $\frac{1}{8}+\frac{1}{8}<\sqrt{1/8}$.

### Questions
- Can you give more explanations on $\underline{C}$ at the end of Page 4? From my understanding, in [2], the forced exploration is a design of the algorithm. And in [3], $\beta$ is also a hyper parameter (thus, a design) of the algorithm. But here $\underline{C}$ is an assumption on the problem instance, so I think they are not similar.
- Given that the optimal allocation is known, is it possible to adopt a tracking sampling rule, i.e., sampling the arms in a way such that the empirical arm allocation approaches the optimal allocation. As indicated by section 2.3 in [4], sampling according to a distribution can make the convergence speed slow. Can you give comments on the allocation rule?
- It would be better if you describe the experiment designs in more detail. In particular, 
	- for the Sequential Halving-based algorithm, it only recommends an arm at the end of the experiment, how to compute the simple regret of the arm at $t\in \{ 1000,\dots,50000 \}$? And it would also be interesting to see how SHAdaVar behaves without contextual information while the other algorithms have access to contextual information in App. I.2.
	- for the other algorithms, how you incorporate contextual information in the original algorithm.

Please also refer to the Weaknesses section. I'd appreciate it if you can resolve my concerns.
