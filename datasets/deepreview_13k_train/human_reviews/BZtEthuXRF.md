## Abstract
We present Manifold Diffusion Fields (\model), an approach that unlocks learning of diffusion models of data in general non-Euclidean geometries. Leveraging insights from spectral geometry analysis, we define an intrinsic coordinate system on the manifold via the eigen-functions of the Laplace-Beltrami Operator.  {\model} represents functions using an explicit parametrization formed by a set of multiple input-output pairs. Our approach allows to sample continuous functions on manifolds and is invariant with respect to rigid and isometric transformations of the manifold. In addition, we show that {\model} generalizes to the case where the training set contains functions on different manifolds. Empirical results on multiple datasets and manifolds including challenging scientific problems like weather prediction or  molecular conformation show that {\model} can capture distributions of such functions with better diversity and fidelity than previous approaches.

### Summary
The authors propose a methodology for learning fields over manifolds with denoising diffusion probabilistic models. It uses an approximation of eigen-functions of the Laplace-Beltrami Operator for the manifold at hand to create an intrinsic functional basis for the manifold. This approximation is the eigendecomposition of the graph Laplacian of the mesh approximating the manifold. This formulation theoretically allows the model to learn from data that live in manifolds, even in the absence of analytical forms for the metric of the manifold and related operators.

### Strengths
The paper is excellently written, with very clear explanations, illustrations, and algorithms. Experimentally, the paper covers a lot of "ground" in terms of exploring the capabilities of their model. This includes comparisons against the closest-related model in multiple scenarios and comparisons against task-specific models (molecule generation).

I believe the paper does a good job at showing how this relatively direct tweak to how DPF works is a very appropriate one. This is supported by a sufficient amount of experimental evidence, which explores most practical questions about such a change in representation.

Interestingly, the paper also shows the robustness of the model to rigid transformations on the manifold, having a much more appropriate behavior in this case than the model it is mostly based on.

### Weaknesses
I believe the model's biggest weakness is its novelty. Theoretically, there is only a small contribution compared to DPF (Zhuang et al., 2023). While the authors theoretically discuss the possibility to use Laplace-Beltrami Operators as the source for a functional basis on the manifolds, this is only explored as graph Laplacians, which are a discrete approximation of manifolds. Understandably, in many scenarios it is not possible to analytically solve this problem, but it is unclear how challenging it is to adapt the ideas presented here to scenarios where it is possible (or how beneficial that is). A simple fix to this issue, in my opinion, is to claim what is being extensively evaluated experimentally: graphs/meshes as an approximation of a manifold.

### Questions
1. Is the model's robustness to rigid transformations on the manifold a sufficient explanation for its performance for molecule generation? Is it possible that it is also robust to other types of transformations which are useful in solving this task?

*Minor comments*
- Sec. 3.3: were $<$ and $>$ the intended symbols when writing $f$ as a linear combination of the basis?
- Sec. 3.3: "making MDF strictly operate the manifold" => "on the"?
- p. 7: "available at [URL]" I think a footnote here is less disruptive for reading

### Summary
The paper proposed the extension of diffusion probabilistic fields onto Riemannian manifolds. The proposed method utilizes the Laplace-Beltrami operator to build an efficient representation of the points on Riemannian manifolds, which makes the proposed method invariant with respect to rigid and isometric transformations of the manifold. Numerical experiments are provided to show the efficacy of the proposed method.

### Strengths
The proposed method is the first work that can handle the diffusion process where the support of the distribution is on Riemannian manifolds. The proposed usage of the eigen-functions of Laplace-Beltrami operator makes the proposed method invariant w.r.t. affine and isometric transformations. The proposed method outperforms existing diffusion models on manifolds.

### Weaknesses
The proposed method seems to be a plain extension of a previous work of diffusion probabilistic field. This extension shows a great potential for non-Euclidean domain but the work seems not to focusing on the discussion of how this new representation improves the work quantitatively.

The main concern, as stated in the Weakness section, is the comparison of this work with [1]. To me, the difference of this work with [1] is only the different ways of representing points on the Riemannian manifold, where [1] directly use some coordinate since the manifolds we consider are always embedded, and this work uses the leading eigen-function of the LBO to approximate the points. It remains not very clear why and how LBO eigen-functions outperforms a plain coordinate approach, or a local chart approach (since for every point on the manifold we have a local coordinate chart). Calculating eigen-functions of LBO potentially also consumes time. A more elaborative discussion of different approaches to do the embedding seems necessary.

The authors choose the top k LBO eigen-functions to do the embedding. is there a guidance on how to determine k?

Regarding Algorithm 2: First, what’s $M_q$, which seems to exist in [1] but not here? Second why do we need a random subset $C_{t}$? I thought we just need the same context and query sets as in Algorithm 1.

Regarding the numerical experiments, I’m particularly interested in the ERA5 dataset, which seems to be the only natural instance of manifold-supported distributions. It would be interesting to see how the proposed algorithm performs in terms of COV and MMD for this dataset, comparing to other algorithms as DPF and GASP.

### Summary
The authors extend diffusion fields onto Riemannian manifolds. They leverage the Laplace Beltrami operator as a way to get local coordinates. The authors then present experimental results in many situations comparing their approach to SOTA techniques.

Minor comment: in 3.3 end of the first paragraph should use langle rangle rather than less than greater than signs,

### Strengths
The overall idea the paper presents is relatively simple to understand so it is easy to follow what the authors are attempting to accomplish.

### Weaknesses
There are some errors when introducing Reimannian manifolds, for instance the authors state $g:\mathcal{M}\times\mathcal{M}\rightarrow\mathbb{R}_+$ but this is not true, the metric tensor takes in inputs from the tangent spaces and further can be 0.

The authors have a specific goal in mind for the manifolds they wish to consider but the theory seems to be more general in a sense. That is, typical Riemannian manifolds such as the cone of SPD matrices or a Grassman manifold go largely un mentioned. The authors focus on specific manifolds which could be interesting such as the Stanford bunny, but I lack to see the importance/applicability of it. That being said, it is a nice application but a little mysterious as to its usefulness.

I understand the usefulness of using function and field interchangeably but I am curious as to why this choice was made. I ask this because over Riemannian manifolds it's common to use gradient vector fields which are defined over tangent spaces and the use of fields can cause confusion here.
