# BiLoRA: A Bi-level Optimization Framework for Low-rank Adapters

- Decision: Reject
- Scores: 6, 5, 6, 5

## Abstract
Low-rank adaptations (LoRA) are widely employed for fine-tuning large-scale pretrained models in downstream tasks, by learning low-rank incremental matrices. LoRA and its variants such as AdaLoRA train an entire low-rank incremental matrix on a single training dataset, which often leads to overfitting to training data and inferior generalization on test data. To address this problem, we propose a bi-level optimization (BLO) based method for alleviating overfitting. Our method parameterizes a low-rank incremental matrix in a pseudo singular value decomposition form, and separates the training of pseudo singular  vectors and values onto different data subsets in different optimization problems. This separation alleviates the risk of overfitting to a single dataset and improves generalization on other data. 
Specifically, in the lower level of our BLO formulation, we train  the pseudo singular vectors on a subset of the training data. In the upper level, we learn  the pseudo singular values on the other subset of the training data. The two levels of optimization problems are mutually dependent on each other and solved jointly. On ten datasets from natural language understanding and generation tasks and on various popular large pretrained models, our method achieves significantly better performance than LoRA,  AdaLoRA, and other fine-tuning baseline methods  with similar amounts of trainable parameters.

### Summary
Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) is an important line of work for adapting large foundation models to a specific task. LoRA is one of the promising approaches in this direction which models the update matrices as product of two low-rank matrices. A recent approach AdaLoRA further refines LoRA formulation by modeling the update matrices as low-rank pseudo SVD decomposition and uses the singular values to adaptively allocate parameter budget to different matrices. This paper proposes a bi-level optimization approach for learning the AdaLoRA updates which allows for better generalization. The results show consistent improvement over LoRA across different tasks and models.

### Strengths
- The paper is well-written and easy to follow
- Results show consistent gains over LoRA with reduced training times due to faster convergence
- Although, the bi-level optimization approach is not novel in itself but its application in context of PEFT is new

### Weaknesses
 - Motivation for using bi-level optimization is not well supported, more specifically "One limitation of AdaLoRA is that it learns pseudo singular vectors in {P, Q} and pseudo singular values in Λ simultaneously by minimizing the fine-tuning loss on a single training dataset", why is this necessarily a limitation?
- The approach is compared against AdaLoRA only in one of the experiments since it is the most relevant baseline for this paper so I'd expected a more thorough comparison against AdaLoRA

### Questions
- Does BiLoRA also apply iterative pruning of singular values (similar to AdaLoRA)? (the paper seems to talk only about the optimization of pseudo-SVD matrices)
- Table 7 compares the total training time between LoRA and BiLoRA and shows BiLoRA is faster due to faster convergence, what are the total training steps needed for convergence for these two methods? what are the per-update cost differences between these two? Also, can we do the cost comparison with AdaLoRA?
- In the approximately binary parameterization of singular values, does removing the regularization help i.e. just sigmoid over the real values  (since this would be similar to real value baseline but with only positive values)?

### Summary
The author proposes bi-level optimization for the SVD LoRA variant. Specifically, two datasets are needed for the corresponding two level optimization objectives. At one level, the proposed method optimizes P and Q, while at the other level, it optimizes \sigma. Two penalty terms are used to regularize PQ and \sigma. Empirical results show competitive model performance and training speed compared with LoRA.

### Strengths
+ The SVD LoRA variant is formulated as two optimization objectives, one for optimizing P and Q, while the other for optimizing \sigma.
+ The formulation is easy to follow.
+ Comprehensive empirical results on NLU and NLG are provided.

### Weaknesses
 + It seems that the empirical model performance and training speed are mostly similar as LoRA.
+ It'd be better to see results on LLMs (>10B) in NLG tasks.
+ No theoretical insights are provided for understanding LoRA with bi-level optimization. Specifically, it doesn't seem convincing to replace LoRA with BiLoRA.
+ For the SVD LoRA variant, it seems to me that P and Q are of similar size as W. How does it achieve parameter-efficient finetuning?
+ How do you decide two datasets D1 and D2?

### Questions
+ For the SVD LoRA variant, it seems to me that P and Q are of similar size as W. How does it achieve parameter-efficient finetuning?
+ How do you decide two datasets D1 and D2?

3: You are fairly confident in your assessment. It is possible that you did not understand some parts of the submission or that you are unfamiliar with some pieces of related work. Math/other details were not carefully checked.

### Summary
The paper proposes BiLoRA that leverages bi-level optimization on different subsets of the data to resolve overfitting. The proposed method is efficient and produces better finetuning results across NLU and NLG tasks. Overall, the paper makes a valid contribution, and there are only some minor concerns.

### Strengths
1. Writing is pretty clear. I am able to easily follow most part of the paper. 
2. The idea to train different parameters (singular values vs vectors) at different subsets of the dataset to reduce overfitting makes sense intuitively. 
3. The method is efficient to train and also produces better results for both NLU and NLG.

### Weaknesses
1. I fail to understand why “Learning Λ by minimizing a single dataset’s training loss can easily render these contributions and parameter amounts tailored to this dataset”. In machine learning, aren’t we always learn parameters by minimizing a single dataset’s training loss?

2. It is mentioned in many places that existing methods train "on a single training dataset". "single training dataset" can be confusing here. The proposed BiLoRA even though uses different subsets, it is also still trained on the same single dataset.

3. Is the motivation that AdaLoRA can overfit to training set? If overfitting happens, can you just prune the singular values more aggressively? What happen if you just use larger weight decay in AdaLoRA?

4. Can you compare the distribution of the singular values learned in BiLoRA vs AdaLoRA? This can be helpful to understand BiLoRA more.

### Summary
This paper considers parameter efficient fine-tuning built on low rank adaptation (LoRA) and its adaptive extension AdaLoRA. The main limitations addressed regarding LoRA and AdaLoRA are that (1) LoRA uses a constant rank for all adaptors, whereas pre-trained weight matrices may have varying levels of importance for a downstream task and (2) AdaLoRA searches for pseudo singular values/vectors on the entire training set. It is suggested that (2) results in overfitting, and the main idea behind the proposed BiLoRA is to train singular values and vectors on a different partition of the training set.

### Strengths
* This paper conducts several ablation studies for various constraints that can be imposed on the singular values/vectors.
* Proposed method consumes much less training time as seen in Table 7.
* Various (large) architectures are tested on natural language understanding and language generation to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method: RoBERTa base/large; GPT-2 medium/large; DeBERTa-XXL (1.5B params).
* Empirical conclusions are sound, in particular how unconstrained pseudo-singular values that allow for negative singular values result in worse performance than the variant that uses softmax which results in non-negative singular values.

### Weaknesses
 * My main concern is that there is no evidence to support the claim the basis of this paper, that AdaLoRA overfits because it trains both singular values and vectors on the same full training set. While the authors claim this to motivate the need for bi-level optimization, it is unclear that the basis of their work is an actual limitation of existing methods. Without any evidence on the alleged limitations of AdaLoRA, it is unclear what advantages the bi-level optimization approach brings. 
* Although the main methodological difference with AdaLoRA is the bi-level optimization approah, the paper doesn't really experiment with the associated hyper-parameters. How is the number of iterations for singular value/vector updates found? Does this result in large performance/training-time differences? If the results are robust to the choice of $T_1$ and $T_2$, why not alternate between the two, i.e. $T_1 = T_2 = 1$? How does the dataset partition (choice of data on which singular values and singular vectors are trained on) affect the performance and training times?

### Questions
* Ablation study on orthogonality regularization for the singular vectors illustrate that the performance is largely unaffected by the coefficient of this regularization, i.e. penalty for singular vectors violating orthonormality has minimal effect. Is this because the resulting pseudo-singular vectors turn out to be nearly orthogonal? It would be nice to see if the optimal solutions found are nearly orthogonal by plotting their angles & magnitudes.
