- Decision: Accept
- Scores: 6, 6, 6

## Abstract
Fine-tuning text-to-image models with reward functions trained on human feedback data has proven effective for aligning model behavior with human intent. However, excessive optimization with such reward models, which serve as mere proxy objectives, can compromise the performance of fine-tuned models, a phenomenon known as reward overoptimization. To investigate this issue in depth, we introduce the Text-Image Alignment Assessment (\benabbr) benchmark, which comprises a diverse collection of text prompts, images, and human annotations. Our evaluation of several state-of-the-art reward models on this benchmark reveals their frequent misalignment with human assessment. We empirically demonstrate that overoptimization occurs notably when a poorly aligned reward model is used as the fine-tuning objective. To address this, we propose {\method}, a simple method that enhances alignment based on a measure of reward model confidence estimated across a set of semantically contrastive text prompts. We demonstrate that incorporating the confidence-calibrated rewards in fine-tuning effectively reduces overoptimization, resulting in twice as many wins in human evaluation for text-image alignment compared against the baseline reward models.

### Confidence
3: You are fairly confident in your assessment. It is possible that you did not understand some parts of the submission or that you are unfamiliar with some pieces of related work. Math/other details were not carefully checked.

### Summary
The paper proposes a simple method to prevent the overoptimization problem in alignment of text-to-image models. They work hypothesizes that the overoptimization problem is mainly due to lack of alignment between the human preference and the learnt reward model. Inorder to solve this issue, they propose two techniques namely textual normalization which better normalizes the reward using contrastive text description. Further they propose textual inconsistency score, which compares the distance between the textual description and the predicted reward . They find that both these objectives help improve the calliberation and alignment with the human reward.

### Strengths
- The problem that paper picks namely reward overoptimization. Seems to be important with very works addressing it.
- The paper does a good job at benchmarking previous reward functions on various settings.
- The paper proposes novel techniques to improve the alignment and caliberation of the current reward models.

### Weaknesses
 - The paper talks about overoptimization as the motivation, however doesn't directly evaluate for overoptimization. It instead evaluates for caliberation and human evaluation. To my understanding , current works get away with overoptimization issue with early stopping such as AlignProp (https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.03739) however this is not discussed in the paper. I would expect the right way to evaluate would be to not do early stopping and see the tradeoffs with the proposed solutions. Also talk about the benefits of not doing early stopping.
- Further AlignProp, says that they only need to do early stopping for the Aesthetics reward function, however not for HPS v2. I think it would be worth comparing againt the HPS v2 reward function and also discuss methods such as AlignProp or DDPO (https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.13301) and the tricks they use to prevent overoptimization. And why using those tricks might not be a good idea.

### Questions
- Is there a fundamental reason why Softmax CLIP objective is better at caliberation than Sigmoid CLIP objective(https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.15343) ?

-  "Hence, we use the insight that the terms that contribute significantly to the denominator of the softmax score are the ones for which rφ(x, y) is sufficiently large. " -  It's unclear to me how using semantic-contrastive semantic prompts results in finding the terms that have high reward value?

- Can the authors instead of finding contrastive prompts, take random prompts and show an ablation?

### Summary
This paper proposed a text-image alignment benchmark and reward score normalization methods to evaluate and address the "overoptimization" issue when finetuning with a reward model. The proposed benchmark contains 550 prompts covering comprehensive/counting/compostion categories and 27500 generated images. The normalization method consider normalizing text-image reward scores by contrasting to generated texts. The human evaluation and qualitative results showing the proposed method performs better on the "overoptimization" issue over other baselines.

### Strengths
- The paper is well-written and easy to understand
- The proposed benchmark showing the drawbacks of different reward models
- The proposed text normalization method can reduce the overoptimization problem and improves the model finetuning performance

### Weaknesses
 - One major contribution is the proposed text-image alignment assessment benchmark. However, the role/completeness of the benchmark are not fully explored. For example: 1. Are the comprehensive/counting/composition enough to compare those reward models? 2. In figure 3 (a), we can see ImageReward > PickScore > CLIP > BLIP-2 in terms of "comprehensive". Are these reward model ranking align with human evaluation (Do human also thinks ImageReward > PickScore > CLIP > BLIP-2)?

 - Section 5.2. "select the top 10% of the samples as measured by the chosen reward model". Is that means the model finetuned with different reward models are finetuned with different data? Why not use the same data for finetuning?
- Any Failure cases for proposed text norm method? (failure cases for both comprehensive/counting/composition are helpful)

### Summary
This paper study the problem of reward functions on human feedback data for image diffusion models. It proposes a new text-image alignment assessment benchmark (TIA2) for evaluating the problem of reward designing. It shows that several existing reward-based models are not well-aligned with human assessment after evaluated on the benchmark. The authors propose a method TextNorm to induce confidence calibration in reward models. It shows the proposed score help reduce over-optimization in the human feedback tuning. Experiments are conducted with Stable Diffusion v2.1 and LoRA for parameter-efficient fine-tuning.

### Strengths
-	The proposes benchmark for evaluating text-image alignment can help the reward designing in human feedback data. It includes different categories of prompts: comprehensive, counting and composition, which are the key categories that common image reward functions such as CLIP and ImageReward cannot do well on.
-	The proposed TextNorm is novel and shows superior performance on improving calibration errors on different types of prompts. It also improves text-image alignment compared to existing reward functions according to some qualitative results and human evaluation.
-	An ablation study is also conducted to analyze the impact of different aspects: normalization over prompts, prompt synthesis, and the textual inconsistency score.

### Weaknesses
 - In the process of prompt synthesis using language model, the authors only ask the LLM to generate variations based on the object category and number of objects. Other important aspects such as spatial relationships and object attributes like material, color, size is not included. This greatly limit the scope of the experiment in this work. The synthesized prompts should cover a wider range of variations to comprehensively evaluate the text-image alignment. For example, in addition to varying object categories and numbers, the model should be prompted to generate variations in spatial relationships (e.g., "above," "below," "to the left of"), object attributes (e.g., "metallic," "wooden," "red," "large"), and potentially even stylistic variations (e.g., "photorealistic," "impressionistic"). I also only saw sampled result images related to object category and object number in this paper. It would be great if more analysis on those other aspects can be studied as well.
- In figure 5, the difference of TextNorm and existing methods are not significant. BLIP2 has very similar results as the TextNorm on the correctness of the object number and categories. While the paper presents TextNorm as an improvement, the quantitative results in Figure 5 do not strongly support this claim. A more detailed analysis of the specific cases where TextNorm outperforms BLIP2, and a quantification of the improvement, would be beneficial. For instance, the authors could provide a breakdown of the types of prompts where TextNorm shows the most significant gains, and discuss the statistical significance of these improvements.

### Questions
In the human evaluation, the authors are comparing with “the best-performing baseline reward model” but did not mention which one it is. Please provide the details on which reward function you are comparing with.
