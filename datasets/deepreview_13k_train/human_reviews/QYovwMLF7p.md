# ProFITi: Probabilistic Forecasting of Irregular Time Series via Conditional Flows

- Decision: Reject
- Scores: 6, 5, 6, 6

## Abstract
{Probabilistic forecasting of irregularly sampled multivariate time series with missing values
		is an important problem in many fields, including health care, astronomy, and climate.
		State-of-the-art methods for the task estimate only marginal distributions of observations
		in single channels and at single timepoints,
		assuming a fixed-shape parametric distribution.
		In this work, we propose a novel model, ProFITi, for
		probabilistic forecasting of irregularly sampled time series with missing values 	
		using conditional normalizing flows,
		The model learns \textbf{joint} distributions over the future values of the time series
		conditioned on past observations and queried channels and times, without assuming 
		any fixed shape of the underlying distribution.
		As model components, we introduce a novel invertible triangular attention layer
		and an invertible non-linear activation function on and onto the whole real line.
		We conduct extensive experiments on four datasets
		and demonstrate that the proposed model provides $4$ times higher likelihood over the previously best model.}

### Confidence
3: You are fairly confident in your assessment. It is possible that you did not understand some parts of the submission or that you are unfamiliar with some pieces of related work. Math/other details were not carefully checked.

### Summary
The paper studies the problem of probabilistic forecasting of time series with irregular samples and missing values. Authors propose a new architecture based on conditional normalizing flows that can handle both, irregularity and missing values, and learns a joint distribution of the forecast targets. The proposed approach relies on the new invertible self-attention layer and a new activation function. The authors benchmark their method on 3 real-world datasets and showcase superior performance in terms of log-likelihood.

### Strengths
## Originality 
To my best knowledge, the invertible self-attention layer and the activation functions are new
## Quality 
* The presented approach can be learnt end-to-end without additional steps like solving ODE
* Experiments use a wide set of baselines
* Ablation study is performed
## Clarity 
Authors do a good job motivating and explaining their design choices, but overall exposition is still pretty convoluted
## Significance
Experimental results show a significant improvement in log likelihood. New attention layer can be potentially used in other algorithms with normalizing flows, so the work can potentially have wide impact.

### Weaknesses
 * My main concern is that it seems like most improvement comes from using GraFITi embeddings, which are not used by the baselines. 
* Evaluation covers only three datasets from very similar domain
* The modelling limitations of the method are not clear. What kind of distributions can be modelled with the proposed flows?

### Questions
* Please adjust the abstract in line with ICLR formatting instructions
* It would be beneficial to study what kind of distributions can be modelled with the proposed flows.
* I wonder whether other methods would fare better if computed on the same GraFITi embeddings. Can you add a combination of other baselines with GraFITi and another option in the ablation study that doesn’t use it?

### Summary
The paper focuses on probabilistic forecasting of irregularly sampled multivariate time series with missing values. The authors propose to use conditional continuous normalizing flow to construct the distribution instead of making an assumption on the target distribution as done in the literature. Moreover, they provide a novel invertible equivariant transformation, and a novel non-linear, invertible, differentiable activation function, which can be used in normalizing flows. Finally, they conduct extensive experiments on three real-world IMTS datasets and show that the proposed model (PROFITI) outperforms baselines in terms of normalized joint negative log-likelihood.

### Strengths
The exploration of predicting changes in the joint distribution of time series is an important and valuable problem, which is crucial for downstream tasks in various domains. While previous literature has predominantly focused on regular time series, the paper's contribution in addressing the prediction of joint distributions in irregular time series is commendable. Moreover,  the paper showcases a significant amount of effort and extensive work. The authors present compelling evidence of the effectiveness of their proposed method. The results indicate that the approach performs well in predicting the joint distribution.

### Weaknesses
1. The requirement of permutation invariance, as proposed by the authors, is questionable in time series analysis and may not be suitable for this domain. The authors argue that a density model should produce equivalent density values when the outputs are swapped, which is a reasonable expectation in the context of static generative models. However, in the time series setting, where the joint distribution of variables $y_1,...,y_K$ occurring at different time steps is considered, the presence of serial dependencies becomes crucial. Unfortunately, the permutation invariant requirement, which treats the order of data points as interchangeable, risks disrupting these vital temporal dependencies. In contrast, if the objective is to forecast the joint distribution of variables occurring at the same time step, the permutation invariant requirement might be deemed necessary. Specifically, the permutation invariance across time points seems particularly problematic. For example, if we aim to model the joint distribution of $y_1^1$, $y_1^2$, $y_2^1$, and $y_3^2$ (where superscripts denote channels and subscripts denote time), permutation invariance would imply that the model treats the joint distribution $p(y_1^1, y_1^2, y_2^1, y_3^2)$ the same as $p(y_2^1, y_3^2, y_1^1, y_1^2)$. This is problematic because it disregards the temporal ordering inherent in time series data. While permutation invariance across channels might be reasonable, its application across time points is not well-justified and could hinder the model's ability to capture temporal dependencies.

2. The rationale behind utilizing self-attention as the vector field in the proposed work is not clear. It seems redundant to introduce self-attention into the vector field, given that neural networks inherently possess permutation invariance properties with respect to the input. Therefore, a more explicit justification is needed to understand the motivation behind incorporating self-attention in this context. Moreover, it is worth noting that existing literature, such as [1], has already proposed the use of conditional normalizing flow models for forecasting the joint distribution of time series. Therefore, it is crucial to highlight the distinctions between the proposed work and the existing literature that necessitate the use of self-attention and the introduction of a more complex invertible self-attention mechanism.

### Questions
1. In the paragraph “Invariant conditional normalizing flows,” the authors claim that x is the predictor, which can be grouped into K elements and common elements. The statement confuses me. It is not clear why x contains common elements. Could the authors provide a concrete example of the general setting and explain the statement in the paragraph? 

2. What is the meaning of the L.H.S. in Eqn. (4)? There is a superscript $\pi^{-1}$ on the L.H.S. in Eqn. (4), what does it mean?

3. The choice of $\epsilon$ in Eqn. (6) should affect the training results. Should it be determined before training? Or should it be termed as a hyperparameter during training? Should there be an investigation about the choice of $\epsilon$?

4. Why use the GraFITi model to encode the historical data? Compared to the prevalent model used to model irregular time series, such as GRU-ODE-Bayes [2] or  Neural CDE [3], what is the advantage of GraFITi?

5. Most literature use CRPS and CRPS_sum to evaluate the performance, e.g., [1, 4-6]. Why authors do not follow the literature?

### Summary
The work proposes a probabilistic forecasting for irregular time series using conditional normalizing flows.

### Strengths
The probabilistic forecasting of irregular timeseries is an important problem and the use of normalizing flow for this scope is interesting.

Introduction of a new activation function having the characteristics useful for the normalizing flows.

### Weaknesses
In my opinion could be interesting to assess the behavior of the proposed model in several conditions in terms of percentage of missing values, sparsity of the time steps. In fact the irregular time series are very important and to give researcher an evaluation of these aspects could help to understand the quality/limitations of the proposed work.

The authors use likelihood to assess the quality of the forecast also for marginal and point forecast. In that case I think could be useful to have other metrics as RMSE, MAPE or other that is more related to the prediction error.

The computational effort of proposed solution is not provided and is not compared to other possible solutions. Some results are provided in appendix but only for a particular dataset.

§3 - IMTS Query section, in the definition of QA(C), what is the meaning of $|x^{qu}|=|y|$? After, when you talk about NJNL, looks like $|.|$ means lenght of, but authors should describe clearlry the symbols they use.

In the IMTS probabilistic forecasting problem
"(with $min_k t_{n,k}^{qu} > max_i t_{n,i}^{obs}$)" --> the reader is lead to think that $t_{n,k}^{qu}$ is the k-th observation of the n-th query and the same for $t_{n,i}^{obs}$ but a clarification would be better.

What is the meaning of $\pi^{-1}$ in equation 4?

In eq. 7 $X_{:,1:|X|-1}$ is the matrix X except the last column?
In eq. 7 $X_{:,|X|}$ is the last column of matrix X ?

In the protocol authors said that they use the first 36 hours of observations and forecast next 3 time steps. These time step is, looking at Appendix A, 1 hour for Physionet, 30minute for MIMIC-III, 1 minute for MIMIC-IV. Is this right? 
Moreover, is there a way to indicate the time sparsity of considered timeseries in oder to understand how the timeseries considered are not uniformly spaced? 

The section 6 and figure 3 should be improved in order to make clearer the architecture.
In equation 11 the $x_k$ is the $h$ of figure 3?
What is the meaning of S in fig. 3?

In Fig. 9 the Grafiti+ returns only a region an not the trajectories? Is it possible to compare the confidence regions of ProFITi and GraFITi+?

### Summary
Authors posit a new normalizing flow model for time series forecasting. They introduce two key components, the Shiesh activation function and SITA.

Edit: After reading author responses and reviewer comments, I have decided to maintain my score.

### Strengths
Shiesh seems to have good performance for normalizing flow models. I wonder if the authors have done experimentation with regards to the activation function in particular for other normalizing flow models?

The ablation studies conducted are quite thorough with respect to each of the components, and authors offer solid error bars for each of the results.

Proposed Shiesh activation function and SITA are both well formulated and grounded. These should also be able to be extended to alternative flow models.

### Weaknesses
Figure 1: I'm not sure what this is trying to illustrate, since you're comparing a target bimodal distribution against two other linear gaussian models, and doesn't do much to highlight the novelty of ProFITi.

Experiments seem to only consist of ECG based dataset, which is heavily periodic and consists of similar patterns. Would be interesting to see other datasets here.

Minor typo: "Both, Leaky" doesn't need a comma.

### Questions
What activation function is used in ProFITi-Shiesh?
Authors also mention Leaky ReLU but do not note where it is.
