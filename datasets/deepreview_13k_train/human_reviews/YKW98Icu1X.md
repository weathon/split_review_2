## Abstract
Learning and skill mastery requires extensive and deliberate practice. In many learning settings, producing high-quality pedagogical materials can require a high level of domain expertise and be very time-consuming. Pedagogical materials often need to train students to engage in different thinking patterns. In some domains, such as chess, puzzles are used to help students practice their skills in calculating the next moves and recognizing known patterns on a board. Giving students a practice set of puzzles to help them learn different modes of thinking is challenging because the teacher needs to carefully balance between different motifs and how many look-ahead steps a student needs to perform. Popular online platforms like Chess.com and Lichess offer players millions of puzzles. Unlike chess tactics puzzles procured by human experts, where chess beginners can learn valuable insights, these puzzles are automatically generated and often regarded as having low pedagogical values. These platforms also rely on a heuristic to recommend puzzles to users for practice.
Using the user history data over an entire year, a total of 1.6 billion puzzle-solving histories, we learn the pedagogical value of a puzzle and how to automatically choose a set of puzzles to better support chess learners in a completely unstructured way using insights from offline reinforcement learning. We validate the quality of the puzzles discovered by our model by collecting annotation ratings from titled chess players. The success of our pipeline shows promise for a future where we can understand the pedagogical values of practice items in other domains like math or coding problems.

### Summary
The authors look to use RL to recommend chess puzzles from a fixed set, with the RL objective being that the player gets the puzzle correct and that it has a high Elo. They also add some human annotations and do something with LLMs to reproduce them.

### Strengths
The RL algorithm implemented in the paper is novel (at least in the chess space) and the puzzle evaluations by experts is a new dataset.

# originality

Moderate, the RL approach appears to be new, but the underlying optimization is the same as what chess.com is already doing with their expanding Elo bands (described in line 098). The short and incomplete related works section means I may be overestimating the originality though.

# quality

Moderate, the writing is mostly OK, but there are a few weird or difficult to follow sections. I'm also not clear what the LLM section contributes to this.

# clarity

This is similarly limited by the writing style. The results were difficult to understand as there is no real baseline to compare to, so I don't know if the numbers (and thus the main results) are meaningful. I suggest using the chess.com "algorithm" as a baseline.

I also found the scatter plots difficult to read as they look to be trying to show density, where an actual density plot would be preferable.

# significance

low, the RL objective function is the key to the entire paper is not new so while the RL design might be it's not a major result.

### Weaknesses
I find this paper unconvincing, they don't compare to a reasonable baseline or previous works so evaluating the numbers directly is impossible, the LLMs section seems tacked on, and they don't run user studies despite claiming to "automatically choose a set of puzzles to better support chess learners".

The value function they propose also doesn't seem to optimize for what they are looking for (learning), it just optimizes for success on higher Elo puzzles. If the authors could explain how this leads to learning that would greatly improve my valuation of the paper.

I'm also concerned by the lack of code release. The authors promise they will release the code but not the models or data. What part of the data are "proprietary owned"? There are other papers published on the chess.com puzzles dataset[1] so I'm not clear what is the limiting factor.

### Questions
+ Figure 1b is not very clear, consider a density plot, giving a regression, or even using an alpha lower than 1 for the points.
+ ELO is not a thing, I believe you mean Elo, although which one is never specified
+ There is previous work out of ICLR last year looking at a related problem[1]
+ "Anecdotally, LLMs seem .." there are research papers on LLMs to play chess [2] why was reddit used instead?

### Summary
The paper considers the design and selection of chess puzzles using a reinforcement learning framework that evaluates puzzles in terms of their contribution to a players' learning and improvement. The paper provides strategies for selecting chess puzzles and evaluates them using techniques including expert annotation.

### Strengths
An important aspect of both human and machine interaction with chess as a domain is the design and solving of chess puzzles; they are believed to be an important mechanism for improvement at chess. Given this motivation in terms of improvement, the paper's strategy to explicitly represent this objective within a reinforcement learning framework is very sensible, and it leads to interesting algorithmic insights. The evaluation framework used by the paper provides additional insights into the power of the method.

### Weaknesses
The paper would benefit from making a clearer connection between (a) the technical details of the framework being developed and (b) the high-level motivation for selecting puzzles. I would summarize the high-level motivation (b) as roughly saying: certain puzzles will be more valuable than others in helping a player improve; this choice of the "right" puzzle is both player-specific (the best puzzle for one player won't necessarily be the best puzzle for another) and time-specific (the best puzzle for you now won't necessarily be the best puzzle for you later after you've solved some number of puzzles and also (hopefully) improved).

With this distinction in mind:

- It's not clear exactly how these high-level criteria are informing the choice of objective function and algorithm in the technical method itself; the paper would benefit by drawing this connection more explicitly, including more high-level discussion to connect them.

- It's also not clear whether the annotations the experts are asked to provide are the best way to formalize the high-level goals of puzzle selection into a set of annotation instructions. It would be useful ti explain why these particular annotation instructions were chosen. 

- Finally, it would help to have some discussion of the causal inference considerations that implicitly underpin the work. In particular, as the authors understand, the fact that the puzzles solved by a rapidly improving chess player are different than the puzzles solved by a stagnating chess player could arise for two very different reasons: (a) because the well-chosen puzzles for the first player are causing them to improve more rapidly, or (b) because a player who naturally has more aptitude or motivation for chess will seek out and solve puzzles more effectively. In (a) the direction of causality works as the paper implicitly suggests -- that by choosing better puzzles we can help them improve -- whereas in (b) the direction of causality works differently -- it simply establishes that people who have more aptitude or motivation for chess will also do better at solving puzzles. Given how central this causal point is to the premise of the paper, there should be more discussion of it, and how it informs the approach.

### Summary
The authors propose a method for automatically generating chess puzzles for learners using a year of user history data and 1.6 billion puzzle-solving histories. They frame this discovery as an offline RL problem, using the ability of a user to solve the puzzle as a reward function and validate a small subset of their data with expert human annotators. They then extrapolate this to the entire pipeline as a whole using the human annotation to direct an LLM.

### Strengths
The method the authors used to overcome the exponentially large action space of potential puzzle recommendations is clever and seemingly sound. The question of recommending bite-sized assignments to learners that are appropriate for their mastery of the material is relevant not just to the domain of chess but also to education as a whole.

### Weaknesses
Two key major weaknesses of the paper are in the founding assumption and how the effectiveness of the pipeline is evaluated.

1.) The authors propose using whether or not a solver was able to complete the puzzle as a metric for if the puzzle was of an appropriate difficulty for them. However, this feels like an excessive simplification. While it is mitigated by the availability of the difficulty metric (ELO) in respect to the puzzle, it does not seem sound to claim a puzzle was not an appropriate difficulty merely because it was not completed. Steps until completion, time to completion and other fine-grained details may allow for a deeper insight to whether the puzzle was of an appropriate difficulty for the learner. Even this does not guarantee the 'effective long-term increase in knowledge or skill.' mentioned as a heuristic by the authors in lines 61-63.

2.) I am also somewhat skeptical of the ability of LLMs to evaluate the effectiveness of the puzzle, even with the annotation of the human experts to guide them. The results from the training are not in the main paper, and I feel without proof of the effectiveness of the LLMs as judges in this context, the results detailed in the experiments section cannot be adequately judged.  

The citing of a reddit thread and blog when there are a number of published works on LLMs and chess feels like the authors did not do a sufficient background study prior to submitting the work.

### Questions
1.) How were the categories in Figure 4 picked?

2.) Re 1 in the weaknesses above, can the authors give more justification as to why they chose the specific reward function they did?

3.) From the data, is there a distinct correlation between puzzles done and-or ability to complete puzzles and an increase in a player's ELO?

4.) Re 2 in the weaknesses above, can the authors show the validity of the LLM-judge approach they used? 30 seems too small a number to instill large confidence in the LLMs unless they were able to match the expert annotators numbers exactly, especially given the potential range and variance in chess positions. 

4.1.) How much standard deviation was there in the expert annotators' work? Could the authors provide an analysis on the judgement of the annotators and where the points of major agreement or disagreement were?

### Summary
The paper presents an offline reinforcement learning system for recommending chess puzzles to facilitate user learning. A causal transformer model is trained on user and puzzle embeddings to predict the next puzzle for the user to play. Experiments show the model is better able to give users puzzles that are appropriate to their skill level than the existing policy implementation. This advantage is particularly large for users at low skill levels, who are the bulk of the population and most sensitive to quitting due to failure.

An additional analysis trains a model to replicate expert annotations of puzzles of various subjective criteria. The model predictions on recommended puzzles show no statistically significant differences when comparing the existing and proposed new model, though results suggest there may be differences in favor of the new model.

### Strengths
# originality
Modest.

Recommending content based on policies trained offline is not a technical novelty. There are some details specific to the case that are novel and the chess application is new. 

# quality
Modest.

The evaluation of the behavior recommendations shows strong results and is done with a reasonable amount of rigor.

The evaluation by judge ratings is still very preliminary due to limited sample sizes and no clear integration with the rest of the system.

# clarity
Modest.

The paper provides substantial technical detail on the training process. This is strong and facilitates reproduction.

The questions below address specific areas where things were less clear.


# significance
Modest.

The paper will be of interest to applied research in various educational domains (programming, STEM, and so on), and more indirectly of interest to work in offline RL for recommender systems. The ideas can readily be translated to those applications and the scaling efforts would be useful.

### Weaknesses
The LLM judging is the biggest weakness for the paper. The results are still preliminary with 200 samples that show no significant differences to the behavior policy (Tables 2 & 3). This makes the content dedicated to this system weakly supported, harming the paper overall. In general the judge proxy model seems better suited to a follow on paper. The space that gets freed up could be devoted to more detailed analyses of the learned policies and more detailed differences in their behaviors. This could also be used to develop a model or metric to predict learning outcomes (ELO changes) based on puzzles a (simulated) user encounters (see below).

# quality
What is the evidence that the reward function will accurately capture ELO changes in real players? The evaluation of the new policy hinges on the assumption this is a direct translation. With any offline study it is important to establish how strong the counter-factual could credibly be. I recognize this is difficult, but without evidence on this point it is hard to gauge how much increases in returns (Table 1) translate into improved learning. Are there canonical metrics in previous work to compare with?

Line 471: What test was used to establish statistical significance? What values were obtained for that test?

# clarity
See below for detailed notes.

### Questions
Lines 285-287: Section 4.3 states is it prohibitive to compute the probability normalization across all action embeddings, but in section 4.4 this quantity is computed. Why use this workaround given the embeddings were already computed? Is there some other cost I'm missing?

To what degree does the in-batch negative sample bias the results?
This could be evaluated using a subset of the total data where the true normalization and sample normalization values could be used and the outcomes compared. Knowing how much this method biases the results of the model would be valuable.

Figure 2: Should the yellow and red sets of user and puzzle embeddings both be from $t+1$? I would have expected red to be $t+2$.

Table 1: What is the bold in the table?

Line 481: Does "smallest ELO" here mean "lowest ELO"? This was unclear if it meant "smallest" as in fewest players.
When looking at ELO 100-600 the stagnant group has a mean of 52.9, while growth is 58.8. This does not match the statement that $\pi_{\theta}$ performs better relatively on stagnant group users. Or is relatively meant by the gain relative to $\pi_{\beta}$? That also seems to favor the growth group (gains of 38.6 vs 41.1).

Line 485: Were the 200 users selected across all ELO ratings? How well-balanced was the sample?
This test would benefit from ensuring a balanced sample across buckets. Or only performing it in one or a few buckets separately. Given the importance of low ELO players to the implementation it would be reasonable to examine only the lowest ELO bucket. This might help reduce variance to get more statistically rigorous results.

Tables 2 & 3: These two tables could be combined and pivoted (meaning show the method as columns and the metrics as rows).

Minor typo that spellcheck would miss:
- Line 257: "casual transformer" -> "causal transformer"
