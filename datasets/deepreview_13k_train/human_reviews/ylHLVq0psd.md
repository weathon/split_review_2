## Abstract
In this work, we undertake both theoretical and empirical analysis of noise scheduling strategies within the scope of denoising diffusion generative models. We investigate the training noise schedule through the lens of power spectrum and introduce a novel metric, weighted signal-noise-ratio (WSNR), to uniformly represent the noise level in both RGB and latent spaces, enhancing the performance of high-resolution models in these spaces with WSNR-Equivalent training noise schedules. Further, we examine the reverse sampling process using the framework of Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs), elucidating the concept of the optimal denoiser and providing insights into data-driven sampling noise schedules. We explore the correlation between the number of evaluation points and the generation quality to optimize the acceleration of the ODE solver in the diffusion model. Based on practical considerations of evaluation point effects, we propose an adaptive scheme to choose numerical methods within computational constraints, balancing efficacy and efficiency. Our approach, requiring no additional training, refines the FID of pre-trained CIFAR-10 and FFHQ-64 models from 1.92 and 2.45 to 1.89 and 2.25, respectively, utilizing 35 network evaluations per image.

### Summary
This paper investigates the training noise schedule of diffusion models from the perspective of the spectrum. It introduces the weighted signal-noise ratio (WSNR) to better represent the noise level of latent variables of diffusion models. This paper also proposes an adaptive sampling scheme that better balances efficacy and efficiency.

### Strengths
1. The proposed WSNR can better measure the noise level of diffusion latent variables across various resolutions. Models trained with a WSNR-oriented schedule can generalize better to more resolutions.

2. The proposed adaptive sampling strategy better balances the efficacy and efficiency of diffusion models. It improves the performance of diffusion models without additional training.

### Weaknesses
1. The proposed WSNR-Equivalent training noise schedule and data-driven sampling noise schedule seem to be independent of each other， which weakns the focus of this paper.

2. Experiments in Table 1 and Table 2 compare with only EDM training noise schedule. The authors are suggested to compare with more training noise schedules to further verify the effectiveness of training noise schedule.

### Summary
This research study identifies substantial disparities  in noise levels across images of different resolutions, 
significantly affecting the performance of the diffusion model. The manuscript then investigates the training of 
diffusion models using a weighted signal-to-noise-ratio (WSNR) metric. This metric does not depend on the image 
resolution. WSNR is shown to be a better metric to quantize the noise level in the forward diffusion process.
The manuscript provides the analysis of the diffusion model from the point of view of the ordinary differential equations
probability flows in Section 5

### Strengths
- The manuscript propose a weighted signal-to-noise-ration (WSNR) metric for training diffusion models which does not depend on the image  resolution.
- WSNR is shown to be a better metric to quantize the noise level in the forward diffusion process.
- Experimental results show that WSNR represents a valid metric to illustrate noise levels in the latent space.

### Weaknesses
-


### Questions
- How would the metric depend on the local properties of the image, such as the presence of flat regions or textures?
For example in Figure 2 the noise is evident in the background but it is masked in the region of the main object which is highly textured.

### Summary
This paper provides a theoretical and empirical analysis of the noise schedule strategy in denoising diffusion generative models. The authors investigate training noise schedules from the perspective of power spectra and introduce a new metric called Weighted Signal-to-Noise Ratio (WSNR) to uniformly represent noise levels in both RGB space and latent space, improving the performance of high-resolution models. They also explore the inverse sampling process using the framework of Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs), revealing the concept of optimal denoisers and providing insights into data-driven sampling noise schedules. Additionally, they explore the correlation between the number of evaluation points and the quality of generated samples, and propose optimizations for accelerating ODE solvers. The proposed method improves the FID of CIFAR-10 and FFHQ-64 models without requiring additional training.

### Strengths
- The authors propose a novel metric, weighted signal-noise-ratio (WSNR), to quantify the noise level in both RGB and latent spaces.
  - WSNR is an intuitive metric. Figure 2 helps to understand the motivation.
- They explore the correlation between the number of evaluation points and the generation quality, and propose a strategy to dynamically select numerical methods for better generation quality.
- They achieve improved performance in high-resolution RGB and latent spaces without additional training.
- They contribute to the field by quantifying the noise level of the forward process of the diffusion model and extending it to the latent space.
- They present empirical results on CIFAR-10, FFHQ-64, ImageNet-64, and FFHQ-256 datasets, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed methods.
- They discuss the probability of the synthesized data and the importance of a broad variety in generated samples.
- They introduce a data-driven sampling noise schedule to ensure the diversity of generated data.
- They identify the trade-off between the quality of generated data and the number of neural function evaluations (NFE) and proposes an appropriate value for the integration range.

### Weaknesses
 - The motivation or justification for rethinking the noise schedule of diffusion-based generative models is not clearly explained in the introduction.
  - I could not understand how Figure 1 is related to the main motivation of the paper. Figure 2 was more intuitive.
- From Eq. (1), it seems to implicitly assume the variance exploding (VE) case, but it is not clear what happens in the variance preserving (VP) case.
- Overall, writing should be improved. In the current form, motivation is not clearly explained in the introduction, and it is not until Figure 2 in Section 4 that the motivation is understood.

### Questions
As I described in the weakness section, Eq. (1) seems to implicitly assume the VE case, but how abound the VP case?

### Strengths
1. This paper views the noise scheduling problem from the perspective of power spectra of various frequency components and discover that the average power spectra of isotropic Gaussian noise are consistent across all components.

2. The proposed metric, WSNR, quantifies the noise level of the training data in both the RGB space and latent space.

3. It empirically explores the relationship between the number of evaluation points and the generation quality.

### Weaknesses
1. The noise scheduling is discussed in previous works from different perspectives. The concurrent work [1] also discusses the noise schedule from the spectra view. The authors are encouraged to discuss the differences.

2. This paper aims to solve the terrible performance of existing noise scheduling in high resolutions. But the experiments are all conducted on small resolutions, with the highest resolutions being 256x256.  Experiments with a higher resolution are highly recommended.

### Summary
In this paper, the authors investigate the training/sampling noise schedule through the lens of power spectrum and introduce the weighted signal-noise ratio (WSNR). The authors show that adjusting the noise schedule according to WSNR is able to improve the performance of high-resolution image generation and ODE-based sampling.

### Strengths
1) Although the importance of noise schedule has been studied in previous papers, most of previous methods adjusting the schedule intuitively. The authors proposed a numerical metric and validated the effectiveness of the proposed metric.
2) The motivation of this paper is clear and the organization and presentation of this paper is good.
3) The experimental results validated the advantage of adjusting noise schedule for high-resolution image generation and ODE-based sampling.

### Weaknesses
1) The authors proposed the WSNR metric and adjusting the noise schedule of high-resolution image generation to align the WSNR schedule with low-resolution image, although the authors show that such adjustment is beneficial for high-resolution image generation, a more important question is whether the proposed metric could shed light on optimal schedule for image generation. Since the schedule for 64\times 64 image generation is also intuitively setted, why should we align the schedule of high-resolution image generation to 64 \times 64? The choice of 64x64 as an anchor point seems arbitrary. It's unclear if this is truly an optimal schedule or just a convenient starting point. The paper lacks a clear justification for why aligning to this specific resolution is theoretically sound, rather than just empirically beneficial.
2) The idea of data-driven ODE noise schedule is interesting, and the authors show that the proposed method is able to improve the sampling quality. Is the newly proposed sampling strategy highly related to the WSNR metric, can we adjust the sampling schedule based on other metrics such as PSNR? The improvement is mainly due to the data-driven framework or the newly proposed metric. It is not clear if the WSNR metric is the sole driver of the performance gains, or if the data-driven approach is the primary factor. The paper needs to disentangle these effects to provide a more complete understanding of the method's efficacy. Furthermore, the paper does not explore the limitations of the WSNR metric, or if other metrics could be more suitable for certain tasks.
