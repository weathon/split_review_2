# Twinned Interventional Flows

- Decision: Reject
- Scores: 6, 3, 3

## Abstract
Real-world problems in continuously evolving settings, such as predicting the efficacy of medical treatment, often require estimating the causal effects of interventions. Issues such as irregularly-sampled and missing data, unobserved factors, and ethical concerns make such settings especially challenging. The existing methodology relies on low-dimensional embeddings, potentially incurring information loss.  

We circumvent this limitation with a novel approach ``twinning" that augments the partial observations with additional latent variables and appeals to conditional continuous normalizing flows to model the system dynamics, obtaining accurate density estimates. We also introduce a new approach to overcome a key technical challenge, namely, mitigating stiffness of the underlying neural ODE. The model provably benefits from auxiliary non-interventional data during training. We showcase the flexibility of the proposed method with tasks like anomaly detection and counterfactual prediction, and benchmark on standard reinforcement learning (Half-Cheetah) and treatment effect prediction (tumor growth) contexts.

### Summary
This paper proposes a novel approach called Twinned Interventional Flows for estimating causal effects of interventions in continuously evolving systems, based on a modified conditional normalized flow model. The authors introduce the concept of "twinning" and use conditional continuous normalizing flows to model system dynamics, obtaining accurate density estimates. The proposed method is flexible and can be applied to various tasks, especially for counterfactual prediction while combining both experimental and observational data. The paper also presents theoretical and empirical results demonstrating the efficacy of the proposed framework.

### Strengths
- (Originality & Quality) This paper presents an interesting and novel concept, "twinning", which augments partial observations with additional latent variables including confounders as a state and treats interventions as actions in a POMDP setting.
    - The proposed approach is based on a modified conditional normalized flow (CNF) model with bijective mapping that incorporates the twinning of observation and unobserved latent representation. This naturally can be extended to address counterfactual inference problem.
    - This approach seems pretty versatile. Apart from addressing counterfactual inference, it also generalizes to data with missingness or irregular sampling.
    - The paper presents a solid theoretical analysis on the property of the proposed approach. This further justifies the technical soundness.

- (Significance & Potential Impact) Since the focus of this work is to generalize the conventional CNF model to the counterfactual inference setting where experimental and observational data can be use in conjunction. This work can be used in many continuous causal inference problems. The versatility in its design can potentially contribute to a broad impact.

### Weaknesses
 - (Presentation & Clarity) Despite the technical soundness, the paper seems difficult to follow, in lack of intuitive illustration of both newly introduced concepts or adopted approaches & notations. This makes it hard for readers to follow the logical reasoning and motivation for each specific modeling proposal.
    - The method section mainly focuses on "what" -- what was designed in the proposed approach, however without enough high-level intuitive illustration of "why". Similarly, in experiment section, the purpose, tasks and characteristics of the chosen dataset were not clearly presented, which makes it difficult to understand the motivation and analysis along without checking the external references.
    - The above could be partially due to limited space. But i believe the presentation can be improved.

- (Complexity and Limitation in Scaling) Bounded by the invertibility design, the proposed normalized flow based model TIF does not abstract input data into lower-dimensional latent space with encoder. All transformation/mapping happens in the same dimensions. This would limit generalizing the model to complex data with high dimensionality (e.g, clinical data, EHR, images). Due to the high time complexity of matrix inversion (in general O(n^3)), the computation cost would be significantly heavy for either large sample size or high data dimensionality.

### Questions
- What's the overall time complexity of TIF?

### Summary
The paper introduces a new time-varying generative model based on conditional continuous normalizing flows, namely, twinned interventional flows (TIF). TIF operates under the assumption of a partially observed Markov decision process (POMDP) with continuous time, can be fit with both observational and interventional data, and can handle irregular and missing data. The model promises to perform predictions in the presence of unobserved confounding, to detect anomalies, to do counterfactual inference, and to facilitate reinforcement learning and treatment effect prediction. To verify the claimed properties of the model, the authors provided experiments with different benchmarks.

### Strengths
The paper develops a new flexible generative model for continuous-time irregularly-sampled data. It has many potential applications, as it offers a tractable log-probability at each time step and does not suffer from the limitations of fixed-dimensional embeddings. The paper also provides several important theoretical results, like the marginalisation of the infinitesimal change of variables theorem (3.1).

### Weaknesses
The main weakness of the paper, in my opinion, is that TIF aim at many different applications, but the lack of rigour and experimental evidence makes it unclear what this method is actually useful for.

**Lack of rigour**. The paper positions itself as both a reinforcement learning and a (causal) time-varying treatment effect estimation method but makes little effort to explain the connections between both. It inherits the assumptions, typical for reinforcement learning, i.e., POMDP, but uses it for causal benchmarks, like interventional or counterfactual predictions. For example, benchmarks for interventional predictions (like the tumor generator) are based on a different set of assumptions, e.g., three assumptions from Seedat et al. (2022), and, thus, are not suitable for TIF. Specifically, the assumption of sequential randomization in continuous time, which is crucial for identifiability in the TE-CDE framework, is not explicitly addressed or justified within the TIF framework. Importantly, the straight application of the method to interventional and counterfactual prediction tasks raises many identifiability questions. For example, is there a need to adjust for time-varying observed confounders or to perform propensity weighting to obtain unbiased interventional predictions? Also, what is the purpose of the data with the hidden confounding (I understand, that it does not harm performance, given infinite data, but I don’t see how it could facilitate interventional predictions). Regarding counterfactual predictions, they would require even stronger identifiability assumptions [1], such as additive latent noise. Those assumptions are not properly discussed in the paper. The paper also claims to handle unobserved confounding, but in this case, without further assumptions, the causal effects are non-identifiable. The authors do not discuss how their method addresses the challenges of confounding in causal inference, such as time-varying confounders, which is a crucial aspect for any causal method.

**Lack of experimental evidence**. Some key statements in the paper were not supported by the experimental evidence, for example, the claim that TIF are better than methods with low-dimensional embeddings. Also, the authors claimed that the method provides accurate density estimates, but no comparison with other density estimators was provided. The same applies to the counterfactual benchmark, where no fair comparison with other existing baselines, e.g., [2], were provided, or anomaly detection benchmark. Regarding, the RL benchmark, it does not seem like TIF significantly outperformed VAE-RNN (see Fig. 6). Also, there are no implementation details provided for the benchmarks. Additionally, I found it unfair, that the authors did not provide details on the hyper-parameter tuning and did not provide the source code of the method. E.g., it is unclear, how to choose the latent dimensionality ($n - m$) or number of MC samples. For the same reason, I cannot verify, whether the comparison between TIF and TE-CDEs was fair for the interventional prediction benchmark.

I also have several minor remarks, which are important for clarity and understanding of the paper:
- Table 1 mixes up completely different methods, aka “compares apples with oranges”, e.g., causal inference methods with reinforcement learning methods; time-varying methods and cross-sectional methods, etc. Also, it is unclear, what property “making prediction in the presence of unobserved confounders” means, as in this case, we would need to assume some sensitivity model and perform partial identification of causal effects. Additionally, there seem to be wrong entries, like the cross for De Brouwer et al. (2022) at “logp” column (this paper assumes a likelihood model, thus we can infer log-probability), or Seedat et al. (2022) at “conf” (TE-CDEs are not suitable for hidden confounding).
- Some of the notation and definitions in the paper were not properly introduced. For example, a POMDP was never formally defined. Also, what is $\hat{Q}_{t_j, t}$ in Eq. 1? What is the definition of the “privileged data”? What are “sub-flows”?
- Some of the causal inference terminology is used inconsistently. For example, counterfactual prediction is sometimes used in the meaning of the interventional (Sec. 4.2), and “counterfactual trajectories” are used instead of “interventional trajectories” (Sec. 4.1 “Counterfactual prediction”). Notably, the terms “interventional” and “counterfactual” denote fundamentally different concepts of causal inference. 
- I found the usage of the terms “observational” and “interventional” data a bit confusing in this paper. Usually, the term “observational data” is used for the data, where treatment assignment depends on other observed $o$ and unobserved “l” confounders, whereas “interventional data” means a randomised control trial, i.e., no arrows leading to variables $a$ in Fig. 1. This paper, on the other hand, uses the term “observational” for the data with unobserved confounders and “interventional” for the data with all confounders observed.
- Seems like the authors confused the causal Markov condition and Markov property of POMDP, which are two different things.

### Questions
- What is exactly meant by the ability to perform “online prediction”?
- Why is the concatsquash block important for the architecture of TIF? Couldn’t it be done simpler?

### Summary
This paper proposes a new method called twinned interventional flows (TIFs) for modeling complex dynamical systems with irregularly sampled partially missing observations and actions (interventions). To achieve this they modify continuous normalizing flows to augment them with history of latent variables that bridge the gap of partial observability and causal insufficiency (presence of hidden confounders). As a result, the model can allow counterfactual queries. Additionally, they introduce a proof that shows that training with observational and interventional data can improve performance as compared to training only on interventional data.

### Strengths
## Originality
- The setting (learning to model temporal potential outcomes in continuous space with partially missing observations) seems under-explored.

## Significance
- This work seems to be introducing some benefits on the tested experiments.
- It suggests a novel penalty that improves in the stiff ODE case.
- The work solves an important problem (learning to model temporal potential outcomes in continuous space with partially missing observations)

### Weaknesses
Weaknesses
- It’s poorly written and lacks coherence. The introduction doesn’t motivate the problem sufficiently - what is the precise setting? This should be stated in the first paragraph and not scattered around two pages of introduction (leaving a feeling of lack of focus). For example paragraph three is motivating a setting but doesn’t explicitly express it and then paragraph four start talking about something different (stiff ODE) without ever defining it or commenting on the relevance of stiff ODEs with this setting. After reading the paper several times, still cannot understand why this specific setting suffers from stiff ODEs.
- The paper combines too many ideas and it doesn’t spend much time to explain and study each of the ideas properly. For example, the penalty for mitigating stiffness is not ablated sufficiently (stiff ODEs are not even defined on the paper which makes it very hard to read)
- Related work and background section is out of focus and missing key parts as well. For example, why is causal discovery discussed? How is causal inference relevant? Is it a causality paper, if so where is the background section introducing key concepts?
- The paper is appendix heavy. A lot of the content should have been surfaced in the main text. For example, assumptions C.{1,2,3} are essential and should be surfaced on the main. Significance of theoretical results should be discussed in main as well.

### Questions
- What are stiff ODEs and how are they related to this setting? is it a common problem in the setting you are studying? can you show visual examples in the main text? motivate and demonstrate the issue and then solve it, that way the reader can understand why things are happening.
- What is the setting precisely? Please write a sentence explaining it as simple as possible. This shouldn't be guessed by the reader.
- in paragraph 3, "which can be counterproductive" - it's not counterproductive only, it casts the problem non-identifiable. Can you please update the text?
- What are stiff regions? This is a technical term and needs definition before used.
- Unobserved confounders is an assumption and is not explicitly stated. Please put a list of the assumptions you are making (also this is known as causal sufficiency - i'd suggest to use terms known in the community if your audience is causality)
- In related work, missing discussion on POMDPs for continuous time (e.g. "POMDPs in Continuous Time and Discrete Spaces" or "Flow-based Recurrent Belief State Learning for POMDPs"), can you please add or discuss relevance?
- In related work, causal discovery discussion is unrelated, can you please discuss the relevance to your work or remove?
- Also, are you focusing mostly on learning from offline data? If so, would discussion of offline RL be of relevance here?
- In POMDP formulation you say that rewards are not required, however if you remove rewards from the POMDP then it's just a graphical model (Decision Process requires rewards). What does the POMDP formulation buy you?
- What is the "twinned space"?
- In 3.2 you stalk about the stability of Monte Carlo estimate. Where are you using MC?
- You cite Manski 1989, can you please comment on the relevance of this paper to you work? It doesn't seem to comment on the use of "observational data helping learning the dynamics of discrete interventional settings".
- Figure 6 - The plot doesn't match the performance of the baselines in the paper. Did you use the same code? Also, how many seeds did you run? Are you plotting the standard error? I don't see any variance on your method - is this because it's stable between seeds?
- What is the take-away message from the half cheetah example? How is this experiment related to your setting?
