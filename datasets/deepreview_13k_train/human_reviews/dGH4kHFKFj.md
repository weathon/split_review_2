## Abstract
This paper introduces GenCorres, a novel unsupervised joint shape matching (JSM) approach. Our key idea is to learn a mesh generator to fit an unorganized deformable shape collection while constraining deformations between adjacent synthetic shapes to preserve geometric structures such as local rigidity and local conformality. GenCorres presents three appealing advantages over existing JSM techniques. First, GenCorres performs JSM among a synthetic shape collection whose size is much bigger than the input shapes and fully leverages the data-driven power of JSM. Second, GenCorres unifies consistent shape matching and pairwise matching (i.e., by enforcing deformation priors between adjacent synthetic shapes). Third, the generator provides a concise encoding of consistent shape correspondences. However, learning a mesh generator from an unorganized shape collection is challenging, requiring a good initialization. GenCorres addresses this issue by learning an implicit generator from the input shapes, which provides intermediate shapes between two arbitrary shapes. We introduce a novel approach for computing correspondences between adjacent implicit surfaces, which we use to regularize the implicit generator. Synthetic shapes of the implicit generator then guide initial fittings (i.e., via template-based deformation) for learning the mesh generator. 
Experimental results show that GenCorres considerably outperforms state-of-the-art JSM techniques. The synthetic shapes of GenCorres also achieve salient performance gains against state-of-the-art deformable shape generators.

### Summary
This paper proposes a new algorithm for joint matching of a set of 3D shapes represented as polygon meshes or surface point clouds. The core idea is to learn a generative model for meshes, based on deformations of a base template, that can produce the input shapes and thereby infer correspondences between them. To achieve this in a robust and accurate way, the authors propose several innovations, including learning an initial implicit generator that informs the eventual mesh generator, and techniques to regularize the generator output by imposing distortion-minimizing/consistency-maximizing losses in epsilon-neighborhoods of the synthesized shape space (not just around the input landmarks).

### Strengths
I really like this paper. I think it addresses an important, general problem by bringing together a bunch of relevant ideas in a well-justified way: using generative models for discriminative problems, physically-inspired regularization, etc. The core insights are simple and compelling. The individual technical contributions are theoretically meaningful and elegant, well-presented, and show significant improvements over baselines in experiments. I particularly like the computation of optimal correspondence fields between similar implicit shapes in 4.1. And not being an expert in this precise area, I am impressed that this can be done both differentiably (is this where finite differences come in as mentioned in 4.4?) and fast (how long does the training take?)

I am provisionally recommending acceptance and am open to revising my opinion further upwards (if the authors can address the critiques in Weaknesses) or downwards (if other reviewers find serious flaws).

### Weaknesses
This is a fairly complex system. I am not 100% certain that every design decision is fully justified since there are too many possible ablations (though the authors do study several obvious ones). In particular, the authors claim that the implicit approach is necessary since learning a mesh generator from scratch is too difficult and error-prone. While this may be true, it is not actually demonstrated within the ambit of the proposed pipeline. There is the 3D-CODED comparison, but that is an entirely different pipeline. I do understand that this would be an "ablation" that's at least half a research project by itself, but still... Maybe the authors have already done experiments to verify this which are not included in the paper?

Also, code (and preprocessed data) would be really helpful so that others can understand and verify the claimed contributions. Will it be released?

A couple of relevant papers may be worth mentioning since they are in the overall spirit of this paper:

Muralikrishnan et al., "GLASS: Geometric Latent Augmentation for Shape Spaces", CVPR 2022
(learning generative models from sparse landmarks guided by ARAP regularization -- does require input with correspondences though so it's sort of complementary to this paper)

Bednarik et al., "Temporally-Coherent Surface Reconstruction via Metric-Consistent Atlases", ICCV 2021
(using metric distortion energies for consistent reconstruction, and hence joint matching, of time-varying shape sequences)

### Summary
This paper presents GenCorres, a method to solve the Joint Shape Matching (JSM) problem for a collection of unorganized shapes.  It is based on fitting the input shapes with a mesh generator that is constrained to preserve the local structure (conformal or isometric) of the shapes. Particularly, GenCorres first learns an implicit generator from the input shapes using a VA, which produces intermediate shapes between arbitrary pairs. The paper introduces a novel approach for computing correspondences between adjacent implicit surfaces, which is used to regularize the implicit generator. Second, synthetic shapes generated by the implicit generator guide the initial fittings (template-based deformations) for learning the mesh generator. Experimental results demonstrate that GenCorres outperforms state-of-the-art JSM techniques in collections of articulated body shapes.

### Strengths
GenCorres is a well-crafted method divided into three stages. Stage 1 learns an implicit generator from unorganized sets using a VAE, where local (ACAP) and cycle consistency is imposed between surfaces that are close along the embedding dimension, defining the geometric deformation and cycle-consistency regularization losses. Stage 2 learns the explicit mesh generator from the VAE encoder-decoder. Stage 3 refines and fits the mesh generator to the input set of meshes and enforces again local structure consistency with ACAP. The three stages are well constructed and contain novel contributions to this field, especially the regularization losses in Stage 1. The results in the paper reveal that the GenCorres' generative method produces high-quality meshes and the correspondences across the input set significantly improve the state-of-the-art.
In terms of the quality, the methodology is well described and motivated. The results offer enough evidence that GenCorres improves the state-of-the-art of JSM in collections of shapes describing articulated body shapes. The article also includes an ablation study to assess the importance of each individual step.
In terms of significance, this method offers an interesting solution to a difficult and open problem that has important applications in computer graphics.

### Weaknesses
The main weakness of GenCorres, which is revealed by the experiments and commented by the authors, is the need of a relatively large set of input shapes to learn the shape generators properly. Solving this issue is a difficult task that requires further research.

GenCorres seems to be especially suitable for a particular type of shapes (articulated body or animal shapes) to which ACAP and ARAP represent good deformation constraints. Other shape collections, such as man made objects, probably represent a challenge for this method.

### Questions
How well does GenCorres perform with man-made shapes or other shapes that do not correspond to articulated objects? 

What is the influence of the hyperparameters (lambda and epsilon) in the final result? Are the values specified in the paper valid for other sets of input shapes?

If the number of input shapes is a critical factor, I suggest the authors to include an experiment to establish the limit number for which the method significantly degrades.

### Summary
The paper presents a method for computing correspondences between target shapes from a collection of shapes. Namely, the method first learns an implicit shape generator from the input collection, enforcing several useful shape-preserving constraints. It then evaluates the learned implicit generator to interpolate between target shapes, and uses the interpolation to guide the learning of the explicit shape generator. After a final refinement step, the target shapes are corresponded with high quality and appropriate in-between interpolations. The main shortcoming of the approach is the need for a substantially large collection of shapes to begin with.

### Strengths
The high level idea is simple and sound: learn a shape generator with useful geometric priors, then apply its interpolation capabilities to guide explicit correspondence. The results are convincing, with rigid limbs bending appropriately between corresponded shapes, and the ablation study is informative.

### Weaknesses
The paper is hard to follow, both in text and in math, which makes it difficult to clearly understand and implement the presented ideas. A few rounds of editing should help the flow. Much of the mathematical detail (especially in section 4.1) should be relegated to the appendices (with full derivations and descriptions), and only clearly readable final formulas should be shown in the main text (I'd carefully pick which symbols represent which concepts).

The demonstrated use case is pretty contrived -- all collections come from well parameterized datasets. I would love to see results using 3D body scans with various clothes, hairstyles, etc.

The human shape collection seems to include a multitude of body types, and is clearly able to correspond/interpolate between them. The animal collections seem to only have shapes of the same animal. The paper would be stronger if you show an interpolation between say a lion and a horse. It is not clear whether this method would blend well between very different quadruped shapes.

A more suitable ARAP reference should be: As-rigid-as-possible shape interpolation by Alexa et al. 2000

The main title in the PDF seems to be misspelled: "CenCorres" instead of "GenCorres".

In general, there are many symbols used in the mathematical notation, which need to be clearly mentioned and described.
  * What are the different fonts for g (looks like implicit expressions use lowercase letters, while explicit use bold letters)
  * What is Theta in g^Theta in the "Problem statement" paragraph (page 3)?
  * What is Phi in "Approach overview" (page 3) and what does it map from and to? Why R^3 x Z? Does it compute the distance field value at the specific 3D coordinate for the shape defined by a latent code?
  * What is Psi in h^Psi in equation (1)? Also mention lambdas for equations (1) and (2).
  * Symbol x is introduced in section 4.1 without describing what it is.
  * What does d stand for in equation 3, some displacement between a vertex and an infinitesimally close corresponding vertex? Is d of unit length, then scaled down by epsilon? Or should d be the small displacement that doesn't need to be further multiplied by epsilon?
  * At some point we get exposed to several capital letter symbols (C, F, G, E) whose meaning is hard to follow.

Table 2 caption should mention that the metric is mean and median geodesic distance between correspondences.

Acronyms should be spelled out the first usage.
  * First mention of ACAP is not accompanied by description and reference, maybe just remove it from section 3 until it's properly introduced in section 4.
  * MP-pseudo inverse should just be Moore-Penrose inverse.

### Summary
The paper proposes joint shape matching (JSM), an unsupervised training schema based on three steps: the training of a generative model for implicit shapes; a template fitting to the shape generated by interpolation in the latent space; a final refinement provided by a chamfer fitting. The method is tested on humans and animals on relatively small datasets, and shows promising performance w.r.t. previous methods, comparable to ones that use implicit information.

### Strengths
- The method is unsupervised and extrinsic but provides good performance, competitive with intrinsic approaches that uses the surface as regularization 
- The method seems novel, and the idea of enhancing the learning representation by interpolation in the latent space seems straightforward and reasonable

### Weaknesses
 - The central part of the method is not easy to grasp. I find the overall principle clear, and it is probably possible to replicate the work in principle. Still, the technique is not well explained in detail, and the notation is often confusing. For example, the letter "g" is used both for the shape generator and for the mesh generator, and requires some back-and-forth to get used to it. I suggest revisiting the method explanation and clarifying the methodological details.
- By my understanding, the method highly relies on the target shapes belonging to a given distribution that should not only bounded in terms of structure and class but in particular, should be possible to express by the registered template. Many methods rely on template registration, and it is not a weakness per se, but the proposed approach makes use of techniques that aim to be general and flexible (e.g., implicit representation, unsupervised learning), but the paper does not show any out-of-distribution results (and also, results only on shapes for which data are available and can be even generated synthetically). I also believe that the topological constraint given by the template limits the generality of the method. The limitations barely mention this, and it should be emphasized more.
- Experiments are performed on a relatively small set of data. The datasets are outdated and do not deal with the literature's more recent and real challenges (e.g., partiality, noise, clutter, ...). In this sense, I suggest stressing the method further; I believe that they would be interesting to investigate the latent interpolation when the learned space represents more diverse shapes (i.e., I wonder if relying on implicit representation may help in the context of limited topological variation during the interpolation, or if the relying on a template do not let to generalize to these cases)

### Questions
Following the Weaknesses above:
1) How would linear interpolation behave in the presence of significant diverse geometrical topology data? Is the template triangulation the main limitation in this case?
2) Could you provide some measure of the computational cost of the method? I think would be important to understand the scalability of the method, and I assume that the method would require a significant computational effort. How does it compare with NeuroMorph?
3) Would it be possible to test the method on a class for which a dense correspondence is not provided; for example, some classes of ShapeNet (e.g., cars, airplanes)?
