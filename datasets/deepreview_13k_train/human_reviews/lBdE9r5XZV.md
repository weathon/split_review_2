- Decision: Reject
- Scores: 3, 6, 8, 6

## Abstract
We develop a method that recovers the surface, materials, and illumination of a scene from its posed multi-view images. In contrast to prior work, it does not require any additional data and can handle glossy objects or bright lighting. It is a progressive inverse rendering approach, which consists of three stages. First, we reconstruct the scene radiance and signed distance function (SDF) with our novel regularization strategy for specular reflections. Our approach considers both the diffuse and specular colors, which allows for handling complex view-dependent lighting effects for surface reconstruction. Second, we distill light visibility and indirect illumination from the learned SDF and radiance field using learnable mapping functions. Third, we design a method for estimating the ratio of incoming direct light represented via Spherical Gaussians reflected in a specular manner and then reconstruct the materials and direct illumination of the scene. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms the current state-of-the-art in recovering surfaces, materials, and lighting without relying on any additional data.

### Summary
This paper proposes a three-stage method to reconstruct geometry, material and lighting of glossy objects from multi-view posed images. They reconstruct the scene radiance and signed distance function (SDF) in the first stage with both volume and surface rendering, and decompose the color into diffuse and specular components for surface rendering. They then distill and model light visibility and indirect illumination from the learned SDF and radiance field. Finally, they perform material and direct illumination estimation based on the learned geometry and visibility/indirect light. Experimental results show that they can recover more plausible surface geometry and albedo of glossy objects compared to existing methods.

### Strengths
- This paper proposes to progressively decompose the glossy object into plausible geometry, material and illumination. They model the visibility and indirect light according to the recovered geometry and radiance field, and perform the material reconstruction based on the geometry and indirect light. The progressive design facilitates the decomposition of the albedo/specular and the illumination.
- Experimental results show the proposed method successfully recovers the surface of the glossy objects and decomposes the diffuse/specular components.

### Weaknesses
 - Lack of reference to NeRO [a], DIP [b]. NeRO [a] proposes a two-step approach for reconstructing the geometry and the BRDF of reflective objects with strong reflective appearances. They also introduce real/synthetic glossy dataset for evaluation. DIP [b] proposes a physics-based interreflection-aware illumination model and end-to-end learns the illumination, geometry and materials. Both are released earlier and with code available. The authors should compare the proposed method with them.
- Lack of novelty. The proposed method consists of three stages which combine ideas from different papers. For the first stage, they propose to perform joint volume and surface rendering, which is similar to S^3-NeRF [c], and joint appearance and BRDF modeling which follows TensoIR [d], decompose color into explicit diffuse and specular components for glossy surfaces which follows Ref-NeRF[e]. The visibility and indirect light modeling in second stage mostly follow NeRFactor [f] and IndiSG [g]. The BRDF modeling in last stage follows PhySG [h].
- Evaluations/analysis are not thorough. For instance, the diffuse/specular component of the first stage is not visualized/analyzed. There is also no ablation study on the design of the modeling of the two components. Besides, it would be better to visualize the geometry/albedo/specular/roughness/visibility/indirect light/environment map at the same time for all the datasets. Most results in the paper are partially shown for different datasets. Visibility and indirect lights are only included in the videos of three objects without any analysis. Environment maps are only visualized in one ablation study in supplementary.
- The progressive decomposition is not end-to-end, the geometry is fixed after first stage.
- Symbols used are a bit messy.

### Questions
- The datasets for evaluation should be more diverse. The lighting of SK3D dataset is not complex and the backgrounds are all black. The proposed method should also be evaluated on the Glossy-Blender dataset and Glossy-Real dataset proposed by NeRO [a] whose surfaces are more reflective.
- What’s the performance on objects that are diffuse or not very glossy?
- Better visualize the pipeline and models of all stages for easier understanding.
- The proposed method chooses simplified modeling for diffuse and specular component in the first stage, where diffuse does not consider shading and specular and only consider reflection direction and normal as input of MLP. Since the geometry will be fixed in the following two stages, how would the design affect the geometry reconstruction?

### Summary
This paper deals with the problem of jointly reconstructing surface geometry and material properties and inferring illumination from posed images captured from multiple viewpoints in a stationary scene. The proposed approach for this task is able to deal with glossy and specular objects quite well. The underlying approach is based on inverse rendering which has been studied and has shown quite a lot of promise recently. Motivated by NeuS/Geo-NeuS, the authors have proposed an implicit 3D reconstruction approach that works in three-stages. The first stage focus on accurate surface geometry recovery even when non-Lambertian surfaces are present and the subsequent stages involve estimating the lighting directions and visibility and BRDFs. The paper presents novel ideas and presents ablation experiments to justify the importance of the proposed ideas. The overall approach outperforms existing approaches on some hand selected scenes from the DTU and SK3D benchmark.

### Strengths
The paper presents strong results that improve upon recent works addressing the joint geometric reconstruction and appearance modeling task – PhySG (Zhang et al. 2021), NVDiffRec and IndiSG, on appropriate datasets. Standard metrics are used for evaluating the geometric accuracy and the re-rendered images based on the reconstructed geometry and appearance models are evaluated based on PSNR.

The formulation is principled and in particular the use of surface rendering as well as volumetric rendering to deal with non-Lambertian surfaces is novel, I think. Also, training a neural network to predict the specula albedo map on top of the BRDF network is also a technical contribution to the best of my knowledge.
The SDF-based reconstructed geometry is robust and works well on non-Lambertian surfaces where Geo-NeuS and NeuS both produce noticeable artifacts. 

The ablation study reported confirms that the specular albedo estimation improves accuracy in most cases on various datasets and also the second experiment confirms the importance of combining volumetric and surface rendering.

### Weaknesses
Although the paper reports quantitative results (Chamfer-distance based) on the DTU and SK3D datasets, they only do so for 4 and 5 scenes from DTU and SK3D respectively. It would have been more convincing to see the quantitative results on the whole dataset. The approach is sound and should technically work on all scenes and not just on scenes with glossy objects. Therefore, including these results would be informative to confirm that the more complex image formation model does not lower performance on scenes with Lambertian objects.

The approach is quite complex and involves training several different neural networks and setting hyperparameters in different stages. While Section 3.1 is well written and provides more details, I found Sections 3.2 and 3.3 to be quite short and difficult to follow. The technical presentation is sound, but the work will be difficult to reproduce due to lack of sufficient detail, especially in Section 3.3. It will help the reader if the author present pseudo code for the full approach and clarify which modules are trained and how the associated parameters are initialized and how the various hyperparameters need to be set or tuned.

The images in the paper are very small (Figures 3, 4 and 5) making it difficult to compare the results from various methods.

### Questions
I would appreciate if the authors could clarify the technical novelty especially around the specular albedo estimation, and how this part of their approach differs from the work of Zhang et al 2022b (IndiSG).

There are several hyperparameters in the three stages. How are they all determined? Which ones need to be tuned from scene to scene, or when dealing with different datasets?

Why is the approach evaluated only on masked objects?

I would appreciate it if the authors computed the metrics for the whole DTU dataset and showed the accuracy gap with NeuS and Geo-NeuS on all the scenes.

### Summary
This paper describes a method for building a model of scene radiances out of a set of images of the object from many orientations.  The model factors the object surface radiance into four parts: ambient body reflection, ambient surface reflection, direct body reflection, and direct surface reflection. The authors use multiple trained networks to build the model, divided into three stages. The new method is compared against three other recently published methods that also build decomposed NeRF models.

### Strengths
The strength of the paper is the method of decomposition, which follows more closely with prior work on physical models of reflection than comparable methods (even if the authors didn't realize it).  The use of multiple networks to model different phenomena also factors the problem into more learnable parts.

A second strength is the focus on shape as a way to build ground truth into the decomposition.  Developing good ground truth for body and surface reflection is challenging at best for real imagery.  However, by focusing the loss on surface reconstruction, which is a derivative of the estimate of body and surface reflection, they were able to provide reasonable feedback to the decomposition networks.

I like the fact that the networks must be learning linear color functions (which is necessary because adding body and surface reflection in sRGB space would produce the wrong values).  

The qualitative and quantitative results are strong for the data sets evaluated.  I also like the use of real data sets rather than relying on synthetic ones.

### Weaknesses
The primary weakness is a lack of consistency with vocabulary and definitions.  There is a long history of physical models of appearance, and the model the authors derive is effectively the Bi-illuminant Dichromatic Reflection model (see equations 9 and 10 of Maxwell et. al, CVPR 2008) which is built on the Dichromatic Reflection model (Shafer, 1986).  The physics-based vision community has long used the terms body reflection and surface reflection to refer to what the authors are calling diffuse radiance and specular radiance.  Using a phrase like "surface diffuse radiance" is mixing this vocabulary and creates confusion.

Another confusing example is the sentence  "Diffuse radiance refers to the scattered light that illuminates a surface or space evenly and without distinct shadows or reflections."   Illumination is irradiance onto a surface, while radiance is light leaving the surface.  I believe what the authors are trying to describe is what is often referred to as ambient illumination, which is the light arriving at a surface from all directions except those that point at a direct light source (the source of shadows and shading).  The ambient illumination is then what is reflected by the surface to create ambient body reflection (diffuse diffuse radiance?) and ambient surface reflection (diffuse specular radiance ?).  Using body reflection and surface reflection makes the concepts more clear because it refers to the mechanism of reflection rather than a descriptive term.

The term "diffuse albedo" is also somewhat confusing, though albedo is commonly used (for greyscale?).  Using something like body reflection color is less confusing.

My only other complaint is the reference to a number of appendices, which aren't present in the review copy.  Is it possible to squeeze just the critical points into the actual paper?

### Questions
Are the authors using linear or sRGB data to train the networks?  If linear, then is the original data linear, or are they taking the sRGB inverse of sRGB JPG data?

Just to clarify, can the stage 3 models of direct illumination learn multiple direct illuminants?  How is this related to the visibility calculations in stage 2?  Or is there an implicit assumption of a single direct illuminant?  

Are there any examples of multiple direct illuminants in the data sets evaluated?

Following Bonneel et. al, 2017, a useful evaluation of intrinsic decomposition is to demonstrate that the decompositions are good enough to enable editing of illumination or reflectance separately. Is there a similar task whereby the authors could show a practical use of the decomposition and use it for comparison with other methods?

### Summary
This paper develops a method that recovers the surface geometry, materials (diffuse and specular), and illumination of a scene from multi-view images. Unlike previous approaches, this method does not require any extra data and is adept at managing glossy objects and high intensity lighting conditions.

The method has three stages: In the first stage, the scene's radiance and Signed Distance Function (SDF) are reconstructed. A novel training strategy is introduced here, which leverages both volume and surface rendering. This strategy effectively addresses complex, view-dependent lighting effects during surface reconstruction. In the second stage, light visibility and indirect illumination are distilled from the learned SDF and radiance field using learnable neural networks. Finally, materials and direct illuminations are recovered using a set of Spherical Gaussians.

### Strengths
- A significant focus of the paper is on addressing the challenges posed by glossy scenes, especially when they feature specular highlights. This is an important area as many objects in the real world manifest specular and many previous method fail to achieve good quality it in these areas.
- The paper is well-written. It clearly outlines previous works and offers a balanced comparison with them. The paper's contributions are clearly stated, and it provides a comprehensive ablation study on its proposed enhancements. 
- From the experiments, it's evident that this paper achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in terms of material and geometry reconstruction. The ablation study further reinforces the validity of the improvements proposed.
- I find the first stage of this paper particularly innovative. It was previously unknown that optimizing both volume and surface rendering concurrently could enhance surface geometry, especially in specular regions. This concept might be applied in other contexts to address surface geometry challenges arising from pronounced specular highlights.

### Weaknesses
 - This paper appears to be a combination of numerous prior works. From my perspective, the first stage borrows from the papers NeuS and PhySG. The second stage seems inspired by NeRFactor and IndiSG, particularly in how they learn visibility mapping from a previously trained geometry neural network. The final stage also bears similarities to IndiSG. Given these observations, I contend that the paper presents limited novelty in its three-stage training approach.
- The proposed Specular Albedo Index (SAI) lacks solid theoretical grounding. The authors don't clearly explain why the specular albedo is applied only to the indirect component (as seen in eq-13) and not to the direct component (eq-10). Furthermore, the experiments indicate that the introduction of SAI causes the method to underperform in its illumination estimation. It would be beneficial if the authors could elaborate on this performance decline and offer deeper analysis and insights

### Questions
Please address the question about SAI in the weakness part.

In summary, I believe this paper offers a robust solution for determining the geometry, material, and illumination of objects in uncontrolled settings using only multi-view inputs. The authors outline a three-stage approach to address this complex problem and provide valuable insights. However, certain concepts and design choices remain ambiguous. It would be beneficial if the authors could address these in their response.
