## Abstract
<- trailing '%' for backward compatibility of .sty file
Machine-learning methods are gradually being adopted in a wide variety of social, economic, and scientific contexts,
yet they are notorious for struggling with exact mathematics.
A typical example is computer algebra,
which includes tasks like
simplifying mathematical terms, calculating formal derivatives, or finding exact solutions of algebraic equations.
Traditional software packages for these purposes are commonly based on a huge database of rules for how a specific operation (e.g., differentiation) transforms a certain term (e.g., sine function) into another one (e.g., cosine function).
These rules have usually needed to be discovered and subsequently programmed by humans.
Efforts to automate this process by machine-learning approaches are faced with challenges like
the singular nature of solutions to mathematical problems, when approximations are unacceptable,
as well as hallucination effects leading to flawed reasoning.
We propose a novel deep-learning interface involving a reinforcement-learning agent that operates a symbolic stack calculator to explore mathematical relations.
By construction, this system is capable of exact transformations and immune to hallucination.
Using the paradigmatic example of solving linear equations in symbolic form,
we demonstrate how our reinforcement-learning agent autonomously discovers elementary transformation rules and step-by-step solutions.

### Confidence
2: You are willing to defend your assessment, but it is quite likely that you did not understand the central parts of the submission or that you are unfamiliar with some pieces of related work. Math/other details were not carefully checked.

### Summary
The authors present a reinforcement learning approach for solving linear equations and evaluate it on a set of problems.

### Strengths
- the problem domain is interesting, there is not much work on using RL to solve symbolic equations
- The paper in generall is easy to understand
- The related work appears to be covered

### Weaknesses
There is no clear motivation why the proposed approach is a good idea.  
The authors state that:
" Evidently, this process could benefit greatly from techniques that enable computers to
discover and implement transformation rules on their own. Moreover, finding viable approaches
to do so will eventually help to make machine-learning models more adept at mathematics and
problems requiring exact solutions in general."

But why is it a disadvantage that current automatic equation solvers integrate human expert knowledge? What is the pain point of the current solutions that exist?

2. There are no comparisons done in this paper. This is striking both on the small as as well as the large scale.

2.1 how much faster/slower and more/less accurate does the proposed method work compared to established methods from Mathematica, Maple, Matlab, or SymPy?

2.2  What are the impacts of the hyper-parameters on the performance of the solution? E.g. how relevant is the discount factor, the complexity of the network? While I understand that deep RL approahces have a lot of hyper-parameters it is still relevant to identify the most sensitive ones  and do some form of inspection and analysis regarding the robustness of the approach.

2.3  What are the impacts of the RL approach (double Q learning) on the solutions? How well would  for instance PPO methods compare?

2.4 Compared to related work, is there no related method you could compare to?

### Questions
After training, what is the sucess rate compared to established solvers?
What is the wall-clock time in inference compared to established solvers?

### Summary
The authors introduce a simple computer algebra system for manipulating elementary algebraic equations. This system comprises a sequence-based representation for the algebraic equations, and a small stack based machine for executing manipulations of these expressions. The authors then train a deep reinforcement learning agent, using double deep Q-learning, to operate this stack machine, with the objective of reducing given algebraic expressions to a canonical ("solved") form.

The authors show that, with an appropriate curriculum, the agent can indeed learn to operate this machine to achieve the goal of solving the equations. Further, they show that by introducing a second RL agent in an adversarial generator-solver arrangement with the first, that they can reduce the need to hand-craft a curriculum - although they do find that it is still useful to craft a simpler curriculum for maximum performance.

### Strengths
The manuscript is very clearly written. I found it very easy to read and understand what the authors had done. The presentation of the results was direct, easy to understand, and helpful.

### Weaknesses
I think there are two main weaknesses with this paper: that it doesn't support its main claim; and that the domain it is applied to is too simple to really get a sense for whether the approach is useful or interesting.

The paper claims in the introduction that "humans must implement the discovered rules as computer programs" in traditional computer algebra systems and that "this process could benefit greatly from techniques that enable computers to discover and implement transformation rules on their own." In the conclusion the authors claim that their work "can be seen as a first step towards the general goal of creating a machine-learned computer algebra system in which the fundamental laws of mathematical reasoning and deduction are discovered autonomously by an AI." I do not think this claim is supported by the work presented. When the authors introduce their representation of the algebraic equations, and the operations of the stack machine, they implicitly encode all of the "fundamental laws of mathematical reasoning and deduction" that are necessary for this domain. These are fully sufficient for this domain, and so in that sense also all the "fundamental laws" that this system will ever contain. More specifically, their assumptions immediately partition the space of expressions into equivalence classes that encode the notion of semantic equality in this domain. The act of "solving" the equations can be thought of as the act of finding a canonical exemplar (or, at least, an exemplar from a canonical subset as the authors' definition of "solved" admits multiple solutions). So what the RL algorithm has found is a search algorithm within an equivalence class that finds a canonical example. This is an interesting and useful thing to do, but I would argue that is does not in any sense enable their system to discover any fundamental laws of mathematics - these were all in there right from the start when the authors defined their system. So I don't think the main claim of the paper is supported by the developments presented.

The second weakness is that the domain in which the authors work is exceedingly simple: that of simple algebraic equalities. Viewed through the lens described above - that what the authors' RL algorithm really does is discover effective search procedures for canonical exemplars in the domain, then I think a valid question is "how complex would it be to develop such an algorithm another way?" And the answer is "essentially trivial". Many straightforward algorithms exist for doing this search, including the ones routinely taught to schoolchildren and those implemented in standard linear system solvers. So from my perspective showing that an RL agent can discover such an algorithm isn't really a convincing result. It would be interesting if an RL algorithm could find search algorithms that are not known to existing computer algebra systems (or even schoolchildren) but that hasn't been demonstrated in this paper. So my feeling here is that the authors would really have to show that their system can discover non-trivial search algorithms for it to be a notable result.

### Questions
The opening analogy is confusing: while there's only one correct solution to the equation in some sense, there are usually multiple structural forms for that solution (x = 2 - c, x = -c + 2), and there are many sequences of manipulations that would lead to those goal states. So it seems like the situation is not that different from chess, in the sense that one is trying to find a sequence of moves to get to a subset of states that have some particular property.

### Summary
The paper proposes a new method for solving algebraic equations via reinforcement learning, in a manner akin to a Computer Algebra System.  However, the key contribution of the paper is that the solving strategy is learnt by a reinforcement learning (RL) system. The RL system has access to a set of rules/actions, that can be iteratively composed to solve the linear equation. The authors propose a novel strategy, whereby parts of equations and additional constant coefficients can be stored in a stack, from where they can be called or acted upon with a possible set of actions, to solve the linear equation.

### Strengths
- The proposed strategy, though simple is quite original
- The writing is clear
- The experimental analysis seems sound

### Weaknesses
 - The problem is interesting but the restriction to just linear equations is quite severe
- I am not sure if this is a widely different approach from Computer Algebra System (CAS), as in the end CASs also implement a search strategy in a space of possible actions. This is not completely a criticism, as it could be exciting to extend CASs with RL for efficiency. But I am not sure this paper provides many novel ideas in that direction. I believe the paper can be a stepping stone to a real proof-of-concept for RL applications to CAS, but in its present form it is too limited.

### Questions
- Have you looked into expanding the existing open-source CAS (such as Sympy) systems with RL?
- Why have you not experimented with quadratic equations? does the space of actions significantly explodes in that case?
- In what case if ever, exponential (^) is used?
