- Decision: Reject
- Scores: 6, 5, 6, 6

## Abstract
Stochastic differential equations (SDEs) have been shown recently to  characterize well the dynamics of training machine learning models with SGD. When the generalization error of the SDE approximation closely aligns with that of SGD in expectation, it 
  provides two opportunities for understanding better the generalization behaviour of SGD through its SDE approximation. 
Firstly, viewing SGD as full-batch gradient descent with Gaussian gradient noise allows us to obtain trajectory-based generalization bound using the information-theoretic bound from \citet{xu2017information}. Secondly, assuming mild conditions, we estimate the steady-state weight distribution of SDE and use information-theoretic bounds from \citet{xu2017information} and \citet{negrea2019information} to establish terminal-state-based generalization bounds. 
Our proposed bounds have some advantages, notably the trajectory-based bound outperforms results in \cite{wang2022generalization}, and the terminal-state-based bound exhibits a fast decay rate comparable to stability-based bounds.

### Summary
The paper analyzes noisy gradient descent where the added noise is an anisotropic, state dependent Gaussian noise. Two bounds on the expected generalization error of this algorithm are established using tools from information theory. The first is a trajectory dependent bound, the second takes a quadratic approximation of the loss around a local minimum and derives a result for noisy GD in that basin. In addition, some experiments are conducted to argue that the noisy gradient descent scheme constitutes a valid approximation of SGD.

### Strengths
The paper applies the idea of using data depended priors to bound mutual information to study a noisy gradient descent scheme that appears to not have been studied before.

### Weaknesses
 - Some inappropriate comparisons and missing discussions: The bounds in this paper are established for noisy GD, but comparisons to [1] and [2], which is are results on SGD analyzed through an auxiliary sequence are made. It is strange to say a bound on a different object is tighter. More important are the missing discussions of other data dependent bounds established for schemes very similar to the studied noisy GD. For example, the very paper this work builds on has a result on SGLD where the batch noise covariance appears [3, theorem 3.1], comparisons with such results would be more appropriate. Especially since theorem 3.1 in this work is a straightforward application of the method in [3].
- Interpretability of the bounds: The choice of priors would ideally yield meaningful quantities. Here, aside from obtaining a dependence on trajectory wise gradient norms, a result already known for generic noisy iterative schemes, the paper proves Theorem 3.2 where the alignment between the batch estimate covariance and the population gradient covariance appears. It is difficult to understand why this quantity is interesting as it is not well discussed. Moreover, there should be more discussion on the positive definite assumption because, in practice, for neural networks, there are many more weights than data points, thus making $C_t$ invertible only for large $n$.
- A mix of informal and formal claims: Throughout the paper, even in the proofs, and especially in section 4, the paper mixes informal and formal results making it quite difficult to track what the result is stating. Approximate equalities $\approx$ and $=$ are used interchangeably and results that hold in the limit are taken to be valid for a finite T. This is especially felt in theorem 4.1 and lemma 4.1 and its corollaries.
- Tenuous links with practice and problems with solely analyzing generalization: The paper makes an effort to link its bounds with practice but is often unconvincing. For instance, concepts such as the "edge of stability" are discussed along with experiments simply because a step size and largest singular value appeared together in lemma 4.1 after two obscure assumptions such as commutation of a hessian and a covariance matrix and an ambiguous $\approx$.  For the trajectory based bounds, it is important to note that the obtained bounds are time dependent, meaning that a single pass over the data can quickly yield a vacuous result so this should be stated well before these bounds are used to try to justify practice. Putting aside the previous points, it is clear from Corollary 4.2 and its interpretation that solely analyzing generalization bounds can quickly loose meaning: yes an algorithm that stays close to initialization generalizes better but so does an algorithm that simply ignores the training data entirely. Over analyzing generalization bounds without thinking of the utility of the algorithm can lead to strange interpretations.

### Questions
Section 4 is difficult to understand. I can only make sense of the results if we exactly have $T = \infty$.
- Could you please formally restate the result showing that the noisy GD scheme you analyze converges to a mixture of Gaussians centered at local minima ? It is only briefly discussed with a mention to a result by Mandt et al.
- In lemma 4.1 are you assuming that there is only a single minimum per sample $S$ ? 
- The results Corollary 4.2 and Theorem 4.2 appear to be algorithm independent as long as the algorithm converges to a distribution over local minima. Is this correct?

### Summary
This paper explores the challenge of establishing generalization bounds for SGD. It does so by using information-theoretic measures to assess the connection between a learning algorithm's output and its input. These bounds rely on two key assumptions: 

1- Approximating SGD using a discrete Stochastic Differential Equation (SDE) framework, where the "minibatch noise" is Gaussian with a data-dependent covariance matrix. 

2- Assuming that the transition kernel of SGD follows a Gaussian distribution. 

Using these assumptions, the authors provide generalization bounds by characterizing the mutual information between the learning algorithm's output and its training dataset.

### Strengths
I think providing generalization bound for SGD is an important problem. Approximating SGD update rule with anisotropic SGLD seem an interesting idea and the bounds are intuitive.

### Weaknesses
Motivation of this work is not clear for me. It seems the main motivation is the connections between dynamics of SGD and its associated discrete SDE. The only evidence in the paper is a plot in the introduction. In the other related work, the authors miss many prior work and also the discussion in the related work section seems in-complete. Validation of SDE section in the paper also include lots of technical terms without exactly defining them.

Regarding Section 3 of the paper, many parts are not clear to me. In particular, it is assumed that the transition kernel of SGD is Gaussian around the minima. why is it a valid assumption? Transition kernel of SGD is just a bunch of delta measures based on the different realization of the mini-batches.

In general, I found the motivation of the paper is rather weak.

### Questions
- What does it mean that the distribution around local minima be Gaussian distribution? I do not understand the assumptions in Section 3.

- The statement of the theorems can be improved. For instance, it is difficult to understand the assumptions of Theorem 4.1.

- An important related work is

In this paper the authors also consider the problem of obtaining generalization bounds for SGD+ anisotropic noise. What are the technical differences between the results in this paper and Wang et al?

### Summary
This work proposes several new information-theoretic generalization bounds based on an SDE approximation of SGD. Detailed discussions on these results are provided, including a comparison with prior information-theoretic bounds and specific corollaries for different scenarios (e.g., isotropic vs. anisotropic prior). All the results are validated experimentally throughout.

### Strengths
1. Extensive discussions on prior works and the context behind considering information-theoretic bounds + thorough literature survey
2. Experimental verifications support the theoretical bounds

### Weaknesses
1. The overall organization can be done better. For instance, there are many different information-theoretic bounds throughout the papers, each separately discussed below the corresponding theorems. It would be very helpful for first-time readers if the paper had a summarizing section that gathers and summarizes all the results and compares them (e.g. when is this more useful/tighter)
2. Overall, although the results are better than previous bounds (e.g., Neu et al. (2021)), to me, it's a bit unclear exactly what are the technical novelties in allowing for better results. The discussions provided after each theorem helped me understand the context of how to interpret the new result, but I'm a bit confused about whether the results themselves are new or are just improvements of known bounds. Even in the contributions, although the paper provides much explanation on what the bounds mean and what they are saying, the novelty of the results is somewhat unclear (As most of the implications are already somewhat known in deep learning theory literature).

### Questions
1. Overall, am I correct in saying that the paper proposes analyses that provide a somewhat unifying information-theoretic perspective on the folklore (some of which have been studied extensively) results in deep learning theory?
2. Can the authors provide the plot of the proposed generalization bounds by somehow estimating the mutual information?
3. Can this be extended to other optimizers such as momentum, adam, adagrad...etc?
4. Any connection to the information bottleneck theory of deep learning?
5. Can the authors do something similar with noisy SGD [1]?
6. Corollary C.1 states that the generalization is controlled by the distance from initialization. Does this mean that lazy training is when generalization is the best? Or is it that the lazy training phase is not compatible with the required assumptions?

### Summary
- The authors provided an information-theoretic generalization error bound for SGD by utilizing the interesting connection between SGD and SDE discussed in [Mandt et al. (2017)] and [Jastrzebski et al. (2017)], etc..
- They showed the close relationship between the population gradient covariance and the covariance of the gradient noise, thus justifying the significance of the trace of gradient noise covariance in the generalization ability of SGD.
- Additionally, we applied the obtained information-theoretic bounds to derive the generalization error upper bound for SGD based on distribution-dependent prior distributions or data-dependent prior distributions. Using these results, they derived bounds based on alignment between the weight covariance matrix for each individual local minimum and the weight covariance matrix for the average of local minima, as well as bounds based on sensitivity.
- They empirically confirmed the generalization ability of SGD/SGE and the key components within the derived bounds for both algorithms by utilizing their generalization bounds, revealing that these components for SGD and SDE align remarkably well. They also showed that their bound is tigther than that of [Wang & Mao (2022)].

### Strengths
- Information-theoretic generalization error analysis is particularly effective for analyzing noisy and iterative algorithms like SGLD. However, in the case of SGD, the upper bounds for mutual information (MI) diverge, making it challenging to apply directly. In this paper, instead of relying on the commonly used auxiliary process technique, the authors enabled information-theoretic generalization error analysis by exploiting the connection between SGD and SDE using full-batch gradients and mini-batch gradients, as a means to address this issue. This is a very intriguing approach with broad potential applications.
- Through the derived generalization error bounds, this paper provided a theoretical validity for empirically known discussions of the impact of gradient variance on generalization performance and the improvement of generalization performance through control of gradient norms.
- In the experiments, the analysis not only focuses on the tightness of the bounds but also examines the numerical assessable elements that constitute these bounds. Furthermore, it confirms the close agreement between SGD and SDE. These factors collectively ensure the validity of the theoretical results.
- From the above, it is evident that this paper is well-written and provides a significant impact in the research field of generalization performance analysis obtained through stochastic optimization.

### Weaknesses
 - The limitations of the information-theoretic generalization error analysis approach, such as (implicit/explicit) dimension-dependence and time-dependence, are inherent in the bounds of this paper (although mitigating these limitations can be challenging or important future work). The paper would have been better if there had been a part discussing the limitations and future prospects related to these issues.
- The approximation of $\Lambda_{w*}$ leads to a dependency on the inverse of the learning rate $\eta$ in the bounds provided in Corollaries 4.1 and 4.2, as well as Theorem 4.2. It seems that these bounds become large or even diverge as the learning rate decreases ($\eta_t \rightarrow 0$). A similar problem appears in the sensitivity-based generalization error analysis for SGLD [1]. I guess that the reason for decaying the learning rate only between the 40,000th and 60,000th iterations in the experiments is to prevent the bounds from diverging, as reducing the learning rate too early might cause divergence before the parameters have converged sufficiently.

### Questions
I would like to express my sincere respect for all the efforts the authors have invested in this paper. 
In connection with the weaknesses mentioned above, I would like to pose several questions related to the concerns raised. 
I would appreciate your responses.

- In this paper, the authors make the assumption of a loss function that is both differentiable and satisfies the $R$-subGaussian property. Can you provide specific examples of loss functions that meet both of these assumptions, excluding bounded losses?
- As I comprehend it, the generalization error bounds presented in Theorem 3.1, Corollary 3.1, Theorem 3.2, Theorem 4.1, and so forth, within this paper, explicitly or implicitly rely on the parameter dimension $d$. I'm curious about the behavior of these bounds as $d$ grows ($d \rightarrow \infty$). Especially, in cases where dimensionality dependence is observed both inside and outside the logarithmic expressions, it appears that these bounds tend to diverge unless factors such as gradient noise are adequately small. Could you please share the authors' thoughts on this matter?
- Is it feasible to find an approach for approximating $\Lambda_{w*}$ that eliminates the reliance on the inverse of $\eta$?
Is delaying the timing of reducing the learning rate the sole method when numerically evaluating your bounds? I believe there is some relationship between the generalization (or the desired convergence) and the speed of learning rate decay. What is your perspective on these concerns?

## MISC
- When numerically evaluating generalization errors in experiments, I imagine it involves evaluating the difference in accuracy between the test data and the training data. In such cases, even if the training/test accuracy is low, it's possible for the apparent generalization error to be small. Therefore, if possible, reporting the predictive accuracy after training completion would enhance the reliability of the experimental results (I refer to Appendices H and I in [2] for example).
- p.4, the paragraph of "Validation of SDE," the 2nd paragraph: an oder 1 strong... --> an order 1 strong... ?
