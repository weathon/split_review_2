- Decision: Accept
- Scores: 6, 6, 5, 6

## Abstract
Explaining multivariate time series is a compound challenge, as it requires identifying important locations in the time series and matching complex temporal patterns.
Although previous saliency-based methods addressed the challenges,
their perturbation may not alleviate the distribution shift issue, which is inevitable especially in heterogeneous samples.
We present ContraLSP, a locally sparse model that introduces counterfactual samples to build uninformative perturbations but keeps distribution using contrastive learning.
Furthermore, we incorporate sample-specific sparse gates to generate more binary-skewed and smooth masks, which easily integrate temporal trends and select the salient features parsimoniously.
Empirical studies on both synthetic and real-world datasets show that ContraLSP outperforms state-of-the-art models, demonstrating a substantial improvement in explanation quality for time series data.

### Summary
The paper presents a tool for time series explanations, which is challenging as it requires matching complex temporal patterns and features. Perturbations have been among popular approaches to identify counterfactuals, but the paper argues, in time series these can be particularly challenging since perturbations can make samples OOD, rendering the resulting explanation meaningless to the original goal (i.e., finding a counterfactual). This is especially the case when considering the label-free perturbation scenario, which is less studied in literature. 

In order to address this, the paper proposes a label-free Contrastive, and locally sparse perturbation approach that is more likely to generate in-domain perturbations. 

ContraLSP has two main components -- first a contrasting objective that seeks to ensure perturbations are dissimilar from the the original time series and are "more distracting". There is also a sparse, stochastic gate for each feature to ensure sparsity in feature selection. The final objective contains 3 terms -- contrasting loss, a regularizer on the mask, and a proximal loss to ensure predictions are close to the original, un perturbed input.

### Strengths
* **Problem statement and motivation**: Time series explainability is an important topic, that has received relatively lesser attention. The paper correctly identifies the trouble with OOD perturbations in time varying data, which are poorly understood in comparison with image and language modalities. The tool is capable of working with both blackbox and whitebox models, as well as working with regression and classification tasks-- which are positives.
* **Problem formulation**: The contrasting approach to time series explainability appears to be novel as far as I know. 
* **Evaluation**: Extensive empirical evaluations are conducted on synthetic benchmarks with available ground truth on feature importance, as well as real world clinical data. ContraLSP appears to be outperforming several related baselines in both scenarios.

### Weaknesses
 * **Counterfactuals**: The paper generously uses counterfactuals in the text to indicate perturbations produced by their model, whereas this is a label free approach and the mask is learned to minimize the gap between the original and unperturbed samples. The contrasting objective is the only source for potential counterfactual generation, that too it is not guaranteed to do so --  this distinction should be made more explicit in the text, and reduce the usage of perturbations being called counterfactuals. The experiments mostly only measure the ability of ContraLSP on identifying salient features, so this claim should be tempered down. 
* In this context, can the authors elaborate on the failures or weaknesses of ContraLSP? Specifically, when is it expected to fail, perhaps in comparison to techniques that work with labeled data?
* **The contrasting objective** :  Since negatives are chosen at random, they are likely going to be weak negatives, and claiming these will be "more counterfactual" is probably not true. It must also be defined what "more counterfactual" means here -- more than what? How does the random negative selection ensure perturbations are crossing over class boundaries? Why is an L1 edit distance the right distance metric to do this? 
* **OOD Perturbations**  how does this objective _guarantee_ or at least ensure lack of OOD perturbations? Is the training of the perturbation function with contrastive loss sufficient to ensure this?
* **Sparse gating and stochasticity**: Please define what the heavy-tailed nature of the sparse feature selection is, and how it is relevant to ContraLSP. The hard thresholding function in eqn (3) is only needed due to the random noise injected in the masking, since $\mu'$ is a sigmoid function already.. why is the noise needed in the first place? 
* The paper's writing is not easy to follow, and this makes it hard to assess the core contribution of the work more rigorously. There are a lot of vague statements which are not stated clearly. Some of these are listed below:
	* ".. perturbation may not alleviate the distribution shift issue.." (in the abstract)
	* ".. unregulated data distribution .." (in Sec 3)
	* ".. allows perturbed features to perceive heterogenous samples, thus increasing the impact of the perturbation.." (Sec 4)
	* ".. counterfactual perturbations more distracting.." (Sec 4.1)
	* ".. due to their heavy tailed nature.." (Sec 4.2)
* **Illustrations**: I recognize time series explanations are more challenging than visual data like imagery. However, the current set of illustrations are not very clear. For e.g. in Fig 5 why is the sum of salient observations shown? What is the inference from this figure? its very unclear, please make the key observations more explicit, perhaps with the help of a simpler dataset or time series and more consistent with Fig 1, which is easier to follow.

### Summary
This paper presents ContraLSP, a locally sparse model that introduces counterfactual samples to build uninformative perturbations but keeps distribution using contrastive learning.

Note that this paper does not quite match the expertise of my research and I have made the comments to AC.

### Strengths
1. The idea of using contrastive loss seems to be a new idea
2. In the experiment section, the authors provide a comprehensive comparison with multiple baseline models
3. The paper is well written.

### Weaknesses
I mainly have some questions to the author:
1. I curious about if the method is scalable to high dimension data. For example, video sequences?
2. What is the $\alpha$ and $\beta$ values you use for each dataset? and how do you determine their values?
3. In section 4.1, I wonder why you choose Manhattan distance rather than more conventional Euclidean distance? Optionally, other metrics like cosine distance might work better for contrastive learning?

### Summary
This manuscript presents a new method in the explainability of time series predictions. The task here is given a multivariate time series of factors to predicting an output variable to identify the regions of the input that are most predictive of the output, here defined by a binary mask. The presented technique uses a perturbative approach to compute the binary mask on the input factors. While perturbative approaches have been considered, it differs from other approaches in how it produces these perturbations. They use a contrastive (triplet) loss across samples  a smoothed sparse gate. They provide a series of experiments comparing performance to other perturbative and other approaches, such as Dynamask and Shapley Features. They use a synthetic white-box experiment with rare observation or time salience and show improved recall with their method compared to others, although all methods showed high precision. Similarly on a synthetic state-switching task they find improved recall, and perform ablations to show how  different inputs vary. They provide further examples using classification and with a real-world mortality task. There is a comprehensive supplement giving further documentation for the methods and experiments.

### Strengths
* The approach is original and I believe a good contribution to existing methodologies.

* They present a comprehensive set of experiments that are well motivated and the result achieves SOTA performance on many of them. 

* While the writing and motivation is often unclear, the math behind the method is very clearly explained.

### Weaknesses
 * The advance feels somewhat incremental and the experiments performed are near-identical to the Dynamask paper (cited in text).

* It was unclear to me how hyperparameters were selected for each experiment. This is important as changing the expected sparsity could have a dramatic effect on recall performance. More generally there are now a family of approaches for interpretability and it is not clear what the respective strengths and weaknesses are of each. This manuscript suggests their method is superior to all others, but a discussion of which types of data each method is suited to would be helpful. 

* The manuscript is hard to follow the text as the writing and motivation is not clear in a number of points. Terms are not always introduced in order and it is hard to appreciate the innovations is. One of my reservations about this manuscript is even if the algorithm is novel it will be hard for others to appreciate. 

* In the white box experiments I had trouble appreciating the experimental design, which made it difficult to evaluate. Moreover the largest difference between methods was in the information-based metrics, which seemed to scale quite nonlinearly with recall  (fine tuning/hyperparameters).

* The authors mention treatment of inter-sample correlations as an important component of the technique, but I do not see clear evidence of this. 

* Can you explain what in-domain and negative samples refer to “Other perturbations could be either not uninformative or not in-domain, while ours is counterfactual that is toward the distribution of negative samples “

* “ To cope with it, locally stochastic gates Yang et al. (2022) consider an instance-wise selector that employs heterogeneous samples. Lee et al. (2022) takes a self-supervised way with unlabeled samples to enhance stochastic gates that encourage the model explainability meanwhile.” The terms introduced here (stochastic gates, heterogeneous samples) are not defined. The writing is unclear as well. 

* I found the description of the ‘Datasets and Benchmarks’ in 5.1 WHITE-BOX REGRESSION SIMULATION very unclear, making it hard to follow the experiments. 

* “our method significantly outperforms all other benchmarks.” I do not see any tests of significance. 

* Figure 5 I found unclear.

### Summary
-	The paper proposes a Contrastive and Locally Sparse Perturbations (ContraLSP) framework, which utilizes contrastive learning techniques to render non-salient features uninformative during training. The sparse gate with $\ell_0$ regularization can aid in feature selection. The proposed method exhibits strength in both with-box and black-box scenarios.

### Strengths
-	The paper demonstrates its novelty by incorporating contrastive learning techniques into explainable time series tasks. Contrastive learning is a suitable solution for distinguishing informative and non-informative components.
-	The paper is well-written and easy to read, and the figures effectively aid in comprehending the main ideas.
-	Through the use of perturbation methods, ContraLSP remains relatively unaffected by noise and uninformative parts.
-	The paper shows the performance enhancement of ContraLSP across a wide range of datasets, surpassing existing methods. The authors cover various tasks in Rare-Time, Rare-Observation, and various real-world datasets.

### Weaknesses
 - Please refer to questions.

### questions:
 I will happily raise the score if the authors can address the following questions:

- 1. Although the authors discuss the selection of positive and negative samples in Appendix B, the selection of positive and negative pairs in time series is quite controversial because the proximity of data samples does not guarantee similarities [1,2,…]. The method in Appendix B appears too naive and may pose a risk of incorrect sampling for time series pair selection.
- 2. Can you provide a more specific explanation of why the counterfactual of non-salient features is superior to ignoring that part (e.g., setting it to zero), as shown in Figure 1? Even though a zero value of $x$ does not affect the training to minimize the loss of prediction with weight $w$ as $wx$, using counterfactuals can have adverse effects.
- 3. The learned mask in Figure 4 appears to exhibit similar behavior to a hard mask rather than other smooth masks. Can you clarify how the learned function $\tau(\cdot)$ behaves in a multi-dimensional context? I have read the ablation study in Table 3.
- 4. What is the difference in using the $\ell_0$ norm in Section 4.2 of your methods compared to previous methods that use the $\ell_0$ norm?
