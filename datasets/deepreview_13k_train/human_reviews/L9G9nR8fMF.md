# LayerAct: Advancing CNNs with BatchNorm through Layer-direction Normalization

- Decision: Reject
- Scores: 6, 5, 8

## Abstract
In this work, we propose a novel activation mechanism aimed at establishing layer-level activation (LayerAct) functions for CNNs with BatchNorm. These functions are designed to be more noise-robust compared to existing element-level activation functions by reducing the layer-level fluctuation of the activation outputs due to shift in inputs. Moreover, the LayerAct functions achieve this noise-robustness independent of the activation's saturation state, which limits the activation output space and complicates efficient training. We present an analysis and experiments demonstrating that LayerAct functions exhibit superior noise-robustness compared to element-level activation functions, and empirically show that these functions have a zero-like mean activation. Experimental results with three benchmark datasets for image classification tasks show that LayerAct functions excel in handling noisy datasets, outperforming element-level activation functions, while the performance on clean datasets is also superior in most cases.

### Confidence
3: You are fairly confident in your assessment. It is possible that you did not understand some parts of the submission or that you are unfamiliar with some pieces of related work. Math/other details were not carefully checked.

### Summary
The paper proposes a new activation function for CNNs with BatchNorm. The proposed layer-level activation, LayerAct, is designed to be more robust to noise and activation fluctuations due to shifts in input, compared to existing point-wise activation functions. The analysis and experimental results validate the noise-robustness of LayerAct.

### Strengths
- The paper presents a new layer-level activation function for CNNs with BatchNorm.
- The proposed activation function is presented in a general form in that variations of activation functions can be explored.
- The paper is well-written and easy to follow.

### Weaknesses
 - The paper demonstrates experiments with rather same networks (ResNet) and small networks. Is the experimental result consistent with larger networks (e.g., ResNet-152) and different networks (e.g., EfficientNet, ResNext)?

- If LayerAct provides different effects from LayerNorm, there may be benefits the proposed function may bring for networks with LayerNorm. How does the proposed activation function behave with Transformers?

4: You are confident in your assessment, but not absolutely certain. It is unlikely, but not impossible, that you did not understand some parts of the submission or that you are unfamiliar with some pieces of related work.

### Summary
This paper proposes an activation mechanism called LayerAct that combines layer normalization in the (general) sigmoid-linear-units to improve the noise-robust of the network. It empirically shows that the proposed LayerAct functions have a zero-like mean activation and are more noise-robustness. Experimental results with three clean and three out-of-distribution benchmark datasets for image classification tasks show the proposed LayerAct functions output perform the baselines on noisy datasets, and also is also superior on clean datasets in most cases.

### Strengths
1. The topic is interesting and important for the community.  
2. The proposed LayerAct can improve the performance marginally over the baselines, showing the potential in practice. 
3. It is glad to see the proposed LayerAct exhibit superior noise-robustness compared to element-level activation functions.

### Weaknesses
1. I think the technical contribution is overall low. The proposed LayerAct can be viewed as Layer Normalization combining the (general) sigmoid-linear-units. Both of them are good methods in improving the performance of neural network. It is not surprise the proposed method can improve the performance over the original activation functions. It is good that this paper addresses the robust of the proposed method, however I have concerns in the second point.

2. I have concerns on the clarity of why LayerAct is noise-robust. The main claim is that the scale activation function is bounded (Eqn.8 and Eqn.9), thus the model is robust. But, bounding the activation function cannot bounding the $y_i$, which can still be not robust. This paper should well address this point. It is true the proposed LayerAct can obtain good empirical results on corruption datasets. However, this is not surprising, because the previous methods [1] have show that the combination of Batch-Free normalization (e.g., LayerNorm) and BatchNorm can be more robust for distribution shift (e.g., corruption). The main insights is that LayerNorm can alleviate the train-inference inconsistency problem of BatchNorm (I noted all experiments on noise-robust uses the networks with BatchNorm). I want to ask whether the proposed LayerAct can be noise-robust on the network without BatchNorm?

3. I have concern on the title of this paper. The title addresses “ADVANCING CNNS WITH BATCHNORM THROUGH LAYER-DIRECTION NORMALIZATION”. However, I find the description of the proposed LayerAct is independent to the BatchNorm (e.g, this paper doesnot say how LayerAct alleviates the problem of CNN with BatchNorm). I think this paper should well clarify it

4. This paper has some imprecise descriptions:
(1)I have concerns on this “Specifically, we propose a novel layer-level activation (LayerAct) mechanism, along with two as sociated functions. This advancement combines batch-direction normalization with the effects of layer-direction normalization”. How does LayerAct combines both? If yes, why the experiments run on the network with BatchNorm? How does the LayerAct works on the network without BatchNorm.
(2) This paper claims “One-sided saturation avoids the vanishing gradient problem while maintaining noise-robustness”. Why the One-sided saturation avoids the vanishing gradient problem? Based on my understanding, the saturation state will cause no gradient.
(3)why ” the sum of activation scale $\|s(n^{LN})\|$ will be similar across all samples”? please clarify it in detail.

### Summary
This paper introduces a novel activation mechanism for Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) with BatchNorm, addressing limitations of existing activation functions, specifically the trade-off problem and the large variance of noise-robustness across samples. The proposed LayerAct functions aim to provide layer-level activation, reducing noise fluctuations in activation outputs and achieving noise-robustness independently of the activation's saturation state. The authors present a comprehensive analysis and experimental results demonstrating the superiority of LayerAct functions over element-level activation functions in terms of noise-robustness. Additionally, they show that LayerAct functions perform exceptionally well in handling noisy datasets, outperforming element-level activation functions, while also achieving superior performance on clean datasets in most cases.

### Strengths
- The paper makes a significant contribution to the field of deep learning by introducing the concept of LayerAct functions, which address limitations in existing activation functions. This novel approach provides a valuable addition to the toolbox of techniques for improving the robustness and performance of CNNs.

- This paper is written in a clear and easily comprehensible manner, making it easy for readers to follow.

### Weaknesses
 - Some existing advanced batch normalization improvements like IEBN [1] and SwitchNorm [2] have shown enhanced performance. It would be interesting to investigate whether LayerAct can further improve the performance of these normalization methods.

- While I understand that this paper discusses CNNs, there is a growing need for advanced activation functions in various other network architectures, including transformers and UNets. I'd like to know if the proposed method has the potential to be adapted to these advanced network structures.

- I still don't quite understand the advantage of "layer-direction" activation over "element-wise" activation. Could the author please provide a concise explanation with simple examples or a summary?

- Additionally, I'd be interested in understanding in which applications LayerAct might excel or not excel. For example, we have instance norm for tasks like style transfer, batch norm for CNN-based classification tasks, and layer norm for transformer-related tasks. Can LayerAct be analyzed and discussed in a similar manner, suggesting suitable application areas?

- The author needs to clarify the above questions. If these issues are addressed, I will consider these clarifications along with feedback from other reviewers in deciding whether to raise my score.
