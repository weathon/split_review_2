## Abstract
\Glspl{dnn} usually come with a significant computational and data labeling burden.~While approaches such as structured pruning and mobile-specific \glspl{dnn} have been proposed, they incur in drastic accuracy loss.~Conversely from prior work, in this paper we leverage the intrinsic redundancy in latent representations  to drastically reduce the computational load with very limited loss in performance.~Specifically, we show that semantically similar inputs share a significant number of filter activations, especially in the earlier layers.~As such, semantically similar classes can be ``clustered'' so as to create cluster-specific subgraphs. These may be  ``turned on'' when an input belonging to a semantic cluster is being presented to the \gls{dnn}, while the rest of the \gls{dnn} can be ``turned off''. To this end, we propose a new framework called \textit{Semantic Inference} (\FW). In short, \FW  (i) identifies the semantic cluster the object belongs to using a small additional classifier; and then (ii) executes the subgraph extracted from the base \gls{dnn} related to that semantic cluster to perform the inference. To  extract each cluster-specific subgraph, we propose a new approach named \emph{Discriminative Capability Score} (DCS) that effectively finds the subgraph with the capability to discriminate among the members of a specific semantic cluster. Importantly, DCS is independent from \FW, as it is a general-purpose quantity that can be applied to any \gls{dnn}. We benchmark the performance of DCS on the VGG16, VGG19, and ResNet50 \dnns trained on the CIFAR100 dataset against 6 state-of-the-art pruning approaches. Our results show that (i) \FW reduces the inference time of VGG19, VGG16, and ResNet50 respectively by up to 35\%, 29\% and 15\% with only 0.17\%, 3.75\%, and 6.75\% accuracy loss; (ii) DCS achieves respectively up to 3.65\%, 4.25\%, and 2.36\% better accuracy with VGG16, VGG19, and ResNet50 with respect to existing discriminative scores; (iii) when used as a pruning criterion, DCS achieves up to 8.13\% accuracy gain with 5.82\% less parameters than the existing state of the art work published at ICLR 2023; (iv) when considering per-cluster accuracy, \FW performs on average 5.73\%, 8.38\% and 6.36\% better than the base VGG16, VGG19, and ResNet50. We share our code for reproducibility.

### Summary
The paper introduces the Semantic Inference (SINF) framework to accelerate the execution of DNN. Leveraging the intrinsic redundancy in latent representations, the authors propose the Discriminative Capability Score (DCS) to identify subgraphs within large DNNs to discriminate between members of specific semantic clusters. They validate the approach using the CIFAR100 dataset and compare the performance of SINF across popular DNN architectures like VGG16, VGG19, and ResNet50.

### Strengths
Novelty in Approach: The paper leverages intrinsic redundancy in latent representations, offering an interesting perspective on accelerating DNNs.

Versatility: The approach is tested across multiple popular DNN architectures, indicating its adaptability.

### Weaknesses
## Major

1. There are a lot of existing pruning methods, e.g., DepGraph: Towards Any Structural Pruning
but this paper does not provide any comparison to existing works

2. The acceleration on CIFAR10/CIFAR100 is not satisfied.
For example, DepGraph achieves an 8.92× acceleration with a 3.11 loss in accuracy on CIFAR100 with VGG19.
However, the results provided by the author (~1.72x and 2.83 loss on acc) are worse than previous work.

3. The writing is confusing, it is hard to find the main results.

4. This method applies an additional predictor to discriminate which hyper-class the input should be, which introduces extra inference cost and training effort. Does the provided inference time include the inference time on the additional predictor? Another concern is that the extra network will hurt model generalization ability.

## Minor

1. The authors provided an anonymous GitHub link to share code, but it is an empty link.

### Confidence
3: You are fairly confident in your assessment. It is possible that you did not understand some parts of the submission or that you are unfamiliar with some pieces of related work. Math/other details were not carefully checked.

### Summary
1) Key ideas: the submitted paper studies the problem of pruning approaches of deep neural networks, with a focus on searching cluster-specific subgraphs for inference (without retraining or fine-tuning) that faster neural network without drastic accuracy loss. 

2) Contributions: The authors propose a new inference framework to divide the DNN into subgraphs according to the semantic cluster the object belongs to. This process is complemented by common feature extractor, semantic route predictor and feature router modules.  Additionally, a new discriminative capability score (DCS) is proposed to find the subgraphs, which is also applied as a pruning criterion and achieve state-of-the-art performance.

3) Their significance: the most significant contribution is the results: 1. DCS outperforms existing state-of-the-art discriminative algorithms and pruning criterion. 2. SINF reduces the inference time with limited accuracy loss and showing significant improvement considering per-cluster accuracy.

### Strengths
1. The paper shows impressive results of reducing inference time with limited accuracy loss (Figure 4 and Figure 6) and the proposed DCS shows state-of-the-art performance (Figure 5 and Table 1).
2. Visualization and quantization analysis and verification have been conducted on the proposed Semantic DNN Subgraph Problem. Figure 1 shows intuitive and credible results.
3. The paper provides detailed descriptions of the proposed core algorithms (how to extract subgraphs for semantic clusters, algorithm2) and theories (how to compute discriminative capability score, algorithm1).

### Weaknesses
1. Lack the comparison with previous quantization and pruning approaches. There are many quantization and pruning approaches that can speed up the inference without fine-tuning or retraining. Can do more comparison experiments with SINF and show the comparable results of the whole pipeline. Specifically, the paper should compare against methods that perform filter pruning or weight pruning without requiring retraining, as these are most relevant to the proposed approach. The current comparison only considers one recent work, but there are likely other methods that could serve as a baseline.
2. Table 1 lack the results of ResNet50 on CIFAR100.
3. Lack the analysis of the poor improvement in Table 1, where there is almost no improvement for VGG19 on CIFAR100 and only a slight improvement on CIFAR10. The paper should provide a more in-depth analysis of why the proposed method struggles to improve performance on certain architectures and datasets. It is not sufficient to simply state that the network has reached a lower bound; a more detailed investigation into the specific limitations of the approach is needed.

### Questions
Is there any proof or metric to evaluate the intrinsic redundancy in latent representations? The idea of intrinsic redundancy is interesting but somehow blurred, it will be great if there is any explicit metric can be proposed or discussed.

### Summary
This work introduces Semantic Inference (SINF), a novel method for drastically reducing the inference complexity of DNNs. SINF is based on the assumption that semantically similar inputs should share a significant number of filter activations; these semantically similar inputs can be viewed as "clusters". In turn, appropriate cluster-specific sub-graphs of the base network can be detected and then executed for inference based on the assigned cluster of each object. To do so, the considered approach introduces Discriminative Capability Score (DCS)  , a general purpose method aiming to find filters that can distinguish between semantically similar classes. In experimental evaluations on the CIFAR-10/100 datasets using different benchmark architectures (VGG16, VGG19, RN50), DCS yielded significant improvements compared to other SOTA methods.

### Strengths
The paper introduces a novel approach for using sub-graphs of the network to perform inference based on a partition of the inputs via semantic similarity. The idea is very interesting and intuitive, potentially contributing to a different inference methods for DNNs.

### Weaknesses
Despite the novelty of the approach, there are some significant issues that need to be addressed, and the main element missing from the main text, at least in my personal view, is clarity. Up until (and including) Section 3, the paper is well-written and easy to follow. The intuition and motivation are very clear. 

After that, the presentation of the method is very confusing. 

We begin with the definition of the DCS procedure, where the notation keeps changing. The authors start with a given layer $l$ and semantic cluster $\gamma_m$ (where up to this point, it is not clear if $\gamma_m$ comes from some ground truth information or is computed as the introduction suggested). For each datapoint belonging to the semantic cluster, the activations for each feature map $\boldsymbol A_{l, c_i}^j$ are computed and adaptive pooling is perfomed. Then, the feature map is flattened by the dependence on $l$ is gone. This is the first instance that breaks the flow of reading the paper. This trends continues by introducing $\boldsymbol F^j$ which concatenates all the features for all the filters in the layer and $N_f$ is introduced (again layer-specific with no dependence). The same goes for $\boldsymbol W*$ that seems to be dependent on both $\gamma_m$ and $l$. Using some normalization, we then compute the desired DCS value, which again is layer and cluster specific but this is not clear from the notation. 

Then, the SINF procedure is presented. The authors present the steps, most of which are not yet introduced. It would be better to first introduce the procedures and then tie them together, instead of noting that everything will be explained later. 

Here, the authors note that before deployment, the DCS is used to construct semantic subgraphs. Again is not yet clear how are the partitions obtained. Do the authors use the training set of CIFAR-10/100 that are already somehow prepartitioned into semantic clusters, e.g., the superclasses of CIFAR-100, and use algorithm 2 to extract the subgraphs? Because this is the first step of the approach, that always takes as an input the Partitioned Data. 

Moving on to the process of extracting the sub-graphs, we begin with $L$ and $M$, the last layer and the layer before the Common Feature Extractor. In this context, if $L$ is the last layer of (assuming) the backbone network, isn't $M$ also the layer of said network? In Fig.3 there is no illustration of what $L$ and $M$ since they backbone is not shown. The input is just passed through the common feature extractor and a sub-graph is selected without a corresponding backbone. 

The authors use $X$ to denote the number of retained filters in a layer $X$. Again confusing notation, $X$ are the data, and even though it's easy to understand the difference, clarity is reduced. The authors can just use $r_l$ for any layer $l$. The authors note that for each layer $M \leq l \leq L$ the $r_l$ is calculated; however, in Algorithm 2, $r_L$ and $r_M$ are given as an input and also updated in the process. At the same time the authors note "This procedure is performed for different values of $r_L$ and $r_M$. In this paper, $r_L$ is set between 90% and 10%, with steps of 10, while $r_M$ is set between 10% and 1%, with steps of 2". Why is this procedure performed? Is this some kind of initialization? What happens with the multiple different values? Do the authors select some kind of best performing model? And in this context, what is the intuition behind the computation of $r_l$? It seems to be dependent on the current layer number $M, L, r_M$, and  $r_L$ but how the values affect the results is not clear. 

Turning to the classifier, the authors note that the classifier is attached to some $l$-th layer. This layer is the earliest layer that provides good prediction for semantic routes is chosen. What does it mean that the layer provides good predictions for semantic routes? Do the authors try to match the output of this classifier to the potential $K$ clusters (which at this point I will assume stem from ground truth information)? How was the $75$% accuracy was decided? What if for some setting the $l$-th layer is the last layer of the network? What is the impact of different values for this threshold? 

In the experimental section, the authors introduce the notation for the confidence threshold as $\gamma$, which is also used for the partitions $\gamma_i$. Again, even though it is something distinct, notation clarity should be improved. 

Other points:

In the context of pruning methods, there exist a plethora of methods that perform pruning end-to-end during training, balancing accuracy and sparsity. Characteristic examples include [1,2,3]. However, one argument that the authors make is that all the (referenced) methods require fine-tuning after pruning, which may be true for the methods that the authors cite but not for all pruning methods. Unless the authors refer to post-hoc pruning methods, in which again there exist methods that consider solvers to balance accuracy and sparsity without any further fine-tuning [4].

I find the definition of the Semantic DNN Subgraph Problem a bit misdefined. The equation itself seems to indicate that the average loss of the partitions should be less or equal to the full network loss; this however can be true for any configuration of the sub-graphs (even random) and restricts solutions that can even perform better, e.g., due to avoiding parameter redundancy. The authors note that $\mathcal{L}$ is the evaluation metric, but the $\mathcal{L}$ notation is commonly the loss function in the literature and not the classification accuracy that the authors consider. And in the regression setting, e.g., using MSE as an evaluation metric leads to a different interpretation of the problem setting.

The fact that the evaluation is only assessed on CIFAR-10/100 undermines the impact of the approach. Indeed, these datasets are considered "small" datasets and the authors should assert the generalization capabilities and performance on more demanding datasets and settings, such as ImageNet-1k. At the same time, evidently the algorithms depends on ground truth information about the semantic clusters of the data. If we do not have access to this kind of information, it's not clear: (i) what semantic clusters we should consider, and (ii) how will the algorithm perform in this setting. 

Overall, despite the novelty of the proposed framework, presentation and clarity should be greatly improved. At the same time, important  details (like the $r_l$ computation) are not justified, while important ablation studies in the various effects of parameters/settings are missing.

### Summary
The authors propose a method to make DDN inference more efficient by selecting for each input, using the features of early layers, which units to use in the rest of layers.
They do so by finding clusters in the training dataset such that each cluster is assigned a subnetwork within the whole DNN.
At inference time, a sample is assigned to a cluster and, thus, to a subnetwork.
The result show that a substantial reduction in inference time can be obtained while sacrificing some accuracy on CIFAR100 using VGG and ResNet DNNs.

### Strengths
With the activations in the high-level layers of DNNs (and not so much the lower-level ones) known to be sparse, it seems reasonable to perform predictive pruning conditioned on the low-level activation of a sample.

### Weaknesses
Although I understand the motivation and the gist of the method (Fig 3 conveys it quite well), I struggled to follow some of the details. These are my main issues with the paper:
1- In Eq 1, is L_eval is a loss (where lower is better), it seems trivial to find subnetworks that perform less well than the original DNN. So I imagine L_eval is not a loss (as the L would suggest), but some performance metric where higher is better. Even in that case the problem is not fully defined, since F_yi = F would satisfy Eq 1 while not being an useful solution. The addition of 'proper subgraph' does not fully address this, as the core issue is the lack of an explicit objective to minimize the size or complexity of the subnetwork while maintaining performance. An efficient subnetwork is not just a different subnetwork, but a smaller and faster one.
2- I find the writing of the paper very hard to follow. How are the semantic clusters built? I’m not sure I could follow the explanation in section 4 and algo 1, which is a bit too cluttered. Something as important for the method as the Discriminative Capability Score is not actually explained anywhere. Same issue with the training of the route predictor.
3- Even in section 3, which introduces the main setting of the methodology, the authors already mention many elements that would rather pertain to the experimental section, like specific architectures and hyperparameter choices.
4- The authors claim to obtain SOTA results while using relatively old datasets and architectures. I don’t think such a choice invalidates the contribution, but I would weigh the claims accordingly.
5- What is Fig 1top supposed to convey? It doesn’t seem to show anything. If the idea is to show the difference in sparsity, a simply plot with the sparsity level of each layer would work better.

### Questions
Overall, I think it is likely that the contribution of this paper could be valuable, but the presentation and understandability needs to be substantially improved.

The authors would probably be interested in this paper:
