- Decision: Accept
- Scores: 6, 6, 6, 6

## Abstract
In deep learning, test-time adaptation has gained attention as a method for model fine-tuning without the need for labeled data. A prime exemplification is the recently proposed test-time prompt tuning for large-scale vision-language models such as CLIP. Unfortunately, these prompts have been mainly developed to improve accuracy, overlooking the importance of calibration, which is a crucial aspect for quantifying prediction uncertainty. However, traditional calibration methods rely on substantial amounts of labeled data, making them impractical for test-time scenarios. To this end, this paper explores calibration during test-time prompt tuning by leveraging the inherent properties of CLIP. Through a series of observations, we find that the prompt choice significantly affects the calibration in CLIP, where the prompts leading to higher text feature dispersion result in better-calibrated predictions. Introducing the Average Text Feature Dispersion (ATFD), we establish its relationship with calibration error and present a novel method, Calibrated Test-time Prompt Tuning (C-TPT), for optimizing prompts during test-time with enhanced calibration. Through extensive experiments on different CLIP architectures and datasets, we show that C-TPT can effectively improve the calibration of test-time prompt tuning without needing labeled data.

### Summary
This paper studies an interesting problem related to test-time prompt tuning of a vision-language model. Through a series of observations, this paper finds out that the calibration is linked to the choice of prompts. Therefore, this paper attempts to improve the calibration error (ECE) by using the average dispersion of text features. The main idea is to distribute the text features in the feature representation space. The experiments show that the proposed method successfully improves the ECE of test-time prompt methods. The topic of this paper is relatively interesting and proposes a novel perspective for prompt tuning.

### Strengths
1. The solution (i.e., ATFD) of this paper is reasonable. The choice of prompts affects the ECE metric, indicating that the feature representation is well-calibrated. Therefore, prompt tuning for placing textual class vectors separately is important.
2. The experiments of this paper are comprehensive, and the improvement of ECE is significant. Both the ablation study and additional analysis can provide valuable information to readers.
3. The presentation of this paper is good, and the technical content is easy to follow.

### Weaknesses
1. The experimental results show that the accuracy (ACC) of C-TPT drops in many cases. However, the ECE and ACC are a trade-off in most cases. The author should explain whether the drop in accuracy is worth the improvement of ECE. My advice is that authors can provide a Pareto frontier of ECE vs. ACC for C-TPT methods and hand-crafted prompts to demonstrate that C-TPT achieves a superior solution, rather than simply obtaining a prompt with higher ECE and lower ACC.
2. The related work should discuss a related field, i.e., Test-time Adaptation [1-5].

### Summary
This paper first makes observations on the effect of text prompt to the CLIP model calibration (consistency of predicted confidence with the real accuracy), where there is a negative correlation between the dispersion of the text features and the calibration error. Then it proposes the Average Text Feature Dispersion (ATFD) to measure this dispersion of the text features. It then proposes a loss function based on the ATFD to increase the ATFD thus improving calibration during test-time adaptation. The approach is validated on different datasets with CLIP models and shows the improved results with smaller calibration error and similar accuracy compared to an existing test-time prompt tuning methods.

### Strengths
-	The authors make several observations before introduction their technique to improve the calibration property of the model. The observations (figure 1&2) are intuitive and clearly shows the correlation between the calibration error and the ATFD metric.
-	The proposed ATFD loss combined with an existing test-time adaptation method shows consistently improved results on various downstream tasks (ImageNet, Caltech, Pets etc)
-	Paper writing is clear and easy to understand. The key claims are well supported by the evidence from the experiments.

### Weaknesses
-	The application of improving calibration on just one algorithm (test-time prompt tuning) is kind of limited. I would expect this method to help improve different prompt tuning methods such as CoOp. Additional experiments on other prompt tuning tasks are strongly recommended to improve the impact of this work.
-	Figure 5 is problematic. First, the color scheme of Figure 5 is incorrect. The legends of (a) and (b) both have the black color, but the dots in the prompt visualization figure does not have the black dots. And the class visualization is weird. Do the authors want to show the class of some samples on the visualized plan? Then the location of the class samples should be different from the class prompt. However, I find that in Figure 5(a) the class samples are perfectly aligned with the class prompts.

### Questions
Is there specific reason to prevent this method to be used for other prompt tuning methods such as CoOp and CoCoOp (Conditional Prompt Learning for Vision-Language Models) ?

### Summary
This paper focused on the calibration issue in prompt tuning of vision-language models, especially for test-time prompt tuning, which is not fully explored in previous studies. The main findings are (1) test-time prompt tuning increases the calibration error, (2) the variance of calibration is high with different hard prompts, (3) calibration and text-feature dispersion are highly correlated. Based on the third finding, this work proposed a regularization term based on the text feature dispersion during test-time prompt tuning. Experiments on fine-grained classification and distribution shift datasets show that the proposed method achieves comparable performance with test-time prompt tuning method while lowering the calibration error.

### Strengths
+ The calibration error issue in test-time prompt tuning is not fully discussed in previous works. The research problem is novel and interesting.

+ The proposed regularization term is simple but effectively decreases the calibration error.

+ Experiments on fine-grained classification and distribution shift datasets show that the proposed method achieves comparable performance with test-time prompt tuning method while lowering the calibration error.

+ The paper is well written and organized. It is easy to follow the idea and figure out the main massages.

### Weaknesses
 - Although the contributions of this work are obvious, it is somehow limited. The main messages I took from this paper are (1) this work pointed out the calibration error issue for test-time prompt tuning of VLMs, (2) provided an analysis on the relations between prompts and calibration error, (3) this work found the correlations between text-feature dispersion and calibration. Although the analysis is interesting and novel, it is not comprehensive enough. It would be interesting to know whether training-time prompt tuning also suffers from calibration error. If so, does the proposed method work for training-time prompt methods. If not, what is the reason. Also, the conclusions are empirical rather than theoretical. It is okay if the method is motivated merely on empirical observations, but the lack of theories decreased the contributions of this work.

- The proposed method is only adopted on TPT method. Do other test-time prompt tuning methods suffer from calibration error? Can the proposed method be applied to other methods? Only one method is discussed is not comprehensive to draw the conclusions.

- This work used 80 hard prompts to evaluate the impact of prompts on calibration error. However, according to the prompts shown in Appendix A.3, some of the prompts are not optimal. For example, "a black and white photo of a {class}" is not suitable to colored photos, and "a sketch of a {class}" may not work for photos. I am wondering whether the discrepancy between prompts and calibration error are due to the bad choices of prompts. If so, the conclusions about the relation between prompts and calibration error may not be convincing enough.

### Summary
This paper aims to calibrate the output of CLIP during test time. The authors discover the negative relationship between ATFD and ECE and use ATFD as regularization during test time prompt tuning.

### Strengths
1. The paper is well-written.
2. I appreciate the story of the paper.
3. I recognize the contribution of the paper --- calibration during test time. The proposed method is simple but effective. They maintain competitive performance with TPT and achieve better calibration.

### Weaknesses
Although I recognize the contribution of the paper, one practical problem is that the proposed method does not improve the metrics --- no positive influence is observed besides the ECE. A lower ECE does not show its significance in the tasks of the paper unlike the mentioned medical application. Hope authors can shed more light on this weaknesses

### Questions
One interesting thing is that CLIP (before TTA or fine-tuning) achieves the lowest ECE most time. It would be nice if the authors could shed light on this point.
