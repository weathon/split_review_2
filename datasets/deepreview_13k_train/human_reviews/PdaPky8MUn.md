# Never Train from Scratch: Fair Comparison of Long-Sequence Models Requires Data-Driven Priors

- Decision: Accept
- Scores: 8, 8, 8, 8

## Abstract
Modeling long-range dependencies across sequences is a longstanding goal in machine learning and has led to architectures, such as state space models, that dramatically outperform Transformers on long sequences. However, these impressive empirical gains have been by and large demonstrated on benchmarks (e.g. Long Range Arena), where models are randomly initialized and trained to predict a target label from an input sequence. 
In this work, we show that random initialization leads to gross overestimation of the differences between architectures and that pretraining with standard denoising objectives, using \emph{only the downstream task data}, leads to dramatic gains across multiple architectures and to very small gaps between Transformers and state space models (SSMs).
In stark contrast to prior works, we find vanilla Transformers to  match the performance of S4 on Long Range Arena when properly pretrained, and we improve the best reported results of SSMs on the PathX-256 task by 20 absolute points. Subsequently, we analyze the utility of previously-proposed structured parameterizations for SSMs and show they become mostly redundant in the presence of data-driven initialization obtained through pretraining.
Our work shows that, when evaluating different architectures on supervised tasks, incorporation of data-driven priors via pretraining is essential for reliable performance estimation, and can be done efficiently.

### Confidence
3: You are fairly confident in your assessment. It is possible that you did not understand some parts of the submission or that you are unfamiliar with some pieces of related work. Math/other details were not carefully checked.

### Summary
The paper demonstrates that random initialization of model weights on long sequence benchmarks leads to severe underestimation in performance of transformer architectures. The results show that pre-training on the training data with autoregressive/masked prediction objectives results in much better initializations and final performance. With self pre-training the performance gap between state space models specifically designed for handling long sequences and traditional transformers is much smaller than shown in prior work. Moreover, the self pre-training improves the performance on state space models as well. Overall the paper points out an important baseline which should be adopted more broadly when evaluating different architectures for long sequence tasks.

### Strengths
* The paper does a fairly through evaluation of SPT and its impact on evaluation on various benchmarks. The evaluation clearly shows gaps in the current evaluation of different architectures on long sequence tasks. 
* In addition to providing guidance on evaluation practices the experiments also show the effectiveness of data driven initialization across both transformers and state space models. It is also interesting to see SPT to provide better initialization at smaller data scales for state space models. 
* The paper also demonstrates that simplified state space models can perform competitively to their complicated counterparts when initialized with SPT

### Weaknesses
 * The paper largely compares the different models on the effectiveness in terms of benchmark accuracy. It would be good to include commentary on SPT computational costs relative to initializations of state space models.

### Questions
* Figure 3, in the smallest data setting it seems like SPT does not provide monotonically increasing gains as the data size reduces. Is there guidance on what scale of data SPT ends up resulting in poor initializations that the ones used in state space models.

### Summary
This paper provides a suite of experiments to show that self pretraining (SPT), i.e., pretraining with denoising objectives on only downstream data, most often closes the performance gap between Transformers and state space models (SSMs) on the Long Range Arena benchmark. In the case of Transformers the performance gains from the incorporation of SPT range from 8 to 15% across tasks.

The experiments also show that in the case of SSMs, manually-designed biases become increasingly redundant when SPT is incorporated.

More generally, the results suggest the evaluation of different architectures on supervised tasks should incorporate SPT for reliable performance estimation.

### Strengths
**S1.** The presentation of the main ideas, related work and experimental results is clear.

**S2.** The incorporation of SPT is efficient and extremely effective compared to only training from scratch.

**S3.** The experimental results are thorough and support the main claims in the paper.

### Weaknesses
 **W1.** There are no results on computing requirements for SPT and, e.g., how to best combine SPT with supervised fine-tuning.

 **W2.** The results on PathX-256 suggest SPT failed to close the gap in this case. This seems to warrant further investigation.

### Questions
**Q1.** What can be said about the results of Transformers and S4 on PathX-256?

 **Q2.** What is the point of the experiment with Pythia? For instance, what is the single Pythia row in Table 2 to be compared with?

### Summary
This paper studies the effectiveness of self-training (SPT) using its own downstream data with Transformer and state space models (in particular S4) for long-range sequence modeling. Specifically, the studies include the impact of SPT on Transformer, S4, and Diagonal Linear RNNs for long-range sequences. Also, the effect of SPT across data size and data-driven vs HiPPO kernel initialization are analyzed. The experiments show that SPT overall improves the performance on Long Range Arena benchmarks, speech commands, CIFAR, and some regression tasks.

### Strengths
- The paper is clearly written. 
- The experimental setup sounds and the results are informative.
- The analysis of conv. kernels learned via SPT compared to the HiPPO kernels is novel and interesting.

### Weaknesses
 - Most experiments are performed on Long Range Arena which is relatively small or synthetic. 

- The main self-pretraining results (Tables 1 and 2) are not with the latest Transformers and SSMs. 

- Some experimental analysis is lacking. See my questions below.

### Questions
- Self-training may be effective not only across the data scale but also the model size. Have you tried the same experiments with different model sizes? It would be interesting to see the phenomenon.

- It looks like the hybrid models like SPADE and MEGA outperform other models including transformer+SPT and S4+SPT for many Long Range Arena tasks. Would SPADE+SPT or MEGA+SPT further improve the performance? Is there a reason this comparison is not included in the paper?

- Regarding the experiment about pretraining on text corpora: I appreciate the idea of comparing results with a pretrained model on a large language dataset. However, the current results are meaningless since the downstream task datasets are very different from Pythia 70M. I'm not sure we are able to find the right dataset to cover all the tasks for Long Range Arena. What about separating this experiment from Long Range Arena and showing the comparison for another downstream task on the language domain?

- Are S4/Transformers trained with the same number of epochs as S4+SPT/Transformers+SPT (including pretraining+finetuning)? If it's not, these results should be added. I'm asking to make sure the single-trained models are not undertrained.

### Summary
This work questions the common procedure of testing sequence model architectures by directly training on downstream supervised tasks (e.g. the LRA benchmark). They propose to pretrain models on the downstream task data (self pretaining or SPT) before fine-tuning on the task. This significantly closes the gap between many sequence models on long-range sequence tasks. The work also investigates the importance of manually designed biases to help methods capture long-range dependencies and finds that SPT makes these biases less important.

### Strengths
- Benchmarks such as Long Range Arena (LRA) are constantly used for new sequence modeling architectures. Questioning some of the assumptions and usefulness of benchmarks such as this is a fresh and interesting direction.

- Most of the experimental results are strong and convincing. The proposed SPT really does seem to improve the performance of methods such as Transformers previously considered to be unable to solve LRA. This is compelling since SPT is more in line with how large models are often trained.

- The investigations of explicit priors and effects across data scales are also interesting angles to explore.

### Weaknesses
 - The paper does not seem to take the cost of SPT vs training directly on the downstream task into account, or at least does not make this axis of comparison clear.
  - The details are unclear in how much time is spent pretraining vs fine-tuning with the SPT procedure and how this compares to the typical training method for these tasks. These points should be discussed clearly in the main paper.
  - It is stated in Section 3.2 that sub-par LRA performance is often cited as a prime motivating factor for new methods, but it seems efficiency is often just as important a reason new methods are proposed
  - If one method can be directly trained on the task, while another has to first be pretrained and then fine-tuned, one would need to compare the cost/time/compute/etc to achieve a certain performance to determine if one method is superior, at least in many settings (note this point is less relevant in large scale language and vision settings where pretraining is the norm).
  - Further exploration and clarification on these points would improve the paper.

- Even when trained with SPT, it seems from the results that methods such as S4 with structured biases consistently outperform methods with less structured biases across almost every task (I believe Text and Retrieval in Table 2 are the only exceptions to this). The reviewer agrees these differences are not as drastic as it seems when using the traditional procedure, but it still seems the structured biases are helping and the traditional procedure is somewhat predictive of the ordering. Or is this just an artifact of the experiments? A potential discussion on this point could be useful.

- Table 1 lists many efficient attention methods that were originally evaluated on LRA. It would have been interesting to see a couple of these methods also trained with SPT to confirm empirically that they also do not perform as poorly when using SPT. (I suspect this is the case, but currently have to guess since no result is provided).

- The tasks considered in this paper are standard, but nonetheless the addition of less synthetic or larger scale tasks and experiments would also make the paper more compelling to a broader audience

- No code appears to be included (it seems it will be made available based on the anonymized link, but would have been nice to explore during the review).

### Questions
1. Could you clarify the pretraining vs fine-tuning procedure and how much time is spent on both for each method? Please let me know if I have missed this in the main paper. Appendix B.1 says models were trained for 200 epochs or 24 h "for pretraining and fine-tuning", but it is unclear if this means 200 epochs of pretraining and 200 epochs of fine-tuning? If so this would seem to be much more time/epochs than some of the baseline methods were trained.

2. In Table 2, was the Transformer + Rotary embeddings trained without SPT? This seems unlikely. Perhaps there is a typo in the description of the Transformer methods in this table?

3. In Table 2, the X "denotes computationally infeasible or unreported results". These are 2 drastically different things and 2 separate symbols should probably be used.

4. The methods evaluated for Figure 2 still seem to use complex valued parameterizations even though they are randomly initialized. Is this still necessary when using SPT? Since complex values can be problematic when scaling large scale systems, it would be interesting if SPT also removed the need for this in SSMs/linear RNNs.
