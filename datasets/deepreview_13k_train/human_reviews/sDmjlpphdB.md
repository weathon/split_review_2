# Mixture-of-Experts in Prompt Optimization

- Decision: Reject
- Scores: 6, 5, 3, 5

## Abstract
Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit strong generalization power in adapting to novel tasks when prompted with language instructions and in-context demos. Since this ability sensitively depends on the quality of prompts, various methods have been explored to automate the instruction design process. While these methods demonstrated promising results, they also restricted the output space of the search problem to a demo-free instruction. Such simplification significantly limits their performance, as a single demo-free instruction might not be able to cover the entire problem space of the targeted task due to its complexity. To alleviate this issue, we adopt the Mixture-of-Expert paradigm to divide the problem space into homogeneous regions, each governed by a specialized expert. To further improve the coverage of each expert, we expand their prompts to contain both an instruction and several demos.  A two-phase process is developed to construct the specialized expert for each region: (1) demo assignment: Inspired by the theoretical connection between in-context learning and kernel regression, we group demos into clusters based on their semantic similarity and assign a cluster to each expert; (2) instruction assignment: A region-based joint search is applied to optimize an instruction complementary to the demo cluster for each expert, yielding a synergistic effect. The resulting method, codenamed Mixture-of-Prompts (MoP), outperforms prior art by up to 43% on benchmark NLP tasks.

### Summary
This paper focuses on prompt optimization for applying LLM on downstream task with (input, output) samples. The authors propose a method called Mixture-of-Prompt (MoP) as a novel approach to obtain optimized prompts. In details, the method first clusters the downstream samples (demos) using K-Means-Auto and then performs region-based joint search to determine the prompt for each cluster. During inference, a new downstream example will first be routed into one of the learned cluster and then use the cluster's optimized prompt. Experimental results on APE show the advantage of this method. Analysis on cluster numbers, region-based joint search, the 
heterogeneity between clusters as well as other perspectives are conducted.

### Strengths
1. The motivation is interesting and reasonable. Typically for a downstream task, a fixed task instruction sentence may not be optimal to LLM for every sample of this task. In most cases, a downstream task dataset can also be subdivided into subtasks requiring various instructions. From these perspective, applying a mixed-of-prompt strategy is natural.
2. The method is clear and easy to follow. A two-phased approach is proposed and each phase is relatively easy to implement.
3. The authors have provided sufficient analysis both qualitatively and quantitatively. Case study on APE subtasks is also provided, providing more clearer information on the differences between the clustered experts.

### Weaknesses
1. I think more benchmarks in addition to APE should be considered, especially some datasets derived from real-scene user logs (like ShareGPT), which will demonstrate the application value of MoP better. The current evaluation is limited to discriminative tasks, and it is unclear how the method would perform on generative tasks where the input and output are less structured. Specifically, datasets that involve more complex reasoning or creative generation would provide a more robust evaluation.
2. More results on embedding modules other than GPT, as well as including other baselines will be much better. The reliance on GPT-based embeddings raises questions about the method's generalizability to other embedding spaces. The lack of comparison with other prompt optimization techniques also makes it difficult to assess the relative performance of the proposed method.

### Questions
1. I am curious on what prompt groups will the MoP obtain on math (especially some hard and complex math tasks) and code related tasks. If some evidence can be provided, this will be very good.
2. In many cases, it is not very easy for a task to split the task instruction and the input independently. How to make MoP work in such cases?

### Summary
The choice of prompt has been shown to be critical for the performance of Large Language Models. Therefore, many recent works have explored how to improve prompting strategies, one of them being prompt optimization. However, this suffers from two problems: first, the optimized prompt only contains an instruction, not demos (few-shot examples), and second, one prompt might not be the best for an entire dataset. This paper proposes a mixture-of-experts prompt optimization strategy to solve these two problems. First, the set of all demos is clustered in embedding space. These clusters, which tend to be semantically meaningful, are then each used to produce an optimized prompt. Then at inference, a sample is associated with a cluster (by measuring distance to centroids in embedding space) and is prompted using the cluster's instruction and demos. The advantage of this strategy is that it utilizes demos, and the instruction in the prompt can include local information that is relevant to its cluster but not necessarily to the rest of the dataset. That is, the proposed instruction per cluster is dependent on the demos belonging to that cluster, so the two components of the prompt complement each other. The paper measures this approach on NLP tasks and finds that it can outperform APE significantly (which samples the demos to create one instruction-only prompt for the entire dataset).

### Strengths
Originality:
- While ideas around using multiple prompts exist such as PromptBoosting [1], the MOE format of prompt optimization has not been studied to my knowledge. It would be interesting to extend this work into a soft MOE where outputs when using different prompts are aggregated in a weighted fashion (I guess going from discrete clustering slightly back to this kernel regression format), or to use multiple embeddings (something like [2] comes to mind) to produce different sets of candidate clusters.

Quality:
- Strong experiments with impressive gap over other prompt optimization approaches

Clarity:
- Notation and equations were easy to follow.

Significance:
- A clean algorithm for developing sets of specialized prompts. I think this approach can be useful in the future as long as tasks can be broken down into reasonably balanced sub-domains/topics.

### Weaknesses
Quality: 
- Based on the description in 4.4, I have trouble understanding how creating 20 instruction proposals and picking the top 4 instructions is equivalent to the objective in equation 9. This might just be a clarity issue though; are you actually only showing the prompt optimizer samples from a given cluster each time (this is what I would expect)? 4.4 makes it sound like you are generating cluster-agnostic instructions and choosing the top 4 based on average performance on the dataset, not on the cluster in particular.
- I had some concerns about the instructions made available in the Appendix. First, some of them are incoherent (like Expert 2/3 in Table 6), and some of them ask very different things, such as sentence_similarity expert 1/6 asking to create sentences, and expert 3/6 asking to rate sentences. Also, I expected that the main advantage of utilizing the cluster is for the optimized prompt to pick up on some cluster-specific information. For example in Table 4, 3 of the 8 experts have specifications being "journals, apparel, ..., computer science books". But expert 1/8's demos appear to be geographic, expert 3/8 is apparel, expert 7/8 is health/medicine. This goes against the intention that the instruction and demos should complement each other. That being said, these prompts might be a byproduct of the APE method not working well.
- Another shortcoming mentioned in the limitations is the lack of incorporating dependencies; each cluster is individually optimized (at least based on the algorithm description). I am curious if a boosting style approach could help with this, or if you can generate instructions for the kth cluster by conditioning on demos and instructions that do _not_ belong to that cluster (e.g., telling the prompt optimizer that the instruction should be different from these other ones).

Clarity: 
- In section 4, APE---both the tasks and the method---is not introduced the first time it is mentioned. I did not have any idea of what to expect of the evaluation tasks, since there was no pointer to a description of them besides an explanation of auto_categorization in 4.2 and an overview of them in 4.5, long after the APE tasks were introduced.
- It also was not clear what the APE method is, resulting in some confusion of "APE benchmarks" versus "prompts generated by APE".

### Questions
- Can you clarify the APE tasks, APE method, and how equation 9 is implemented?
- Why do the instructions not complement the demos for each expert?

### Summary
This paper proposed a demo assignment task and an instruction assignment task with MoE framework. By this means, they hope to enhance the prompt searching capability. Their experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of their method.

### Strengths
S1: I like their presentation and language writing, which is clear.
S2: they proposed two-step search algorithm, which leverages semantical similar- ity for demo assignment and routing function and region-based joint search for instruction assignment, achieves significant performance gains on the APE Benchmark.

### Weaknesses
W1: The idea of grouping training demos into homogeneous clusters, with each cluster corresponding to a specific expert, is disputable. This method actually assumes that all the potential demos or test queries can be all decomposed by these groups. This causes several problems: (1) how to make sure the given training demos are representative enough to cover all the cases? (2) how to make sure your clustering method is effective in making each cluster homogeneous? Specifically, clustering algorithms like K-means are sensitive to initialization and may converge to local optima, leading to suboptimal cluster assignments. The paper does not discuss the impact of different clustering algorithms or initialization strategies on the final performance. (3) how to make sure your generated groups are qualified to support better performance? The paper lacks a clear metric to evaluate the quality of the generated clusters beyond their impact on the final task performance. It is unclear if the clusters are semantically meaningful or if they are simply artifacts of the clustering algorithm. (4) If each group corresponds to one expert, how to set an optimal number of experts for different clustering methods? How to make sure these experts are representative enough, how to achieve the balance between expert number and efficiency? The paper uses K-Means-Auto, but it is not clear how this method determines the optimal number of clusters and how this choice affects the diversity and coverage of the experts.   

Here is a very simple solution to all the problems raised by W1: ignore/remove the clustering component, and treat all the demos as normal instances that can be represented by a K-dimensional latent space where each dimension corresponds to one expert. I would like to see the feedback from the authors.

W2: can I assume that the proposed INSTRUCTION ASSIGNMENT is just the combination of Independent Search and Joint Search? I thank the authors for their insights but it is too straightforward, and there exist more important problems that should be considered. For example, since each expert corresponds to one sub-instruction, there is a pressing need to make sure these instructions are heterogeneous. Achieving this goal is not easy, for example, maybe we should maximize KL divergence among pairs of sub-instructions. I didn’t find such effort in this paper.

W3: Overall, I thank the authors for their hard work in solving an interesting problem. But I am not surprised about their novelties.

### Questions
Q1: In Equation (3), if we let $C=1$, can I treat this equation as this: we use one region with the entire training demos to search a single instruction? So the insight of your Mixture-of-Expert for prompt optimization is: you think searching one single instruction is hard (no matter whether we have training demos), and you reduce the difficulties by splitting this problem into several sub-problems (searching the combination of multiple sub-instructions with demos)

If my understanding is correct, I think the following sentence in your paper is over-claimed: "a limitation of existing auto-prompting methods is that they solely focus on searching for an optimal demo-free instruction" (below equation 2). It seems that the above sentence should be replaced with something like: "a limitation of existing auto-prompting methods is that searching an optimal instruction is usually very hard"

Q2: W1

Q3: W3

### Summary
This paper proposes Mixture-of-Prompts (MoP) algorithm to automatically create a series of prompts to tailor the need of different test cases. MoP leverages the idea of Mixture-of-Expert paradigm to divide the problem space into homogeneous regions governed by different experts by constructing a specialized prompt for each region via demo assignment and instruction assignment. The paper conducts extensive experiments to study the effects of different searching algorithms and finds that Region-based Joint Search gives the best results. Empirical results and in-depth analysis demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

### Strengths
1. Applying the idea of divide-and-conquer in prompt design is interesting. Unlike some methods that require manual prompt engineering, the MoP algorithm proposed in this paper can be a very general framework and automates the prompt engineering process in a systematic way.
2. The experiments and analysis are extensive and well-designed. The analysis of different experts' performance justifies the motivation of this work and can offer insights to the community as currently, most of the works still use a unified prompt rather than taking the property of each test case into account.

### Weaknesses
1. Though the authors view this method as an instantiation of Mixture-of-Expert paradigm in prompt engineering, I think the idea is actually similar to the classic ensemble learning. Considering that the expert construction has two phases, i.e., demo assignment and instruction assignment, have you tried fixing one of the phase and using different algorithms to decide the other? In this way, we can still get different prompts, although they may not be considered as different experts. I'm curious about the results if we just ensemble the outputs of these different prompts.
2. Some parts of the paper are not clearly written. See my detailed questions below.

### Questions
1. In test time, do you run the test case using all the prompts or have a router to decide which prompt to use? For Mixture-of-Expert paradigm, router or routing algorithm is a crucial part. However, the paper doesn't discuss this part clearly. Also, from the optimization goal in Equation (3), it seems like a single test case needs to be run multiple times. If this is the case, I'm wondering if your proposed MoP method will have efficiency issue.
2. Where do the initial demonstration set and instruction set come from? I know this paper is largely based on APE but it's better to briefly discuss these important details to make the paper self-contained. "Since our Region-based Joint Search uses APE proposed
prompts as the candidate set, we save the results from APE runs and reuse them in RBJS to eliminate the randomness in prompt proposals." I would suggest defining RBJS first to make readers easier. Also, from this sentence, it seems like the initial instruction set does influence the performance, so it's better to explicitly mention this part and explain a bit.
3. About the theory part of this paper, how do you go from Equation (5) to Equation (6)?
4. The experiments are mostly conducted on tasks that have close-ended output. I'm wondering if the MoP algorithm can be applied to more open-ended tasks, such as long-form QA or creative writing.
