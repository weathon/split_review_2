# Incentivizing Data Collection from Heterogeneous Clients in Federated Learning

- Decision: Reject
- Scores: 5, 6, 5, 3

## Abstract
Federated learning (FL) provides a promising paradigm for facilitating collaboration between multiple clients that jointly learn a global model without directly sharing their local data. However, existing research suffers from two caveats: 1) From the perspective of decentralized agents, voluntary and unselfish participation is often assumed. But self-interested agents may opt out of the system or provide low-quality contributions without proper incentives; 2) From the mechanism designer's perspective, the aggregated models can be unsatisfactory as the existing game-theoretical federated learning approach for data collection ignores the potential heterogeneous effort caused by contributed data. 

To alleviate above challenges, we propose an incentive-aware framework for agent participation that considers data heterogeneity to accelerate the convergence process. Specifically, we first introduce the notion of Wasserstein distance to explicitly illustrate the heterogeneous effort and reformulate the existing upper bound of convergence. To induce truthful reporting from agents, we analyze and measure the generalization error gap of any two agents by leveraging the peer prediction mechanism to develop score functions. We further present a two-stage Stackelberg game model that formalizes the process and examines the existence of equilibrium. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed incentive mechanism.

3: You are fairly confident in your assessment. It is possible that you did not understand some parts of the submission or that you are unfamiliar with some pieces of related work. Math/other details were not carefully checked.

### Summary
The authors focus on decreasing data heterogeneity and training a better global model from the perspective of incentivizing data collection. The authors also propose a framework of the two-stage Stackelberg game to incentivize the data collection.

### Strengths
1.	This paper extends the convergence bound with the Wasserstein distance.
2.	The experiment results are convincing.

### Weaknesses
1. The model is not clear/justified what does the "effor" mean for agents? How can agents narrow down the non-iid degree of their own data simply by incurring more "effort"? I don't think such model of effort and non-iid level is reasonable and realistic.

2. The authors assume complete information, e.g., agents know the true central distribution, this is also not reasonable/justified.

3. Definition 5.1 is quite similar to Definition 6 in Blum et.al, 2021, but it is not cited when Definition 5.1 is proposed.

4. Not clear why Figure 3 indicates equilibrium.

### Summary
The paper proposes an incentive-aware framework to encourage the participation of clients with a view to using data heterogeneity measures to accelerate the convergence of the global model.
A key component of this framework is the use of wasserstein distance to quantify the degree of non-IIDness in the local training data of a client. In addition, the framework includes the design of reward functions that use the generalization error gap between two agents to induce more truthful reporting.
The paper combines all these ideas and presents it as a two-stage Stackelberg game, proving the existence of an equilibrium within this setting.

### Strengths
- The presentation of the concept, with detailed explanations of base terminology and notations, examples and relation to broader goals discussed throughout the paper is well thought out.
- A clear and unambiguous statement of the overall goal of the paper and effort detailing how it differs from existing approaches offers a clear picture with regard to the current status of the domain.

### Weaknesses
 - While there are a number of key assumptions made throughout the paper, an important one is "equilibrium shall prevail when the impact of unilateral deviations in an agent's effort level remain limited to their own utility." and an equilibrium solution may not exist if small changes affect other agent's utilities. Could the authors discuss whether adversarial behavior falls under this category of assumptions and how can the system potentially protect itself from such cases.
- A recent trend in federated learning involves the use of pre-trained weights, either from ImageNet pretraining or foundation models, to close the gap in performance between IID and non-IID scenarios. Given that such choices directly affect the prediction ability of agents, with each agent having a unique understanding of the dataset based on the training setup and choice of pre-trained model, could the authors comment on pre-trained weights suppressing the underlying heterogeneity of local data distributions and how this affects the proposed framework?
- Could the authors discuss how best to assess the degree of non-IIDness of an agent's local training data ($\delta_k$) without it being provided?

### Questions
For key questions, please refer to the weaknesses section.

EDIT: I appreciate the detailed responses provided by the authors. Taking into the consideration the new insights provided by the authors' feedback, I believe that the current manuscript serves as a good starting point in studying incentive mechanisms in FL. In addition, the current submission also highlights the need to bridge theoretical insights with the current SOTA FL methodologies.
Considering all these points together, I plan to maintain my original score.

### Summary
The paper proposes an FL framework that incentivizes clients to collect high-quality data. The framework is based on the principle of mechanism design, where the server designs a payoff function that takes as input the clients' "effort" level and returns a payoff to each individual client. The paper assumes that the cost of a client is some value proportional to the iid-ness of their local dataset (i.e. how similar it is to other clients' datasets). Under this condition, they propose using a payment function based on a client's performance relative to its peers. They derive theoretical results and and run experiments showing the utility of this payment function for various clients.

### Strengths
The paper is a novel way to view FL as a mechanism design problem between data and model providers.
The paper emphasizes the importance of having clients collect non-iid data for FL and highlights the cost of collecting this data.

### Weaknesses
The experimental results are very limited. The first two plots simply show that training on a limited set of labels is harmful. The other two plots show that utility is stable across rounds. 

Furthermore, it is not clear why stable utility across rounds indicates the strategies are at an equilibrium? In my view the variation across rounds does not seem relevant. The important part is in Figure 4 which shows the implicit cost-reward tradeoff from varying the client's iid-ness.

The FL setup itself is also limited in that it resamples data from the same shared pool. While this toy setup might provide the clearest results it is also quite unrealistic. If FL clients are the ones who are generating the data, then clients will usually have distinct examples.

The time-varying aspects of the paper are not clear. Do the clients adjust their dataset over the course of training?

### Questions
If we can account for the noise in client sampling to compute the payment (e.g. take an average over all other clients), would the utility curves (Fig. 3,4) be horizontal lines? 

It seems surprising that utility is stable across rounds, despite the fact that training is often noisy. Wouldn't this noise also be reflected in the relative performance between two client models?

### Summary
The paper studies how to incentivize the clients to contribute/share heterogeneous data in a federated learning setting. The authors consider the Wasserstein distance to formalize the data heterogeneity to derive a convergence bound, which is used to obtain a generalization gap between any two clients. Subsequently, the authors adopt the Stackelberg game to model the incentive process and derive a pure Nash equilibrium via the effort levels of the clients. Empirical results on the conventional FedAvg algorithm are provided.

### Strengths
- The paper studies a relevant and important problem in FL.

- The result for the pure Nash equilibrium (Theorem 5.2) provides a useful characterization of the properties of the utilities of the clients.

- The investigation of the constants (e.g., Lipshitz constant) in the results and assumptions is appreciated.

### Weaknesses
 - The writing can be improved, for details see the questions.

- Some assumptions can be justified and motivated better.

- The main result (Lemma 4.2) is an application of an existing result, and is a looser upper bound, making its theoretical contribution not so clear.

- There seems to lack a comparison with existing methods or simple baselines.

- The abstract mentions "decentralized agents", but the setting does not seem decentralized since there is a central learner.

- In introduction,
    > Hence the correct way to provide incentives for agents is to encourage agents to upload models that can capture the data heterogeneity.

    Is this made precise somehow?

- In introduction,
    >  Such a solution is necessary for designing incentive mechanisms in a practical FL system but currently missing from all existing work ...

    Precisely, how is the necessity of such incentive mechanisms demonstrated? For instance, is it shown that all existing works perform sub-optimally in some way?

- In introduction,
    > We are the first to prove that Wasserstein distance is an essential factor in the convergence bound of FL with heterogeneous data (Lemma 4.2)

    If my understanding is correct, the Wasserstein distance is used to derive a specific instantiation of an existing result, which already provides a way to formalize the heterogenity of data in FL. It is unclear why Wasserstein distance is essential.

- Is the Wasserstein distance formally recalled somewhere? Is the definition of $\delta_k$ the formal definition? If so, does it mean that it does not work for regression problems?

- In the definition of $\delta_k$, what is the support of $p^{(k)}, p^{(c)}$?

- After the definition of $\delta_k$,
    > p(c) indicates the reference (iid) data distribution in the centralized setting

    Why is there a centralized setting, and what is meant by iid data distribution? Furthermore, how to obtain $\delta_k$ in implementation?

- In Section 3.2,
    > Learner: seeking to train a classifier that endeavors to encourage agents to decrease the degree of non-iid. Thereby, attaining faster convergence at a reduced cost.

    What is meant by "decreasing the degree of non-iid"? Furthermore, precisely what is the cost in the "at a reduced cost"?

- What are $ g_t, \bar{g}_t, f^* $ in Lemma 4.1?

- In Lemma 4.2, what is the $L_{x|y=i}$-Lipschitz function Lipschitz w.r.t.~?

- The learner is assumed to have access to $\mathcal{D}_c$, what are its properties and how can this assumption be satisfied?

- What exactly is $\text{Bound}(e)$?

- What is the "Ninety-ninety rule"?

- In Theorem 5.1, the partial derivative of $f$ is taken. Does it mean you require the assumption that function $f$ is differentiable? If so, what are the (practical) motivations for this assumption?

- In Definition 5.1, how are the constants $d_k^1, d_k^2$ set or determined, and how are $d_k^1, d_k^2$ related for a fixed $k$?


- Why (only) Nash equilibrium in a Stackelberg game? Can something be said about the behavior of the learner (i.e., leader in the Stackelberg game) to consider the Stackelberg equilibrium?

- In experiments under "Parameter analysis",
    > Recall that we set the learning rate $\eta = 0.01$.
    
    Is it for all experiments?

- How should Figure 3 be interpreted? In particular,
    > the utilities of two randomly selected agents remain stable, which indicates an equilibrium.

    Which are the two agents? and the fluctuations (which the authors attribute to the random selection of the agents) make it difficult to see the equilibrium.
