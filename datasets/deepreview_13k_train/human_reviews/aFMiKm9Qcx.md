# The Central Spanning Tree Problem

- Decision: Reject
- Scores: 6, 5, 3, 5

## Abstract
Spanning trees are an important primitive in many data analysis tasks, when a data set needs to be summarized in terms of its ``skeleton'', or when a tree-shaped graph over all observations is required for downstream processing. Popular definitions of spanning trees include the minimum spanning tree and the optimum distance spanning tree, a.k.a.~the minimum routing cost tree. When searching for the shortest spanning tree but admitting additional branching points, even shorter spanning trees can be realized: Steiner trees. Unfortunately, both minimum spanning and Steiner trees are not robust with respect to noise in the observations; that is, small perturbations of the original data set often lead to drastic changes in the associated spanning trees. In response, we make two contributions when the data lies in a Euclidean space: on the theoretical side, we introduce a new optimization problem, the ``(branched) central spanning tree'', which subsumes all previously mentioned definitions as special cases. On the practical side, we show empirically that the (branched) central spanning tree is more robust to noise in the data, and as such is better suited to summarize a data set in terms of its skeleton. We also propose a heuristic to address the NP-hard optimization problem, and illustrate its use on single cell RNA expression data from biology and 3D point clouds of plants.

3: You are fairly confident in your assessment. It is possible that you did not understand some parts of the submission or that you are unfamiliar with some pieces of related work. Math/other details were not carefully checked.

### Summary
The submission at hand proposes a novel notion of spanning trees - called central spanning trees - that interpolate between concisely representing the structure of shortest connections between a set of data points in a Euclidean space and being robust to slight pertubations of these points. This comes in the form of a parameterized framework where one weights the cost of an edge in the spanning tree according to its centrality in the spanning tree. The parameter (alpha) determines how strong this weighting is.
The motivating aspect that central spanning trees are more robust than spanning trees is supported by an empirical analysis.
For alpha=0 the problem coincides with the minimum spanning tree and for alpha=1 the problem coincides with the minimum routing cost tree.
For all alpha > 0 determining the minimum cost of a central spanning tree is NP-hard and hence the manuscript also includes a heuristic for it.
All these contributions are also extended to the setting in which non-terminal points are allowed in the tree (leading to analogues of the Steiner tree problem).

### Strengths
I believe this contribution is a decent topical fit for ICLR. The suggested notion of central spanning trees is very natural and interesting, also from a theoretic standpoint.
Overall the presentation of the results is good (with the exception of me not completely understanding the setup of the experiments in 2.1).

### Weaknesses
In my opinion, the benefit of considering CST over MRST is not sufficiently motivated in the current manuscript.
Also, the quality of the heuristic seems to only be considered for alpha=1 on large instances. I can understand why, but it is still a weakness of the evaluation of the heuristic.

A minor error on the level of a typo is that on page 2, 0 should not be included in the range of alpha for which concavity is claimed.

### Questions
Have you also thought about extending central spanning trees to more general graphs (not complete Euclidean metric ones)?

What exactly is the setup for Section 2.1? How many random instances do you start with and then perturb?

### Summary
In this paper, the authors propose a parameterized family of spanning tree, which encompasses the minimum spanning, the Steiner and minimum routing cost trees as limiting case. Moreover, they propose a heuristic algorithm to compute the corresponding trees. At last, they conduct experiments to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms.

### Strengths
S1. New family of spanning trees are proposed.
S2. New algorithms are proposed to compute the corresponding trees.
S2. Experiments are conducted to evaluate the proposed algorithms.

### Weaknesses
W1. The motivation of the proposed tree is not strong. The paper argues that small perturbations of the original data set often lead to drastic changes in the existing spanning trees, but the scenarios where this robustness really matters are not provided. The necessity of a new family of trees seems unconvincing, especially given the increased computational complexity. The paper needs to articulate specific use cases where the trade-off between robustness and computational cost is justified.

W2. Only one real example regarding the superiority of the proposed model is provided. The single cell gene expression example does not clearly demonstrate the advantages of the proposed approach. The example does not show trajectory bifurcation, and the comparison with mST is not compelling. The paper needs to provide more diverse and convincing empirical evidence to support the claims of robustness and utility.

W3. The efficiency of the proposed algorithms are not well evaluated. While the paper acknowledges that mST can be computed efficiently, it does not provide a thorough comparison of the computational cost of the proposed algorithms. Given the increased complexity of the proposed model, it is crucial to demonstrate that the algorithms are practically feasible, especially for large-scale datasets. The paper should include a detailed analysis of the time complexity and scalability of the proposed algorithms.

### Questions
Q1. The motivation to proposed a new tree seem weak. The paper argue that small perturbations of the original data set  often lead to drastic changes in the existing spanning trees, but the scenarios that the robustness really matters are not provided. The necessity of a new family of trees seems unconvincing.

Q2. In Section 2, a single cell gene expression measurement example is provided. However, it seems that CST also cannot detect the trajectory bifurcation. Moreover, as mST cannot detect the trajectory bifurcation even on the original data, the example seems hard to support the superiority of proposed model regarding the robustness. 


Q3. The efficiency of the proposed algorithms are not well evaluated in the experiments. As mST can be computed efficiently in practice, it is unfair to propose a more complex tree model without considering the efficiency. It is better if the efficiency of the proposed algorithm could be compared with existing algorithms.


Q4. Is there any theoretical guarantee regarding the returned results of the heuristic algorithms proposed in section 4?

### Summary
The problem under consideration in the present paper is the estimation of the underlying tree structure of a point cloud. To this end, a new model, called central spanning tree, is developed and investigated. It is defined as the solution of an optimization problem involving combinatorial and geometric aspects.

Parameterized by $\alpha$ between $0$ and $1$, central spanning tree interpolates models from the literature, in particular the minimum spanning tree ($\alpha=0$). The main interest of this new model is that its robustness to noise increases with $\alpha$, making it more robust than minimum spanning tree.

A heuristic is proposed to solve the optimization problem of interest, which turns out to be NP-hard. Numerical simulations support the claims of the paper on robustness of the model and accuracy of the estimation algorithm.

### Strengths
This article proposes a new method for extracting the tree structure of a point cloud, with emphasis on robustness to noise, which is a major challenge in real applications.

The paper focuses on the theoretical and numerical properties of the model, on both synthetic and real data, and proposes a heuristic for solving the optimization problem at stake.

### Weaknesses
The main weakness of this article is its presentation. From my point of view, it is not in the right format for a conference like ICLR. The main paper refers extensively to the appendices, which are 30 pages long. Some parts of the main paper are difficult to read without calling up the long version, particularly the optimization algorithm (section 4). Mention should also be made of the link with the minimum concave cost network flow problem, which helps to show that the problem is NP-hard: some elements are given in the main body, but the link can only be understood by carefully reading the appendix.

The main advantage of the proposed model is its robustness to noise. However, it is only compared with the minimum spanning tree (and the Steiner tree in the case where nodes can be added), which is known not to be robust to noise. However, competing algorithms are mentioned: some are even used as benchmarks to measure the accuracy of the heuristic. The paper's main motivation (robustness) should be more thoroughly documented.

On the same aspect, it would be relevant for the authors to cite and compare with the following papers:
> Kasperski and Zielinski (TCS, 2010). On the approximability of robust spanning tree problems.

> Bezrukov et al. (LNCS, 1996). On central spanning trees of a graph.

The parameter $\alpha$ serves as a trade-off between noise robustness and data fidelity, but how do the authors choose it? For example, why was $\alpha=0.8$ chosen for the simulations in Figure 2? The model may lose some of its interest if practitioners do not know how to select $\alpha$ in their applications.

If I understand the definition of Steiner points correctly (page 3), the data are only used for the terminal nodes of the tree, while all the internal nodes are added (they are not part of the data) and their position is to be optimized. Is this really the case? If it is, I have two questions:

(i) First, is optimization problem (2) well formulated (compared to equation (1))?

(ii) Then, is this model really relevant to extract the tree structure of a point cloud?

I think this point should be better discussed throughout the paper.

Why do the authors exclude $\alpha>1$ from their investigations? Did they study the complexity of the optimization problem (which is proved to be NP-hard only for $0<\alpha\leq 1$) in this case?

Why do the authors do not consider the central spanning tree (but only the branched version) in the application to 3D plant skeletonization?

page 2: Is it obvious that the model turns into the minimum routing cost tree for $\alpha=1$?

page 6: Why does the optimization problem (2) is not everywhere differentiable?

I can understand the theoretical interest behind the study of branching angles and degree of Steiner points, but what is the link with the rest of the paper? Could this be of any use in addressing the paper's main questions?

### Summary
This paper proposes new classes of spanning trees named central spanning tree (CST) and branched central spanning tree (BCST) problems. CSTs can be considered as a continuous interpolation (with parameter $\alpha$) of well-known minimum spanning trees (mST) ($\alpha=0$) and the traditional minimum routing cost trees (MRCT) ($\alpha=1$) where the sum of distances of all vertex pairs are minimized. BCST is the same as CST except that an additional branching point called Steiner point (SP) can be introduced, and it can be considered as a generalization of Steiner tree problem. This paper empirically reveals the robustness of CSTs against noise in graph data and theoretically investigates the possible topologies for BCSTs. Also, this paper proposes a heuristic algorithm for CST and BCST problem and empirically validated the optimality.

### Strengths
Conventionally, the mST problem and the MRCT problem have been considered completely separately, to the extent I know. This paper connects these two spanning tree problems by considering an interpolation, which itself is a theoretically interesting work. Moreover, the structure and topology of CSTs and BCSTs are well investigated.

### Weaknesses
The introduced problems, CST and BCST problems, are currently less meaningful in both theoretical or practical senses than the existing problems. To introduce a new problem, it is desired that at least one of the following points are realized:

(I) The newly introduced problem has a strength or offers a trade-off compared to the existing problems.
(II) The newly introduced problem introduces a new better solution/insight on the existing problems.

Regarding (I), it is empirically confirmed that the CST is robust against data perturbations, but the MRCT is also robust against data noise. So, I expected that the CST problem can be solved more easily than the MRCT problem. However, judging from the content, this is not the case: the CST is NP-hard for $\alpha>0$ (Appendix C), and the performance of the proposed heuristics (mSTreg) has no clear correspondence to the $\alpha$ value (Appendix N), meaning that the MRCT problem can be solved to the same extent as the CST/BCST problem. Therefore, I have found no significant advantage of the proposed CST/BCST problems over MRCT problem.

Regarding (II), the heuristics for solving CST/MRCT problems is proposed (mSTreg) and it is applied to the existing problems, Steiner tree problem and MRCT problem. However, for Steiner tree problem, only instances such that the optimal solution is known are used as benchmarks. For MRCT problem, the proposed mSTreg falls short of the existing algorithm GRASP_PR. Although the authors claim that GRASP_PR is time-consuming because of heavy local search and it can be improved by using mSTreg for preprocessing, it is not verified through experiments. Therefore, currently the proposed heuristics, mSTreg, beats the existing methods only for the newly proposed CST/BCST problems.

Minor comment:
Regarding the final point, the computational time is also a key factor for the performance analysis of heuristic algorithms. I have read the per-iteration complexity and the time-measuring experiment in Appendix K, but I think at least a statement for computational time should be described on the main part of the problem. To the extent I understand, the per-iteration complexity is fairly small for graphs with 100 vertices and thus the proposed method runs much faster for the graphs used in the evaluation (Section 4.3). If the consumed time for the evaluation in Section 4.3 can be obtained and can be compared with the existing methods, they should be clearly stated.

### Questions
1. Please see "Minor comment" on "Weaknesses".
2. If my understanding on "Minor comment" is correct and the proposed heuristics runs much faster, is there any improvement on the solution quality output by mSTreg by modifying the stopping criterion or increasing the number of iterations?
