# The Uncertainty-Perception Tradeoff

- Decision: Reject
- Scores: 8, 3, 5, 6

## Abstract
Generative models have achieved groundbreaking performance in restoration tasks and inverse problems, producing results that are often indistinguishable from real data. Yet these models are also known to produce hallucinations, or artifacts that are not present in the original input, raising concerns about the uncertainty of the models' predictions. In this paper we study this phenomenon, employing information-theory tools to reveal a fundamental tradeoff between perception and uncertainty. Our mathematical analysis shows that as perceptual quality increases, so does the uncertainty of a restoration algorithm as quantified by error entropy. We derive and illustrate the behavior of the uncertainty-perception function, showcasing both local and global bounds that define the the feasible region of the tradeoff. Furthermore, we revisit a well-known relation between estimation distortion and uncertainty and generalize its scope to include perception quality, thereby shedding new light on the well-established perception-distortion tradeoff. Our work offers a principled analysis of uncertainty, highlighting its interplay with perception and the limitations of generative models in restoration tasks.

### Summary
This work presents a generalization of the distortion-perception tradeoff. The (previously reported) distortion-perception tradeoff itself is an extension of the classical distortion-rate curve (or tradeoff) in signal reconstruction by considering the preservation of the signal PDF. It turns out that (surprisingly) better preservation of the PDF raises the distortion-rate curve. As perceptual quality is somehow related to PDF preservation, divergence between the PDFs of the original and reconstructed signal is called "perceptual deviation". The distortion-"perception" tradeoff is actually a distortion-divergence tradeoff.

In this work, the authors extend the distortion-perception tradeoff by changing the distortion term. As opposed to the expected value of a distance between original and reconstructed signals, the authors propose to measure distortion through the entropy of the reconstruction error. They propose to measure distortion through uncertainty (or variability) as opposed to distance. In this way they define the uncertainty function U(P), that depends on P (Perception = divergence between PDFs); as opposed to the (previosuly used) distortion function D(P). The authors prove the properties of the U(P) function and show that D(P)>= U(P).

### Strengths
* Well written: a pleasure to read!.

* Extends a previous interesting concept, and the new results are consistent with previous reports. Effects of signal estimation on (1) the deviation of the estimate from the original sample and on (2) the deviation of the estimated PDF from the original PDF, are interesting points for the ICLR community (because of its implications in inference, generative models...), and this work further digs into these issues.

* The properties of the new tradeoff are analytically proved, so results are solid. While the main concept (the joint consideration of both deviations 1 and 2) was introduced in a previous work, it is interesting to keep on pointing out the surprising relation between the two deviations and this (technically sound) work presents analytical properties of an information theoretic extension of the distortion concept in the distortion-perception framework.

### Weaknesses
 * Introduction is confusing for those not familiar with the "perceptual quality" concept (divergence between PDFs) introduced in [Blau & Michaeli 18].

* Perceptual distances between samples (the regular perceptual quality concept) have been related to the signal PDFs as well.

* Experimental illustration of super resolution is limited: no visual examples are given. Note that the "perceptual quality" concept defined from divergence is an abstraction. Actual assessment of the perceptual quality should be done through visual inspection, but no visual examples are given. 

* Numerical evaluation is prone to error because entropy and divergence values are based on estimations from samples in high-dimensional scenarios. This should be acknowledged.

MAJOR ISSUES

* The introduction should include a citation to the "perceptual quality" concept defined from divergence between PDFs as done in [Blau & Michaeli 18, 19] because if not, the key question "Can one design an AI model of high perceptual quality which exhibits low uncertainty" is unclear or vague. 

* In the same vein, the "related work" section should include a paragraph on "Perceptual quality quantification". This section should link the Blau&Michaeli definition with "no-reference distance" definitions based on the similarity between PDFs (e.g. citations to [32-34] and associated reasoning in [Blau & Michaeli 18]). 
However, note that this divergence concept is related to the usefulness of summary statistics to capture the nature of textures, as in [Portilla&Simoncelli IJCV 2000], in more recent style transfer algorithms based on difference of Gram matrices in VGG-like nets [Gatys et al. CVPR 2016]) or in state-of-the-art perceptual distortion metrics such as DISTS [Ding et al. IEEE PAMI 2020]. Also worth citing in that paragraph is the recent work relating perceptual distances and PDFs [Hepburn et al. ICLR 2022], which makes interesting points on the difference between individual distances between samples and averages over ensembles. In particular [Hepburn et al. ICLR 2022] shows that perceptual distances capture relevant information on the image PDF.

* Please discuss if the proposed uncertainty-perception concept could be extended to rate-distortion?  R(U,P) similarly to R(D,P) in [Blau & Michaeli 19].

* The experiments depend on estimations of entropy and divergence between PDFs from samples of 243 dimensions. These estimations are risky and prone to high bias. How many samples did you used? Have you checked other estimators appart from Kozachenko-Leonenko?. Ready-to-use alternatives include (1) an improved Kozachenko-Leonenko estimator [Marin-Franch & Foster IEEE PAMI 2013] available here https://github.com/imarinfr/klo , or (2) a Gaussianization-based algorithm which has proved to be better [Laparra et al. IEEE TNN 2011], see the comparisons in [Malo J. Math. Neurosci. 2020], or in [Laparra et al. 2023 https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.03807], available here https://isp.uv.es/RBIG4IT.htm    https://github.com/IPL-UV/rbig
I suggest to repeat Fig. 4 and 5 with other estimators to have stronger evidences of the trend.

* Please include a visual example for several points of Fig. 4. At least in the appendix if it doesnt fit in the main text. Remember that beyond conceptual definitions of "Perceptual quality", in this regard, nothing substitutes visual inspection of representative examples.
In these examples please report the uncertainty (entropy of error) but also the MSE. 

MINOR ISSUES

* Why in fig 5 we have less points than in fig. 4?

* The third paragraph in page 2 has a repeated sentence "Conformal methods..."

* Last sentence of the fourth paragraph of page 2 is confusing (particularly as "perceptual quality" as in Blau&Michaeli had not been defined). Currently it says "While the above studies address both uncertainty and perception, none of them explicitly quantify
uncertainty as a function of perceptual quality"... Please clarify in which way the above studies talk about "perception" and how your work is different. Is it because this one uses the divergence definition?. Probably it will be easier to clarify this if the suggested paragraph on "Perceptual Quality Quantification" is added before this comment.

* What is n in the exponent of Lemma 1? is it dimension d?

* [Blau & Michaeli 18a] and [Blau & Michaeli 18b] are the same?

### Summary
This paper presents a rigorous theoretical analysis of the tradeoff between uncertainty and perceptual quality in generative models for ill-posed inverse problems like image restoration. Leveraging information theory tools, the authors introduce an uncertainty-perception (UP) function that captures the minimal uncertainty for a given level of perceptual quality. They prove several valuable properties of this function, establishing its quasi-linearity and bounding behavior. By adopting Renyi divergence as the perceptual measure, they further derive analytical bounds confining the UP function, giving rise to an insightful uncertainty-perception plane. This geometric construction categorizes estimators into impossible, optimal and suboptimal regions. The analysis reveals a dependence on dimensionality, with the tradeoff becoming more severe for higher dimensions. Finally, the authors connect uncertainty to MSE distortion, offering a novel perspective on the classic distortion-perception tradeoff. Experiments on super-resolution methods validate the tradeoff in practice.

### Strengths
•	Provides novel theoretical framework to analyze uncertainty-perception tradeoff based on information theory principles.
•	Establishes and proves existence of inevitable tradeoff through rigorous analysis.
•	Derives insightful analytic bounds confining UP function to convex envelopes.
•	Uncertainty-perception plane offers intuitive visualization and practical utility for assessing estimators.
•	Connects uncertainty to distortion, offering new view on classic distortion-perception tradeoff.

### Weaknesses
•	Assumptions like unbiasedness and Markov chain may limit applicability in some cases.
•	More analysis for other divergence measures besides Renyi could strengthen claims.
•	Additional validation on diverse restoration tasks needed to fully support general claims.

### Questions
•	Does the proposed strategy work only for image super-resolution? Could it work for other models and tasks?
•	Can the theory guide development of new algorithms to achieve better uncertainty-perception tradeoffs?

2: You are willing to defend your assessment, but it is quite likely that you did not understand the central parts of the submission or that you are unfamiliar with some pieces of related work. Math/other details were not carefully checked.

### Summary
The paper investigates the tradeoff between perception and uncertainty in generative models used for restoration tasks. Specifically, authors employ information-theory tools to analyze this tradeoff and show that as the perceptual quality of a restoration algorithm increases, so does the uncertainty, as quantified by error entropy.

### Strengths
I would like to acknowledge that I am not familiar with the specific field to which this manuscript belongs. Therefore, the following assessment is based solely on my subjective perception of the paper.
The strength of this paper lies in its rigorous mathematical analysis of the tradeoff between perception and uncertainty in generative models for restoration tasks. By employing information-theory tools, the authors provide a principled analysis of uncertainty and its interplay with perception.

### Weaknesses
One potential weakness of this paper is the lack of empirical evaluation or experimental validation of the proposed analysis and tradeoff. I think the experiments in this article are not sufficient. Moreover, the results in Figure 4 do not effectively support the findings described in the text ‘methods that achieve low perceptual quality exhibit low uncertainty, while algorithms with superior perceptual quality result in high uncertainty values’, and the correlation between the two is not as strong as suggested.
To summarize, even though the paper provides a rigorous mathematical analysis of the tradeoff between perception and uncertainty, it seems that the paper lacks empirical evaluation or comparison with existing approaches, limiting the assessment of the practical implications of the analysis. Therefore, it feels like taking a few more steps of revision can be beneficial for the paper for improving its quality.

### Summary
This paper introduces a new theoretical framework that captures the fundamental trade-off between perceptual reconstruction quality and estimator uncertainty in inverse problems. They show that as perceptual quality increases, the uncertainty of the estimator increases in tandem in the proposed information-theoretical formulation.They derive a feasible region in the trade-off plane that can be achieved by estimators, providing a potential venue to identify areas of improvement in existing reconstruction techniques. Some numerical experiments are provided on image data that demonstrates the trade-off.

### Strengths
- To the best of my knowledge, the proposed framework is novel in deriving the trade-off between perceptual quality and distortion metrics in inverse problems. The proxies to describe perceptual quality and estimator uncertainty are sensible. The direct tie to the perception-distortion trade-off is interesting.
- The paper is clearly written and fairly easy to follow. 
- The investigated problem is crucial in better understanding the behavior and limitations of state-of-the-art image reconstruction methods that are able to produce exceedingly realistic images without providing clear ideas about the reliability of such results. Thus, the work is well-motivated and has a potential for improving our understanding of this fundamental trade-off.

### Weaknesses
 - In my opinion, demonstrating how the framework can be used in practical settings is seriously lacking, somwehat undermining the potential impact and significance of the work. The authors claim that the introduced framework can be used to 1) assess estimator performance and 2) identify areas of improvement for image reconstruction techniques. Even though Figures 4 and 5 demonstrate that the framework gives sensible results that correspond to what we would expect from the theorems (higher perceptual quality results in higher uncertainty and higher distortion), it is not clear to me how much we can gain from this. In particular, I believe if we simply plotted LPIPS vs PSNR on various datasets for these techniques, we would see the same trend. That being said, the key contribution of the framework could be answering questions such as "How much can we improve the perceptual quality/distortion of this network based on our model of the trade-off?". Authors mention this direction repeatedly in the paper, but there are no experiments or further discussion supporting this. For instance, can we determine where a certain reconstruction technique lies in the uncertainty-perception plane and use that to derive useful clues what type of imrpovement we can still expect from our estimator? I believe that focusing on answering these questions on practical reconstruction techniques would very significantly increase the significance of the paper.
- The paper has multiple typos and there is a repeated sentence in Section 2, please check.

### Questions
- With respect to 1) in Weaknesses: Can the proposed framework reveal any insights about estimator performance that would not be possible by simply evaluating perceptual quality and distortion metrics?
- With respect to 2) in Weaknesses: How can the proposed framework be used to identify areas of improvement concretely in practice?
