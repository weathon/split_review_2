# End-Effector-Elbow: A New Action Space for Robot Learning

- Decision: Reject
- Scores: 3, 8, 3, 6

## Abstract
Joint control and end-effector control are the two most dominant control methods for robot arms within the robot learning literature. Joint control, while precise, often suffers from inefficient training; end-effector control boasts data-efficient training but sacrifices the ability to perform tasks in confined spaces due to limited control over the robot joint configuration. This paper introduces a novel action space formulation:  End-Effector-Elbow (E3), which addresses the limitations of existing control paradigms by allowing the control of both the end-effector and elbow of the robot. E3 combines the advantages of both joint and end-effector control, offering fine-grained comprehensive control with overactuated robot arms whilst achieving highly efficient robot learning. E3 systematically outperforms other action spaces, when precise control over the robot configuration is required, both in simulated and real environments.

### Summary
It is common in robot learning to use either an end-effector or joint position action space. Many robots are 7-dof, where as EE action spaces are 6 dof, which means that there is an overactuated degree of freedom, leading to consistency issues. Most of the tasks and corresponding cost functions are metric, thus not aligned with joint action space. This paper proposed EE3 which overcomes both challenges by adding a joint angle (usually base or wrist to make sure there is kinematic consistency) to EE action space. The approach is evaluated on RLBench, where they show that this action space can boost performance in 6 RL tasks which require a good amount of obstacle avoidance, and performance does not drop in other tasks. The paper also shows results on 3 real-world tasks on the Franka arm.

### Strengths
- Rethinking action spaces and adding inductive biases for downstream tasks is an important problem 
- EE3 is well motivated and the presentation of the problem statement is extremely clear
- The experiments are insightful, as we can see that EE3J helps in downstream robot tasks 
- The real world experiments support the hypothesis

### Weaknesses
 - I think there is a lack of discussion of other action spaces (primitives, OSC etc)
- There is a lack of comparison to other action spaces as well 

- I don't fully believe this approach is novel - it can be seen in some ways as a special case of [1]. I believe the authors should discuss this further.
- It would be good to see this applied to other robots than Franka (including those with higher Dof).
- There are also concerns about how general this approach can be - it is only applicable to overactuated manipulation scenarios. It would be good to discuss this more in the paper.

### Summary
- Proposes a new action space called End-Effector-Elbow (E3) for robot arm control that allows both efficient learning and full control over the arm configuration by utilizing the extra degree of freedom in a 7-DoF robot arm used for 6-DoF EE control. Introduces two realizations of E3: E3Angle (E3A) which controls the elbow angle directly, and E3Joint (E3J) which controls the elbow position indirectly by fixing a joint.
- Shows through RL experiments in simulation that E3, especially E3J, outperforms joint and end-effector control in tasks requiring precise arm configuration. Real-world imitation learning experiments all show that E3 succeeds in confined spaces while end-effector control fails.

### Strengths
- Addresses limitations of standard joint and end-effector control spaces.
- Achieves better sample efficiency than joint control and better arm control than end-effector control.
- E3J alignment with task space enables efficient learning like end-effector control.
- Experiments show benefits in simulation and real-world settings in both generic simulation benchmarks and also a hard real-world manipulation setup.

### Weaknesses
 - The E3 action space does not consider the dynamics or contact forces of the robot and the environment, which may affect the performance and stability of the robot learning algorithms. Specifically, the lack of explicit modeling of contact forces could lead to instability when interacting with rigid objects or during constrained manipulation tasks. The agent's reliance on visual and proprioceptive feedback to infer contact is indirect and may not be sufficient for precise force control, potentially leading to jerky movements or task failures.
- The E3 action space is only tested on 7 DoF robot arms, and may not generalize to other types of manipulators with different degrees of freedom or kinematics. The current implementation of E3, particularly E3J which fixes a specific joint, is highly dependent on the specific kinematic structure of a 7-DoF arm. It is unclear how this would be adapted to arms with fewer or more degrees of freedom, or different joint configurations, without a major redesign. For example, for a 6-DoF arm, the concept of an elbow angle or a fixed elbow joint may not be directly applicable, requiring a different parameterization.

### Questions
- Only evaluated on a 7 DoF arm. The framework may not extend well to arms with higher DoFs and 6 DoFs. How does this method extend to higher DoFs? Is there is a generalized version of this framework?

### Summary
This paper proposes a new action space for robot learning, dubbed End-Effector-Elbow. The basic idea for this new action space is to avoid the joint space redundancies that end-effector based control incurs (when N (degress-of-freedom) of a robot > 6). 

To avoid these redundancies the paper extends the robot’s action space to 6 (EE) + (N - 6), where the latter part is controlling the redundant part of the joint space. In many robots (e.g. Franka-Pandas) these redundant dofs arise in the elbow of the robot and probably thus the name. The paper shows that their proposed action space works better in some RLBench tasks (although 4 of the tasks seem to be new tasks) and in some small-scale real-world experiments.

### Strengths
The overall motivation of designing an action space that enables fast learning while not being adversely affected by the null-space is an important problem statement. The overall paper is well written and seems to present an interesting solution to this problem. The experiments (although limited) do seem to suggest that the approach works.

### Weaknesses
I think the overall approach is highly engineered for particular scenarios and robots and is not general. For instance, in the E3J method (the main method), the paper proposes to constraint the base joint but that is an arbitrary choice. Certain parts of the task may find it beneficial to constraint the wrist joint. Further, there can be tasks, which use configurations where constraining the middle joint is useful. For instance, consider scenario where the franka arm has been rotated such that it lies flat and thus the middle joint acts as an elbow. Clearly the proposed approach is infeasible in these scenarios.

**Relation to existing work:** To some extent the E3J idea can be viewed from the lens of a hierarchical policy (where first a constrained joint is learned and then the EE-action). Similar idea of hierarchical control and learning in hierarchical action spaces especially with respect to null-spaces has been considered in prior work (Sharma et al.). Unfortunately, the paper is not cited (or discussed).

Infact, the idea of hierarchical composition in Sharma etal is more general since it composes arbitrary number controllers in null-spaces. This automatically leads to the E3J approach where first a joint is selected and then the IK is used under the constraint of this joint to reach the desired agent (thus automatically acting in the null-space). One difference, between Sharma et al. and the current work is that the former only considers task-space constraints and use task-space impedance control to control the robot. While the current work uses a joint-constraint and task-constraint/goal and use IK for control. However, there are prior works (as referenced in Sharma eta al), which do controller composition directly in the joint space.

Infact, it may actually be useful to combine this paper with Sharma etal. and consider more general hierarchical policies.  Finally, there is other related works which focus on learning constraints from demonstrations that should also be potentially cited.

Sharma et al. *Learning to Compose Hierarchical Object-Centric Controllers for Robotic Manipulation*

Lin et al. *Learning Null Space Projections*

Howard et al. *A novel method for learning policies from variable constraint data*

**Generality of the approach:** Can you talk about the challenges in using this approach on very differently settings. For instance, consider the UR arms and if the task only requires one degree of freedom for successful execution. The presented approach wouldn’t consider this scenario but wouldn’t the benefits of a constrained action space for learning be useful even in this setting? 

It would also be useful to show images/videos of simulation tasks which are being considered as full-body tasks.

**Use of IK:** As is briefly noted in the paper, can the authors clarify if they indeed used constrained IK (with the joint constraint) to solve for the end-effector target pose? Were there any issues or challenges related with solving this optimization problem. For instance, what if the IK failed because the joint constraint makes it hard for the robot to reach the desired EE pose. I would imagine such scenarios to arise, but the paper is very light on such implementation details. 

Another issue with an IK based approach is that it can be expensive to solve at every RL step especially when we perform delta end-effector actions. In such settings most works use the jacobian based controller (osc), how would the proposed approach work with such a choice?

### Summary
This paper presents E3, a new action space for robot arm manipulation. Essentially, the proposed method presents an action space containing both end-effector pose and control over one additional joint in the arm. Compared to previous 2 established actions space, i.e. end-effector pose or joint-space, E3 brings the advantages of both, and show performance gain on a set of experiments.

### Strengths
- The idea is straightforward, reasonable and easy to follow
- the paper presentation is clear
- empirical results showing value of the proposed method

### Weaknesses
 - My biggest concern is, the proposed method is more like a small engineering trick, rather than a rigorous scientific approach. It is specific to 7-DoF arm, which presents opportunities for such method due to the one additional redundant joint. The method won't work for 6-DoF arms, which although doesn't come with redundancy, but will also present multiple disconnected IK solutions given one end-effector pose, and only a subset of them would satisfy the task constraints.It also won't work for arms with DoFs greater than 7: which joint should we choose then? Or do we need to control 2 joints?
- Some explanations are not clear: 
   - It says `elbow`, but in the method it says empirically it uses the base joint
   - i don't understand why choosing any joint in between would make problems for IK solver: it's just removing 1 DoF and the solver should work just fine. There's also no experiments to empirically validate which joint to choose
