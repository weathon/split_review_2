# Discovering Environments with XRM

- Decision: Reject
- Scores: 5, 6, 3

## Abstract
Environment annotations are essential for the success of many out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization methods.
  Unfortunately, these are costly to obtain and often limited by human annotators' biases.
  To achieve robust generalization, it is essential to develop algorithms for automatic environment discovery within datasets.
  Current proposals, which divide examples based on their training error, suffer from one fundamental problem.
  These methods introduce hyper-parameters and early-stopping criteria, which require a validation set with human-annotated environments, the very information subject to discovery.
  In this paper, we propose \fullmethod{} (\method{}) to address this issue.
  \method{} trains twin networks, each learning from one random half of the training data, while imitating confident held-out mistakes made by its sibling.
  \method{} provides a recipe for hyper-parameter tuning, does not require early-stopping, and can discover environments for all training and validation data.
  Algorithms built on top of \method{} environments achieve oracle worst-group-accuracy, addressing a long-standing challenge in OOD generalization.

### Summary
This paper addresses the challenge of achieving robust out-of-distribution generalization without relying on resource-intensive environment annotations. The authors propose Cross-Risk Minimization (XRM), a novel approach that trains twin networks to learn from random halves of the training data while imitating confident mistakes made by their counterparts. XRM enables automatic discovery of environments for both training and validation data. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of XRM by building domain generalization algorithms based on the discovered environments, achieving oracle worst-group-accuracy.

### Strengths
1. The paper is well-organized and easy to understand.
2. This paper addresses a crucial challenge in Domain Generalization (DG) tasks, which is the data-splitting process without relying on human annotations.
3. The authors provide strong empirical evidence through extensive experiments to substantiate the effectiveness of their proposed XRM method.

### Weaknesses
1. The paper's claims may be slightly overstated. While the focus on subpopulation shift in distribution shift is indeed important, it might be more appropriate to avoid claiming to solve a long-standing problem in out-of-distribution generalization without further empirical studies on widely recognized DG benchmarks such as DomainBed and Wilds. These additional experiments could provide more convincing evidence of the proposed approach's effectiveness. The current experiments, while extensive, are limited in scope and do not fully demonstrate the generalizability of XRM across diverse datasets and domain shift scenarios.
2. The paper lacks a comprehensive discussion of important related works concerning data splitting strategies for improved DG performance and subpopulation shift, such as references [1], [2], [3] and [4]. Notably, in [1], the authors have theoretically demonstrated the challenges of learning the invariant correlation between samples and labels in the absence of prior information. Including these relevant works would enhance the paper's literature review and contextualize the proposed approach. The absence of a discussion on methods that explicitly aim to learn invariant representations or utilize causal inference techniques to address spurious correlations is a significant oversight.

Typo:

In the first sentence of the paragraph above section 4.2, it appears that the authors have inadvertently added a redundant "we.”

### Questions
1. As highlighted in [1], it is crucial to understand the specific scenarios where XRM is expected to be effective. Therefore, it would be beneficial for the authors to provide further insights into the data distribution settings in which XRM is likely to perform well. Alternatively, the authors could explore providing theoretical guarantees to enhance the understanding of XRM's strengths and limitations.
2. The observation that XRM outperforms Human-annotation methods is intriguing and warrants further explanation.

### Summary
The paper introduces CROSS-RISK MINIMIZATION (XRM), a method for achieving robust out-of-distribution generalization without relying on resource-intensive environment annotations. By training twin networks to imitate confident mistakes made by each other, XRM enables automatic discovery of relevant environments for training and validation data. The proposed approach addresses the challenge of hyper-parameter tuning and achieves oracle worst-group accuracy, offering a promising solution for broad generalization in AI systems.

### Strengths
* The problem of learning OOD robust model without manual domain partition is a very important task, which might has great impact on real-world applications.
* The proposed method has a clear advantage over existing methods such as EIIL and JTT, that they does not need to explicitly tune the hyperparameter for early stopping. Since hyper-parameter tuning is a crucial challenge, the proposed method would be of interest to many.
* The empirical performance is strong.

### Weaknesses
I have several concerns as follows:

1. The paper should provide a clear discussion on the identifiability challenges presented in [1], which demonstrate that learning invariance without domain partition can be generally impossible. It is crucial to address the need for imposing inductive bias, additional assumptions, conditions, or auxiliary information to ensure the effectiveness of the proposed method. A thorough exploration of these aspects would enhance the paper's theoretical foundation and its practical applicability. Specifically, the paper should discuss the conditions under which the proposed method can successfully identify invariant features, and when it might fail, given the theoretical limitations highlighted in [1]. For instance, what happens when the spurious correlations are not the first features learned by ERM, or when the invariant feature is learned first? The paper needs to clarify these limitations.

2. According to [2, 3], spurious features are defined as any nodes in the causal graph other than the direct causes of the label. However, I have concerns about the evaluations conducted on datasets like waterbird, which explicitly contain only one dominating spurious feature. These datasets may not fully reflect the implications of the proposed methods on more realistic and high-dimensional datasets such as ImageNet variants. Moreover, the paper relies on the assumption that Empirical Risk Minimization (ERM) learns spurious features first, but it may not hold true for all types of spurious features as discussed in [2, 3]. It would be valuable to address these concerns and provide further insights into the generalizability of the method to diverse real-world datasets. For example, the paper should discuss how the method would perform if the spurious features are not easily separable from the invariant features, or if there are multiple interacting spurious features.

3. If a large number of spurious features are present, [1] demonstrates that there are necessary and sufficient conditions for learning invariance without explicit domain partitions, which can be quite restrictive. I have concerns about whether the proposed two-stage method can effectively address this problem given the limitations imposed by these conditions. It would be valuable for the authors to discuss how their method overcomes or accommodates these restrictions and whether it can achieve satisfactory results in scenarios with a significant number of spurious features. It is crucial to analyze the sensitivity of the proposed method to the number of spurious features and discuss the potential for performance degradation as the number of spurious features increases.

4.  Several studies [5, 6] have highlighted the challenges associated with learning invariance in the presence of many spurious features. In a recent paper, [4] discovered that when dealing with a large number of spurious features, each ERM model tends to learn a subset of these features. [4] further demonstrates that rather than exclusively focusing on learning invariant features, it is beneficial for OOD performance to diversify the learned spurious features (referred to as spurious feature diversification). Spurious feature diversification is shown to explain the effectiveness of empirically strong methods like SWAD and Model soup. It would be valuable to investigate whether the proposed method (XRM) can enhance spurious feature diversification and demonstrate effective performance on a broader range of real-world datasets, such as PACS, OfficeHome, DomainNet, or ImageNet variants. The paper should also discuss how the proposed method compares to existing methods that explicitly encourage spurious feature diversification, and whether it can achieve similar or better performance.

2: You are willing to defend your assessment, but it is quite likely that you did not understand the central parts of the submission or that you are unfamiliar with some pieces of related work. Math/other details were not carefully checked.

### Summary
The paper addresses OOD generalization by discovering latent environments (partitions) of the training data that are beneficial when used subsequently with standard methods (GroupDRO, reweighting, or resampling to equalize groups during training). The method proceeds by training a pair of models (details discussed below).

### Strengths
- Thorough evaluation on multiple standard datasets.

- Good empirical results.

### Weaknesses
W1. If I understand correctly, the method seems to rely on the fact that misclassified examples are such because they do not contain a "spurious correlation" that a model would learn by default. The twin training serves to reinforce the tendency of one of the trained models to capture this spurious correlation. If this is indeed the case, then the overall methods seems to depend on the (common) heuristic that models learn spurious correlations by default (a.k.a. shortcut learning). I think this is the same heuristic that is used in the existing methods criticised in Section 3. Critically, this heuristic relies on the fact that we know that the chosen architecture/training set lead to learnin undesirable spurious correlations by default. What if one applies the method to a situation where a perfectly-fine, "robust" model is learned by default? I'm guessing that the method would then be detrimental.

I'm not suggesting that we should be able to do better without additional knowledge (in fact [1] seems to show it's not possible) but the authors here do claim to do so, hence the need to point out this possible limitation (see also W5).

If my understanding of the method is correct, the method is also very similar to the following.
- Works in the debiasing literature (e.g. LfF) that train a pair of models that respectively rely/do not rely on spurious features. These works are discussed in Sect. 3, and I do understand that they rely to some extent to the tuning of model capacity to ensure that it captures the spurious feature, but I am not convinced that the proposed parallel training (which seem to be the essential difference) leads to the discovery of something fundamentally different.
- Works in the "model diversity" literature that train a pair of models that differ in their predictions [5,6]. These also proceed to train models in parallel, in a was that seems conceptually very similar to the step 1 proposed here (implementation details aside).

--------

W2. The proposed method only partitions the data into 2 "environments". I don't think this is really in line with the literature on DG (with which this work is supposed to connect) that are mostly based on invariance learning and need a large number of training environments (e.g. IRM). This work therefore seems much more related to the simpler setting of "debiasing" methods (e.g. LfF) that aim at removing the reliance of a model from one precise biased feature.

The methods used for the second phase are indeed simple baselines for debiasing, and not really DG methods. These are very strong baselines in these settings (and with the datasets considered), but I'm not sure this is what the reader would expect given all the mentions about DG.

--------

W3. Absence of a comprehensive review of related work. Some directly-related methods are correctly cited/discussed throughout the paper, but there are other connected areas that are not really discussed (examples below).

[1,2] discuss conditions under which environment discovery is possible. I think the theoretical statements in [1] are particularly important to discuss (I am not sure how the proposed method overcomes the impossibility stated in that paper; see also W5).
[3] was an early method that also proposed to "unshuffle" data (a term used in this paper) by simply clustering the data. Looking at the visualizations of discovered "environments" in Fig. 3, one wonders if these could also be discovered with such as simple clustering baseline.
[4] is another recent method that also seems to claim discovering partitions in the data (I suspect it has similar flaws to those discussed in the paper; it has appeared at ICCV 2023 after the ICLR deadline so it's totally fine to dismiss it though).

--------

W4: No discussion or empirical exploration of the limitations of the methods. No precise statement of the assumptions on which the method relies.

--------

Minor comments (no need to comment in the rebuttal; these do not affect my rating of the paper)

- W-minor 1. The writing style is unusual for a technical paper. There are many verbose statements, emotional words, exclamation marks, etc. This is actually a great writing style in other circumstances, but it does not maximize the clarity and efficiency of communication. This does not directly affect my rating of the paper, but it made the reading more tedious. I would suggest using a more concise style and neutral tone for the benefit of the readers.

- W-minor 2. The existing methods for environment discovery based on 2 phases is described twice in sections 1 and 3. It could be clearer to merge these.
Section 3 is a mix of review/background material/motivation/related work. It's not bad at all in its contents, but it could be easier for the readers to stick with common sections like "related work", "background", etc.

- W-minor 3. Note that the initial premise stated in the very first sentence of the abstract is not really correct (although it does not really affect the rest of the paper):
"Successful out-of-distribution generalization requires environment annotations (...) therefore (...) we must develop algorithms to automatically discover environments"
Using multiple training environments/domains is only one approach to improve OOD generalization.

### Questions
Please comment on W1-W4 above.

To summarize, the main reasons for my negative rating are the absence of precise statements about limitations/assumptions of the method, and the missing discussion of links with the existing literature. Therefore, I am not sure this is really a work about DG (but rather the simpler setting of single-bias), and the core of the method may be very similar to existing work [5,6] (although presented in very different terms).

--------

In the spirit of constructive feedback, I would suggest that theses issues are fixable (in a future version) with:

(1) a proper review of the existing work, how/if it relates to this work (e.g. what is the connection with invariance learning? how do the many-environment methods related to this one? how to understand the claims made here in relation to the impossibility theorem in [1] mentioned below?)

(2) a better discussion why/how the proposed method work. The current text is mostly hand waving. Even if a complete theory is out of reach, perhaps a concrete example could help (conceptual, or with a toy example).
