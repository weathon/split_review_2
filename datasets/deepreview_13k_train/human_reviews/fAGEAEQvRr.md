# Gradient descent for matrix factorization: Understanding large initialization

- Decision: Reject
- Scores: 6, 5, 5, 6

## Abstract
Gradient Descent (GD) has been proven effective in solving various matrix factorization problems. However, its optimization behavior with large initial values remains less understood. To address this gap, this paper presents a novel theoretical framework for examining the convergence trajectory of GD with a large initialization. The framework is grounded in signal-to-noise ratio concepts and inductive arguments. The results uncover an implicit incremental learning phenomenon in GD and offer a deeper understanding of its performance in large initialization scenarios.

### Summary
The paper presents a stage-by-stage analysis of the dynamics of gradient descent on a low-rank symmetric matrix factorization problem, showing that the empirically observed stages of fast decrease followed by crawling progress before another fast decrease can be captured theoretically.

### Strengths
Fig. 1 and the first paragraph of 4.2 form a really nice motivation! I'd recommend moving them to the introduction. This forms a well-defined problem that is of relevance to understand the dynamics of gradient descent on more complex systems, which is relevant to the community. The approach appears novel, although I am not too familiar with the related work.

Altough the theory might be described as "incomplete", as it relies on an Assumption 8 to transition from learning the first component to the second, I appreciate that the submission is clear in that it is an assumption and gives a justification.

### Weaknesses
Up to minor clarity points below, the paper is understandable, but dense. My main concern regarding the submission its intended audience might be limited to the people looking to build upon those results to get towards a better understanding of symmetric matrix factorization. But my perspective is likely limited and there might be a wider applicability to the presented results.

**Questions**
- The introduction states that the focus of the submission is on the implicit bias of gradient descent, but I do not see how studying the dynamics of Fig. 1 connects to the implicit bias (which, in my understanding, refers to the limit point the optimizer converges to)?
- Remark 2 states the the results hold for PSD $\Sigma$, but the results seem to also assume that $\Sigma$ is diagonal. Is this assumption necessary, or is it presented for the diagonal case wlog? What is the key difficulty in generalizing it to non-diagonal matrices?

**Minor points**
- Please define incremental to avoid confusion with the alternative use of incremental learning as a synonym for seeing-one-example-at-a-time learning. I realise in post that this is what the second-to-last paragraph in §1 is doing, but I didn't read it as such. A more explicit phrasing the first time the term appears might help, eg in the 4th paragraph "Jin et al. demonstrate an increamental learning phenomenon with small initialization; Eigenvectors associated with large eigenvalues are learned first". A sentence as to how this differs qualitatively from a similar observation on linear regression might help contextualize too.
- The introduction describes matrix factorization as "mirroring the training of a two-layer linear network", but this doesn't hold for the symmetric matrix factorization studied here, which seems more similar to quadratic regression
- The term "period" on page 7 might be replaced by "time", as the behavior is not periodic
- "ascend to infinity" is more commonly referred to as "diverge" or "diverge to infinity".

### Summary
This paper focuses on a simplified matrix factorization problem, aiming to understand the convergence of gradient descent when using large random initialization.

### Strengths
This paper focuses on a simplified matrix factorization problem, aiming at understanding the convergence of GD when using large random initialization.

### Weaknesses
The presentation could be further improved.   The authors claim that they aim to understand the convergence of GD with large random initialization on simple matrix factorization problems, but as a reader, I could not find a main theorem or corollary that clearly states that with large random initialization, GD converges with certain rates under appropriate parameter settings and assumptions.  Also, the presentation of the theorem involves many notations, which on the other hand, looks could not be uninvolved. 

The  'large initialization' is in fact the `large random initialization'.  The authors consider GD with large random initialization, but the variance still depends on the dimension of the problem under consideration. Therefore, when the dimension d is relatively large, it reduces to the ``small" random initialization setting. 

The authors consider a simple matrix factorization problem, but as claimed in the main text, the motivation of this paper is to better understand  GD with large random initialization in training neural networks.

Even in the simple matrix factorization problems, the comparisons with state-of-the-art results in this exact setting are not clear to me.

### Questions
Line-5 on Page 1 and the other places, ''problem 1'' should be "Problem (1)".

### Summary
The paper studies the influence of initialization on the performance of gradient descent for the matrix factorization problems.
Existing work focusses on small initialization (see missing ref in References).
The analysis is based on a signal-to-noise (SNR) analysis, which generalizes the one of CHen et al (2019) for the rank 1 matrix factorization problem. Here the SNR is defined as the ratio of the norm of the components of X aligned with the desired directions (first k eigenspaces of target matrix $\Sigma$), divided by the norm of the remaining components.

The paper has two main contributions:
- Provided GD is initialized in a high SNR region (Eq 10), the authors prove linear convergence towards the global minimizer.
- When no such initialization is available, the paper provides additional results, but (see first point below) it still seems to require that $X_0$ be in certain region which is unknown.

### Strengths
Potential important progress in the field of implicit bias for matrix factorization, if the results are true. All previous results I know of are for small initialization.

### Weaknesses
See questions below:
- only one experiment, on rank 2 matrix approximation
- unclear dependency on initialization: $\alpha$ needs to be small 
- unclear it it is required in the proof that $X_0 \in S$ or not (contradictory statements in the paper)

### Mathematics
By order of importance:
- The paper claims to study large initialization, and that the first result with initialization in the region of Eq 10 is not satisfying. However, the proof of the main result states "This is achievable if we use random initialization X0 = αN0 with a reasonably small constant α", which is not "large initialization". $\alpha$ must be small enough such that $\sigma^2_1(K_r) \leq \lambda_r - 3 \Delta/4$, so $\alpha$ depends on $r$, and it's not so wild to think that $r$ is a fraction of $d$. Remark 4 seems to contradict that, highlighting that the theorem does not require $X_0 \in S$, but the exposition is very confusing here (eg, Lemma 5 assumes that $X_0 \in S$)
- It is clear that Sigma can be assumed diagonal in problem 1 up to an orthogonal change of variable in $X$ (because GD is equivariant to such a change of variable), but this deserves to be stated explicitly the first time this assumption is made (P2).
- $\sigma_1(u_{k,t})$ is just its norm, right? $u_{k,t}$ is a vector. Same for $u_{k,t} K_{k, t}^\top$


## Experiments
- In the experimental example, how do we know if 0.5 N(0, 1/d) is a large initialization? Since $d$ does not vary, what can we say? It would be better to have the experiment for several values of $d$ and fixed $\bar \omega$
- The experimental example considers rank 2 matrix factorization which, though by nature different as the authors have explained, does not seem to far from rank 1 factorization (especially compared to the dimension 2000). It would highlight the goal of the paper better to use something like rank 10 matrix factorization here.
- Please provide more than one experiment in dimension 2. The analysis is incomplete without more proof that the results hold for varying r and d, fixed $\bar \omega$.



### Formulation
- Incremental learning has many possible meanings, it would be nice to clarify it here. Same for "spectral method", I think the amount of details given in section 3.2 should be slightly increased.
- P3 "because at the global minima"/"the set R contains all the global minima": it seems to me that there is a single global minima, the rank-$r$ truncated SVD of $\Sigma$. can the authors clarify?
- First sentence of Section 3.3 is a repetition from above.
- Paragraph 4.1 consider replacing rank-$r$ by rank-2 for clarity (and all instances of $r$ in that paragraph)
- Legend of Figure 1: "top three rows" are the first three rows?

### References:
- I believe the paper is missing the seminal reference "S. Gunasekar, B. E. Woodworth, S. Bhojanapalli, B. Neyshabur, and N. Srebro, “Implicit regularization
in matrix factorization,” in Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, 2017" which conjectured global convergence of GD to the minimal nuclear norm solution in the case of small initialization.

### Summary
This paper analyzes the incremental learning behavior of gradient descent for matrix factorization problems. Different from existing works that only consider small initialization, this paper considers initializations that have constant scale. Under certain regularity assumptions on the initialization and singular values in the training process, the authors show that gradient descent still exhibits incremental learning. In their theoretical analysis, the auhtors use a  novel signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) argument to show the exponential separation between a low-rank signal and a noise term, which allows that to show that gradient descent trajectory is nearly low-rank.

### Strengths
1) The introduction part of this paper is written in a clear and succint manner. The main theoretical results are often followed by necessary explanations and proof sketch, making it easier for the readers to understand them.
2) The effect of large initialization on implicit bias is an interesting topic and the theoretical results in this paper are novel to the best of my knowledge. The authors also provide comprehensive review of the related literature.

### Weaknesses
1) The theoretical results in this paper are presented in a somewhat isolated manner, and it seems that then result for rank-$2$ is not even stated as an independent theorem. I suggest that the authors can briefly summarize the main results (for rank-$2$ and general ranks) in the introduction, before going into technical details.

2) The organization of Sec. 3 can probably be improved: although the title of this section is "challenges in examine general rank solutions", Sec. 3.1 is about local convergence and the remaining two subsections seem to discuss the challenges for large initialization, rather than for general ranks.

3) The "signal-noise-ratio" argument in this work looks different from existing works that also decompose the GD trajectory in the signal and noise term (e.g. [1,2] ), but the decomposition seems to be the same. I suggest that the authors can add more discussions about this difference to highlight the contribution of this paper.

### Questions
1) I am confused about Assumption 8 and cannot see how it is related to the arguments at the beginning of Sec. 4.2.3. According to my understanding, it says that the norm of the $2$-to-$d$ components is larger than its inner product with the first component. Can you explain this assumption in more details?

2) The authors seem to employ a successive argument for general rank matrix. However, the definition of the benign set $R$ in Sec. 3.1 would change for higher ranks. Is there any arguments in your proof verifying that GD remains in the high-rank $R$? Probably you did it in Theorem 13, but I cannot understand how they are related.

3) In existing works it is commonly the case that convergence/incremental learning hold with high probability (e.g.[1] Theorem 3.3), since the initialization has to be aligned with each component, otherwise it cannot make progess in some direction. Does this paper need to impose similar requirements for initialization?
