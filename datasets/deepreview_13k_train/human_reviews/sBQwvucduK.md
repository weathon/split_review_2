## Abstract
\vspace{-0.2cm}
Recent advancements in diffusion models have significantly enhanced the data synthesis with 2D control.
Yet, precise 3D control in street view generation, crucial for 3D perception tasks, remains elusive.
Specifically, utilizing Bird's-Eye View (BEV) as the primary condition often leads to challenges in geometry control (\eg, height), affecting the representation of object shapes, occlusion patterns, and road surface elevations, all of which are essential to perception data synthesis, especially for 3D object detection tasks.
In this paper, we introduce \methodname, a novel street view generation framework, offering diverse 3D geometry controls including camera poses, road maps, and 3D bounding boxes, together with textual descriptions, achieved through tailored encoding strategies. 
Besides, our design incorporates a cross-view attention module, ensuring consistency across multiple camera views. With \methodname, we achieve high-fidelity street-view image \& video synthesis that captures nuanced 3D geometry and various scene descriptions, enhancing tasks like BEV segmentation and 3D object detection.

### Summary
The paper proposes MagicDrive - a Bird's-eye-view(BEV)-to-street-view image generation method. Given a BEV road map, 3D bounding boxes for objects, the camera pose, and an input prompt it generates a consistent, multi-view image set for autonomous driving purposes. It is capable of scene, background and foreground control by prompting - lighting conditions, weather, object orientation, object deletion are available. 

The main paper contributions are the a view-consistent image generation and 3D bounding box encoding for objects, as opposed to previous approaches that used only the BEV map.

The algorithm yields favorable visual results compared to similar methods (15-16 FID vs 20+) and the augmented data it generates improves upon the BEVFormer 3D object detection (\~+2mAP, depending on input modality) and Cross View Transformer vehicle and road mIoU (\~4-5%) on the nuScenes validation dataset.

### Strengths
- consistent cross-camera image generation
    - a cross-view attention model with neighboring views 
- better problem modelling compared to older methods
    - 3D object bounding box and camera pose allows a wider array of edits and more accurate terrain representation
    - prompting the diffusion model allows for more diverse output images

### Weaknesses
## Summary ##
A view-consistent UNet generation method and bounding box inputs for a controlNet BEV-to-RGB are the main contributions. Apart from the benefit of encoding bounding boxes, unclear whether the chosen consistency method is ideal.
## Details ##

- engineering work / limited contributions
    - ControlNet stable diffusion pipeline coupled with a multi-view conditional UNet  
        - there are other consistency methods - inpainting, panorama input, feature volumes - why is this cross-view attention module the best choice?
- limited comparisons, different baseline numbers
    - the authors use BEVFormer for some comparisons and CVT for others 
        -  for BEVFormer the reported numbers are significantly lower compared to the original paper and I don't believe it's only the resolution; no numbers match
- method not mature enough
    - to the best of my knowledge, neither of the two baselines (BEVGen/BEVControl) have been accepted at a major conference; furthermore, MagicDrive disregards other practical considerations such as temporally-consistent frames [1*]

### Questions
1. Why are the BEVFusion numbers much lower? Why not use BEVFusion for the BEV segmentation as well?
2. If the aim is just to generate novel views, why not add additional elements to the bounding box images and use controlNet image encoding? See [1*] for inspiration.
3. If the data augmentation strategy works so well, why not start with a state-of-the art method such as [2*] and see what it can be improved from there?
4. Why not present other methods for consistent view generation? Arguably [4*] deals with the same problem; the scope is different, but they also have reasonable depth maps.
5. The method is heavily reliant on nuScenes; how would you consider improving generalization?

### Summary
The goal of this paper is to have multi-modality control on street scene generation process. Overall idea of this paper is to use ControlNet framework on top of pre-trained stable diffusion model to support conditional generation over street view dataset. The complexity comes in terms of how to design multi-modality conditions for the ControlNet condition. For this purpose, the authors introduce various cross attention over their conditions to fuse their conditions onto scene representation (they also feed non-scene related condition directly to stable diffusion). The training follows ControlNet paradigm with classifier-free guidance to encourage output more aligned with conditions. Result-wise, they compare with BEVGen and BEVControl on nuScenes. The experiment aims to reveal they produce more realistic images and have better control over output space for street view generation task.

### Strengths
1. The paper is very nicely organized and written. 
2. The quality of the generated street view is realistic
3. We can see MagicDrive has more precise control on street generation than baselines

### Weaknesses
1. The main concern is for their marginal technical contribution. The proposed method is ControlNet applied into street view generation setting with multi-modality condition. The novelty probably lies in how to organize the condition into controlNet setting, which might not sufficient for acceptance. Specifically, the paper adapts ControlNet for street view generation, but the core innovation seems limited to the specific arrangement of multi-modal conditions. While the authors introduce cross-attention mechanisms to fuse these conditions, the fundamental architecture remains rooted in ControlNet. The adaptation, while effective, doesn't introduce a significant departure from the existing framework. The novelty is primarily in the application domain and the specific configuration of inputs, rather than a fundamental algorithmic advancement.
2. MagicDrive does not ensure consistency across adjacent frames after checking their website demo. The lack of temporal consistency is a notable weakness. While the paper focuses on single-frame generation, the absence of coherence between adjacent frames in the demo raises questions about the practical applicability of the method in dynamic street view scenarios. The generated street scenes exhibit noticeable discontinuities and abrupt changes, which detract from the overall realism and believability of the generated sequences.

### Questions
1. Do you have different CFG weights for different conditions? If so, I am curious on how you make that work.

### Summary
This paper introduces a novel framework for generating street view imagery with diverse 3D geometry controls such as camera poses, road maps, and 3D bounding boxes, using tailored encoding strategies. Existing methods primarily focus on 2D control which limits their utility in 3D perception tasks essential for autonomous driving. This paper consider a BEV view input, and input these control through encoding each of the information and insert these in the cross attention inside the diffusion UNet. In order to ensure the consistency between different views. It also introduce the cross-view attention for the training.

### Strengths
- Adopting diffusion for driving view synthese which trying to solve the data limitation in corner cases for self-driving is important. 

- The overall strategy is sound and the paper proposed reasonable ways to encoding different information. Including Scene-level Encoding,  3D Bounding Box Encoding,  Road Map Encoding, these encoding are well organized and normalized in inserting to the cross attention module.  It also enables the final multi-level control of the generation. 

- Other modules such as cross-view module help in image synthesis consistency. 

- The experiments, show that it outperforms the other baselines such as BEVGen and BEV-Control, for synthesizing multi-camera views.

### Weaknesses
 - the synthesized views are impressive,  the experiments are conducted in 700 street-view scenes for training and 150 for validation, which is a much smaller scale than the real-world senario. Wonder how to possiblly make it generalizable for real world domain. Does this be helpful to improve the detection & other understanding tasks when the data is large.

- In addition, not only for the dark scene, many generated instances such as human can be distorted with diffusion models. Wonder how that affects the detection accuracy for each subclass. The author provides overall accuracy in 3D object detection, may also analysis the details how to mix the synthesized images and real-images for training the model.

### Questions
Diffusion models are costly, Could the framework be extended or modified to handle real-time or near real-time massive generation requirements, which are crucial for applications in autonomous driving systems? This also related to handle dynamic entities in the scene such as moving vehicles or pedestrians, especially when synthesizing views over a period of time?

How closely does the synthetic data correlate with real-world data and what measures were taken to ensure the accuracy and reliability of this synthetic data?

### Summary
This work focus on street view generation conditioned on BEV layout.
The authors harness the power of pretrained stable diffusion model and ControlNet to generate realistic images.
Cross view attention is applied to achieve better multi-view consistency.
Experiments are conducted on nuscenes to demonstrate superior realism over the baselines.
The generative results can serve as data augmentation for downstream task to boost the performance.

### Strengths
1. Decent and realistic results. Some images are hard to distinguish unless zoom in.
2. The overall pipeline is sound to me, and compare to the baselines, it shows improved realism and better multi-camera consistency.
3. It can boost downstream perception performance.
4. Clear writing, easy to understand

### Weaknesses
1. The paper’s claim of “geometry control” appears to be somewhat overstated. Geometry encompasses more than just pose and Box3D; it also includes shape, topology, and the ability to modify any object within the scene. The current method seems limited to manipulating object poses and bounding box sizes, lacking fine-grained control over the actual geometric structure of the scene and objects.
2. The consistency aspect of the results is not fully realized. While I acknowledge that the multi-camera consistency is superior to that of the baselines, the broader aspect of consistency, such as consistency from novel viewpoints (e.g., moving cameras away from the original view, rotating it 360 degrees, modifying the focal length to zoom into details in distant regions), seems to be lacking. The method's reliance on a fixed camera setup and limited viewpoint variations in the training data likely hinders its ability to generalize to arbitrary viewpoints and maintain consistent scene representations. Based on my observations from the website and deductions from the approach, achieving such consistency with the current representation seems highly unlikely.
3. The novelty of this work is unclear to me, as I am not very familiar with this topic. Upon a quick review of BEVGen and BEVControl, it appears that the main difference lies in the new modeling of 3D bounding boxes (in this work, the authors decouple the 3D boxes and road maps and model them separately), the use of Stable Diffusion, and cross-view attention. However, none of these elements seem to be significantly innovative. The decoupling of 3D boxes and road maps, while potentially beneficial, does not represent a fundamental shift in the approach. The application of Stable Diffusion and cross-view attention, while effective, appears to be incremental improvements rather than groundbreaking contributions.

### Questions
Equation 9 is not closed in $||$

What if apply the data augmentation to the SOTA camera 3D detection models, can you achieve the new SOTA on nuscenes?
