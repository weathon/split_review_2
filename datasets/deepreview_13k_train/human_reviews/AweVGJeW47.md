# Smoothing for exponential family dynamical systems

- Decision: Reject
- Scores: 5, 6, 5

## Abstract
State-space modeling is a powerful technique for the analysis of spatiotemporal structures of time series.  However, when assumptions about linearity or Gaussianity are violated, statistical inference about the latent process is challenging.  While variational inference can be used to approximate the posterior in these nonlinear or non-Gaussian settings, it is desirable to preserve the temporal structure of the true posterior in the variational approximation, while ensuring inference scales linearly in sequence length.  We propose a new structured variational approximation that satisfies these desiderata.  Furthermore, by generalizing to *exponential family dynamical systems*, we are able to develop decoupled second order inference algorithms that have simple updates, without increased computational complexity.  Then, we extend our insights and develop the *auto-encoding backward factorized smoother*, making it easy to leverage modern deep learning tools.  For settings where a sequential inference algorithm may be more appropriate, we also present the *variational Bryson-Frazier* algorithm, by developing a new backward smoothing objective.  We compare against various inference algorithms for state-space models, and validate the theory presented through numerical experiments.

### Summary
This paper develops a number of algorithms for smoothing of exponential family dynamical systems. The main contributions are summarized as follows.

First, the paper introduces a prior-parameterized backward factorization to the smoothing posterior. This factorization $ q(z_t|z_{t-1}) $ includes a model of the dynamics $ p_\theta(z_{t+1}|z_t)$  so that it factors similarly to the true posterior, and additionally allows for linear scaling with the number of timesteps without the assumption of independence (as in mean field approximation). When using this backward factorization, one obtains a convenient and simplified expression for the ELBO, which includes terms that are KLs of expectations through conditionals, as opposed to KLs of expectations. One thing that was unclear to me was the claim that "The backward factorization will make gaining insight into the structure of the variational posterior analytically easier". Could this be elaborated on? Additionally, to facilitate tractability, all terms in this factorization were replaced by their closest exponential family approximations.

Second, the authors develop a smoothing algorithm (dBFS) that allows for parameters to be learned in parallel with the addition of lagrange multipliers which constrains $\mu_t^- = E_{q_{t-1}}[\mu_\theta(z_{t-1})]$, i.e. consistency of the parameters between timesteps. 

Third, by noting the relationships between the natural parameters and the Lagrange multipliers (Eq. 20), the authors introduce an amortized smoothing algorithm (aBFS) that introduces function approximators to learn the functions present in these relationships, leading to a VAE-style algorithm for smoothing. The authors also show how this algorithm can be applied for sequential inference for more practical applications in Sec 3.3 via vBF.

### Strengths
To begin, I thought this approach was extremely elegant. Utilizing the insights from Section 2.4, the authors compared the forward and backward factorization approaches and gave interesting insights as to when one might be preferred over the other. The authors also contextualized their work well in the short but informative Section 4. Overall, the paper is explained well, and the ideas were clear to understand. It was hard to evaluate how significant this work is due to the limited experiments (discussed below).

### Weaknesses
The Experimental section I think is both slightly difficult to understand and also not as compelling as the rest of the paper. There was a single experiment for dBFS, as well as a pendulum experiment for aBFS, as well as an experiment on smoothing chaotic dynamics that used aBFS and vBF. From this set of experiments, it was hard to get a good understanding of how 1) dBFS compares with aBFS, 2) how useful aBFS really is relative to the baselines, and 3) how aBFS and vBF would scale to more complex problems. I think there is a lot of room for improvement here, and thus think the paper has a lot of unrealized potential in its current form.

### Questions
-Is it possible to elaborate on what it means to be a "plug-in" predictive distribution? Are we just saying that we will take the thing that is supposed to be $q^-$ and plug in $E_{q(z_{t-1})}[p_\theta(z_t|z_{t-1})]$ instead? Is this different than a posterior predictive distribution?

-Is it possible to state the number of total parameters that each of the models in the experiments had? I think having significantly fewer parameters relative to something like L-VAE could be interesting to demonstrate the models effectiveness.

### Summary
This paper investigates a new factorization of the ELBO for sequence models.  This factorization uses a structured backwards-factored proposal that leverages the forward dynamics.  This choice, while appealing for analysis purposes, presents a number of inference difficulties.  The contributions of the paper is then a set of methods for performing approximate inference within the variational framework.  The method is tested on some small problems.  

**Note** It is important for me to note that while I understand most of the paper, this is right on the edge of what I am comfortable reviewing.  There are parts of the paper that I do not understand, not because I think they are wrong, but because I have struggled to follow the thread in places.

### Strengths
The work dovetails nicely with some recent work studying how structuring variational posteriors can lead to better inferences, but is awkward to learn.  The proposed method is a clever way of working around these problems, and expands the families of models that can be analyzed.  I think the method could be experimentally very useful, and engender follow-up work.  

The paper itself is well written, is self-contained, and has a good degree of purely pedagogical merit.  The authors are to be commended for their attention to detail, and the thought that has clearly been dedicated to structuring the paper.

### Weaknesses
Firstly, I believe the core work is at the requisite level for publication.  The work is sound, and to the best of my knowledge, is novel.  However, I do have numerous questions for the authors as there are aspects of the work I do not understand.  These are listed below.

My main criticisms of the work breaks down into two parts: the empirical evaluation, and the overall clarity.  

**W.1.:  Experimental evaluation**:  I think the experimental evaluation of the proposed methods is weak.  The problem with simultaneously proposing several methods is that you evaluate each method individually less.  Furthermore, the description of the experiments is comfortably the worst prose in the submission.  For instance, I have pretty much no idea what is being studied in “dBFS: convergence”.  I have outlined my comments on this below.  Evaluation of a single variant on a Van De Pol oscillator, and evaluation of some methods on a chaotic RNN and on a simple pendulum are not exactly compelling applications of a method.  Is the autoencoding method better than the Lagrange method?  Does one have more parameters, hyperparameters, more expensive etc.  There is no actual evaluation of the relative merits of the methods presented.  

There are also no compelling baselines or applications.  For instance, the original SVAE was applied to analyze mouse data.  I would also like to see comparison to other VAE variants and inference techniques – VRNNs and DKFs immediately spring to mind.  I think there are also entire families of inference techniques that you could discuss, e.g. VIFLE and SIXO, that are untouched.  These are just examples, and need not be quantitative comparisons, but since you are proposing leveraging backwards information or factorizations, this is exactly what VIFLE and SIXO do.  In general, the linking into prior art is incredibly weak.  

**W.2.:  Clarity**:  My main concern is not so much in the actual writing of the paper, but the clarity of the message.  I think the authors have tried to pile so many ideas and derivations into a single paper that the core message is actually obfuscated.  

I’ll try and give an example.  If the Lagrange method is universally better than the autoencoding method (or vice versa) then omit the weaker method from the main text.  If there are conditions where one is better/preferable than the other, then there should be an explicit experiment tackling this, so that the reader can understand the difference.  

Beyond this, I am not sure _why_ I should be interested in this method.  I have made some of these questions explicit in the Questions section.  It is stated early on that forwards and backwards factorizations have different analysis properties – this is then not mentioned throughout the paper.  It is also stated that a certain factorization underuses dynamics and is inefficient – this is not shown anywhere in the paper, but seems like a fairly fundamental justification for the method.  There are no experimental results that help justify the complexity or show that this method instantly overcomes some hurdles faced by previous methods.  

There are no diagrams outlining the various steps or architectures;  tables compactly contrasting the methods or their free variables;  or summary paragraphs summarizing what was introduced.  All these are tools to make the paper easier to understand.  And easier to understand papers ultimately have a greater reach and impact!  

There are also no fail cases or real limitations of the method stated – which for a method that doesn’t actually optimize a true ELBO and has a number of approximations is definitely required.  

I think this paper would _greatly_ benefit from thinning out the content.  I appreciate the authors not trying to slice the contributions too thinly, but (again as an example) I query if the vBF connection really fits with this paper.  I would almost rather that be removed, to make more room for a more thorough and focused discussion and comparison of the dBFS and aBFS algorithms.  There would also be more space for a more thorough (quantitative or qualitative) comparison to existing works, and where this work improves over those methods.  


## Minor comments:
- a. Throughout the paper, there are parameters ($\nu, \lambda, \ldots$) in equations or objectives that do not show up in the right hand side (e.g. $\lambda$ and $\theta$ in (17-18)).  It would be much better if the authors consistently and explicitly indicated which terms are indexed by which parameters.  
- b. Tables and figures should be floated to the top or bottom of the page, as opposed to inlined in text (c.f. Figure 3).  
- c. I don’t feel like Figure 1 actually helps that much.  I would rather it be written out as a proper pseudocode algorithm block that I can follow, as opposed to restating snippets of math that appear elsewhere.  (It’s also a huge figure that could be made _much_ smaller.  Side by side algorithms?)
- d. It would be nice if somewhere there was a table outlining the constraints on the model family that can be analyzed.  
- e. I have completely lost the thread of how the methods interact with each other by the time we get to “vBF: smoothing chaotic dynamics”, and i’m not really sure how to read the results from the table.  


## Comments on “dBFS convergence”:
- vBFS isn’t defined in the text.
- Why is Figure 2b studying an L-VAE?  What has that got to do with dBFS?
- (20) and (21) are a condition for optimality, and so how can you say the method converges _faster_?
- There is no other line to compare to on the LHS panel in each figure.
- Why are the particle filters bound so low?  PFs are asymptotically tight.  You should run it with a range of particles to see how many particles are required to get a tight bound.  
- The middle panel is practically unexplained – is it good that the $\lambda$s are approaching zero?  
- Colors and line styles are clashing.  Is the histogram over dBFS, L-VAE or mean field, or is it over 1, 10 and 100 steps.  Pick some different colors, or, give each subfigure its own legend.  
- Is “no. dual steps” the same as the colored 1, 10, and 100?
- I don’t even really know what the objective of this experiment is.  I think it is showing/sanity-checking that variational inference works?  That is sort of to be expected.  But with nothing to compare it to, it isn’t telling me a great deal.


**Summary** I think this paper shows great promise.  The core of the work is clearly publication-standard, and the authors have tried hard to make it digestible.  Unfortunately right now I believe their efforts are slightly misguided, and have resulted in a paper that doesn’t quite hit the home run that it is so close to.  I would be happy to accept a paper where the vBF content is removed, and replaced with a more thorough discussion and evaluation of the core methods.  I have tried to be thorough in my questions below, and if answered, I am happy to upgrade my score.

### Questions
**Q.1.**:  Why does L have different parameters in (10) vs (11)? ($\lambda$ vs $q$)

**Q.2.**:    Just below (14), you point out that as a result of the approximations it is no longer a valid ELBO.  This seems bad (although not terminal), and I was surprised this issue is not referenced or addressed elsewhere.  If this is being optimized end-to-end, and the objective is not a true bound, then you cannot make guarantees on what you are optimizing.  Can the authors comment on this.

**Q.3.**:   At the bottom of page 4, you say the following:

```The backward factorization will make gaining insight into the structure of the variational posterior analytically easier; whereas $L_F(q)$ is easier to use in an amortized inference setting where trajectories from the approximate posterior are drawn and used to form a stochastic approximation of the bound (Krishnan et al., 2016; Karl et al., 2016)```. 

Again, this is not obvious to me.  Nowhere else in the paper is the interpretability of the ELBO considered.  You also assert that $L_F$ is easier to evaluate compared to $L_B$, but then later on, you evaluate $L_B$, so I don't understand what the difference is. 

**Q.4.**:  This method be applied to any model with exponential family potentials?  Can one mix and match potential types?  I’m thinking something like a Poisson-HMM would be a nice demonstrative example of this, and one where there are many readily available baselines you could compare to.  

**Q.5.**:  (Following on from Q.4.)  Are the D-VAE, L-VAE and N-VAE all different model classes, or proposal classes?  It would be interesting to compare the inference performance of some different models on some different applications.  For instance, with sufficiently small discretization steps, an extended Kalman filter would solve the Van Der Pol oscillator problem.  How does the inference performance of both methods break down as that timestep grows larger?  Have you tested how close to an exponential family the empirical distributions are, and whether your inference objective learns models that have “better” approximate posteriors? 

**Q.6.**:  Can the authors clarify why natural gradient steps are preferable?  What would happen if you didn’t use NG, and which other methods can use NG?

**Q.7.**: How computationally expensive is each method?  You say that the Lagrange step is parallelizable, but the autoencoding variant almost certainly isn’t for sequence data (unless you use something like S4 as the RNN).  

**Q.8.**: I think I understand the constrained optimization step, but if the authors could clarify:  Instead of optimizing all the parameters freely, you switch to an EM-like alternating optimization, where the M-step looks like a constrained optimization.  This allows you to decouple the timesteps by essentially treating some of the summary statistics as fixed.  Does this coordinate-wise method have any drawbacks?    

**Q.9.**: This is a relatively core question, but can the authors concretely re-state _why_ we should consider a backward factorization of the proposal?  Specifically which step cannot be achieved if we use a forward factorization?  And where does each method break down?

### Summary
The paper develops three methods for smoothing in state-space models (SSMs). The idea is to assume SSMs that are non-linear and avoid assumptions like Gaussianity when using variational inference. The driving idea is thus to preserve the temporal structure in the variational proposal. This seems to lead to what is called "exponential family dynamical systems", that is, a double-looped (forward and backward) chain of Markovian conditionals.

### Strengths
Having carefully checked the exponential family derivations, the parameterization, as well as the derived ELBOs, I feel that likely they are correct and well-founded on previous related work. The use of exponential families in this context, and particularly to build the factorization into Markovian conditionals is definitely a strength. The work itself is clear and concise in the details, also mentioning limitations and reasoning on why certain decisions are taken.

### Weaknesses
To me, the paper has two main points of weaknesses:

[w1] — the work is in general concise and thorough, but written in a way that the smoothing idea is kind of lost. Particularly, technical details jump in to solve issues of previous technical details (derivations begin at the beginning of pp. 2 and finish at the end of pp. 7). In that way, the paper loses quite a lot of space, and story on the general smoothing idea that authors want to solve (and in which way they want to solve it). This is orthogonal to the fact that the technical details and decisions are elegant and well-constructed

[w2] — the second concern to me is the limited results. Having derived long technical details, with the approximated ELBO, the Lagrangian-based optimization and the additional algorithm, the manuscript should at least provide results proportional to the technical development. In my opinion, the evaluation of the model is somehow short (learning of two synthetic systems (pendulum and chaotic scenario) plus analysis on convergence). In this sense, I would have liked to see experiments proving the feasibility of the model with long time data or similar. (Mainly bc it is indicated that the proposed ELBO delivers a computational cost equivalent to mean-field approximations without such crude factorizations).

### Questions
Due to the accidental mistake that I made with the previous review, and the lack of time that I unfortunately gave to the authors on this rebuttal, I will focus my questions only on one point:

I'm sort of concerned with the effect of the plug-in predictive distribution in Eq. 13. In particular, I sell the decisions taken and I liked a lot the sort of factorization introduced to build the new exponential-family-based ELBO with such structure. However, re-introducing an approximation of this predictive quantity in the ELBO to obtain another approximation of the target objective makes me wonder if the ELBO is 1) still tight wrt. the marginal likelihood, 2) if it is still a lower bound, and 3) if it has drawbacks or additional problems. In that direction, details are not clear to me and I would love to hear back if there is some time still available.
