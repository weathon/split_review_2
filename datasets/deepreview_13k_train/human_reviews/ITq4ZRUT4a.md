# Davidsonian Scene Graph: Improving Reliability in Fine-grained Evaluation for Text-to-Image Generation

- Decision: Accept
- Scores: 5, 8, 5

## Abstract
Evaluating text-to-image models is notoriously difficult. A strong recent approach for assessing text-image faithfulness is based on \qga{} (question generation and answering), which uses pre-trained foundational models to automatically generate a set of questions and answers from the prompt, and output images are scored based on whether these answers extracted with a visual question answering model are consistent with the prompt-based answers.
This kind of evaluation is naturally dependent on the quality of the underlying QG and VQA models.
We identify and address several reliability challenges in existing \qga{} work: (a) QG questions should respect the prompt (avoiding hallucinations, duplications, and omissions) and (b) VQA answers should be consistent (not asserting that there is no motorcycle in an image while also claiming the motorcycle is blue).
We address these issues with \methodLong{} (\method),
an empirically grounded evaluation framework inspired by formal semantics,
which is 
adaptable to any \qga{} frameworks.
\method{} produces atomic and unique questions organized in dependency graphs, which (i) ensure appropriate semantic coverage and (ii) sidestep inconsistent answers.
With extensive experimentation and human evaluation on a range of model configurations (LLM, VQA, and T2I), we empirically demonstrate that \method{} addresses the challenges noted above.
Finally, we present \method-1k, an open-sourced evaluation benchmark that includes \num{1060} prompts, covering a wide range of fine-grained semantic categories with a balanced distribution.
We release the \method-1k prompts and the corresponding \method{} questions.

### Summary
The paper addresses the task of evaluating text-to-image models, specifically focusing on the question generation and answering method. This method automatically generate questions and answers from the prompt, and the faithfulness of the image is assessed based on the consistency of the answers from both prompt and visual question answering models. The authors identify and tackle key reliability challenges in this approach, including the quality of generated questions and the consistency of visual question answering.
To overcome these challenges, the authors introduce the Davidsonian Scene Graph (DSG), which produces atomic and unique questions organized in dependency graphs, to ensure questions cover semantic of the prompt and that answers are consistent.
The paper provides experimental results and human evaluations, demonstrating that DSG addresses the reliability challenges mentioned earlier. Additionally, the authors introduce DSG-1k, an open-sourced evaluation benchmark with 1,060 prompts covering a wide range of fine-grained semantic categories.

### Strengths
This paper introduces Davidsonian Scene Graph (DSG) to improve the faithfulness of the text-to-image evaluation. Compared to previous QG/A methods, this framework generates  atomic questions with full semantic coverage and valid question dependency. The authors implement QG step as a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) where the nodes represent the unique questions and they explicitly model semantic dependencies with directed edges. Additionally, they collect a fine-grained human-annotated benchmark called DSG-1k including 1,060 diverse prompts with a balanced distribution to facilitate research in this area.

### Weaknesses
1.	This paper improves the existing QG/A methods with Davidsonian Scene graph, which is generated based on LLMs. The approach of the work could be enriched with more details and techniques.

2.	Ablation on separate steps of DSG should be presented. For example, without establishing dependencies, measure the changes of consistency between VQA score and the human 1-5 Likert Scores.

3.	Apart from TIFA and VQ2A, more methods could be compared, including CLIPScore and caption based approaches.

### Questions
1.	In 4.1, to validate the question dependencies, authors evaluate manually on 30 samples and automatically on the full TIFA160. However, the consistency of manual and automatic evaluation is not presented.

2.	The comparison of runtime among different methods should be added. 

3.	In table 3, for Instruct-BLIP, the Spearman’s ρ of DSG is lower than that of TIFA, authors should explain this phenomenon briefly.

### Summary
This paper focuses on text-to-image generation evaluation by asking text-related questions and checking whether a VQA model can answer it given the generated image. It suggests previous QG/A frameworks usually ask ambiguous, duplicated, and invalid questions. The paper parses the input text input atomic entity/attribute/relation tuples, translates each tuple into questions, and obtains their dependencies through an LLM. The experimental results show the generated questions are unique, have valid entailment, and query atomic semantics. The paper lastly constructs a dataset with the proposed methods.

### Strengths
The paper has strong motivation. It first analyses the drawbacks of previous QG/A methods, then proposes some principles for the generated questions, and lastly introduces a three-step prompting method to resolve it.

The experimental results are strong enough to support the effectiveness of the proposed method in the proposed uniqueness, valid dependency, and human alignment.

The paper is well-written, and the related work is sufficient.

### Weaknesses
The VQA model is not good enough and hinders the final alignment to humans in T2I evaluation.

### Questions
Can a better VQA model lead to better alignment in Tables 3, 4, and 6?

### Summary
This paper studies the problem of fine-grained evaluation of text-to-image (T2I) alignment. Following a line of recent works, this paper formulates T2I alignment evaluation as visual question answering (VQA), which involves question generation from the text prompt using LLMs and question answering using VQA models (referred to as the QG/A framework).

The main contributions of this paper are:
* It identifies the issues of existing QG/A methods regarding the question generation step and proposes four properties that the generated questions should satisfy.
* It proposes a QG method that constructs the questions of a given text prompt as a Davidsonian Scene Graph (DSG). DSG considers the dependency between questions and is designed to satisfy the four properties.
* It collects a test set of 1060 prompts, which covers different challenges, semantic categories and writing styles, together with Likert-scale T2I alignment rating by humans.
* The experiments demonstrate that DSG, when combined with different VQA models, achieves a higher correlation with human evaluation compared with existing QG/A frameworks.
* It further reveals two challenges of QG/A frameworks for T2I evaluation: (1) Some question categories (e.g., shape, style and text rendering) are beyond the capability of current SOTA VQA models to evaluate. (2) For questions that involve “subjectivity” and “domain knowledge”, agreement is hard to achieve even between humans.

### Strengths
* This work reveals the issues of existing QG/A methods in terms of the QG step, which is well-motivated and the proposed four desired properties of QG are reasonable.
* The experiments demonstrate that the proposed DSG achieves solid improvement over existing QG/A frameworks in terms of correlation with human evaluation, which advances the reliability of automatic T2I alignment evaluation.
* This work is transparent about its limitations, shedding light on directions for future studies to work on.
* The paper is well-written and easy to follow.

### Weaknesses
### The design of DSG and DSG-1k
* It is not well-explained which part of DSG is designed to address the **Atomic Question** and **Full Semantic Coverage** properties. Why the QG methods of TIFA and VQ^A cannot achieve these two properties?
* Some categories are under-represented in the DSG-1k dataset. According to Table 9, six categories have less than 30 examples and VQA-Human correlation is not computed for these categories.

### Evaluation
* There is no ablation study showing which design choice in DSG contributes to each of the four properties.
* It is unclear whether DSG correlates better with humans, compared with TIFA and VQ^A, in each fine-grained category.
* The relationship between the claimed desired question properties and the final VQA-Human correlation is not well demonstrated. In other words, the relationship between Precision/Recall/Atomicity/Uniqueness in Table 2 and Spearman/Kendall correlation in Table 3 is unclear.
* There is no comparison with TIFA and VQ^2A in terms of precision and recall in Table 2.

### Questions
* It is stated on page 4 that DSG only involve binary yes/no questions. Why are there multi-choice questions in the human annotation UI in Figure 10?
