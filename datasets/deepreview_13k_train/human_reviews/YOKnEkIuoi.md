- Scores: 3, 5, 8, 8, 5

## Abstract
Inverse problems aim to determine \review{parameters} from observations, a crucial task in engineering and science. Lately, generative models, especially diffusion models, have gained popularity in this area for their ability to produce realistic solutions and their good mathematical properties. Despite their success, an important drawback of diffusion models is their sensitivity to the choice of variance schedule, which controls the dynamics of the diffusion process. Fine-tuning this schedule for specific applications is crucial but time-consuming and does not guarantee an optimal result. We propose a novel approach for learning the schedule as part of the training process. Our method supports probabilistic conditioning on data, provides high-quality solutions, and is flexible, proving able to adapt to different applications with minimum overhead. This approach is tested in two unrelated inverse problems: super-resolution microscopy and quantitative phase imaging, yielding comparable or superior results to previous methods and fine-tuned diffusion models.}.

### Summary
In this paper the authors propose to learn the schedule of the forward process for conditional diffusion models, building up on the work of   [1]. This is an interesting topic since fine-tuning the schedule can be quite time consuming. The main contribution of this paper is to make the schedule dependent on the conditioning variable and to devise an appropriate learning procedure.

### Strengths
The paper is well written and quite easy to understand, which is great. The numerical experiments/applications are interesting and show that the proposed method provides comparable or superior performance to existing methods that fine-tune the schedule.

### Weaknesses
I think that the contribution of this paper is quite marginal and is not suited for ICLR. The main difference with the methodology developed in [1] is the replacement of the unstable SNR term. While this yields good results in practice, I am not sure if this is enough novelty for a conference like ICLR.

### Summary
This paper presents a conditional extension to the prior work of Variational Diffusion Models, to allow learning the variance schedule which eliminates the need to fine-tune this choice. This goal is achieved by incorporating the conditioning information as an additional input to the diffusion denoising network and as the input to one of the component in the decomposition of the learnable variance schedule. Specifically,  the paper discusses a regularized learning approach that keeps the scale of the SNR curvatures with respect to time steps to be low. Empirically, the method shows promising results on super-resolution microscopy tasks and quantitative phase imaging tasks.

### Strengths
This paper's primary strength lies in its practical extension of variational diffusion models (VDM) to the conditioning case, including several technical improvements such as the incorporation of a regularization term on the signal-to-noise ratio. 

In addition, by adopting the VDM framework, the paper eliminates the need of prior works that fine tunes the variance schedule. 

Another strength of the paper is on the experiment study which includes two practical downstream benchmarks assessed with meaningful metrics. It also pays attention on the uncertainty quantification, which is rarely highlighted in prior works.

### Weaknesses
The biggest weakness is the paper's technical novelty. The proposed approach seems like a straightforward conditional extension to the of variational diffusion models. In addition, the paradigm of turning an unconditional model to a conditional version has been largely explored and established, e.g. [1]. I can see the decomposition of the learnable variance schedule, and the regularized learning are novel. Besides that, can the authors comment on the technical non-triviality of this extension?

Another weakness is lack of ablation study. For example, how does the method perform without using the regularized learning approach in Section 3.4?

Finally, there is a room for improvement in terms of clarity, especially in the experiment section. See my detailed comments in the below Questions section.

### Questions
1. In abstract and intro, what does "causal factors" mean?

2. The condition $A(x) = y$ is brought up in the introducation, but is not used in the method section. Does this condition specification matter?

3. Missing a background of Variational Diffusion Models (VDM) before starting the method section. And I would appreciate a more straightforward discussion to how this version extends beyond and distinguishes from VDM. 

4. I find the notation $SNR''$ on page 5 not clear enough; it might be worth out writing $SNR''(t,x)$ when it is first introduced. 

5. Missing (the reference to) the details on how the base model architecture and other training details for the competing methods. This question is important to understand whether the empirical compairison is a fair one.

6. Missing a description on competing methods, i.e. DFCAN, CDDPM, and  a discussion on how is the proposed method different from them. 

7. For the CDDPM, did you fine-tune the hyperparameters, namely the variance schedule?

8. Limited methods used for comparison. There are definitely other qualified competing methods in the diffusion space, e.g. [2], [3], [4]

9. Table1: Maybe I missed this point but what does the "resolution" metric mean?

10. Table 1: why there is only one underlined result?

11. Table 1: Why some rows do not have underlines and bolded results?

12. Table 1: How do you define statistically significant? Do you repeat the experiments for multiple times and compute the average results with standard errors? If so, please describe this detail in table or the text. 

13. Table 2a: I would suggest to add the "synthetic" description to the HCOCO dataset in the caption. 

14. Section 4.2.2, what is the "US-TIE method"?

15. Figure 3a: maybe I missed this but what do the structure and background in the legend box mean? Are they fixed values instead of learned? 

16. Figure 3a: Where does the learned uncertainty reflect in the figure, or it is not? I was thinking of a figure like Figure 4a in [1]. And how do you draw the conclusion on "We briefly point out that our uncertainty estimation is consistent with the values of β as described above" if there is no comparison between the uncertainty estimation and the values of $\beta$? 

17. I wonder how the uncertainty quantification around the reconstruction can be useful?

18. Appendix A, second paragraph, first sentence, should be "Ay=x" instead of "Ax=y"?

### Summary
The authors aim to solve inverse problems, i.e. recovering an underlying true object from imperfect measurements. The authors propose a conditional variational diffusion model (CVDM) to learn the conditional distribution of the true object given the measurement while being able to report uncertainty unlike typical supervised deep learning methods for inverse problems. CVDMs extend *unconditional* variational diffusion models (VDM; Kingma et al., 2023) to the *conditional* case in order to solve inverse problems and avoid hand-tuning the variance schedule of the diffusion process.

The authors demonstrate their model by:
1. showing competitive performance on the BioSR dataset for super-resolution in microscopy
2. showing superior performance on quantitative phase imaging (phase retrieval) on both the HCOCO dataset and their own clinical dataset.

### Strengths
The authors present an extension of VDMs to the conditional case, which has not yet been demonstrated and would indeed eliminate some hand-tuning when training conditional diffusion models. This is also well motivated by an interesting application to inverse problems in optics where uncertainty estimates would be very useful. The authors demonstrate that their learned schedules correspond well to more structured regions of their input on the super-resolution task.

### Weaknesses
While the authors motivate their work well, ~I have some concerns with the experiments performed and their presentation. I would be willing to raise my score if the following concerns are addressed.~ 

**Update**: The authors have addressed the major concerns, so I have updated my score accordingly.

**Major concerns**:

**Uncertainty results**: One of the main motivations of the paper is the ability to report uncertainty in order to point out artifacts in the solutions. In Figure 2, the authors show error images between the reconstructions and the ground truth. Do the uncertainty estimates correspond well to the regions of the image with more error?

**Performance on other datasets**: The performance is not significantly better than other methods for the BioSR super-resolution dataset. If one of the major goals is to demonstrate the flexibility and robustness of this approach, it would be nice to see comparisons against more conditional generative model datasets, especially those in the CDDPM paper (though I understand that there is a focus on inverse problems).

**Flexibility of super-resolution results**: When applied to super-resolution, this method does not require information about the PSF. This means that the model is learning the PSF implicitly from the data, but also means that the model would need to be retrained in order to get accurate results on data from a new PSF, which might be impractical if too much data is required for training. Again, the flexibility and robustness of this method is highlighted, so it would be nice to see some experiments or discussion addressing this, e.g. comparison against other blind deconvolution methods on datasets with different PSFs.

**Estimating pixelwise schedule**: The schedules demonstrated for structured versus background regions appear to be linear with different slopes for the different regions. Would other/baseline methods perform better using an estimated linear pixelwise schedule with a higher slope on "structured" regions?

**Minor concerns**:

**Fourier features**: The original VDM paper showed that a significant amount of the performance was due to the use of Fourier features. It would be helpful to know whether anything like that is the case here.

**Differences from VDM**: It would be helpful to have an explicit list or section summarizing the differences/extensions from VDM.

**Figure design**: Many of the figures are very small and laid out in a way that makes comparing images and reading text difficult, e.g. in Figure 3 it is difficult to see the sections from which the schedules are being estimated.

### Questions
In addition to the previous concerns, I would appreciate if the authors could clarify the following:

1. Does the pattern of schedules for structured versus background regions shown in Figure 2 hold true across the whole sample and for all samples?
1. Are there significant differences in the inference time of this model versus the methods being compared against?
1. Is the "US" in "US-TIE" for universal solution? Only TIE is specified in the text.

### Confidence
4: You are confident in your assessment, but not absolutely certain. It is unlikely, but not impossible, that you did not understand some parts of the submission or that you are unfamiliar with some pieces of related work.

### Summary
This papers proposes a learned scheduling approach for training conditioned diffusion model for solving imaging inverse problems. In effect, the paper takes the variational diffusion model developed by Kingma et al. and replaces its learned scheduling algorithm with one that is conditioned on observations. The paper further extends this approach by learning per-pixel variances. The proposed method is applied to super-resolution microscopy and quantitative phase imaging; it outperforms existing diffusion-based approaches in both contexts.

### Strengths
The proposed method is effective and, though relatively straightforward, novel.

Validation on real-world data is highly valuable and effectively demonstrates the utility of the proposed method.

The proposed method is general-purpose.

### Weaknesses
The paper could do a clearer job differentating itself from VDM. A bullet-pointed list of contributions would have been appreciated.



### Questions
## Minor comment
The typical convention in imaging inverse problems is y=A(x), rather than x=A(y).

### Summary
The paper presents an extension of variational diffusion models to the conditional setting. In particular, the paper makes the following novel contributions:
1. An element-wise learned variance schedule is used.
2. The learned variance schedule is factorized wrt. time and the conditioning variable.
3. The continuous time shedule is formulated in a different way than in Kingma et al. and new loss terms enforcing constraints is introduced.
The method is demonstrated on two image processing problems.

### Strengths
Developing variational diffusion models and making them practically useful is an important and timely problem.

The proposed methods appear sound and reasonable, and seem to work well in practice.

The paper includes supplementary material where ample technical details are given, allowing the reader to follow each step of the derivations.

The paper presents several novel contributions beyond the existing literature.

### Weaknesses
In the abstract, learning the variance schedule is stated as a main contribution, however it is not clear from the abstract in which way the proposed method differs from existing methods that learn the variance schedule.

In general, it is not clearly stated what the contributions are beyond previous work, particularly Kingma et al. 2023. It would be a strong improvement to have a clear list of technical contributions in the beginning of the paper, allowing the reader to have an overview from the beginning.

Before eq. 1 it is mentioned that a continuous time diffusion is used, however, the manuscripts proceeds with discrete time steps. Since in the end, the continuous time formulation is used, I wonder if the presentation could be more direct, building on the continuous time formulation in Kingma et al. 2023?

The technical novelty of the paper is fairly limited, but while the novel contributions might be minor, it could still be practically important. However, it is not absolutely clear from the paper, to what extent these contributions are important for performance. An ablation study or a direct comparison with Kingma et al. 2023 could have illuminated this more direcly.

### Questions
The introduction begins with a relatively high level discussion of inverse problems, which in my view is a bit removed from the specific contributions of the paper. Maybe it could be an idea to motivate the paper more directly by mentioning specific inverse problems that the method is suitable for, such as the super resolution microscopy problem?

"To achieve this, we adopt the framework proposed by Saharia et al. (2021), which focuses on training with the statistics of the noise at each timestep rather than direct timesteps, thus allowing flexible use of the model during inference." Could you clarify what this means?	

In the final loss, you drop the term SNR'/SNR. A large portion of the paper is dedicated to the design of the variance schedule mechanism. Would it be possible to include some more discussion / insights into why this term can reasonably be dropped? I realize this if done in many other papers as well, but usually without much discussion.
