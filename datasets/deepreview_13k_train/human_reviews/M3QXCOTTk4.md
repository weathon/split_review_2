# The Curse of Diversity in Ensemble-Based Exploration

- Decision: Accept
- Scores: 8, 8, 6, 8

## Abstract
We uncover a surprising phenomenon in deep reinforcement learning: training a diverse ensemble of data-sharing agents -- a well-established exploration strategy -- can significantly impair the performance of the individual ensemble members when compared to standard single-agent training. Through careful analysis, we attribute the degradation in performance to the low proportion of self-generated data in the shared training data for each ensemble member, as well as the inefficiency of the individual ensemble members to learn from such highly off-policy data. We thus name this phenomenon \emph{the curse of diversity}. We find that several intuitive solutions -- such as a larger replay buffer or a smaller ensemble size -- either fail to consistently mitigate the performance loss or undermine the advantages of ensembling. Finally, we demonstrate the potential of representation learning to counteract the curse of diversity with a novel method named Cross-Ensemble Representation Learning (CERL) in both discrete and continuous control domains. Our work offers valuable insights into an unexpected pitfall in ensemble-based exploration and raises important caveats for future applications of similar approaches.

### Summary
This paper is a primarily empirical paper investigating what the authors term "the curse of diversity". This phenomenon is where
individual members of a data-sharing ensemble underperform relative to their single agent counterparts due the high proportion of off-policy data relative to each individual ensemble member and the agents' inability to learn effectively from such off-policy data.

The authors first demonstrate in the bootstrapped DQN setting (a common ensemble Q-learning method) that individual ensemble members perform poorly. Then, the authors run experiments to show the underperformance of an individual learner when there is a low self-generated to "other-generated" ratio in the replay buffer. This experiment, along with some reasoning, leads to the conclusion that the curse of diversity indeed exists.

They then investigate whether the curse of diversity can be ameliorated through larger replay buffers. The results are mixed, suggesting larger replay buffers may sometimes mitigate the curse, though largely do not. They then investigate ways to reduce the curse of diversity by directly reducing diversity in the ensemble, but find that it can adversely impact the underlying ensemble method.

They then introduce Cross-Ensemble Representation Learning (CERL), as a mechanism to mitigate the curse while preserving the benefits of the underlying ensemble method. CERL works by adding auxiliary tasks to ensemble members, having them learn value functions of other ensemble members and find that CERL mitigates the curse of diversity without adversely impacting performance.

### Strengths
Presentation - The paper is extremely clear and excellently written. The problem, motivation, and experiments are articulated very clearly. I like that they look introspectively at their own experiments and reason clearly about what can be inferred/concluded from their experiments without making unreasonable intellectual leaps.

Contributions:
1. They show that perhaps the aggregation/majority voting aspect of ensembling methods may contribute to improved performance more than previously attributed. Previously, the intuition/hypothesis was more along the lines of ensembling methods inducing diversity in the data, which leads to higher-quality value estimates.
2. They demonstrate that the curse of diversity exists, at least for ensemble Double DQN methods.
3. They look at some natural ways to mitigate the curse of diversity and analyze their effectiveness.
3. They start the steps towards mitigating the curse of diversity

Experimentation: The experiments are reasonably thought out, and cover a wide range of environments (Atari/Mujoco).

### Weaknesses
I do not have any many major qualms with the paper, but I'll list a few thoughts.

Perhaps this is out of scope of the paper, but I do feel it's difficult to draw conclusions about deep RL more broadly without investigating distributional RL. For example, this paper (https://openreview.net/pdf?id=ryeUg0VFwr) shows that distributional RL will likely do better with this off-policy data. It would be interesting to investigate the extent of this phenomena in the distributional setting. 

CERL does seem to scale poorly with the ensemble size, since if the ensemble size is N, there are N x N Q-functions. In practice, this does not seem like a major problem.

For the bar plots in Figure 2, it might be helpful to plot the top plot minus the bottom plot to highlight the point.

### Summary
The paper introduces a novel observation for ensemble-based exploration: each ensemble member has significantly worse performance than single-agent baselines, even when the aggregate policies outperform them. The authors demonstrate this in experiments with Double DQN and SAC on Atari and Mujoco environments. They show that increasing the replay buffer and sharing layers reduce the effect, but do not lead to better performance. The paper proposes a novel representation learning method (CERL), in which ensemble members predict each other's targets with additional network heads. Results indicate that CERL improves the performance individual ensemble members without loosing too much diversity of their predictions.

### Strengths
The reviewer liked the paper a lot. The main hypothesis makes sense and is substantiated in multiple experiments that show the effect nicely. The paper is well written and the figures are clearly readable. More detailed figures for individual environments are provided in the appendix, which is welcome to get an idea how trustworthy the aggregate performance measures are. The proposed method is not terribly innovative, but to the best knowledge of this reviewer novel. The discussion on other representation learning methods is nice, too.

### Weaknesses
While the main paper is very well written and the experiments appear quite thorough, the reviewer took issue with the way that some conclusions were presented. In particular the connection to exploration (which is in the title) ignores some major alternative explanations of the results. While the reviewer recommends to accept the paper, some phrases *need* to be changed, and some discussion needs to be added, to prevent the casual reader from misinterpreting the text and results. These are:

1. "First, it challenges some previous work’s claims that the improved performance of approaches such as Bootstrapped DQN in some tasks comes from improved exploration" (p.3): as mentioned earlier in the paper, ensemble methods are widely used to drive exploration into unseen regions of the state-action space. However, the authors claim that "Surprisingly, simply aggregating the learned policies at test-time provides a huge performance boost in many environments" (p.3), and proceed to downplay the effect of exploration in favor of an explanation based on "aggregation". This is a problem in statements like "the two cases[, DQN(indiv.) and Double DQN,] have access to the same amount of data and have the same network capacity" (p.3), as the change in exploration means that the two algorithms are based on different data distribution and will therefore behave differently, irrespective of the on- and off-policy-ness of the data. Specifically, the individual members of the ensemble explore differently, leading to different data distributions, and this difference in data distribution is not accounted for when comparing individual ensemble member performance to a single agent baseline. The potential interaction between exploration (which part of the state-space is covered) and on-policy-ness (which member got to sample it) cannot be distinguished with the presented experiments, but the text reads as if the latter is the only obvious conclusion (see below).

2. "These results confirm our hypothesis regarding the cause of the observed performance degradation" (p.5). This is dangerous abductive reasoning: experimental evidence that is consistent with your hypothesis does not make your hypothesis true (one can only falsify a hypothesis). This may sound like a nitpick, but the paper does not discuss the exploration effect of ensembles enough. For example, in Figure 3 (middle), the BootDQN (indiv.) curve is significantly above the Passive (10%) curve. If indeed Algo 2 and Algo 3 are exactly equivalent except for how often they sample the other (non-passive) ensemble members, and *only* this affects the performance due to off-policy sampling, then both curves (which have seen the same fraction of off-policy samples) should perform identically. The fact that they do not shows that there must be another effect at work here. This could be the exploration, but the experiments do not allow to distinguish these potential effects. To be fair, the reviewer also does not know how to distinguish exploration and on-policy-ness with the given setup, but another setup might be able to (e.g. with intrinsic-reward methods where the exploration can be separated from who acts). The presented analysis is strong enough for publication (a new setup is not needed), but these ambiguities must be discussed!

3. While the reviewer liked most experiments (e.g. Figure 3 and 4 are great!), Figure 5 seems to test DQN with a very small replay buffer, where even the aggregated ensemble does not perform as well as Double DQN. This makes some conclusions suspect. For example, does the aggregated performance improve when more layers are shared? Or does the ensemble become indistinguishable from the baseline? If the authors would have picked a larger replay buffer (e.g. 4M), the performance would improve in the first and worsen in the second case. This would have an impact, as it shows that sharing layers in the ensemble reduces the positive effect it can have (e.g. by exploration). The choice of a 1M replay buffer, while common, obscures the potential for the ensemble to outperform the baseline with a larger replay buffer, and the effect of layer sharing on this potential.

4. The main hypothesis of the paper is that "the curse of diversity" hurts individual member performance due the large number of off-policy samples. This makes sense, as an individual member can make 90% of all decisions correctly and still have poor performance, whereas a majority vote of the ensemble will agree with high certainty on the correct action. Ultimately this is the reason why BootDQN explores well. However, CERL seems to have almost as much diversity as the L=0 ensemble. CERL is a representation learning algorithm, which seems to be at odds with the main hypothesis. Contrast this with BootDQN which switches ensemble members mid-episode. If this algorithm would improve individual performance, the reviewer would accept it as a fix of the identified problem. With CERL presented as the "solution", the reviewer wonders: is the underlying problem is indeed "diversity"? Please discuss why representation learning fixes the off-policy-ness of the data (there are some attempts, but it is still vague). It is not clear how learning a shared representation addresses the core issue of off-policy data for individual ensemble members, as the data is still generated by different policies.

### Questions
- If one accepts the idea that ensembles are primarily for exploration, then the diversity of responses is actually a feature, not a bug. Given that few wrong decisions per episode can significantly reduce the performance of an individual ensemble member, why do the authors actually consider the poor individual performance an issue, in particular when the aggregate performance is better than the baseline (e.g. on Mujoco)?
- How did the baseline (Double DQN and vanilla SAC) explore? If the baseline worked so well, doesn't this imply exploration is not very important in the tested environments? How would the analysis look like if it would concentrate on hard-exploration environments?

### Summary
This work studies the problem of off-policy-ness in ensemble learning. Motivated by the recent discovery in offline RL (i.e., the tandem paper), and empirical observations in ensemble learning methods of BootstrapDQN and naive ensemble SAC, the authors introduce a representation learning approach that considers the off-policy data in auxiliary tasks.
Experiments on continuous control and discrete control demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

After rebuttal, I increased my overall rating from 5 to 6, soundness score from 2 to 3, and contribution score from 2 to 3.

### Strengths
I like the way this paper is presented. It is clearly motivated by empirical discoveries, together with reasonings, and followed by solutions to the identified problems.

The authors made great efforts in conducting and presenting experiments. Results are reported in a statistically-identifiable way. I really appreciate it.

### Weaknesses
### On high-level Motivation:

I’m lost in the motivation of using ensemble in **policy learning**. As has been demonstrated in [EDAC] and [REDQ], I acknowledge that using ensemble learning for the **value function** could lead to improved performance, as the value can be more accurate, with uncertainty. But what is the motivation for having **multiple policies** for ensemble (because they are sample generators, rather than learners). Should not those samplers aim at more efficiently decreasing the uncertainty in the value function?

This is a concern with the continuous setting. BootstrapDQN is purely a **value-based** method, and in discrete tasks, the epsilon-greedy exploration can be regarded as sampling from an off-policy uniform policy, this should not be a problem.

### On BootstrapDQN:

In BootstrapDQN, different samples are assigned different weights to analog bootstrap sampling. It would not be surprising to see individual BootstrapDQN perform worse than DDQN. To verify the claim that *BootstrapDQN’s performance improvement is purely based on voting* made by the authors, a comparison between Bootstrap Sampling/ normal sampling; and a comparison between majority voting and 


Figure 2: The reported results of SAC can not match the open-source implementations. This might be due to the usage of a different size of buffer (200k). Could the authors please explain more about this?


### On Performance:

The performance of CERL seems marginal in Figure 7. Also in Figure 7, BootstrapDQN seems not helpful at all.


### On related work:

This work [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2209.07288.pdf] discussed the ensemble learning that trades off between exploration and exploitation using different reward values may also be worth a discussion.

This work [https://openreview.net/forum?id=NOApNZTiTNU] and [REDQ] discussed the usage of the ensemble in Q-learning. REDQ has been considered to be state-of-the-art since 2021.

### Summary
The paper proposes a new way of ensembling RL agents. N neural network value functions are trained, consisting of a convolutional encoder and a value head. Each encoder has a main value head, so we have N main value heads. For each encoder, N value heads are trained with temporal difference, each using as the target one of the main value heads. That gives us N^2 value heads in total. This improves representation learning and data utilization. There are extensive experiment showing that training ensembles of RL agents with other methods are hard, while the proposed method works well. There are experiments on atari with DQN and mujoco with SAC.

### Strengths
- The observation that training ensembles of RL agents is hard is interesting and is analyzed well
- The proposed method is novel and sound
- The experiments are comprehensive and demonstrate the benefits of the method
