# Rethinking pseudo-labeling: Data-centric insights improve semi-supervised learning

- Decision: Reject
- Scores: 3, 6, 5, 6

## Abstract
Pseudo-labeling is a popular semi-supervised learning technique to leverage unlabeled data when labeled samples are scarce. The generation and selection of pseudo-labels heavily rely on labeled data. Existing approaches implicitly assume that the labeled data is gold standard and “perfect”. However, this can be violated in reality with issues such as mislabeling or ambiguity. We address this overlooked aspect and show the importance of investigating labeled data quality to improve any pseudo-labeling method. Specifically, we introduce a novel data characterization and selection framework called DIPS to extend pseudo-labeling. We select useful labeled and pseudo-labeled samples via analysis of learning dynamics. We empirically demonstrate that DIPS improves the performance of various pseudo-labeling methods on real-world datasets across multiple modalities, including tabular and images, with minimal computational overhead. Additionally, DIPS improves data efficiency and reduces the performance distinctions between different pseudo-labelers. Overall, we highlight the significant benefits of a data-centric rethinking of pseudo-labeling in real-world settings.

### Summary
Pseudo-labeling technique is widespread semi-supervised learning nowadays. In most works it is assumed that labeled data have golden correct labels, while authors of the paper highlight that in real world cases labeled data comes with label noise. One of the main contributions of the paper is raising this issue with data centric AI perspective  and focusing on its properties and solutions (though label noise problem is known and tackled before for supervised training only). Authors propose simple yet effective selection algorithm, dubbed DIPS, which is plug and play and applicable to most pseudo-labeling algorithms: both labeled (assumed to be with label noise) and unlabeled data are selected based on both confidence and uncertainty for next teacher-student training. Uncertainty estimation is proposed to be based on the training dynamics: variation of predictions between different checkpoints. Authors validate necessity of proposed method on couple of domains: tabular data and image classification.

### Strengths
- Presentation of results and overall writing is of high quality
- Highlighting label noise problem in labeled data for semi-supervised learning and considering this problem from data centric AI point of view
- Proposed selection / filtering of labeled data during teacher-student process
- Results for two domains: image and tabular data with variety of datasets to show wide usage and applicability of the proposed method, as well as coverage of labeled and unlabeled data coming from different data distributions
- Robustness in the sense that different PL algorithms with proposed selection becomes close to each other in the final performance. This is very nice property as then doesn't matter what to use in practice and this speeds up development and deployment.

### Weaknesses
 - Authors do not disambiguate the problem into two axes: i) amount of label noise ii) amount of data in labeled data. It is well known that with small amount of labeled data (not even relative to the unlabelled, but itself, say 1k-10k images, 10min-10h of speech) it is very problematic to train pseudo-labeling algorithms with good quality due to both weak initial teacher and other training dynamics. I suspect complicated dependency between label noise level and amount of labeled data (besides amount of unlabeled data) which authors do not investigate in depth.
- Absence of simple basic baselines where we apply straightforward the label noise methods to labeled data and perform standard teacher-student training. "In such situations, as shown in Fig. 1, noise propagates to the pseudo-labels, jeopardizing the accuracy of the pseudo-labeling steps" -- if we could train on small amount of labeled data with any method of learning with noisy labels then first teacher will be strong. It is not shown in the paper that all prior methods of learning with noisy labels fail on small amount of labeled data in supervised learning and thus sec 3.2 first part is overstated.
- "PL methods do not update the pseudo-labels of unlabeled samples once they are incorporated in one of the $\mathcal{D}_{train}^{(i)}$ -- authors incorrectly (check out e.g. Xie, Qizhe, et al. "Self-training with noisy student improves imagenet classification." Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF conference on computer vision and pattern recognition. 2020) formulate teacher-student pseudo-labeling widely used and thus overstated issues in second part of sec 3.2. On the next iteration of teacher-student training all unlabeled data are relabeled, some selection based on confidence or/and uncertainty is applied to pseudo-labels and then labeled data and these new pseudo-labeled data are combined (or labeled data can be skipped) to train new student model. I never saw in prior works on any teacher-student training (when new student is trained from scratch on new data) for images, text and speech input data that old pseudo-labels (from older teacher) are used along with new ones (with latest teacher).
- Absence of empirical analysis showing that confidence filtering of labeled data is not enough and aleatoric uncertainty is necessary. Also there are no baselines with widely used uncertainty-based filtering for pseudo-labeled data to be used for labeled data -- motivating usage of aleatoric uncertainty.
- Absence of empirical justification of the proposed selection method for unlabeled data only, as then we also have mislabeling and thus it should be effective there too assuming all labeled data are correctly labeled. It could be also that maybe proposed selection is only needed for labeled data while any prior selection methods could be used for unlabeled data.
- Paper conceptually messes up between teacher-student PL methods and the ones when one model continuously trains on data with time-to-time regenerated pseudo-labels by either EMA model or by previous model states. These two approaches have different training dynamics and problems (e.g. second one is less stable).
  - Training of "greedy PL" in sec. 5.1 (which is the latter type of PL methods) is out of initial formulation of PL in sec 3.1. Moreover, there is no results in Fig 3 for the zero corrupted samples, it seems PL itself it not improving upon supervised training in this toy example which is strange (looking at x=0.1)
  - Baselines in sec 5.2 are a mixture of both methods, which is not aligned again with formulation in sec 3.1.
  - Algo 1 in Appendix A does not cover the second approach, e.g. greedy PL method.

### Questions
- I do not agree entirely with statement "labeled data are noisy" as if labeled data are very limited in a lot of applications we could ask for the golden (correct) labels, as we need only small amount. 
- "application: these works use pseudo-labeling as a tool for supervised learning, whereas DIPS extends the machinery of pseudo-labeling itself." I don't see really huge difference here, as noisy labels means - we don't know the correct label, so mathematically it is very close tasks and solutions.
- why do we use checkpoints for the learning dynamic being epoch and not some parameter based on number of iterations? For very large data we will never do 1 epoch, or only 1 epoch, or only few and thus measure based on epochs will be weak. From appendix info it is not clear even what checkpoints are selected and how this selection important.
- did authors try to exclude some first epochs from confidence and uncertainty definition as they could be not very informative?
- I don't understand this statement "Recall aleatoric uncertainty captures the inherent data uncertainty, hence is a principled way to capture issues such as mislabeling". Why does aleatoric uncertainty capture mislabeling? Why def. 4.2 is aleatoric as we consider variation across checkpoints (= over learning process)? 
- What is the upper bound (when all data are labeled and when all data are labeled and correct / w/o mislabeling) in Fig. 4?
- How many iterations are done for teacher-student baselines in Fig. 4?
- This statement is incorrect "Note that s is solely used to select pseudo-labeled samples, among those which have not already been pseudo-labeled at a previous iteration." in both types of algorithms like greedy PL and UPS we relabel and reselect pseudo-labeled data.
- How the parameters of the baselines in Appendix B1 are found? Why it is not adopted per dataset? I see that aleatoric uncertainty is adopted per dataset, which could be unfair parameters selection for the baselines.
- B 3.1, 3.2 what does it mean T=5 for greedy PL and for UPS? Could authors describe exactly how they do PL for both algo with 5 iterations? Does it mean that for UPS it is 5 teacher-student trainings and for greedy PL 5 teacher-student trainings with each student training based on the original prior work where we continuously train model?
- What will happen if ablation in C2 is done only for labeled data selection and unlabeled data are selected based on PL prior works?
- What is the percentage of selected data by every method, including authors', on every iteration?
- What about Fig 11 with vanilla PL but w/o any data selection?

### Summary
This paper explores an often overlooked scenario in pseudo-labels (PLs) in semi-supervised learning (SSL), where the labeled data used for training is considered perfect. This paper breaks this assumption and shows that noise in the initial labeled set can be propagated to the pseudo-labels and hurt the final performance. To tackle this issue, a Data-centric Insights for semi-supervised learning (DIPS) framework is proposed. It selectively uses useful training samples among labeled and pseudo-labeled examples for every self-training iterations based on the learning dynamics of each example. DIPs has three properties which can be practical in real use and experiments are conducted on various real world datasets across different modalities.

### Strengths
- The motivation for considering the quality of labeled data is clearly presented, connected to real use cases. In addition, the pilot experiment in Figure 3 demonstrates that addressing the inherent noise in labeled data is necessary and that previous (standard) pseudo-labeling algorithms can fail on this setting. 

- Writing quality needs to be acknowledged. All sections are well organized, and easy to follow. Especially for the experiments part, dividing a section into several paragraphs and giving a short summary of the results was a good idea. In addition a supplementary material covers a lot of details including additional ablation experiments. 

- Although a simple data filtering method, the effectiveness of the proposed DIPS was impressive, since it achieves consistent improvements on various real-world cases.

### Weaknesses
 - It seems that this paper is not the first to concern the inherent label noise in the labeled data and take the data-centric approach. It is necessary to discuss and compare with [L. Schmarje et al.,2022] to more clarify the conceptual novelty.

- Connection to the active learning literature is missing. Selection metric for the ‘useful’ data samples among the unlabeled data pool is of central interest in active learning. The term ‘usefulness’ can include various criterions, such as confidence and uncertainty (as in this work), coverage, diversity, and etc. In that sense, more comprehensive discussions and comparisons on selection metrics are expected. Related to this issue, how the quality and diversity (e.g., class distributions) of the selected training samples change for every generation?

- Choice of the threshold parameters $\tau_{\text{conf}}$ and $\tau_{\text{al}}$ seems to be very important. For example, highly tight thresholds (i.e., high $\tau_{\text{conf}}$ and low $\tau_{\text{al}}$) will remain only a few samples for training likely to be correct and abundant samples yet include noise for the vice versa. As the proposed algorithm is not designed to make a correction on the mislabeled samples but filter potentially harmful examples, exploring such trade-offs between remaining data proportion and performance depending on the thresholds will be valuable. 

- Considering the computational aspects, it could be nearly free when the scale of unlabeled data is relatively small (i.e., in vision domain, CIFAR-10/100). In other words, when the scale of the unlabeled dataset grows large (i.e., million-scale samples such as ImageNet), computational overheads caused by evaluating labeled and pseudo-labeled examples with all checkpoints in previous rounds cannot be ignored.

- Although the presented work mainly targets semi-supervised learning on tabular data, baselines have been taken only from the image domain and comparison with SSL methods specific to tabular data such as [J. Yoon et al., 2020] is not given.

- The proposed DIPS framework follows the iteration-based self-training scheme, while a typical pseudo-label-based SSL algorithm such as FixMatch doesn’t. FixMatch takes both labeled and unlabeled data and learns from both supervision signals (i.e., labels and online pseudo-labels). But the self-training scheme makes offline pseudo-labels after an iteration phase and some selected pseudo-labeled examples considered labeled data in the self-training next iteration. It seems to be a conflict between two different mechanisms. Hence, an illustrative example of how the non-iteration-based SSL algorithms can be incorporated into the DIPS framework is expected.

### Summary
The paper addresses the challenge of dealing with inaccurately labeled data in semi-supervised learning contexts, where the small amount of labeled data available may contain errors. Contrary to the common presumption that labeled data is error-free, real-world scenarios often present labeling inaccuracies due to factors like mislabeling or ambiguity. To mitigate this problem, the authors introduce a method called DIPS, which is designed to discern and select the most reliable labeled data and pseudo-labels for unlabeled data throughout the training process.

### Strengths
1. The paper is grounded in a well-justified research gap, addressing the often overlooked errors in labeled data from prior studies.
2. The method proposed is both straightforward and impactful, demonstrating its efficacy across multiple tabular datasets as well as select small-scale computer vision datasets.
3. The authors have furnished extensive experimental details to facilitate reproduction.

### Weaknesses
1. While the authors assert that DIPS is intended to be a versatile tool that can be seamlessly merged with current pseudo-labeling strategies, the experiments are mainly limited to tabular datasets. It would be beneficial to extend testing to the USB benchmark, encompassing datasets from computer vision, natural language processing, and speech to better demonstrate DIPS's generalizability. I will reconsider my score if more experiments are conducted.

2. The sections on Notation and Methodology are challenging to interpret. Transferring the pseudo-code to the Methodology section could enhance clarity and comprehension.

### Summary
This paper rethinks Semi-Supervised Learning from a data-centric view, that is, the labeled data may be not reliable and may contain noise in real-world applications. In this case, previous semi-supervised learning methods, which heavily rely on labeled data, are no longer applicable, showing low data efficiency. The author proposes a method for selecting high-quality data based on the average confidence and aleatoric uncertainty of historical predictions during the training process. Experimental results demonstrate that this method can identify reliable data, improve the data efficiency of semi-supervised learning, and adapt to different pseudo-labeling algorithms.

### Strengths
1. The proposal is simple and technologically reasonable.
2. The experiments seem comprehensive, and the author has analyzed the effectiveness and practicality of the proposed method from multiple perspectives. From the results, the proposed method has consistently achieved performance improvements.
3. Overall, this paper presents an interesting problem and provides a simple and effective solution. This could have a positive impact on the practical application of SSL in the real world.

### Weaknesses
1. This paper focuses more on tabular data, which is different from the image data that the main SSL algorithms currently focus on. The experiments conducted in this article regarding images are still limited. 
2. This paper improves the robustness of SSL against noisy labeled data through a simple data selection method. However, further analysis is not provided regarding the reasons for the success of this data selection. Is there a theoretical connection between the statistical features of historical predictions (average confidence and aleatoric uncertainty in this paper) and the improvement in pseudo-label quality in SSL? Under what conditions does this method work effectively for the overall quality of labeled data, such as the proportion of label noise? More in-depth analysis can further improve this paper.

### Questions
Q: Can the author provide more discussion and analysis to demonstrate the conditions under which this proposal is successful?
