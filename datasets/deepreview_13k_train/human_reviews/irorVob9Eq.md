# Towards the Characterization of Representations Learned via Capsule-based Network Architectures

- Decision: Reject
- Scores: 5, 6, 6

## Abstract
Capsule Networks (CapsNets) have been re-introduced as a more compact and interpretable alternative to standard deep neural networks. While recent efforts have proved their compression capabilities, to date, their interpretability properties have not been fully assessed.
Here, we conduct a systematic and principled study towards assessing the interpretability of these types of networks. Moreover, we pay special attention towards analyzing the level to which \textit{part-whole} relationships are indeed encoded within the learned representation.
Our analysis in the MNIST, SVHN, PASCAL-part and CelebA datasets suggest that the representations  encoded in CapsNets might not be as disentangled nor strictly related to \textit{parts-whole} relationships as is commonly stated in the literature.

3: You are fairly confident in your assessment. It is possible that you did not understand some parts of the submission or that you are unfamiliar with some pieces of related work. Math/other details were not carefully checked.

### Summary
The paper studies the interpretability properties of Capsule Neural Networks. It mainly focuses on the part-whole relationships encoded within the learned representations. The analysis results point out that capsule-based networks may not be related to parts-whole relationships as stated in the literature.

### Strengths
i) The paper conducts extensive analysis and visualization of the capsule network. 

ii) The proposed permutation-based analysis and relevant unit selection are reasonable, and the analysis results support the paper's conclusion.

### Weaknesses
i) The experiments are mostly conducted on the small-scale dataset, such ass MINIST and SVHN, and the image resolution is also relatively small, which makes the results not convincing, and the visual difference between the baseline method and the proposed method is not obvious.

ii) The experiments are all conducted based on ConvNets. Does the conclusion hold based on a transformer-based network?

iii) The discussed related works are mostly before 2020. There have been many works about capsule networks in recent years that have not been discussed.

### Summary
This work introduces a principled approach for assessing the properties of capsule networks, focused around the investigation of relevant units in the network. This serves as an initial investigation in the lacking related literature concerning CapsNets. Qualitative and quantitative evaluations on benchmark datasets (MNIST, SVHN, PASCAL-Part, CelebA and CelebAMask-HQ) reveal a potential entanglement of the emerging representations, contradicting previous findings/claims in the related CapsNet literature.

### Strengths
This work considers an analysis of the disentanglement of the representations (features) in the context of CapsNets. To the best of my knowledge, this constitutes one of the first attempts towards analysis of CapsNets in this setting. The motivation is clear and the considered setting is sound. This approach introduces an appropriate interval for pertubation analysis via first-order statistics The authors consider a variety of standard benchmark architecture, similar to related recent methods, and assess different configurations and settings.

### Weaknesses
Due to the fact that the authors consider multiple settings and configurations, some parts of the paper are not easy to read; some missing definitions and notation inconsistency further interrupt the flow.

Starting with the definition of the first-order statistics in the perturbation analysis section, the authors introduce $A_c = [a_{1,c}^l, a_{2,c}^l, \dots, a_{s,c}^l]$, where $A_c \in \mathbb{R}^{S' \times A'}$. However: (i) $A_c$ seems to be layer-specific; omitting this breaks the flow of the paper, and (ii) at the same time, $S'$ and $A'$ are never defined. Is $S'$ the set of examples corresponding to class $c$? and what is $A'$? I would assume that $A' = w \times h \times d$, but it is never defined. 

In a similar vein, why are the first order statistics again $\in \mathbb{R}^{S'\times A'}$? Since a reduction takes places, the dimensionality should be different. The authors then introduce $A_{all} = [A_1;A_2;\dots ; A_1^M] \in \mathbb{R}^{D \times A'}$. I am assuming that $A_1^M$ is a typo that should be $A_M$. Again this is layer specific and misses the $l$ superscript (which appears in the $\alpha$ definition afterwards). Does this matrix comprise the first order statistics or $A_c$ themselves? The authors define $A_{all}$ as the concatentation of the $A_c$ matrices, but note that this is composed of the first order statistics. In this context, wouldn't an $\alpha$ value based only on $A_c$ make more sense for the sensitivity analysis? Different classes activate $v_j$ with different magnitudes; when an entry for one example is small and is altered with a $\xi$ that is very larger, it can easily lead to massive changes in the reconstruction. I fully understand the need for a more principled definition of $A_c$; I am not $100\%$ certain that this formulation captures the subtle differences in the activations between the examples. What are the values that the other works consider?

Moving on to the experimental section, for the perturbation analysis, I re-iterate my point about the magnitude of the perturbation. Even though the argument that the authors could easily hold, I am still concerned about the impact of the perturbation magnitude is the decoding process. Since the decoder it's not just a simple linear layer, a large change (compared to the original magnitudes of the vector) in the entry of vector $v_j$ can lead to misleading results. 

The visualization in Fig. 2 is not clear, a description of what each color represents is important for understanding what is happening. 

Further details are also necessary in the caption of Fig. 4. Without running back and forth to the relevant section, it is not clear what the different plots depict. What are the $D_0-D_9$ legends? I suppose they are the digits of the datasets. 

I can't see how the Relevance Mass Accuracy metric is an appropriate  proxy for measuring the part-whole relationship. This is a metric for measuring the spatial overlap between ground truth masks and a 2D positive valued image with a single channel.  How does this relate to heatmaps arising from spatially re-arranged responses of capsules is not clear to me. It is possible that I am missing the intuition and the formulation behind this construction. I could understand the approach for activation maps for convolutional maps but not for capsules. 

Figure 6 is not very clear. A more detailed caption can help clarify what each column depicts without the need to re-look at the text. 

The authors note that "Overall, the mean of RMA is lower than what was anticipated". What was anticipated and how this conclusion was reached? Potentially this ties to the previous point. After the analysis, the authors themselves note that "the observed low overlap may have its origin in other sources". I personally don't find this particular analysis to be adequate to draw conclusions about the part-whole relationship of CapsNets. It may very well be true as the authors claim, but further investigation is needed.

### Summary
The paper focuses on Capsule Networks (CapsNets), which have been reintroduced as a compact and interpretable alternative to deep neural networks. While previous research has highlighted their compression capabilities, this paper aims to conduct a systematic and principled study to assess the interpretability properties of CapsNets, specifically examining the encoding of part-whole relationships within learned representations.

To evaluate interpretability, the authors analyze several capsule-based architectures using MNIST, SVHN, PASCAL-part, and CelebA datasets. The findings suggest that the representations encoded in CapsNets may not be as disentangled or strictly related to part-whole relationships as commonly claimed in the literature.

The contributions of the paper lie in conducting a thorough and rigorous investigation into the interpretability of CapsNets. By challenging the prevailing notion of highly disentangled representations and strict part-whole relationships, the authors provide valuable insights that facilitate a better understanding of the limitations and characteristics of CapsNets as interpretability-focused models.

### Strengths
+ The paper stands out for conducting a systematic and principled study to evaluate the interpretability properties of Capsule Networks (CapsNets).

+ The authors analyze multiple datasets (MNIST, SVHN, PASCAL-part, CelebA) and employ various capsule-based architectures, providing a comprehensive evaluation of interpretability in CapsNets. This extensive analysis strengthens the robustness of their conclusions and allows for a broader understanding of the limitations in terms of part-whole relationships.

### Weaknesses
 - The study focuses on a specific type of neural network architecture (CapsNets) and evaluates interpretability properties on a limited set of datasets (MNIST, SVHN, PASCAL-part, CelebA). Maybe large-scale datasets should be also considered, such as ImageNet. The choice of datasets, while standard for CapsNet research, limits the generalizability of the findings regarding interpretability. Specifically, the datasets used are relatively low-resolution and may not fully capture the complexities of real-world images where part-whole relationships are more intricate. Furthermore, the analysis does not explore the behavior of CapsNets on datasets with more complex object hierarchies or occlusions, which could reveal further limitations in their interpretability. The absence of experiments on datasets with a larger number of classes also raises concerns about the scalability of the observed interpretability properties.
