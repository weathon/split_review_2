# SciBench: Evaluating College-Level Scientific Problem-Solving Abilities of Large Language Models

- Decision: Reject
- Scores: 6, 3, 5, 8, 6

## Abstract
Most existing Large Language Model (LLM) benchmarks on scientific problem reasoning focus on problems grounded in high-school subjects and are confined to elementary algebraic operations.
To systematically examine the reasoning capabilities required for solving complex scientific problems, we introduce an expansive benchmark suite \ours for LLMs.
\ours contains a carefully curated dataset featuring a range of collegiate-level scientific problems from mathematics, chemistry, and physics domains.
Based on the dataset, we conduct an in-depth benchmarking study of representative open-source and proprietary LLMs with various prompting strategies.
The results reveal that current LLMs fall short of delivering satisfactory performance, with the best overall score of merely 43.22\%. Furthermore, through a detailed user study, we categorize the errors made by LLMs into ten problem-solving abilities. Our analysis indicates that no single prompting strategy significantly outperforms the others and some strategies that demonstrate improvements in certain problem-solving skills could result in declines in other skills.
We envision that \ours will catalyze further developments in the reasoning abilities of LLMs, thereby ultimately contributing to scientific research and discovery.

### Summary
This paper introduces SCIBENCH, a benchmark suite aimed at addressing the challenges associated with the reasoning capabilities of language models when solving complex scientific problems. SCIBENCH consists of two datasets: an open set containing collegiate-level scientific problems from mathematics, chemistry, and physics textbooks, and a closed set comprising problems from undergraduate-level exams in computer science and mathematics. The authors conduct a benchmarking study using five representative language models, employing zero-shot, few-shot, COT, and tool-augmented prompting strategies. This bench is challenge and the current state-of-the-art model (GPT-4) exhibit unsatisfactory performance, achieving only a 35.8% overall score on the benchmark. Furthermore, the paper identifies ten problem-solving abilities and categorizes the errors made by language models accordingly. The analysis demonstrates that no single prompting strategy consistently outperforms others, and there is a trade-off between improving certain skills and hindering others.

### Strengths
1. Proposing a reliable dataset to evaluate the reasoning ability of existing language models is crucial. This dataset proposed by the authors has two main advantages:

* The dataset is highly challenging, and the performance of GPT-4 is comparatively poor. The questions are all free-form, which helps prevent the model from result guesses based on multiple-choice answers. Furthermore, the dataset can effectively differentiate between different large language models (LLMs). (Open-source models like LLaMA-2-70B exhibit significantly inferior performance when compared to their closed-source counterparts.)

* The construction of this dataset avoids the issue of data leakage during the testing process. Throughout the dataset's construction, measures were taken to ensure that the questions should not be readily accessible online and cannot be easily extracted or transformed into text.


2. In the analysis section, the author further defines ten skills involved in the reasoning process and provides a detailed analysis of error cases. 

3. To assess the reasoning ability of language models, this dataset serves as an good supplementary resource and is a valuable resource for the community.

### Weaknesses
The analysis section could be further enhanced. For instance, regarding the observation "The zero-shot learning setting exhibits comparable performance to the few-shot learning setting," did the author conduct comprehensive testing on different in-context examples to ascertain consistent findings? Different qualities of few-shot examples may yield different results. High-quality prompts and in-context examples should help stimulate the model's capabilities.



Why does utilizing prompts from Wolfram hinder the capabilities of the model? What specific attempts have been made, and could it be due to inadequate adjustments to the prompts? It would be more appropriate to refrain from drawing such a statement without further investigation.



On page8, third line from the bottom, is it written incorrectly? Is "15.2% of casual ability" referring to the zero-shot setting?



Few-shot prompting leads to a trade-off in skills. Is this due to the content of the example prompts? Can it be resolved by replacing few-shot examples?

### Confidence
5: You are absolutely certain about your assessment. You are very familiar with the related work and checked the math/other details carefully.

### Summary
A new dataset consisting of 695 prompts is introduced to test how well several LLMs (GPT-4, Claude, LLaMA) perform in college-level scientific reasoning tasks: math, physics, chemistry. The authors evaluate along different assessment axes how well various approaches performed (e.g. Zero-Shot with CoT, Few-Shot with CoT etc.). They conclude that the mastery of problem solving ability remains weak.

### Strengths
- a good selection of LLMs was used
- state of the art methods, such as CoT is used
- LLMs are allowed to use tools

### Weaknesses
 - the name of the paper, SciBench, is similar to another dataset, called *BIG-bench* (https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.046159), which also overlaps partly with SciBench. Nonetheless BIG-bench is not cited.
- not quite novel impact of the dataset: Some important reasoning datasets on college-level (and beyond) were omitted from the literature review, e.g., *Mathematical Capabilities of ChatGPT* (https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.13867) and *NaturalProofs* (https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.01112) for math, which both already do some of the things SciBench proposed to achieve (see page 4, "Enabling of assessing advanced problem solving ability" which both mentioned papers achieve; and "Inclusion of college-level problems" and "Inaccessibility in text formats" which the first reference paper achieves.)        
The *Mathematical Capabilities of ChatGPT* paper also essentially collects error profiles, as the authors do in Figure 3, as does the *NaturalProver* paper (https://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.12910.pdf), not to be confused with *NaturalProofs*
- There should be a more detailed, in-text comparison with these datasets mentioned above to highlight similarities and differences of SciBench with these other, pertinent datasets. I also have some doubts (see *Questions* section), if Table 1 is really 100% accurate.
- 695 examples is a rather small dataset
- Section 5: "From 112 such error annotations and with the assistance of GPT-4, we distill these errors into ten essential skills that GPT-3.5 might lack". Using a LLM to make a decision is a source of errors. It would be best if no LLM were used - and if it is used, a very detailed explanation should be given of how exactly it provided assistance.

### Questions
- I don't understand how the annotation process works. Do the authors mean by that an evaluation of the output of the model (by humans)? Or do they mean that the existing input data into the LLM was augmented ("annotated")?
If the former was meant, then why does the MATH dataset in Table 1, in the Analysis column, under "Auto" have a "No"? This is incorrect, the MATH uses automatic evaluation by virtue of constraining the output in the \boxed{...} environment.

### Summary
This paper presents SciBench, a benchmark that includes two new curated datasets, one of problems extracted from college-level textbooks in subjects like mathematics, chemistry, and physics, and another of problems from undergraduate exams in computer science and mathematics. The work evaluates five LLMs with different prompting methods and categorizes different problem-solving abilities and errors made by LLMs.

### Strengths
1. The high-level categorization into different types of abilities and errors contributes to benchmarking in the field.

2. The authors highlight the limitations of previous models and methods.

3. The paper is well-written.

### Weaknesses
1. The work evaluates five LLMs; however is critically missing GPT-4 with code interpreter (ADA). The results are now superseded by GPT-4 turbo.

2. The work lacks a comparison with state-of-the-art methods such as hypothesis search and refinement and the use of a code interpreter.

3. Textbooks used for the new dataset are available online in pdf format which is easily converted into text. It is unclear that the dataset does not consist of questions on which the models have already been trained on.

4. The selection criteria of the college textbooks and exams for the new datasets lack detailed explanation and justification.

5. The abilities and errors may be extended and refined by dividing into sub-categories.

### Questions
How many of the questions in the new datasets are available online by search? or in the latest LLMs?

### Summary
This paper introduces an interesting and valuable benchmark dataset called SCIBENCH. The dataset contains challenging college-level problems in physics, chemistry, and mathematics, as well as detailed solutions, which facilitates detailed analysis of model performance. The inclusion of free-response questions rather than just multiple-choice further increases the difficulty and better tests true reasoning skills.

### Strengths
The dataset is comprehensive. And the experiments compare several representative LLMs on SCIBENCH under different prompting strategies like chain-of-thought, zero-shot learning, and using Python/Wolfram tools. The results demonstrate SCIBENCH's ability to differentiate model capacities, with the top score of only 35.8% by GPT-4, highlighting room for improvement.

### Weaknesses
The paper is well-written, and the methodology is sound.  The only problem is that the name of SCIBENCH may be little overclaiming, with problems focused only on physics, chemistry, and math.

### Questions
The paper claims SCIBENCH problems require "multiple steps of reasoning." Is it possible to quantify the complexity and difficulty of the dataset? For example, the GSM8k dataset has 3~4 steps in solutions, which is a mathematical reasoning dataset.

The essential skill set was defined with just two human annotators. Was any inter-annotator agreement analysis performed to ensure consistency?

### Summary
This paper provides a benchmark, SciBench, for solving scientific problems. The previous benchmark datasets for measuring the ability of large language models (LLMs) were for the middle school or high school subjects, and only contain multiple-choice questions. The authors collect two datasets, one open-set and one closed-set, containing college-level scientific questions. Through this dataset, the authors also provide an in-depth discussion of the current inability of LLMs and how they mistake.

### Strengths
- This benchmark is more challenging than the previous related benchmarks, and annotations and varied evaluation methods are provided.
- The evaluation result with multiple LLMs is exhaustive and suggestive to the community.
- The paper also provides LLM-based error analysis for incorrect responses, which is an interesting way as a novel benchmarking approach.

### Weaknesses
 - The experiments report a combination of external tools and few-shot learning. On the other hand, Table 4 shows that the accuracy of few-shot learning is sometimes lower than that of zero-shot learning. The reviewer would like to know why the authors did not try the combination of external tools and zero-shot learning.
- In the experiment, if the LLM responses were within a relative error of 0.05 as a numerical value, they were considered to be correct. On the other hand, as shown in the center of Figure 1, there are cases where the numerical calculation is wrong even though the idea or formula itself is correct, and cases where the numerical calculation is correct by chance but the idea or formula is false. In this evaluation setup, the former case is simply considered wrong, while the latter case is correct. It is questionable whether this is a suitable way to evaluate scientific problem-solving ability.

### Questions
- The reviewer expects the authors to respond to the points listed in Weaknesses.
- Section 3 says "All problems are carefully verified by human annotators to ensure that LaTeX documents can be compiled without any syntax errors." The reviewer wonders if the authors do not check for parsing errors other than syntax errors.
- In section 5, it seems that LLM is only applied to numerically incorrect examples for error analysis. What would be the result if the same error analysis was applied to answers that are numerically correct? This involves two aspects:
  - First, it is possible to find numerically correct answers that contain some errors listed in section 5.
  - Also, it would be even better if there was also an evaluation of error analysis for numerically correct responses, while it has been reported that about 20% of error analysis by LLM for numerically incorrect responses are discarded.
