# A Characterization Theorem for Equivariant Networks with Point-wise Activations

- Decision: Accept
- Scores: 8, 6, 6, 8

## Abstract
Equivariant neural networks have shown improved performance, expressiveness and sample complexity on symmetrical domains. 
But for some specific symmetries, representations, and choice of coordinates, the most common point-wise activations, such as ReLU, are not equivariant, hence they cannot be employed in the design of equivariant neural networks. 
The theorem we present in this paper describes all possible combinations of \rev{finite-dimensional} representations, choice of coordinates and point-wise activations to obtain an \rev{exactly} equivariant layer, generalizing and strengthening existing characterizations.
Notable cases of practical relevance are discussed as corollaries. Indeed, we prove that rotation-equivariant networks can only be invariant, as it happens for any network which is equivariant with respect to connected compact groups. Then, we discuss implications of our findings when applied to important instances of \rev{exactly} equivariant networks. First, we completely characterize permutation equivariant networks such as Invariant Graph Networks with point-wise nonlinearities and their geometric counterparts, highlighting a plethora of models whose expressive power and performance are still unknown. 
Second, we show that feature spaces of disentangled steerable convolutional neural networks are trivial representations.

### Summary
The paper describes a theorem to characterize what group representations can be used given certain types of point-wise activation functions, and vice versa. A main result is that either permutation representations can be used, or trivial irreducible representations. The paper discusses several equivariant networks in context of the obtained results.

[update: based on the rebuttal I raised my score]

### Strengths
1. The paper presents a solid contribution to understanding the limits of equivariant neural networks in light of point-wise activation functions
2. The paper is thorough and precise in its definitions and results (theorems and proofs)
3. The paper is open about it's scope (I appreciate the comment above Section 4 about not addressing homogeneous spaces / infinite dimensional vector spaces) and defines promising directions for future research.

### Weaknesses
1. The paper is a theoretical contribution and emphasizes that the results are of practical value. However, I believe that in order for it to be of practical value the paper should be more accessible to a broader audience. Although formal and precise, there is little effort put in describing the main results in plain English.
2. Although partially covered by clarifying the scope of the paper, I do think the notion of regular representations is insufficiently covered. By sticking to irreducible representations one naturally comes to the conclusion that if one wants to apply point-wise activations one has to use trivial (invariant) irreps. However, if one admits regular representations (either approximations in the full SO(n) case, or exact as in the discrete sub-group cases of SO(n)) then one is not limited to invariants as the regular representations are effectively permutation representations. The regular representations can also be defined in the continuous setting, though the discretization may introduce some equivariance error, however, this need not be a problem as one could use random grids to avoid such biases. See e.g. Kuipers-Bekkers-2023:

Kuipers, T.P., Bekkers, E.J. (2023). Regular SE(3) Group Convolutions for Volumetric Medical Image Analysis. In: Medical Image Computing and Computer Assisted Intervention – MICCAI 2023. LNCS, vol 14222. Springer, Cham. https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-43898-1_25
https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.13960

As for equivariant models with point-wise activation functions, it is often the case that internally the models use (non-trivial) irreps to parametrize the layers, and use an inverse Fourier transform to transform back to the regular representation basis, apply point-wise activation, then project back to irrep basis. I think including such approach in the discussions enable more people to relate to the result of the paper. Although commonly used in practice, I did find it hard to find references to such approaches. See e.g. the library e3nn ( https://docs.e3nn.org/en/latest/api/nn/nn_s2act.html ) and escnn (https://quva-lab.github.io/escnn/api/escnn.nn.html?highlight=fourier#escnn.nn.FourierPointwise). As for papers I could find [Cesa et al. 2021] Appendix H.2:

Cesa, G., Lang, L., & Weiler, M. (2021, October). A program to build E (N)-equivariant steerable CNNs. In International Conference on Learning Representations.

and perhaps the following as it represents signals on a grid but performs convs in the Fourier domain

Cohen, T. S., Geiger, M., Köhler, J., & Welling, M. (2018, February). Spherical CNNs. In International Conference on Learning Representations.
3. By the previous item, remarks such as (see abstract) "we prove that rotation-equivariant networks can only be invariant" is in practice more nuanced, and I consider the statement actually incorrect. Another example of a rotation equivariant method based on equivariantly obtained spherical grids (they call it equivariant mesh) is GemNet:

Gasteiger, J., Becker, F., & Günnemann, S. (2021). Gemnet: Universal directional graph neural networks for molecules. Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, 34, 6790-6802.

Effectively, the paper works with scalar fields over the homogeneous space $\mathbb{R}^3 \times S^2$, as also discussed in recent work https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.02970 , which also fully operates in the domain of regular representations. I remark that this reference seem to have appeared only after the ICLR deadline so of course I do not expect this to have been included.
4. In conclusion, I think the paper could improve on impact if the relation to regular group convolution methods is further clarified and if the main results are introduced in simpler terms. The claim that equivariant networks can only be invariant is I think an artifact of the choice of sticking to irreducible representations.

### Questions
See above comments and smaller details below:

1. On page 3 the symbol $\mathbb{R}^*$ is used. What does the asterix indicate?
2. I did not understand the introduction of the main result "Although employing techniques analogue to already known ones, we highlight how hypothesis can generalize ... of the basis" Apart from this sentence being too long, I really do not understand what is being said here, please rewrite.
3. Theorem 1 could benefit from some subsequent, explicit examples. Take ReLU and e.g. a cyclic permutation group. Or any example you see fit. I think the paper remains abstract throughout and I think it could be helpful to see some common examples.
4. Section 5.1 is also a bit abstract still, dispite being in the section for practical scenarios. Some laymans explainations of the quotient structure could be helpful. In particular I struggled with "...an equivariant isomorphism between ... which is the standard representation space for permutations equivariant networks on sets".
5. Section 5.2 makes sense, but as discussed it is limited in scope regarding the use of irreducible representations exclusively. 
6. Could you clarify Corrolary 3. It is hard to understand what is about. In particular what is the significance of the connected component (are we talking about subgroups here?)
7. "... but not more general equivariant tasks such as segmentation or detection" again this is an artifact of sticking to irreps.

### Summary
This works considers equivariant neural networks, consisting of equivariant affine maps and pointwise nonlinearities that map between representations of a group $G$. They provide a characterization theorem, which simultaneously characterizes possible types of pointwise nonlinearities and maximal group representations that commute with the families of pointwise nonlinearities. This theorem is applied to several specific types of group representations that have been studied in the equivariant machine learning literature.

### Strengths
1. Substantially generalizes previous existing results, of which there are not many.
2. The main result is strong, and remarkably shows that there are not too many pairs of maximal admissible families of activations and groups.
3. The argument on page 7 for why it is better to use pointwise activations in the usual representation for $S_n$ on $\mathbb{R}^n$ as opposed to a disentangled representation is nice. The equivariant linear maps and pointwise activation approach is universal with the usual representation due to Segol and Lipman 2019 (https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.02421), but can be very weak in a disentangled representation.

### Weaknesses
1. I find this paper quite difficult to read at times, and I think that it would benefit from more explicitly defining certain concepts and writing out certain arguments. In the proof of Corollary 3, I do not quite understand the application of Theorem 1; why does the representation have to be trivial? Specifically, the jump from the general result in Theorem 1 to the specific claim about trivial representations in Corollary 3 is not clear. It would be helpful to see a more detailed explanation of how the conditions of Theorem 1 force the representation to be trivial in this specific case. Also, Section 6.2 about invariant graph networks is very dense. The notation is quite heavy, and it is hard to follow the flow of the argument. It would be beneficial to break down the argument into smaller steps, and provide more intuition behind the definitions. See also questions.
2. The applicability of these results to empirical equivariant machine learning is unclear. Already practitioners do not use pointwise nonlinearities for $SO(3)$ equivariant networks. It's not clear how the theoretical results translate to practical benefits. For example, the paper shows that pointwise nonlinearities are not compatible with non-trivial $SO(3)$ representations, but it does not discuss the practical implications of this result. Also, are there any expectations of potential benefits from using other representations of $S_n$ for invariant graph networks? The paper does not provide any empirical evidence or concrete examples to support the claim that these alternative representations could lead to better performance.

### Questions
1. In Section 6.1 / Section 6.3, why is the following case ruled out? Say I let $f$ be linear, so that $\tilde f$ is just scaling and is hence equivariant to $SO(3)$. Then the output representation is the same as the input, and is in particular not invariant. This can be done in the $SO(3) \times S_n$ case as well.

Other notes:
1. Typo: Page 4, sentence with "Although employing techniques analogue to..." has several typos that make it confusing, incluidng use of "hypothesis" and "thesis"
2. Typo: Page 14, "Aff" is incorrectly typeset before Theorem 5

### Summary
The paper studies equivariance of neural network layers consisting of a linear transformation followed by a pointwise activation. The main result is a theorem characterizing largest admissible combinations of activation families and the associated groups for which equivariance holds. After that, the main result and its consequences are discussed in the context of several specific equivariance scenarios.

### Strengths
The main result - Theorem 1 - seems to be new (though heavily relying on previous research, primarily Wood & Shawe-Taylor (1996)). This theorem provides an explicit classification of equivariant pairs of activation families and groups and seems to be a simple, but useful result. I have not spotted any mistakes in the proofs.

### Weaknesses
 **Contribution.** I doubt that the paper in its present state is strong enough for ICLR.
1. The main result looks like a relatively simple add-on to the study of equivariant networks by Wood & Shawe-Taylor (1996). Most results found in the appendix are either simple facts from the group and representation theory or are borrowed from Wood & Shawe-Taylor (1996) (e.g., the key equivariance condition (3)). Theorem 1 seems to be a relatively simple consequence of these results. Specifically, the paper does not sufficiently demonstrate the novelty of its approach beyond the existing framework. While the generalization to non-finite groups and continuous activations is mentioned, the practical implications and the complexity of these extensions are not thoroughly explored. The claim of identifying network classes up to isomorphism is interesting, but the paper does not provide sufficient examples to show how this approach leads to new insights or practical advantages compared to the original work. The integration of Wood & Shawe-Taylor's theory with adjustments for effective classification, such as Lemma 1, is presented as a key contribution, but its significance is not clearly demonstrated with concrete examples or a detailed analysis of its impact on the classification process. The emphasis on algebraic aspects and the classification of multiplicative subgroups of $\mathbb{R}$ is mentioned, but the paper does not provide a clear explanation of how this approach leads to a more general or powerful result compared to the original work.

2. Though the paper includes a discussion of applications of Theorem 1 in Sections 5 and 6, I found these sections not easy to follow. They essentially consist of a long and not so well structured list of comments surrounding a few corollaries. The context of these comments is explained relatively vaguely, partly through references to other papers. It is not really clear to me why any of these corollaries and comments is actually important. The paper does not include specific examples, illustrations or experiments showing how Theorem 1 can, say, help improve designs of equivariant models. For instance, the discussion of permutation-equivariant networks in Section 5.2 lacks concrete examples of how the presented networks differ from existing approaches and what advantages they offer. The paper does not provide any empirical evidence to support the claim that these networks address a gap in the understanding of permutation equivariance. The lack of experiments or detailed examples makes it difficult to assess the practical relevance of the theoretical results.

**Writing.** The writing is sloppy in several places, with typos and unclear grammar. For example, only in Lemma 5:
- the index $i$ seems to be missing in the definition of $\mathcal{T}(\mathcal M)$;
- the indices and coefficients are wrong in the formula for $f(\sum_{j\in S}M_{rj}x)$;
- a word seems to be missing in "It is a simple to check".

I could understand the proof of Lemma 5 only with some effort (especially the sentence " And obviously each.."). The sentence "Hence, we can restrict our classification.." after the proof of Lemma 7 seems to consist of two different statements, but it is unclear where the first one ends and the second begins. In Lemma 7: "dived into three different type".

### Questions
I suggest to: 
- carefully revise the writing;
- strengthen and clarify sections 5-6 by providing experiments and/or theorems so as to make it clear why the discussions there are important (it might be worth it to focus on fewer applications, but with more depth).

### Summary
The paper studies the effect of pointwise activation on multilayer equivariant neural networks and establishes a characterization theorem of which activations can be used to construct a fully equivariant net for a wide variety of group and group action through the lens of representation theory. Notably, they give a unifying view for permutation-equivariant architectures, such as DeepSets and IGNs, which also contain some unexplored architectures; as well as showing that equivariant disentangled steerable CNN (in some definition) must be invariant if the activation is pointwise.

### Strengths
The paper highlights one key challenge in designing a fully equivariant neural network: namely the choice of activation function (common choices of which are not equivariant - e.g. commute with the linear part). Research into this topic is timely, highly relevant and important in the field.

Their framework generalizes existing work from Wood and Shawe-Taylor, and is tight in the sense that the characterization theorem enumerates all pairs of pointwise activation and linear layer that commute (and hence can be used in an equivariant network design). 

The result for rotational equivariant architecture (that pointwise activation is equivariant iff representation of the linear layer is trivial) is surprising and may be crucial in opening up efforts to find other approaches to rotational equivariant architecture.

### Weaknesses
The paper is rather dense in representation theoretic notions. While I believe the paper is still self-contained, it may be beneficial for readers if the authors can expand on some intuition on the main theorems, maybe even in the appendix. Specifically, while the definitions are present, the paper could benefit from more concrete examples illustrating the implications of the theorems, particularly for readers less familiar with representation theory. For instance, elaborating on how specific group representations affect the constraints on activation functions would be helpful.

It doesn’t look like the technique in this paper can generalize to infinite dimensional representation, which the author acknowledged in Page 4. This is a significant limitation, as many continuous symmetry groups are associated with infinite-dimensional representations. The paper should more clearly articulate the scope and limitations of the framework in this regard, and perhaps discuss potential avenues for future work that could address this gap.

Minor: I think the paper would also greatly benefit from a further discussion of "what's next?", what is the loss if we give up point-wise activations for rotational equivariant network but replacing them with other kinds of activation. For permutation-equivariant network, it may also be interesting to work out another nontrivial architecture that is neither DeepSets nor IGN (higher order tensor representation). I'd also understand if the authors deem these as being out-of-scope.

### Questions
Small typos: 
- Page 15, proof of Lemma 4. First sentence in the proof misses “for all i”. Second sentence should start: “Then \sum_{j = 1}^n M_{ij} = 1” (missing “=1”). 
- Page 15. First equation in Lemma 5 missing “i \in [n]” (missing “i”).
- Section 5.2. It is more apt to reference Cohen & Welling 2014 "Learning the irreducible representation..." rather than Cohen & Welling 2016b "Steerable CNN" in this section.
