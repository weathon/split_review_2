# From Posterior Sampling to Meaningful Diversity in Image Restoration

- Decision: Accept
- Scores: 8, 6, 8

## Abstract
Image restoration problems are typically ill-posed in the sense that each degraded image can be restored in infinitely many valid ways. 
To accommodate this, many works generate a diverse set of outputs by attempting to randomly sample from the posterior distribution of natural images given the degraded input. Here we argue that this strategy is commonly of limited practical value because of the heavy tail of the posterior distribution.
Consider for example inpainting a missing region of the sky in an image. 
Since there is a high probability that the missing region contains no object but clouds, any set of samples from the posterior would be entirely dominated by (practically identical) completions of sky.
However, arguably, presenting users with only one clear sky completion, along with several alternative solutions such as airships, birds, and balloons, would better outline the set of possibilities. 
In this paper, we initiate the study of \textbf{meaningfully diverse} image restoration.
We explore several post-processing approaches 
that can be combined with any diverse image restoration method to yield semantically meaningful diversity. Moreover, we propose a practical approach for allowing diffusion based image restoration methods to generate meaningfully diverse outputs, while incurring only negligent computational overhead. 
We conduct extensive user studies to analyze the proposed techniques, and find the strategy of reducing similarity between outputs to be significantly favorable over posterior sampling.

### Summary
This paper discusses the problem of generating a diverse set of reconstructed samples when solving an imaging inverse problem using a pretrained diffusion model. The traditional setup is to cast the inverse problem as one of posterior distribution sampling. However, as the authors discussed this may lead to a concentrated set of samples where most of them look very similar to each other. The paper discusses different ways of measuring and modeling diversity in image reconstruction and later introduces a method for generating a given number of samples  conditioned on a low-resolution / low-quality image, maximizing diversity and using a pretrained diffusion model. The method is evaluated on popular benchmarks on two restoration tasks: super-resolution (4/16x, noisy and noiseless) and inpainting.

### Strengths
* The paper is generally well-written, address an interesting and relevant problem with a clear narrative and presentation.
* The technical contribution of the paper is good: analizes a problem and propose a practical solution. This could lead to more research on this problem ("meaningfully diverse image restoration")

### Weaknesses
Not weakness per se, more like observations:
* Experimental results are interesting but limited. For example, image colorization is one of the main problems where diversity reconstruction could have a significant impact.  
* Presentation could be a little more balanced. In particular, the experimental section (Sec 6) could be a little longer and maybe show more results, discuss a little more some of the algorithmic decisions (presented in Sec 5). The authors opted to put more content on Sec 3 and 4, which seems also a valid decision.

### Questions
The paper is in general well-written, addresses an interesting problem, and present an interesting solution. So I'm in favour of accepting this paper as it is now. However, if the authors would like to make the paper better I list a few questions/comments that could be helpful.

1.  **Analysis of the proposed method**. The method seems to do the job, but I wonder if the authors could provide more insight on their proposed solution. For example, a few alternative designs could be:
    * Instead of increasing distance with respect to NN, just maximize the sample variance (or average pairwise distance as in the reported LPIPS metric)
    * What happens with the sample average. In the traditional formulation, the average of the generated samples should be close to the posterior mean (which is also another possible estimator that minimizes distortion). Have you tried to compute and compare the sample means w/wo the diversified guidance ? I guess that the mean wouldn't be as good as in the traditional case, but maybe a more robust mean estimator could lead to a very similar result (an estimator that minimizes distortion) 

2. **Other Experiments**. In particular regarding Colorization (e.g., one very relevant practical problem is face colorization, can we generate a meaningful diverse set of reconstructed images when starting from a gray photo of a face?)

3. **Connections to other work on GANs** (and mode collapse which seems related).

4. **Training**. This paper is not about training models that allow to generate a diverse set of reconstructions. But, I wonder if the authors could give a comment on wether we could incorporate the idea of diverse sample generation also during training. In particular I wonder if the authors could comment on wether this is an interesting thing to consider, for example in the context of conditional generation ([SR3](https://iterative-refinement.github.io/), [Palette](https://iterative-refinement.github.io/palette/)) or current Bridge restoration models ([InDI](https://openreview.net/forum?id=VmyFF5lL3F), [I2SB](https://i2sb.github.io/))

### Summary
This paper is concerned with  generating  diverse solutions to ill-posed image restoration problems. Usual random sampling from the heavy tailed posterior distribution will have samples from high density regions with a much higher probability than from low density regions, making it an impractical approach to generate diverse solutions from limited samples. Given a large number of samples from posterior, the paper explores three approaches to extract limited number of samples representing meaningful diversity. Further, the paper proposes a simple guidance mechanism to improve diversity of solutions. This involves running the diffusion process to simultaneously generate multiple images starting from different noise samples, and encouraging dissimilarity between estimates of clean images at every step. This guidance improves diversity of solutions of recent diffusion based restoration methods while  maintaining reconstruction quality.

### Strengths
The paper is well motivated and well-written.

The proposed technique is simple and straightforward to implement and the work is reproducible. 

The proposed method improves the diversity of solutions.

### Weaknesses
The observation that random sampling leads to limited diversity for long tailed distributions was also noted in [a] in the context of image generation.  [a] also proposes to modify the sampling process in diffusion models to generate samples from low density regions of a long tailed distribution. Though the focus in [a] is on generation, and not restoration, it is still a relevant work, and could be cited by the authors.

The authors could also cite {b] which attempts to generate diverse solutions to linear inverse problems using pretrained gans.

While the proposed guidance method improves diversity and is useful, the technical contribution  seems rather limited. This is the reason for my rating.

### Questions
Could the authors clarify the following issues:

It is not clarified what kind of down-sampling is used to obtain degraded images for super-resolution.
 
Fig. 14, degraded input for super-resolution looks wierd, the results of DPS look like down-sampled images.

Figs 28 , 29 super-resolution or inpainting. degraded image looks like a low resolution image, caption says inpainting.

### Summary
The current trend in image restoration methods involves sampling multiple outputs from the posterior distribution rather than generating a single one. This paper has highlighted a fundamental limitation of posterior sampling, specifically in generating semantically distinct possibilities using a reasonably small number of samples. This limitation arises from the heavy-tailed nature of the posterior distribution along semantically relevant directions. As a solution, the paper suggests creating compositions of small but meaningfully diverse outputs. The study also delves into a comprehensive examination of what constitutes a set of reconstructions that are meaningfully diverse. To achieve this, the paper explores various post-processing approaches, including Uniformization, K-Means Centers, and Farthest Point Strategy, to obtain semantically meaningful and diverse outputs using existing image restoration methods. Furthermore, the paper introduces a practical approach for enabling diffusion-based image restoration methods to produce outputs that are meaningfully diverse. The effectiveness of these methods is validated through quantitative measures and user studies, demonstrating their superiority over conventional posterior sampling techniques.

### Strengths
-  identify an inherent conceptual issue with posterior sampling and elucidate the root cause of this problem
- conduct an analysis to determine the criteria for meaningful diversity. This analysis involves an exploration of three fundamental strategies for diverse sub-sampling.
-  introduce a novel diffusion-based generation strategy, which offers a practical means to achieve restoration results that are meaningfully diverse.

### Weaknesses
None

### Questions
I have some concerns while reviewing the main paper, but they have been addressed in the supplementary material.

A suggestion for the authors: The discussion on future work could be expanded, e.g., what specific desired variations can be for potential research in the field? This would provide more clarity and guidance for researchers interested in pursuing further work in this area.
