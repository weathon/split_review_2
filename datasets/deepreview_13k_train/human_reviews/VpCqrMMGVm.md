- Decision: Reject
- Scores: 6, 6, 6, 3

## Abstract
Large language models (LLMs) have achieved stunning performance on various language tasks, but remain as mysterious as a black box. Understanding the internal mechanisms of LLMs could contribute to the development of more transparent and interpretable LLMs. To this end, we take the first attempt to reveal a specific mechanism relating to how LLMs implement the reasoning task of a mathematical addition, i.e., scenarios involving the addition of two integers. Through comprehensive experiments, we find that LLMs frequently involve a small fraction of attention heads (0.5% of all heads) when implementing the addition task. Meanwhile, knocking out these frequently involved heads significantly degrades the LLMs' performance on the same task. Surprisingly, these key heads identified for a specific model exhibit outstanding generalizability across multiple datasets related to the mathematical addition task. Moreover, we find an intuitive phenomenon that knocking out these key heads could also affect the performance of LLMs on mathematical subtraction, which shares the same spirit with human behavior. Our work serves as a preliminary exploration into the mathematical prowess of LLMs, laying a solid foundation to reveal more intricate capabilities.

### Summary
Three workings of models, LLaMA2-7B, Qwen-7B, and  chatGLM2-6B, are interpreted using the path patching method (initially introduced in [1], which is an interoperability method rooted in causal intervention) on tasks involving mathematical addition and subtraction. The authors create various datasets for this purpose. They find that only a small number of attention heads are responsible for reasoning.

This represents a good effort to interpret large language models using path patching and mean ablation and it is the first paper where mathematical addition is interpreted in this way.

### Strengths
- a timely topic is treated, how models that are used in practice perform mathematical addition and subtraction
- a large number of figures that show how attention heads are activated on concrete examples help to make the paper readable

### Weaknesses
 - The authors didn't include, as related work, some publications that also deal with mathematical reasoning, such as [1]
- studying only mathematical addition and subtraction seems restrictive. I do note that the authors state at the end however: "_A more thorough study on the subtraction task as well as the validation on more computation tasks (e.g., multiplication and division, etc.) is left for future work._"

### Questions
-Since addition and subtraction are opposite mathematical operations, is there some kind of similar symmetry observable on the level of attention heads?

### Summary
This paper investigates how three different language models (LLMs) perform on simple one-digit addition problems. The researchers generated 10,000 sample addition questions across 20 different formats (such as "42 plus 34 equals ___") to analyze. Through this analysis, they identified the most important attention heads involved in the addition calculations for each model. To confirm the importance of these heads, the researchers ablated them and used counterfactual examples, which showed a clear impact on loss when these heads were removed. Interestingly, only a very small number of attention heads were consistently involved in the addition across all the different question formats. Further examination showed these heads specifically focus on the numerical tokens in the input strings. The researchers replicated some of these findings with one-digit subtraction as well. The paper clearly maps out how a few key attention heads enable simple addition across different state-of-the-art LLMs.

### Strengths
Strengths:

- The language of the paper is concise and clear.
- The breadth and depth of the paper is excellent - specifically the use of 3 LLMs
(LLaMA2-7B, Qwen-7B and chatGLM2-6B), 20 question formats and 10K sample
questions.
- The rigorous nature of the paper is excellent - the claims re addition are confirmed via
detailed experimentation.
- The most significant finding is that a small number of attention heads are consistently
used by each model to perform one-digit addition across the various question formats.

### Weaknesses
Weaknesses:

- The paper (seems to) limit itself to one-digit addition and subtraction - reducing its scope
to a subset of addition and subtraction. The abstract should explicitly say that the scope
is one-digit integer addition.
-  The paper (seems to) limit itself to simple one-digit addition and subtraction (without
“carry over one” or “borrow one” examples - reducing its scope to a subset of addition
and subtraction. The abstract should explicitly say that the scope is simple one-digit
integer addition.
-  The paper does not explain how the attention heads (&/or MLP layer) actually perform
the addition calculation. This explanation is left for future work.
-  The paper touches on subtraction, showing similarities, but a detailed analysis is left for
future work.
-  A discussion of the differences in how each of the LLMs implement one-digit addition
would have been interesting e.g. do all the models use roughly the same number of attention heads to implement addition? If no differences were found, then this would be
an interesting finding in itself.
-  The small scope of this paper limits the reusability of this work.

### Questions
Questions:

- The addition examples seem to be “simple” one-digit integer addition with a one
character answer. There appear to be no “carry over one” examples in the test questions
e.g “5 plus 7 is equal to 1_”. If this is so, it reduces the findings scope to some
subclasses of addition.

- The subtraction examples all seem to be “simple” one-digit integer subtraction with a one
character answer. There appear to be no “borrow one” examples in the test questions
e.g “112 minus 5 is equal to 10_”. If this is so, it reduces the findings scope to some
subclasses of subtraction.

- The calculation of the subtraction question “{A} - {B} =” likely has two distinct calculation
algorithms: one for when A > B and one for when A < B. Do the authors think that this
explains the 52% performance drop when the addition attention heads are ablated?

### Summary
In this study, the authors aim to delve into the underlying mechanisms of Large Language Models (LLMs) by analyzing attention heads at various layers in tasks that require the addition of two integers. Specifically, they focus on the LLAMA2-7B, Qwen-7B, and ChatGLM2-6B language models. Their findings reveal that a limited number of attention heads significantly influence the model's output, and these conclusions are drawn from a range of experiments. Furthermore, the authors show some preliminary results indicating that these same attention heads play a significant role in the performance of subtraction tasks.

### Strengths
Authors are tackling an important problem by aiming to understand the inner workings of LLMs. With the increased pace of advancements happening in the field, it is imperative to gain this understanding. 

Authors tackle the problem in a clear manner, by coming up with a clean task (involving addition of 2 integers) and testing their hypothesis systematically. 

Their findings indicate that a limited number of attention heads suffice for achieving strong performance across a range of addition tasks. Importantly, the methodology they introduce can prove valuable for conducting sensitivity analyses in other areas of interest and even facilitate model sparsification.

They validate their hypothesis on several LLMs and a few addition tasks. Additionally, their preliminary investigations reveal that the attention heads vital for addition tasks also exert a substantial influence on subtraction.

### Weaknesses
While the authors have indeed posed a clear problem and approached it systematically, I find the setup to be somewhat restrictive.

- Although the authors make a great effort to tackle the task of addition, their focus remains solely on the addition of two integers. It would be intriguing to see whether their findings extend to addition of multiple integers and rational numbers, as well as their applicability to problems involving multiple addition operations.

- The robustness of this study could be significantly enhanced if the authors were to conduct analogous experiments on subtraction, multiplication, and division. Such investigations would shed light on whether a select group of attention heads can consistently influence performance across all four mathematical operations.

### Questions
Please refer to weakness section. It would be great if authors have any additional insights regarding the points in weakness section.

### Summary
The paper identifies attention heads which play a key role for addition and subtraction in transformer-based language models. The authors identify several such heads in three different models and demonstrate that removing them destroys the ability of the model to perform arithmetic.

### Strengths
1. The analysis is thorough and rigorous. 
2. The paper is clearly written, and the presentation is well-organised and presented.
3. On top of identifying the “key heads” being focused on addition, the paper shows that the same heads are also involved in subtraction. While this might be intuitive, considering that one of these tasks is the opposite of the other, it is not obvious that an LLM would discover and utilize this duality. However, it is unclear whether that is because the heads focus only on numbers or because they are utilising the duality of summation and subtraction.
4. The paper recognises that later heads depend on earlier ones and attempts to analyse these dependencies (although it appears there are none).

### Weaknesses
1. The paper identifies attention heads that take part in the processing of summation but does not look into or explain what each of the “key heads” actually does and what is the mechanism through which it contributes to summation. Therefore, the paper focuses on _localization_ of the heads that partake in summation, rather than _interpreting_ them. The analysis does not provide a mechanistic understanding of how these heads contribute to the arithmetic operation. For example, it is unclear if the heads are directly manipulating numerical representations or performing some other intermediate computation.

2. The paper does not look at alternative representations of numbers. For example, in words (“two” instead of 2), Roman numerals (II instead of 2), and other languages (二 or ٢ instead of 2). The lack of such analysis leaves the question open whether these heads simply attend to numerical tokens or whether they are involved in higher-order reasoning about numbers and arithmetic. This is a critical omission because it limits the generalizability of the findings and the understanding of the heads' function.

3. Related to the above, the paper seems to focus only on single-digit summation. It is unclear whether the results would translate to the summation of larger numbers (or more than two numbers). This is important as prior works have shown that the ability of LLMs to do arithmetic quickly decreases with the increase of the number of digits. It would be interesting to see if your analysis would be able to provide insights into this phenomenon. The lack of analysis on multi-digit numbers limits the scope of the conclusions.

4. I am not sure how to read the attention patterns in Fig. 4. How can the attention be negative? In fact, it does not seem that these heads attend to all numbers. The first head seems to attend to the completion of “or” with “anges” and the full stop. Both heads seem to attend only to 3 while solving the task would also require attention to 5. Therefore, it is not clear how these heads participate in performing summation. The visualization of attention patterns does not clearly support the claims about the role of the identified heads in summation.

5. The paper looks predominantly at attention heads. However, it is well known that a lot of the computation and processing happens in the MLPs. Hence, a full picture of the interoperation of the mechanisms for summation should also include the MLPs. The analysis is incomplete without considering the role of the MLPs, which are known to perform complex computations.

### Questions
1. Does knocking out the heads have effects on other tasks, i.e. are these heads only important for arithmetic or are they polysemantic?

2. In the Introduction, you say _“Contrary to expectations that LLMs may involve diverse attention heads across all layers, our findings reveal that only a small percentage (0.5%) of the attention heads significantly impact the model’s performance.”_ However, this is exactly the expectation: attention heads have diverse functions so it is not surprising that only a few of them would be involved in summation.

3. In the Introduction, you say _“Remarkably, only the absence of these heads leads to a notable decline in model performance.”_ But this can’t be true. Surely there are many other weights that, if perturbed, would result in a significant decline in model performance (e.g. the embedding matrix or the final output projection matrix).

4. In Section 4.2, how do you decouple the effect of the individual heads? In the implementation of LLAMA there are no separate $W_O$ for each head but a single one that is applied to the concatenation of all the heads. Therefore, it mixes information across heads. How do you resolve this?

5. In Figure 4 left, how do you know that the effect you see is because of the heads specialising in numbers and not because your test sequences have numbers in them? I’d be curious to see how this plot and the rest of your analysis would look like if applied to sentences which have nothing to do with numbers and arithmetic. Possibly the heads that you have found to be important for arithmetic would be especially unimportant for other tasks.
