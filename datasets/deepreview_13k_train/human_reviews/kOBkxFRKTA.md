## Abstract
\Gls{dst} methods achieve state-of-the-art results in sparse neural network training, matching the generalization of dense models while enabling sparse training and inference. Although the resulting models are highly sparse and theoretically less computationally expensive, achieving speedups with unstructured sparsity on real-world hardware is challenging. 
In this work, we propose a sparse-to-sparse \gls{dst} method, \gls{srigl}, to learn a variant of fine-grained \emph{structured} N:M sparsity by imposing a \emph{constant fan-in} constraint.
Using our empirical analysis of existing \gls{dst} methods at high sparsity, we additionally employ a neuron ablation method which enables \gls{srigl} to achieve state-of-the-art sparse-to-sparse structured \gls{dst} performance on a variety of \gls{nn} architectures. %
Using a 90\% sparse linear layer, we demonstrate a real-world acceleration of 3.4$\times$/2.5$\times$ on CPU for \emph{online inference} and 1.7$\times$/13.0$\times$ on GPU for inference with a batch size of 256 when compared to equivalent dense/unstructured (CSR) sparse layers, respectively.}

### Summary
This paper proposes SRigL with a type of structured sparsity - constant fan-in sparsity that can be applied to dynamic sparse training, leading to real-world clock-time savings while maintaining the optimal performance.

### Strengths
1. The research topic of structured DST is timely and important for the ML community. With the popularity of LTH and DST, sparse neural networks have received upsurging attention due to its promising capacity to reduce training/inference costs while maintaining the original performance of dense counterparts. However, the benefits of sparse NNs can largely constraint by the limited support from common hardware - GPUs. Research works to improve the progress of this direction make significant contributions to the community.  

2. This paper provides a comprehensive and precise related work that covers the most state-of-the-art structured/unstructured sparse training approaches. I very much appreciate such rich related works that provide enough credits and credits to previous works. 

3. The detailed step of SRigL in Section 3 provides a good overview to understand the methodology. 

4. SRigL is able to find small-sparse NNs that enjoy better real-world wall-clock for online inference than structured (SRigL with only neuron ablation) and unstructured NNs. 

5. Compared with N:M sparsity, SRigL enjoys uniform layer-wise sparsity, which is more desirable for performance.

### Weaknesses
 (1) Partial of the ideas used in SRigL has some certain levels of overlaps with the previous work (Chase: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.19454.pdf). For instance, Chase also uncovers that a large proportion of channels (termed sparse amenable channels) tend to be sparse during DST. They also perform channel pruning to produce a mixture of structured and unstructured sparsity at the end of training. It is better to clarify the difference and similarity between Chase and SRigL, even though Chase does not introduce the hardware-friendly constant fan-in sparsity for the unstructured part. The overlap in identifying sparse-amenable channels is a significant concern, and the paper needs to clearly articulate the novelty of SRigL beyond this observation. Furthermore, while Chase does not explicitly enforce constant fan-in sparsity, the paper should discuss whether their channel pruning approach could implicitly lead to similar effects, and if not, why not. A more detailed comparison of the specific channel selection criteria used by each method is also needed to highlight the differences.

(2) Can SRigL also accelerate the training process for the online inference, with real-world wall-clock saving?

(3)  In many cases in Table 1 and 3, SRigL w/ ablation even outperforms SRigL w/o ablation, which is a bit counter-intuitive. Cause SRigL w/ ablation essentially produces a smaller-sparse model if I understand correctly, which would decrease the model capacity. Can the authors elaborate more about this? Does  SRigL w/o ablation means only pruning these dean channels without weight regrowing? The performance gains from ablation are indeed surprising and warrant further investigation. The paper should provide a more detailed analysis of how the parameter redistribution after neuron ablation affects the model's learning dynamics. It is unclear if 'SRigL w/o ablation' only prunes dead channels without weight regrowth, which is a crucial detail for understanding the results. The authors should clarify whether the constant fan-in constraint is applied in both ablation and non-ablation scenarios, and if so, how this constraint interacts with the parameter redistribution during ablation.

### Questions
(1) What is the technical difference between SRigL and Chase? 

(2) Can SRigL also accelerate the training process for the online inference, with real-world wall-clock saving? Moreover, I noticed that the Constant Fan-in sparsity can be accelerated by GPUs with some custom CUDA implementation, such as Schultheis & Babbar (2023). I am wondering how difficult to make SRigL accelerated by GPUs using the CUDA implementation provided by Schultheis & Babbar (2023). 

(3) Why SRigL w/ ablation outperforms SRigL w/o ablation? I suppose that SRigL w/o ablation is essentially the unstructured version of RigL. 

(4) Since the real-world clock-time is measured on CPU. I am wondering how different it is to implement GPU kernel to support SRigL in common GPUs?

Overall, I think this paper is a good asset and I am willing to increase my score if the above weaknesses can be resolved.

### Summary
This paper presents Structured RigL (SRigL), a Dynamic Sparse Training (DST) method that excels in training sparse neural networks. SRigL achieves state-of-the-art performance in DST by incorporating fine-grained N:M sparsity and continuous fan-in constraints for sparse interstructures. Through heuristic analysis and neuron removal, SRigL outperforms existing methods across various neural network architectures, demonstrating a substantial 3.6x/2x speedup on CPU at 90% sparsity compared to equivalent dense or unstructured sparse layers.

### Strengths
* The authors propose SRigL method that learns a SNN with constant fan-in fine-grained structured sparsity while maintaining generalization comparable to RigL even at high sparsity levels across various network architectures.
* Experimental results show that the SRigL method can not only improve the efficiency of parameters and memory, but can also enable acceleration during training.
* The proposed SRigL demonstrates minimal accuracy drop even at high sparsity levels exceeding 90% in both ResNet and ViT architectures.

### Weaknesses
 * The proposed SRigL primarily demonstrates its efficacy on networks with relatively high redundancy, such as ResNet or ViT. However, there is a lack of experimentation on networks with lower redundancy, such as MobileNet. This raises concerns about the general applicability of the method, as networks with fewer parameters might exhibit different behaviors under the imposed sparsity constraints. Specifically, the constant fan-in constraint may lead to a more significant performance degradation in models where each parameter is more critical for overall performance.
* The experimental results are limited to vision tasks. This narrow focus limits the evaluation of the method's robustness across different data modalities and tasks. It remains unclear how SRigL would perform on tasks with sequential data, such as natural language processing or time-series analysis, where the structure of the data and the network architectures differ significantly from vision tasks.
* While the comparison from the perspective of Dynamic Sparse Training (DST) in Table 3 is crucial, I believe that the results regarding structured pruning performance are equally significant. However, there is a notable absence of experiments, and comparisons with other techniques with 'structured' attributes are challenging. The lack of comparison against established structured pruning methods makes it difficult to assess the specific advantages of SRigL's approach to sparsity. It's not clear if the performance gains are solely due to the dynamic nature of the sparsity or if the structured constraints provide a unique advantage over existing static structured pruning techniques.
* A minor concern is the absence of a comprehensive figure that provides an overview of the entire process of SRigL. This makes it harder to quickly grasp the overall flow of the algorithm and how the different components interact.

### Questions
* In Section 4.4, the description of Algorithm 1 mentions, "The algorithm to accelerate our condensed sparsity representation is shown in Algorithm 1, demonstrating its embarrassingly parallel nature." I'm interested in knowing the throughput on real GPU or CPU based on the sparsity levels in the matmul unit-test.
* While discussing "Constant fan-in sparsity," it occurs to me that there might be performance variations across tasks and networks depending on the information included by input features. Have there been any experiments applying this approach to tasks other than vision?
* It is anticipated that the proposed SRigL method is significantly influenced by the $\gamma_{sal}$ value. I think this sensitivity might be more pronounced in networks with lower redundancy, such as MobileNet. Has there been an observation of trends by sweeping through different $\gamma_{sal}$ values? If so, what were the findings?
* How does the application of SRigL affect the practical outcomes (latency, throughput) in the context of "end-to-end sparse training" on GPUs?

### Summary
The paper proposes a method for dynamic sparse training that leads to structured N:M sparsity, here realized as a constant fan-in degree for neurons. The authors modify RigL to achieve this. The proposed constant fan-in N:M sparsity can theoretically achieve faster inference speeds on new GPU chips that are produced for general consumers but can specifically accelerate this type of structure.

The authors show that the output norm variance can in expectation be reduced with constant fan-in sparsity. The authors experimentally show that their proposed SRigL leads to the similar performance as RigL while enforcing the imposed structure.

### Strengths
The paper tackles an important issue in deep learning, is well-motivated, and written in a clear fashion. The motivation for the benefits of structured sparsity are clear. The main method is simple to explain, and seems to work approximately as good as RigL.
I have reviewed the paper before, and appreciate that the authors include a wall-clock time comparison of a fully connected layer on a CPU.

### Weaknesses
I have reviewed this paper before and still remain unconvinced by the author's argumentation on the main benefits of SRigL. While the authors claim that sparse-to-sparse training such as SRigL is beneficial over dense-to-sparse methods in terms of memory usage and computational time, the evidence presented for this is marginal. While the benefit of sparse models at inference time is obvious, the benefit of sparsifying models at training time (that reach the same generalization error) should be either faster training times or lower memory footprint. The authors show no evidence that SRigL trains models faster than dense-to-sparse methods such as SR-STE. On a similar note, a real-world quantitative evaluation of the difference in memory footprint for dense-to-sparse methods (such as SR-STE) vs. SRigL would make this paper much more convincing.

For the wall-clock time comparison, it seems that the median for at least 5 runs is shown. Given that the inference time is in the microsecond range, why not show the median of millions of forward passes, to reduce noise?

What should be the main takeaway from you showing SRigL x2 and SRigL x5 in Figure 3? It seems to be included to inflate the presentation of results of SRigL, but RigL performs the same under x2 or x5 training times. Either include RigL x2 and RigL x5, or omit both from Figure 3.

### Confidence
2: You are willing to defend your assessment, but it is quite likely that you did not understand the central parts of the submission or that you are unfamiliar with some pieces of related work. Math/other details were not carefully checked.

### Summary
The paper introduces Structured RigL (SRigL), an advancement in Dynamic Sparse Training (DST). SRigL combines structured sparsity with neural network training, resulting in models that are both computationally efficient and performant. The method achieves faster real-world inference times on CPUs and outperforms other sparse training techniques in various neural network architectures.

### Strengths
(1) SRigL creatively combines structured N:M sparsity with a constant fan-in constraint which is from existing DST methodologies.

(2) The paper provides extensive empirical evidence to show its superior performance.

(3) SRigL's ability to achieve faster real-world inference times on CPUs is of paramount importance.

### Weaknesses
(1) an important baseline is missing [1].

(2) Lack of novelty: A combination of sparse training and N: M sparsity have been shown in previous study [1]. Specifically, the paper lacks a clear explanation of how SRigL's approach to structured sparsity differs fundamentally from existing methods that also leverage channel-level sparsity. The claim of combining structured and fine-grained sparsity is not sufficiently justified, as it's unclear if the fine-grained sparsity is truly distinct from the structured sparsity or simply an artifact of the N:M implementation. It is also unclear how the constant fan-in constraint provides a significant advantage over other structured sparsity methods, especially given that N:M sparsity can be implemented with varying fan-in by adjusting the block size.

### Questions
(1) with comparison to [1], what's the advantages of SRigL?

(2) Why AST and SR-STE is not comparable to SRigl?  it would be better to report the results of AST and SR-STE since they are very related works.

### Summary
This work proposes a dynamic sparse training method with constant fan-in constraint. The method is validated on several computer vision datasets and architectures.

### Strengths
The introduced sparsity pattern is quite flexible and allows achieving performance close to unstructured sparsity while being more hardware-friendly. Neuron ablation procedure looks very sound and improves noticeably performance of the method. The appendix involves theoretical analysis motivating the good optimization behavior of the proposed SRigL and the choice of constant fan-in sparsity pattern. 

Method is validated on several models and attains pretty good performance at high sparsity.

The algorithm is simple and leads to speedups even without the need to write highly-customized code.

### Weaknesses
I think the proposed SRigL with constant fan-in sparsity should be compared to a similar sparse training procedure with N:M sparsity. One could perform it as follows: with some interval, a fraction of weights with the smallest magnitude among the group of M consecutive weights is dropped and the same fraction with high gradient magnitude is regrown. Indeed, the difference from original RigL is that the space of possible updates is much more constrained - i.e. for 2:4 sparsity one can prune a single non-zero weight inside the group of 4 and regrow one among the zeros. Likely, such strategy would perform poorly, but this comparison would motivate the necessity for constant fan-in sparsity. The other alternative is RigL with blocked sparsity that prunes whole groups of consecutive `block_size` weights. This sparsity pattern is known to be more CPU-speedup friendly compared to unstructured sparsity.

Method lacks comparison with dedicated inference engines that leverage sparsity. DeepSparse engine [1] achieves significant speed-ups for unstructured sparsity, especially on Intel CPUs.

*Minor* In the Appendix E plots w/o ablation seem to be absent on Figure 7.

Wall-clock timings for structured sparsity look suspicious. Does it mean that N:M sparsity with higher sparsity may be slower than the one with lower sparsity? Indeed, it is hardly possible to achieve linear speed-up, but I would expect at most saturation for high N:M sparsity.

How well does the method perform when combined with quantization? One is expected to achieve even higher speed-ups for sparse+8bit quantized model.

How much does the method explore new connections compared to RigL? Would be interesting to compare some measure similar to In-Time Over-Parameterization, introduced in [1] for RigL and SRigL.
