## Abstract
Reinforcement Learning algorithms that learn from human feedback (RLHF) need to be efficient in terms of \emph{statistical complexity, computational complexity, and query complexity}. In this work, we consider the RLHF setting where the feedback is given in the format of preferences over pairs of trajectories. In the linear MDP model, using randomization in algorithm design, we present an algorithm that is sample efficient (i.e., has near-optimal worst-case regret bounds) and has polynomial running time (i.e., computational complexity is polynomial with respect to relevant parameters). Our algorithm further minimizes the query complexity through a novel randomized active learning procedure. In particular, our algorithm demonstrates a near-optimal tradeoff between the regret bound and the query complexity. To extend the results to more general nonlinear function approximation, we design a model-based randomized algorithm inspired by the idea of Thompson sampling. Our algorithm minimizes Bayesian regret bound and query complexity, again achieving a near-optimal tradeoff between these two quantities. Computation-wise, similar to the prior Thompson sampling algorithms under the regular RL setting, the main computation primitives of our algorithm are Bayesian supervised learning oracles which have been heavily investigated on the empirical side when applying Thompson sampling algorithms to RL benchmark problems.

### Summary
This paper introduces a novel RLHF algorithm capable of learning from preference-based feedback while maintaining efficiency across statistical complexity, computational complexity, and query complexity. The algorithm is demonstrated to strike a near-optimal balance between regret bound and query complexity. Additionally, the authors extend these results to encompass more general nonlinear function approximation through the development of a model-based Thompson sampling method, accompanied by a Bayesian regret analysis.

### Strengths
1. This paper makes good theoretical contributions. Despite prior works achieving sublinear worst-case regret for RL with preference-based feedback, these existing algorithms are often computationally infeasible, even in simplified models like tabular MDP. In the context of linear MDP, this paper marks the first RL algorithm that simultaneously achieves sublinear worst-case regret and computational efficiency when handling preference-based feedback.

2. While the primary contribution is theoretical, the research provides valuable practical insights. Notably, the proposed algorithms suggest drawing one trajectory from the latest policy and another from an older policy, rather than two from the same policy, for regret minimization. This innovation departs from conventional practices and enhances the practicality of RLHF.

3. Despite its theoretical nature, the paper is exceptionally well-written and easily comprehensible.

### Questions
1. Sekhari et al. (2023a) have previously explored contextual bandits and imitation learning via preference-based active queries, demonstrating efficiency in statistical, computational, and query complexity. While this current paper addresses RL with linear MDP and nonlinear MDP, it would be beneficial to elucidate the specific technical differentiators that set it apart from Sekhari et al. (2023a).

2. The paper proposes a new RLHF algorithm that relies on various input parameters such as $\sigma_r, \sigma_P, \epsilon, \alpha_L, \alpha_U$. The authors provide rates for these parameters in the main theorem, some of which depend on unknown true parameters. To establish practical utility, it is crucial to use numerical simulations to justify the newly proposed algorithm.

3. It is essential to support the theoretical findings with numerical evidence that demonstrates the superiority of the proposed approach over existing benchmark RLHF methods. Numerical comparisons would enhance the practical relevance and acceptance of this paper.

### Summary
This paper studied RL with preference feedback and provided regret guarantee for linear MDP. Some extensions to nonlinear case using eluder dimension is also studied.

### Strengths
An interesting problem and solid theory.

### Weaknesses
I have some major concerns:

1. The theoretical contributions are incremental. The proposed algorithm is fairly standard (RLSVI) and almost identical as previous work. The proof technique is very routine and it is hard for me to see novelty here. There are a large body of theoretical works based on linear MDP and using model-free algorithms. The author didn't have a concrete comparison with them. Extension to nonlinear function approximation using eluder dimension is fairly well-known as well. People know for a while the only known function class for smaller eluder dimension is linear and generalized linear. There are many more general complexity measures for RL: Bellman-Eluder, Decision-Estimation Coefficient, bilinear class. The appendix is very long. I feel it might not be good to prove everything from scratch. There are so many prior works and I might suggest the authors to query existing lemma as much as possible to respect prior works.

2. This work is far away from the practical RLHF use case. There is no experiment at all and the algorithm seems to be practically feasible. For example, it is unclear how to implement LLM fine-tuning through RLHF using algorithm 2. It is also unclear why we care about cumulative regret in the context of RLHF for LLM alignment.

### Summary
This paper considers learning linear MDP (Assp 4.1) with preferential feedback. The unobservability of rewards makes learning significantly harder than standard RL. The author proposes PR-LSVI (Alg 1). PR-LSVI combines the MLE and Gaussian exploration to balance the exploration versus exploitation tradeoff. The algorithm only queries the feedback when the two trajectories can have a large gap (2). Theorem 4.2 bounds regret and query complexity. The paper also introduced a posterior sampling algorithm (Alg 2) and derived its Bayesian regret and query complexity. The paper is somewhat more detailed than it should be but readable in general. I could not follow the details of the paper but found no issues. 

Minor comments:
* Alg 1 Line 15: Quey -> Query

### Strengths
* Learning of linear MDP under limited feedback with optimal regret in terms of $T$ ($\tilde{O}(\sqrt{T})$)
* Conceptually simple algorithm (Alg 1 and 2), which is computationally tractable and amount of query is controllable.

### Weaknesses
 * Large volume: 53 pages is a bit large for conference proceedings. Not to mention, the shorter, the better s.t. the same results.
* Suboptimal dependence on parameters except for $T$, such as $H$, which makes the exploration larger than what is required (Alg 1).
* No experimental/simulation results.
* Disjointness of two results: Two algorithms are not connected together, and they have different objectives (frequentist or Bayesian).

### Questions
* Could you elaborate with the connection of the paper by Wang et al. (2023)?

* Could you elaborate on $\omega$ after (1)? To my understanding, this controls the rewards in subsequent rounds. Essentially, the exploration and exploitation tradeoff is resolved by demonstrating that the exploration is enough (and decaying at the same rate as uncertainty), and describing the mechanism would help the reader.

* One of the closest papers to this is Zanette et al 2019 which combines randomized exploration with least squares. Obviously, this paper is new in the sense that it deals with preferential noise. Other than that, are there technical novelty that should be highlighted in this paper?

### Summary
This paper considers Reinforcement Learning with preference-based feedback. Two algorithms are proposed with corresponding bounds on the (Bayesian) regret and (Bayesian) query complexity. The novelty lies at the application of randomization into the algorithm design in the preference-based feedback setup, making the algorithm more computationally efficient. It shows that there is a trade-off between the regret and the query times, i.e., more queries lead to less regret. The relationship is quantitatively characterized in the main results in terms of the parameter $\beta$.

### Strengths
- For MDPs with linear structure, it proposes an algorithm that utilizes randomizations to facilitate the learning process under the context of preference feedback.
- When the MDPs are not linear, it introduces a Thompson sampling based algorithm with accompanying Bayesian regret bound and query complexity bound.
- For the proposed algorithms, regret bounds and query complexities are derived, which quantitatively characterizes the tradeoff between them. This provides insights on how to tune the threshold $\epsilon$ in the algorithm in order to achieve certain performance, which I  appreciate a lot.
- By injecting randomness to the algorithm, it improves the computation efficiency of the RL algorithm for the preference-based feedback problem.

### Weaknesses
 - It would be great if the authors can illustrate the empirical performances of the proposed algorithms. Algorithm 2 seems to be computationally intensive. Additionally, it would be convincing if we can observe the tradeoff between the regret and query times in the experiments.

Minors:
- While most notations are well explained, some notations are used without being properly defined, e.g., $\hat{\theta}_{P,t,h}$. This may hinder the readers in other relevant field from reading this paper. Hope the authors can further improve the paper presentation.



### Questions
- In terms of the regret bound for algorithm 1 (Theorem 4.2), can the authors comment on the dependence on $d$? Compared to the work by Zanette et al. (2020), it seems the power has increased a lot.
