- Decision: Accept
- Scores: 5, 8, 5, 6

## Abstract
\vspace{-2mm}
Typical neural network trainings have substantial variance in test-set performance between repeated runs, impeding hyperparameter comparison and training reproducibility.
In this work we present the following results towards understanding this variation.
(1) Despite having significant variance on their test-\textit{sets}, we demonstrate that standard CIFAR-10 and ImageNet trainings have little variance in performance on the underlying test-\textit{distributions} from which their test-sets are sampled.
(2) We show that these trainings make approximately independent errors on their test-sets.
That is, the event that a trained network makes an error on one particular example does not affect its chances of making errors on other examples, relative to their average rates over repeated runs of training with the same hyperparameters.
(3) We prove that the variance of neural network trainings on their test-sets is a downstream consequence of the class-calibration property discovered by \citet{jiang2021assessing}. Our analysis yields a simple formula which accurately predicts variance for the binary classification case.
(4) We conduct preliminary studies of data augmentation, learning rate, finetuning instability and distribution-shift through the lens of variance between runs.

### Confidence
3: You are fairly confident in your assessment. It is possible that you did not understand some parts of the submission or that you are unfamiliar with some pieces of related work. Math/other details were not carefully checked.

### Summary
This paper shows that the variance for true test distribution among multiple training runs is actually smaller than those observed from the test dataset. They also proposed a statistical assumption and derived an estimator to estimate the stand deviation of the test distribution.

### Strengths
The paper is easy to follow. The paper provides many empirical analysis to support their points and also include some theoretical analysis.

### Weaknesses
Since most parts of the paper are based on the empirical analysis, it might be better the have the experimental setup in the main paper including all the hyperparameters and all the models in those 60000. However, it might be important to include results for different architectures since some of the models may have better reproductions. It might be interesting to have more use cases for getting the variances of the true test distribution.

Have we tried different architectures? Do they have similar results? I am curious do we really need to get the true variance? For example, if for all the models, we have a similar trend between variance from test-set and test-distribution, then why do we need to get that?

Do we have some cases that the variance among the test distribution gives us new insight? For example, does flatness of the minimizer related with this?

### Summary
This paper delves into the variance observed in test-set performance across repeated runs of neural network training, a phenomenon that has raised concerns about hyperparameter comparison and training reproducibility. Key findings of the study are:

- Although there's significant variance in test-set performance, the variation on the underlying test-distributions (like CIFAR-10 and ImageNet) is minimal. This suggests that in practical applications, the variance might not be as concerning as assumed.

- The study puts forth an "examplewise independence" hypothesis, suggesting that a network's correct prediction for a given test example is akin to a biased coin flip and is independent of its predictions on other examples.

- The paper states that prior works have noted that predictions from ensembles of networks, trained repeatedly, are typically calibrated. They argue that this calibration inevitably leads to some variance in test-set accuracy. For binary classifications, they provide a formula to determine this variance.

- Other observations include the reduction in distribution-wise variance with longer training durations, the correlation between optimal learning rate and absence of excess distribution-wise variance, the effect of data augmentation in reducing variance, and the increase in variance when test-sets differ from the training set.

### Strengths
This paper covers an interesting topic: the variation of test accuracy over random seeds (stochasticity of deep learning experiments). It tells the test accuracy on the whole test set from the test accuracy on the test distribution (random subsets of test sets). An important conclusion is that accuracy gain in the whole test set from random seeds does not generalize to the whole test distribution. Another interesting conclusion is that the result of trained model on each example can be approximated by binomial distribution with biased flip probability.

Overall, I find this paper interesting and novel. The paper is easy to understand.

### Weaknesses
Althouth I enjoy reading this paper, the analysis is mainly posterior: we can only get these insights after running the same algorithm for hundreds of runs. As far as I can see, the insights from this paper can tell us if a training algorithm is good despite the impact of random seed, but it cannot tell if a trained model is better than another despite the impact of random seed. If this paper can further achieve the latter application, I would be more than happy to raise my score.

Another concern is how well does the conclusion itself generalize to other settings. In Figure 1, it seems the variance becomes smaller as training goes on. But I think it is caused by the learning rate schedule: the authors say that they "always linearly ramp the learning rate down to zero by the end of training", so it is expected that the accuracy has less variation in the end.

### Questions
- How does the conclusion generalize to other training setting or other network architecture (like Transformers)?

- How can the insights of random seeds help practical development? E.g. if they can be used to tell the quality of individual model, to separate the accuracy into random part and true accuracy.

### Summary
The authors analyze the variance between trained networks on the test set and find that minor variations are insignificant and explained by finite sample noise due to a finite test set. Further, they show that when considering the test distribution, the variations in validation set performance are not well correlated with the test distribution performance.

### Strengths
- The work formalizes what I think many people would ultimately suspect in that the minor variations between runs are insignificant when looked at through the larger perspective of the test distribution. Even though I think this would be expected, it is nice to see a work which empirically verifies it. 

- The derived bounds are useful for estimating the expected variance between runs.

### Weaknesses
 - The two main itemized contributions contain way too many points to be in a list. They are paragraph sized. I do not think something of that size should be presented in a list. I believe they either need to be broken up into smaller components, or discussed in plain text instead of a list.

- What is $n$ in theorem 3, 4, and 5? I suppose it should be the size of the dataset, but it would be nice to include this right by the theorems in order to avoid any possible confusion.

- I think it would be interesting to see the difference in Theorem 3 when varying the number of models in the ensemble. For instance, the bias in the estimate may be small, and a two model ensemble may give good results, or it may actually require quite a large ensemble in order to be close to correct. Can you add this experiment? I believe it can be done by only randomly choosing and expanding the ensemble of the models which are already trained.

- Many of the claims listed as main contributions are in the appendix. Even in the conclusion, the things in the appendix as main contributions which have been demonstrated even though there has been nothing said about them up until this point in the text. I do not think this is fair to the reader and it should be reorganized or rewritten such that this does not happen.

- In section 3.4 it says: “That is, if we let S ′ be the subset of test images which are classified by 30-40% of independently trained networks as “dog”, then approximately 30-40% of the images in S ′ really will be dogs.” I do not think that is how calibration is phrased in most calibration works. The definition of calibration should align with the standard definition, such as the one presented in [1]. Specifically, calibration, as discussed in [1], requires that for a subset of images $S'$, where each image is classified as a dog with a predicted probability (confidence) between 30-40%, approximately 30-40% of the images in $S'$ should actually be dogs. The current phrasing seems to conflate the proportion of networks classifying an image as a dog with the predicted probability of the image belonging to the dog class. This is a crucial distinction for proper calibration analysis.

- In figure 2, why is (odd examples) in parentheses? I cannot figure out what this means since there are only two splits and they seem to be uniformly random.

Ultimately, I like the findings of this work, but I find part of the presentation problematic as noted in the weaknesses section above. If these things can be fixed, I would probably raise my score.

### Summary
In this work, the authors try to address the following important question: are marginal improvements in test accuracy (after a certain point) on benchmark datasets actually indicative of better models (with respect to the underlying data distribution)? Towards this end, the authors conduct a series of large-scale experiments on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet which show that trained model performance becomes uncorrelated on disjoint splits of test data. They also connect this variance in model performance with the notion of calibration of ensembles of models.

### Strengths
1. **Originality:** The experimental setups in this paper, as well as the connection introduced between model variance and calibration, are to the best of my knowledge new and contain several interesting ideas.
2. **Quality:** The authors have run extensive experiments to verify their hypotheses (at least within the context of the benchmarks they restrict themselves to), and their theoretical predictions track the experiments quite closely (for the appropriate regimes). 
3. **Clarity:** Overall the paper is very easy to read, and justification/sufficient detail are provided for the experiments conducted in the paper.
4. **Significance:** This paper studies the important problem of how to assess a trained model's future test performance, and introduces useful formalisms for thinking about this problem. The main drawback here is that the paper's experiments and hypotheses are restricted to two image classification benchmarks (which are widespread - this is still a useful contribution), so it is tricky to assess how well the observations will generalize.

### Weaknesses
## Main Weaknesses
1. **Generalization of takeaways.** The practical takeaway provided in the paper in Section 3 is that marginal test performance improvements for well-trained models on CIFAR-10/ImageNet can be uncorrelated with performance on the underlying data distribution. I have some concerns with this claim (i.e. fixed test splits vs resampling), but even assuming this to be true - what can be said for more general machine learning (or even image classification) tasks? For example, in the experiments in Section 4, as the authors note there is a clear correlation between BERT-Large validation performance and test performance. I am not really sure how this should be interpreted in the context of the paper; while the analysis in the paper shows empirically that BERT-Large fine-tuning has more variance than BERT-Base, I don't see how the analysis in the paper would allow one to predict (without running many experiments) whether val performance will be correlated with test performance or not. The paper does not sufficiently address the conditions under which the decorrelation phenomenon will appear, or how to anticipate it without extensive experimentation. It's unclear if the observed decorrelation is a general property of well-trained models, or a specific artifact of the experimental setup and datasets used.
2. **Hyperparameter choices/sensitivity for results.** Of course it is not possible to be entirely comprehensive with respect to hyperparameters, but I have concerns with some choices made by the authors. Particularly, the training horizons considered are 0, 4, 16, and 64 epochs. We see in the experimental results a clear trend of decreasing variance as the training horizons are extended - do any of the results still hold for longer training horizons? I would anticipate that the independence of network predictions surely shrinks as training horizons are extended. The paper should provide more evidence that the observed decorrelation is not simply a transient phenomenon that disappears with longer training. The choice of training epochs seems somewhat arbitrary and may not reflect realistic training scenarios where models are trained until convergence. It is unclear how sensitive the results are to these choices, and whether the conclusions would change with different training schedules or optimization parameters.

## Minor Comments
- In the proof of Lemma 1, the exponent should be inside the expectation. Additionally, it's probably helpful to justify the penultimate step (interchange of expectation) by saying that Fubini's Theorem applies.
- It would be better to include a definition of ECE in Section 3.4, or at least verbally describe it in the context of Hypothesis 2.

### Questions
- Is the test set split fixed? In other words, when the authors write "we split the test-set into two halves of 5000 examples each", does this mean there is a single fixed split of the test set? If so, this seems to not make sense in the context of the proposed formalism ($S \sim \mathcal{D}^n$), which considers randomly sampled test-sets.
