- Decision: Accept
- Scores: 5, 5, 6

## Abstract
Vision Transformers (ViTs) have been widely used in various domains. Similar to Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), ViTs are prone to the impacts of adversarial samples, raising security concerns in real-world applications. As one of the most effective black-box attack methods, transferable attacks can generate adversarial samples on surrogate models to directly attack the target model without accessing the parameters. However, due to the distinct internal structures of ViTs and CNNs, adversarial samples constructed by traditional transferable attack methods may not be applicable to ViTs. Therefore, it is imperative to propose more effective transferability attack methods to unveil latent vulnerabilities in ViTs. Existing methods have found that applying gradient regularization to extreme gradients across different functional regions in the transformer structure can enhance sample transferability. However, in practice, substantial gradient disparities exist even within the same functional region across different layers. Furthermore, we find that mild gradients therein are the main culprits behind reduced transferability. In this paper, we introduce a novel Gradient Normalization Scaling method for fine-grained gradient editing to enhance the transferability of adversarial attacks on ViTs. More importantly, we highlight that ViTs, unlike traditional CNNs, exhibit distinct attention regions in the frequency domain. Leveraging this insight, we delve into exploring the frequency domain to further enhance the algorithm's transferability. Through extensive experimentation on various ViT variants and traditional CNN models, we substantiate that the new approach achieves state-of-the-art performance, with an average performance improvement of 33.54\% and 42.05\% on ViT and CNN models, respectively. Our code is available at: https://github.com/LMBTough/GNS-HFA.

### Confidence
4: You are confident in your assessment, but not absolutely certain. It is unlikely, but not impossible, that you did not understand some parts of the submission or that you are unfamiliar with some pieces of related work.

### Summary
In this submission, the authors proposed a gradient normalization scaling and high frequency adaptation for vision transformers. Specifically, the authors proposed to improve the generalization ability of ViTs by using gradient normalization. Moreover, the authors proposed a high frequency adaptation approach to guide the back-propagation in ViTs. Experimental results on several public datasets for adversarial attack have illustrated the effectiveness of the proposed method.

### Strengths
1. The paper is easy to follow.
2. The idea is well motivated and presented.

### Weaknesses
The contribution is marginal, since the gradient normalization was demonstrated in [1], please discuss the major differences.

### Questions
Please conduct ablation studies using only GNS or HFA to demonstrate the effectiveness of those two methods.

### Summary
In order to enhance the transferability of adversarial attacks on ViTs, this paper introduces a novel gradient normalization scaling method for fine-grained gradient editing. After calculating the distribution of gradients, tanh is used for scaling the gradients that are considered as prone to cause overfitting and have minimal impact on attack capability. A high frequency adaptation method is proposed to explore the sensitivity of ViTs to adversarial attacks in different frequency regions, on the premise that ViTs shows different attention areas from CNNs in frequency. DCT transformation is conducted to obtain high frequency features, and then reverse transformation is put afterward to feed into the network for backpropagation. From the comparison of Attack Success Rates on ViT and CNN models, this work achieves better performance, enhancing the transferability of adversarial samples on ViTs.

### Strengths
1. This paper comes up with a novel problem space.
2. Utilizing normalization, or scaling is innovative.
3. Achieved better attack transferability performance than SOTA methods.

### Weaknesses
1.	Lack of soundness of mild gradients and extreme gradients. The paper does not provide a clear, mechanistic explanation of why mild gradients are more prone to overfitting than extreme gradients. It is not sufficient to simply state that they are; the underlying cause should be explored, such as how the magnitude of gradients affects the learning dynamics in ViTs, and how this differs from CNNs. The concept of 'mild' and 'extreme' gradients needs to be more rigorously defined in relation to the optimization landscape, not just an arbitrary threshold.
2.	Normalization and scaling process is insufficiently demonstrated. The paper lacks a detailed explanation of how the normalization and scaling are implemented. The specific mathematical operations, the order of these operations, and the parameters used are not clearly described. The connection between the tanh function and the scaling process is not well-justified. It is unclear why tanh is the appropriate choice for this scaling, and how the parameters of the tanh function are chosen and how they affect the scaling behavior.
3.	Miss rationale of utilizing high frequency. Is frequency transformation for better ViTs or for better attacks? The paper does not provide a strong rationale for why high-frequency components are specifically targeted. While it is mentioned that ViTs attend to different frequency regions than CNNs, the paper does not explain why manipulating high frequencies leads to better transferability. The connection between high-frequency manipulation and the generalization of adversarial examples is not clear. It is unclear if the high frequency transformation is intended to improve the ViT model's robustness or to enhance the attack's transferability, and this distinction needs to be made clear.
4.	Ablation study is insufficient to evaluate the impact of your two components on the final method performance and verify their importance. The ablation study is not comprehensive enough to demonstrate the individual contributions of the gradient normalization scaling (GNS) and high-frequency adaptation (HFA) components. It is not clear how the performance changes when each component is removed or modified, and whether the two components are complementary or if one dominates the other. The study should include more variations of the components to verify their importance.
5.	Some sentences contain grammatical errors, such as missing subjects.

### Questions
1.	In your Abstract, after a one-sentence introduction to ViT, quickly talk about enhancing the transferability of adversarial attacks on ViTs is somewhat discontinuous. Adding an introduction to adversarial attacks in between would make it smoother. There are many more logical breaks like this. 
2.	Structure illustration figure can be more detailed/comprehensible. Figure annotations could provide more explanation. 
3.	There should be more explanations about how mild gradients and extreme gradients in Figure 3 react to your specific parameters (briefly introduce u here instead of later), and why mild gradients are the easiest to overfit. Besides, why is µ + u ∗ σ the watershed between mild and extreme gradients? 
4.	Normalization and scaling seem to be one and the same.
5.	Give more arguments for tanh and frequency transformation.
6.	GNS-HFA is a combination, so does each part fit your hypothesis? What role do they play? Which one contributes more?

### Summary
This paper proposes a method to increase the tranferrability of adversarial attacks across Transformer models. The key idea is to attenuate mild gradients and to do frequency adaptive perturbation of the input signal.

After rebuttal, I decided to increase my score to reflect the answers.

### Strengths
The comperhensive numerical results in the paper across a number of architectures and attack methods shows the benefits of the approach, consistently achieving very high transferrability scores. The method itself seems quite simple to implement.

### Weaknesses
This paper was written in a manner which made it very difficult for me to follow the exact approach. I have a number of questions below which I hope the authors will address. I am not up to date on the latest adversarial literature and therefore it may be that I have missed obvious ideas, but nevertheless I think the authors should write the paper for a general ICLR audience rather than adversarial sub-field experts. I am willing to re-visit my rating if the authors can provide satisfactory answers to the questions below, which are mostly to do with the very opaque setup in the paper.

Questions:

1. What are "strong" and "mild" gradients? These terms are assumed to be understood by the reader, but never explicitly defined. At the least, one would expect some informal definition to give the reader some intuition.

2. The definition of "channels" in a Transformer model is unclear. For conv nets, it is obvious what this refers to. It seems to refer to the number of attention heads, but it was not too clear.

3. It is unclear why attentuating certain types of gradients ("mild") leads to better transferability. Is there an intuition that the authors can provide for this phenomenon?

4. The HFA method was quite unclear to me (and I guess it will be to many readers).

5. How are the GNS and HFA methods combined?

6. What exactly do the results in Table 1 show us? Is there one model on which the adversarial attacks were generated, and the remaining were the rates of success?
