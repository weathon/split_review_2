# Benchmarking Diffusion Based Text-Guided Image Editing Methods

- Decision: Reject
- Scores: 6, 5, 5, 6

## Abstract
A plethora of text-guided image editing methods have recently been developed by leveraging the impressive capabilities of large-scale diffusion-based generative models such as Imagen and Stable Diffusion. A standardized evaluation protocol, however, does not exist to compare methods across different types of fine-grained edits. To address this gap, we introduce \editval{}, a standardized benchmark for quantitatively evaluating text-guided image editing methods. \editval{} consists of a curated dataset of images, a set of editable attributes for each image drawn from 13 possible edit types, and an automated evaluation pipeline that uses pre-trained vision-language models to assess the fidelity of generated images for each edit type. 
We use \editval{} to benchmark 8 cutting-edge diffusion-based editing methods including SINE, Imagic and Instruct-Pix2Pix. We complement this with a large-scale human study where we show that \editval's automated evaluation pipeline is strongly correlated with human-preferences for the edit types we considered.
From both the human study and automated evaluation, we find that: (i) Instruct-Pix2Pix, Null-Text and SINE are the top-performing methods averaged across different edit types, however {\it only} Instruct-Pix2Pix and Null-Text are able to preserve original image properties; (ii) Most of the editing methods fail at edits involving spatial operations (e.g., {\it changing the position of an object}).  (iii) There is no `winner' method which ranks the best individually across a range of different edit types. 
We hope that our benchmark can pave the way to developing more reliable text-guided image editing tools in the future.
We will publicly release \editval{}, and all associated code and human-study templates to support these research directions in \url{https://deep-ml-research.io/editval/}.

### Summary
The paper introduces a comprehensive benchmark specifically designed to evaluate text-guided image editing methods, effectively addressing a noticeable gap in the realm of image editing. This benchmark assembles a dataset encompassing 13 potential types of edits and proposes two evaluation pipelines, consisting of both an automated pipeline and a human-study template. The automated pipeline leverages vision-language models for the assessment of object-centric modifications, while the human-study template utilizes Amazon Mechanical Turk (AMT) to gather responses to a curated set of questions. The paper conducts evaluations on 8 state-of-the-art diffusion-based image editing methods, providing a valuable reference for future advancements in the field.

### Strengths
1. The paper tackles a critical and previously unaddressed issue in image editing, identifying the limitations inherent in existing benchmarks such as TedBench and EditBench.
2. A novel and holistic evaluation approach is introduced, incorporating both the automated method and the human study to assess a comprehensive range of 13 edit types.
3. The paper conducts thorough evaluations on eight of the latest image editing methods, serving as a good reference for future work.

### Weaknesses
1. There is a need for more detailed information regarding the implementation of the image editing methods. For example, methods such as Null-Text and SINE, are not based on instructions. It is confusing that instruction-based editing evaluations are applied to them.
2. The evaluation appears to lack focus on image-editing methods that deal with complex editing operations. For instance, methods like Diffusion Self-Guidance for Controllable Image Generation, which is designed to handle the shape, location, and appearance of objects, could be evaluated to show the performance of spatial manipulation.

### Summary
The paper proposes an evaluation protocol for text-guided image editing methods, and evaluates a set of 8 recent diffusion-based editing methods. Authors first build an editing benchmark using ChatGPT, comprising 92 images and 19 classes from the COCO dataset. Each image is associated with a set of pre-defined editing instructions linked to objects categories and manually defined editing types. This benchmark is then used to evaluate the 8 editing methods in two ways: 1) using a AMT user study, and 2) using hand crafted object detection-based rules for object centric editing tasks (e.g. object replacement or addition) to automatically evaluate editing success.  The performance of the methods is discussed according to these metrics, and the correlation between the human study and automated evaluation is investigated as well.

### Strengths
Image editing is a challenging task to evaluate, notably due to its subjective nature. Existing metrics and evaluation protocols are insufficient, despite the current high popularity of the topic. Therefore, authors are addressing an important and timely research topic. Having a systematic evaluation protocol for editing tasks can strongly benefit methodological development. 

Authors carried out a large amount of work, manually curating images from the COCO dataset and designing a set of editing instructions. The detailed evaluation and analysis of 8 popular editing methods is particularly interesting, highlighting their strengths and limitations.

The idea of going beyond global image scores and leveraging object detection tasks is interesting and has potential to provide informative insights.

### Weaknesses
One big limitation of the paper is its poor presentation. It is very crowded, with a lot of vspace adjustments, making the reading experience uncomfortable. Several facts are repeated numerous times, notably editval’s description and main contributions, while key elements are left for the reader to find in the appendix (e.g. the choice of the COCO dataset as source of images).  The definition of editVal instead is not clear, in certain parts of the paper it is described as the data, edits and automated eval, and in others (e.g. the introduction) it includes the human study as well. 

The paper is presenting many contributions : building a benchmark, analyzing pre-existing methods through a human study, developing an automated evaluation metric and comparing this metric’s performance to user preferences. It is impossible to address all thoroughly and clearly, leading to a lack of in depth discussion and exploration.  For example, the user study can provide a lot of insights over the different editing methods’ behaviours, but only the top 4 methods (selected according to an unknown criterion) are briefly discussed in 4.2. Comparing the performance of methods that require fine-tuning vs training free, or methods that use similar editing mechanisms, for example, could be very interesting. Perhaps the work could be more impactful if split in multiple papers or sent to a venue where more space is available. 
Authors also overclaim their contributions, presenting their automated pipeline as an alternative to the human study. However, their detection based strategy can only evaluate a subset of editing tasks, and only provides a binary success/fail output. In addition, additional editing criteria (content preservation, image quality) cannot be measured this way, with authors reverting to standard metrics (FID, DINO scores) to complete their evaluation process.  It is not clear whether these two additional metrics are part of the automated evaluation pipeline. 

The related work section is too limited. An important topic of the paper is the lack of reliable evaluation metrics for editing tasks, yet pre-existing works are not reviewed (besides CLIP). For examples, authors do not discuss recent techniques such as ImageReward (Xu et al, Neurips 2023) or Pickscore (Kirstain et al. , 2023). Furthermore, the detection based metric should be compared to these other metrics  in terms of human preference correlation, to highlight the advantages of the proposed technique.  
It should also be noted that authors claim a strong correlation between their human study and their proposed metric, yet DINO scores show a much stronger correlation (fig 10), than the owl-vit based metric (fig. 6). This further highlights the importance of comparing the proposed technique to pre-existing works.

### Questions
-In section 3.1, it is mentioned that the 19 categories with the highest overlap across editing types were selected. What does overlap across editing types mean? What was the selection criterion? 

-It is mentioned that chatGPT is used to generate a list of plausible editing changes. Are these quality controlled as well ? 

-How did author select the top 4 performing methods to show in Figure 4? Was a global score computed, or a ranking across editing types and question type?  

-Dreambooth and textual inversion were not initially developed for editing purposes, why include these methods?

-COCO is still a challenging dataset for object detection tasks. Was the dataset curated for simpler detection tasks? Does it occur that OWL-vit fails to detect the objects to edit?

### Summary
The paper introduces a standardised benchmark for text-driven image-editing methods. The authors evaluate eight s.o.t.a. editing methods and analyse their performance across popular editing tasks.

### Strengths
* The benchmark provides a comprehensive list of edits and classes.
* Extensive human study for s.o.t.a. text-guided image-editing methods. 
* Valuable conclusions about existing editing methods.
* The paper provides many thorough details and discussions explaining the design choices.

### Weaknesses
The automated evaluation pipeline seems incomplete and limited:
* Only 6 out of 13 edits are supported. 
* The pipeline can only check the object presence, location and size. For example, it cannot recognize if a cup stands naturally on the bench for “add a cup on the bench”. These aspects make this evaluator quite vulnerable. 
* It does not evaluate image fidelity and image-context preservation. One still needs FID and DINO/CLIP scores which are not specifically designed for editing evaluation.

Therefore, I do not fully understand the value of the proposed automated pipeline if one still needs a human study for reliable evaluation. 
Probably, it would be reasonable to finetune some visual language model on the collected human scores and obtain something similar to ImageReward[1] but for the editing tasks. In addition, one can consider combining it with the proposed detector-based algorithms.

### Questions
* Please address the concern about the automated pipeline in Weaknesses.
* From my perspective, it is not quite correct to compute FID in the editing setting, especially when there are only 92 real images. Could you please provide more details on this?

### Summary
EditVal proposes a standardized benchmark for evaluating text2image editing methods across various edit types. The proposed benchmark has an automated evaluation pipeline and enables evaluation in scale. The paper benchmarks 8 SoTA editing methods using the proposed benchmark and finds that the benchmark positively correlates to human eval. This study found there is no clear winner in all categories and it discovered that all SoTA methods perform poorly for complex editing operations.

### Strengths
– the paper is well-written and well-motivated, trying to standardize evaluation on text-based image editing methods.
– the proposed benchmark is general purpose and includes larger and more complete edit types compared to previous benchmarks.
– the proposed method adopts OwL-ViT for evaluating edit types that require fine-drained localization capability

### Weaknesses
– the proposed benchmark only includes real images from MSCOCO, a missing evaluation on common use case is editing on synthetic generated images, which I think should be added to the benchmark
– the automatic evaluation pipeline cannot capture hallucinations, i.e. Figure 1 object addition, Dreambooth added a plausible wine glass next to the pizza, but the original content does not preserve well, and Pix2Pix is the opposite;

### Questions
– what are your thoughts on the practical usage of the benchmark? does achieving a high score translate into a better editing method in practice or does it just mean it is relatively better than other methods?
- I do have concerns on the practical usefulness of the benchmark, especially the automatic evaluation pipeline, hopefully the authors can address them as mention in the weakness
