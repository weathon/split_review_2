## Abstract
Text-to-Image Diffusion Models such as Stable-Diffusion and Imagen have achieved unprecedented quality of photorealism with state-of-the-art FID scores on MS-COCO and other generation benchmarks. 
Given a caption, image generation requires fine-grained knowledge about attributes such as object structure, style, and viewpoint amongst others. {\it Where does this information reside in text-to-image generative models?} 
In our paper, we tackle this question and understand how knowledge corresponding to distinct visual attributes is stored in large-scale text-to-image diffusion models. We adapt Causal Mediation Analysis for text-to-image models and trace knowledge about distinct visual attributes to various (causal) components in the (i) UNet and (ii) text-encoder of the diffusion model. 
In particular, we show that unlike generative large-language models, knowledge about different attributes is not localized in isolated components, but is instead distributed amongst a set of components in the conditional UNet. These sets of components are often distinct for different visual attributes (e.g., {\it style} / {\it objects}).  
Remarkably, we find that the CLIP text-encoder in public text-to-image models such as Stable-Diffusion contains {\it only} one causal state across different visual attributes, and this is the first self-attention layer corresponding to the last subject token of the attribute in the caption. 
This is in stark contrast to the causal states in other language models which are often the mid-MLP layers. 
Based on this observation of {\it only} one causal state in the text-encoder, we introduce a fast, data-free model editing method \difffix{} which can effectively edit concepts (remove or update knowledge) in text-to-image models.~\difffix{} can edit (ablate) concepts in under a second with a closed-form update, providing a significant 1000x speedup and comparable editing performance to existing fine-tuning based editing methods.

### Summary
This paper first introduces the authors' discovery of what are the critical layers for a text to image diffusion model to generate images of certain visual concepts and styles. Based on the analysis, authors propose a method called "DIFF-QUICKFIX" that removes/edits certain visual concepts that the model is able to generate.

The method for localizing these critical layers are adapted from Casual Mediation Analysis, where certain activations of a corrupted model is replaced with that of the original model to identify its impact to the generated image. Specifically both the UNet and text encoder are studied, and experiments show the inspected visual concepts and attributes are scattered on various layers of UNet, as well as the first transformer layer of the CLIP text encoder.

Based on the findings above, authors propose to remove/update concepts by modifying the out put projection unit in the first self attention layer to remap the generated activation to target concept's activation, thus removing/updating the model's generated content.

### Strengths
The proposed method for locating and editing knowledge in diffusion models is a novel approach.

The editing method introduced in this paper is unique and significantly faster than traditional training-based techniques. As demonstrated by the results presented in the appendix, the method effectively removes or modifies unwanted concepts introduced by the diffusion model.

The authors clearly convey the paper's main idea, with appropriate background information at most places. The extensive results provided in the appendix are particularly valuable given the lack of well-established metrics for evaluating open-domain text-to-image generation models. These results allow reviewers and readers to effectively assess the method's soundness and effectiveness.

### Weaknesses
The scope of the claims seems too broad. The title and introduction claim to locate the knowledge of text-to-image diffusion models, while in the paper, only one stable diffusion model checkpoint is investigated. Given that most of the findings on this model are through laborious experiments, it is unclear if these findings can be generalized to even other versions of stable diffusion models, not to mention other types of text-to-image models. The experiments are limited to a single checkpoint of Stable Diffusion v1.4, and it is not clear whether the observed layer-specific concept localization would hold for other versions or architectures. If the findings are only applicable to the studied checkpoint, the impact of the method may be significantly restricted, as the studied model is not considered state-of-the-art.

Lack of comparison to other methods. The visualized results are definitely pleasing to the eye, but it would be better if results of other models could be visualized side-by-side to provide more references. The paper would benefit from a more thorough comparison with existing concept ablation techniques. While the qualitative results are compelling, a quantitative comparison using established metrics would strengthen the evaluation. Without such comparisons, it is difficult to assess the relative performance of the proposed method.

The subsection on "Selecting Threshold for CLIP-Score" can be confusing to read at the beginning. Perhaps some context of why this is needed would be helpful for readers. The explanation of the threshold selection mechanism for CLIP-Score lacks sufficient context. It is not immediately clear why this thresholding is necessary or how it relates to the overall goal of identifying causal layers. A more detailed explanation of the underlying motivation and the specific criteria used for threshold selection would be beneficial.

### Questions
My main question is how the results of this study generalize to other text-to-image generation models, and what are the components that can be reused if we want to apply the method to another model.

Other than optimizing the W_out, an alternative approach would be to directly replace the token embeddings, e.g., from embeddings for "Van Gogh" to those for "painting". I wonder what the authors' view is on the effectiveness of this approach.

I don't see any results on removing trademarked objects as claimed at the top of page 3. Were they removed during the preparation of the manuscript?

While it seems reasonable to use CLIPScore as AIE, it does not seem that |CLIPScore(x_0^{restored}, c) - CLIPScore(x_{0}^{corr}, c)| can be approximated by CLIPScore(x_0^{restored}, c). In particular, both increases and decreases of CLIPScore(x_0^{restored}, c) by the same amount around CLIPScore(x_{0}^{corr}, c) lead to the same absolute difference, but the CLIPScore(x_0^{restored}, c) is obviously different.

### Summary
The paper examines the localization of knowledge in language-text models for image generation, specifically UNet and stable diffusion with the CLIP-ViT-L/336px text-encoder. Previous works have not explored these models, and the paper presents some interesting findings such as the wide dispersion of visual concepts across UNet layers coupled with the concentration of text knowledge in a single encoding layer. The latter result is exploited in a new editing algorithm that directly adjusts the weights in the localized component, resulting in high efficiency with similar performance.

The paper is generally clear, the topic is very timely and significant, and the experiments are reasonable.

### Strengths
The use of causal mediation analysis is a good idea, and seems to provide a basis for knowledge tracing, but the text should be clearer about how the approach actually uses or follows the CMA paradigm. It is mentioned in the introductory sections but not later on.

The knowledge analysis provides significant insight into multi-modal models, showing they seem to store knowledge differently from language-only models. 

Knowledge localization analysis is used effectively to enable highly efficient control and editing of the image generation process, through direct model parameter adjustment without any model training. This seems to be a unique advantage of this approach that is reminiscent of manipulating eigenvectors to generate a range of plausible face images (pre-deep learning).

It seems that the relative importance of each model component is calculated by corrupting it with gaussian noise; generating an image from the corrupted model; then using CLIP-Score to measure the difference between the image and its caption. A low score indicates incompatibility, and implies that the model component is important relative to the caption. This process is linear in the number of model components being tested, and therefore does not scale well to fine-grained components such as individual neurons.

Diff-QuickFix is a clever way to edit generated images, by directly optimizing the weight matrix of a single layer in the text-encoder rather than standard model updating. It is much faster, and appears to be quite effective based on the provided qualitative results.
The experimental design seems sound, comparing against two recent editing methods on the same prompt dataset they used previously, via the CLIP-score metric. The results show that the method achieves equivalent editing performance to the baselines, with a huge gain in computational efficiency.

### Weaknesses
The intro is unclear about key points, such as what forms of visual knowledge the paper is focused on, because it is unclear what “visual attribute” means in this paper. In computer vison, an attribute is usually a property of an object such as its color, texture, gender (for a person), presence of accessories (eyeglasses, hats, etc.), age, and so on. It seems that visual attribute here means any sort of visual information, which is confusing.

Fig. 2, which is very effective and interesting, shows that there is a large overlap between model components that are causal for the four different attributes. There are a few components (Unet layers) that are unique to different attributes, but most seem to be causal for all attributes, which is problematic. Not only is information distributed widely across the layers for all attributes, but it is largely the same layers that seem to be encoding most information. This is not a weakness of the causal tracing approach per se, but it does call into question the proposed editing method. How effective could it be, when very few model components independently control different attributes?

Fig. 3 seems highly unlikely and may call the approach into question, as the illustrated result strongly implies that only one layer and one token in that layer encodes relevant knowledge. This seems highly unlikely. Is there some way to corroborate this result?

Most of the references lack information on the venues in which the works were published. This is unusual and improper for a research paper, although it should be easy to fix.

3: You are fairly confident in your assessment. It is possible that you did not understand some parts of the submission or that you are unfamiliar with some pieces of related work. Math/other details were not carefully checked.

### Summary
The paper studies the source of knowledge about scenes being generated within the architectures of text-to-image diffusion models. It draws the conclusion that such knowledge is distributed within the conditional UNet. It further introduces an image editing method that provides speedup compared to prior arts.

### Strengths
* The paper adapts Causal Mediation Analysis to interpret text-to-image diffusion models and draw several meaningful conclusions in terms of the location of visual knowledge within these models. 
* The paper proposes an editing method based on the observations as an application that achieves empirical advantages compared to prior methods.

### Weaknesses
 * The main toolbox of the interpretation method, Causal Mediation Analysis, is borrowed from previous works. There is a limited novelty in terms of the interpretation framework. 
* The experiments presented in the paper all use Stable-Diffusion. The results would be more convincing if other classes of diffusion models could be investigated, which would provide important cues on whether the observations are specific to the Stable-Diffusion architecture or can be transferred to other models that adopt diffusion-based training. 
* The causal states are retrieved solely relying on CLIP-Score, but it's possible that such a score is sensitive to only some prominent visual attributes such as colors. The paper claims to identify the knowledge source of general visual attributes but does not provide an investigation on the efficacy of CLIP-Score to discriminate different kinds of visual attributes.

### Questions
* The paper highlights the difference in causal state locations between Stable-Diffusion and GPT. Is such a difference specific to the CLIP encoder or is general to the diffusion model class?

### Summary
This paper explores how knowledge corresponding to distinct visual attributes is stored in large-scale text-to-image diffusion models. The authors apply Causal Mediation Analysis to trace the various attributes in U-Net and text-encoder of diffusion models. In addition, the authors introduces an editing method, DIFF-QUICKFIX to edit the image based on their proposed method. DIFF-QUICKFIX can remove or update concepts in images.

### Strengths
Overview, the paper is well-written and the motivation is clear. Extensive experiments are performed to demonstrate the meanings of exploring how the attribute information is reflected in the embeddings of text-to-image generative models.
Though I'm not an expert in causal mediation analysis, I enjoy reading the paper and be happy with the abundant visualization results in the paper.

### Weaknesses
It would be nice if the authors can include more discussions on the limitations of the DIFF-QUICKFIX parts. *E.g.*, what can DIFF-QUICKFIX do in editing tasks. When I check the **remove** results generated by DIFF-QUICKFIX, such as "Snoppy" in Figure 5, it seems the "Snoppy" is replaced by a dog rather than removed from the figure. From my view, it is more like attribute editing rather than object removal. Is there any potential methods that can leverage DIFF-QUICKFIX to achieve various editing tasks such as remove object, add object rather than simply editing the attributes of existing objects?

In addition, it would be nice if the authors can add some descriptions in Figure captions. *E.g.*, in Figure 6, I'm confused between "photo of a apple in a beach" and "photo of a apple in a city". Are there any clues that can help readers to understand why one figure corresponds to "beach" and the other corresponds to "city"? Maybe add descriptions just like Figure 5 would be helpful.
