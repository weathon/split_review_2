## Abstract
Lipschitz constant estimation plays an important role in understanding generalization, robustness, and fairness in deep learning. Unlike naive bounds based on the network weight norm product, semidefinite programs (SDPs) have shown great promise in providing less conservative Lipschitz bounds with polynomial-time complexity guarantees. However, due to the memory consumption and running speed, standard SDP algorithms cannot scale to modern neural network architectures. In this paper, we transform the SDPs for Lipschitz constant estimation into an eigenvalue optimization problem, which aligns with the modern large-scale optimization paradigms based on first-order methods. This is amenable to autodiff frameworks such as PyTorch and TensorFlow, requiring significantly less memory than standard SDP algorithms. The transformation also allows us to leverage various existing numerical techniques for eigenvalue optimization, opening the way for further memory improvement and computational speedup. The essential technique of our eigenvalue-problem transformation is to introduce redundant quadratic constraints and then utilize both Lagrangian and Shor's SDP relaxations under a certain trace constraint.  Notably, our numerical study successfully scales the SDP-based Lipschitz constant estimation to address large neural networks on ImageNet. Our numerical examples on CIFAR10 and ImageNet demonstrate that our technique is more scalable than existing approaches. Our code is available at https://github.com/z1w/LipDiff.

### Summary
The authors proposed an interesting reformulation (LipDiff) to use SDP to estimate the Lipschitz smoothness of a Neural Network (specifically, LipSDP.) The major observation is that there is a trace bound on the Shor's relaxation on the "Rayleigh quotient" QCQP of the Lipschitz-smoothness problem inspired by [Wang et al., 2022, section 5]. And inspired by [Liao et.al., 2023], the SDP primal problem with an explicit trace bound has an equivalent objective value to a dual optimization problem with only box constraints and a "simple" objective function with linear + $\rho\cdot$positive(eigmax(X)) for large enough penalty $\rho$ that's computable. For such a boxed-contrained optimization problem with maximum eigenvalue in the objective function, the authors apply the Lanczos-inspired optimization method [Dathathri et al., 2022] and try to exploit the sparse structure in LipDiff. In the experiment section, the authors demonstrate the proposed method on "classical" multiple-layer CNN trained on realistic datasets.

### Strengths
The paper is surprisingly correct, given so many omitted parts. The result that the LipSDP can be reformulated as a boxed-constrained minimax eigenvalue problem is surprising and probably has some deeper connections. Further, although the proposed method is "inspired" by many recent papers, there are generally some adaptions/improvements to the original formulation or proofs. For example, the QCQP "Rayleigh quotient" problem considered in  [Wang et al., 2022, section 5] is L-$\infty$-based, but it's L2-based in this work. The proofs in [Liao et al., 2023] require strict feasibility, but the authors generalized it to boxed constraints without requiring strict feasibility. The Lanczos-inspired optimization method in [Dathathri et al., 2022] doesn't exploit sparsity, but the authors try it in the work. Thus, the paper is not just a blind combination of various state-of-the-art methods. Thus, I would recommend an acceptance.

### Weaknesses
First, let me complain that the authors should have included more context in the description and derivations. This makes verification hard, but fortunately, the proofs are short and correct. Other than that, my biggest concern is the equivalence of the formulations in eq (1) and (3), in which the authors "proved in the footnote" by stating "it can be proved". Unfortunately, I didn't find the equivalence in the mentioned literature. In the worst case, eq (3) is an upper bound of eq (1) for the additional constraints (not equivalence), which is still okay due to its computational advantages. Further, the paper didn't do an approximation ratio analysis like [Wang et al., 2022, section 5] and other works. Finally, I am not sure the minimization of linear + positive(maxeig) objective function is easier to solve than the original SDP or the manifold alternatives (E.g., ManOpt.) The proposed formulation minimax in nature so the gradient-based method may be pretty unstable.

### Questions
1. Please explicitly clarify the relationship between the objective values in the different formulations (scaling / square roots).
2. P3 after eq (1): The "last" term, not the 2nd term.
3. Footnote 2: I'm unconvinced about the abovementioned equivalence. Also, please explain why it's $\epsilon/2$-smooth.
4. P5 on adding a trace norm: the rationale is not explained unless the reader goes to [Liao et.al., 2023].
5. P5 on the exact penalty: [Liao et al., 2023] doesn't apply directly to the non-negative constraints, but your proof is correct.
6. P13 in Appendix A: the $\Lambda$s are not defined. Also, why $\xi/2$?

### Summary
The authors tackle the problem of Lipschitz constant estimation of neural networks. Semidefinite programs (SDP) have shown great success for Lipschitz constant estimation, but the memory and time consumption avoid them to scale to modern neural network architectures. By transforming the problem into an eigenvalue problem, the proposed method is more memory efficient than the existing methods for solving SDP, and performs much better than simple matrix production norm bound.

### Strengths
1. The proposed method seems reasonable and promising.
2. The reduction into the eigenvalue problem is very useful and makes the proposed method practical and provides potential for further optimization.

### Weaknesses
1. While I can get that transforming into an eigenvalue problem would be beneficial (as there are many past developments in solving such problems), it is still kind of vague why and to what extent the proposed method is more memory efficient. Specifically, the paper lacks a detailed analysis of the memory footprint of the proposed eigenvalue-based approach compared to the semidefinite programming (SDP) methods it aims to improve upon. The reduction to an eigenvalue problem is presented as a memory-saving technique, but the exact mechanisms and the magnitude of this reduction are not clearly explained. For example, it is unclear how the memory requirements scale with the size of the neural network, specifically the number of parameters and layers, for both the proposed method and the SDP approach. A more rigorous comparison, perhaps including a theoretical analysis of memory complexity, would be beneficial.



### Questions
1. Could the authors list the time and memory of each method, so it is clearer for comparison?
2. Is it possible to provide some kind of lower bound to show how good the proposed method is? LipSDP serves as a comparison target, but is only viable in one of the compared architectures. Showing that the proposed method is competitive with LipSDP on more architectures can make the paper more convincing.

### Summary
The authors consider the classical Shor semidefinite programming (SDP) relaxation of the Lipschitz constant of neural networks. 
They formulate this SDP program as a non-smooth eigenvalue problem with an exact penalty (EP) parameter. The resulting formulation is called EP-LipSDP. 
The exact penalty parameter is obtained by means of proper redundant quadratic constraints. 

Then they provide different numerical algorithms to handle this eigenvalue optimization, including eigenvector approximation via Lancsoz' method, sparse matrix multiplication, and analytical initialization. These different algorithms allow one to tune the running time and convergence of the optimization process.

The resulting algorithm, called LipDiff is compared to standard techniques on three neural network benchmarks: MNIST DNN, MNIST CNN and CIFAR10 CNN.

### Strengths
The authors can obtain a non-trivial Lipschitz constant estimate on the CIFAR10 CNN.
Thanks to the different numerical techniques, the resulting algorithm can be tuned for adaptation to allocated computational resources, in particular memory.

### Weaknesses
1. The initial problem of Lipschitz constant computation can actually be formulated as a polynomial optimization problem. The authors have almost completely forgotten to mention related papers based on techniques from this field (at the exception of the one by Latorre et al.), in particular the following ones:

- Chen et al. Semialgebraic optimization for Lipschitz constants of ReLU networks
- Chen et al. Semialgebraic representation of monotone deep equilibrium models and applications to certification
- Mai et al. Exploiting constant trace property in large-scale polynomial optimization

The latter paper relies on the constant (rather than bounded) trace property, and a proper comparison would be valuable. 


2. The LipDiff algorithm might not be very accurate in general. From the comparison on the basic benchmark MNIST DNN, one notices that LipSDP obtains a better bound. It would be interesting to see how LipSDP behaves on, e.g., MNIST CNN by using LipSDP with Mosek on a scalable computing platform with more RAM. 
First order methods are usually much faster than second-order solvers (in particular interior-point methods) but they are also much less accurate in general. The trade-off between accuracy and efficiency should be more explicitly investigated. 
It would be also interesting to see what kind of results first-order SDP solvers like COSMO would yield.

### Summary
Papers concerns a new SDP method to approximate the Lipschitz constant of neural networks, with the main benefit being its scalability due to the reduction of explicit constraints as penalizations. The proposed methods is itself useful, however the paper did not convince me of its technical innovation. It just seems to me that the authors simply took the methods from (Liao et al., 2023) and applied it to the LipSDP method to ensure that they have the same optimal solution.

### Strengths
The proposed technique itself is nice, and may be beneficial in many aspects. The numerical experiments are also convincing, demonstrating its usability. The presentation is clear and easy to follow.

### Weaknesses
1. The theoretical innovation is relatively weak, because anyone can apply different techniques in the convex programming space and use it on LipSDP to claim as a new idea. I didn't see any specific analysis and/or new technique proposed specifically for the Lipschitz problem of NN.  Maybe I am overlooking some details, and if so please point me to these places.


2. The authors only showed that their new formulation has the same optimal value as the old LipSDP problem. However since LipSDP is a relaxation, there are no guarantees of its accuracy. The authors introduced redundant constraints in this paper, and this kind of technique is usually used to tighten relaxation gap in classic literature, so I hope the authors could also touch upon the tightness of relaxation, especially by tuning the parameter $\rho$, as I believe this is possible to analyze.

Typos
- On page 3, it seems like when you say "second term of the left hand, etc" you meant the third term, and you grouped the first two terms together implicitly. Also please explain how your third term ties to the relu function (experts may understand, but since you're explaining here please be more precise).

### Questions
Not questions, but I encourage the authors to check a major line of work concerning the SDP verification of robustness of neural networks. That problem and your Lipschitz problem are very similar from a technical standpoint, and there are already a number of different branches in that space. For example brand-and-bound methods, non-convex cut, chordal decomposition (as you have mentioned), and theoretical analysis of relaxation quality. By exploring that problem I think you can benefit the Lipschitz problem as well.
