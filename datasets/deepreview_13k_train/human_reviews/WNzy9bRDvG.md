- Decision: Accept
- Scores: 6, 6, 8, 8

## Abstract
Consistency models are a nascent family of generative models that can sample high quality data in one step without the need for adversarial training. Current consistency models achieve optimal sample quality by distilling from pre-trained diffusion models and employing learned metrics such as LPIPS. However, distillation limits the quality of consistency models to that of the pre-trained diffusion model, and LPIPS causes undesirable bias in evaluation. To tackle these challenges, we present improved techniques for \emph{consistency training}, where consistency models learn directly from data without distillation. We delve into the theory behind consistency training and identify a previously overlooked flaw, which we address by eliminating Exponential Moving Average from the teacher consistency model. To replace learned metrics like LPIPS, we adopt Pseudo-Huber losses from robust statistics. Additionally, we introduce a lognormal noise schedule for the consistency training objective, and propose to double total discretization steps every set number of training iterations. Combined with better hyperparameter tuning, these modifications enable consistency models to achieve FID scores of 2.51 and 3.25 on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet $64\times 64$ respectively in a single sampling step. These scores mark a 3.5$\times$ and 4$\times$ improvement compared to prior consistency training approaches. Through two-step sampling, we further reduce FID scores to 2.24 and 2.77 on these two datasets, surpassing those obtained via distillation in both one-step and two-step settings, while narrowing the gap between consistency models and other state-of-the-art generative models.

### Summary
This paper presents improved techniques for training consistency models, which include 1) adopting better weighting function, noise embeddings, and dropout 2) eliminating Exponential Moving Average from the teacher model; 3) utilizing Pseudo-Huber loss instead of $l_2$ metric and learned metrics like LPIPS; 4) introducing a new noise schedule and proposing a new curriculum for discretization steps. These modifications enable much better consistency model training.

### Strengths
This paper is really well-written and easy to follow. Each component of the design space is carefully explained and well-presented. Most of the choices are accompanied by intuitive demonstrations, which provide insights that could translate to other methods. Most importantly, the empirical results are competitive against the SOTA methods, establishing consistency models as an attractive family of generative models.

### Weaknesses
If I remember correctly, in the original consistency model, the teacher set to have EMA is more of an empirical decision. Using the same network as the student (with STOPGRAD operation) is definitely reasonable and even more intuitive (we want the model to be consistent with itself). Thus, I am not against dropping the EMA component, if it means better empirical performances.

However, I do not feel the theoretical analysis presented in Sec.3.2 is justified. Note since I believe the main contribution of the paper is an empirical one, my complaint here does not change my assessment of the paper significantly. Still, I would appreciate it if the authors could clarify my concerns here.

1. I think Eq.6 applies no matter the relation between $\theta$ and $\theta^-$, no?
2. In Eq.7, why are we looking at the gradient scaled by $1/\Delta\sigma$? If we look at just the pure gradient, it should be 0 if $\theta=\theta^-$, and some finite value associated with their difference if not, and furthermore, the difference between $\theta$ and $\xi$ disappears. It may look like the loss function has nothing to do with learning the correct parameter $\xi$ like the authors suggest in the second last paragraph in Sec.3.2. However, to me, this is not a surprise and totally expected. The self-consistency loss itself does not really force the network to learn anything correctly, i.e. the model could just predict a constant no matter the input and still be considered consistent with itself. In my understanding, it is really the boundary condition enforced through parameterizations that makes the model work, which is not a fact used in this toy example.
3. In the current version, I am curious as to what the authors have in mind about "if the consistency loss either does not exist or is unsuitable". This notion does not seem to be explained well.

### Questions
1. Do the authors have any insight as to why the Pseudo-Huber loss could bring this much improvement? I do not recall it utilized in any popular diffusion models. Could it be that consistency models, because of their unique features and training dynamics, benefit more from "bounded" gradients for all $t$?
2. Do the authors have insights on why insensitive time embeddings are helpful or in this case crucial? There are similar design choices made in EDM: $1/4\log(\sigma)$ has a rather small range between $\sigma_{\textrm{min}}$ and $\sigma_{\textrm{max}}$.
3. When examining the effects of different time embedding choices, positional embedding is mentioned. Given Fig.1 on the average $l_1$ distance, I assume the authors directly feed in $\sigma$, rather than EDM's $1/4\log(\sigma)$? I think this needs to be clarified.
4. In the paper, there are no explicit definitions of $s_0$ and $s_1$, which denote the start and end discretization steps.
5. In Sec.3.2, third paragraph, the ground truth consistency function should have $\xi$ rather than $\mu$.

### Summary
"The paper introduces a comprehensive set of techniques aimed at enhancing the efficacy of consistency training within few-shot diffusion models for image generation. The contributions are prioritized as follows:

1. The elimination of the Exponential Moving Average (EMA) from the student model, a change supported by both theoretical arguments and empirical evidence, results in markedly improved consistency training performance.

2. An improved framework that incorporates weighted timestep selection (inspired by EDM), time-step adaptive loss weighting, and the pseudo-Huber loss function to refine the training process.

3. A refined schedule for discretization steps involved in computing the consistency loss, accompanied by a new heuristics curriculum that adjusts these steps throughout the training phases.

4. Additional modifications to the network, such as the integration of dropout strategies and better time embeddings, to enhance model robustness and adaptability.

Collectively, these advancements makes the consistency training model highly competitive, achieving performance on par with leading generative models on benchmarks like CIFAR-10 and ImageNet.

### Strengths
S1: this model positions consistency models as competitive generative models. When the first consistency model was introduced, its performance was somewhat mediocre, especially on large datasets like ImageNet. The set of improvements proposed in this paper has made consistency training competitive, and it may become a leading approach in the future due to desirable properties such as stable training and accurate approximation of the probability flow ODE.

S2: the technical contribution is robust. The theoretical analysis supporting the removal of the EMA is well-justified and is corroborated by experimental results.

S3: Various other enhancements have also proven useful and are validated experimentally.

S4: the paper is well-written and easy to follow

### Weaknesses
W1: The choice to use the pseudo-Huber loss is not entirely convincing, as its effectiveness appears sensitive to the chosen constant value, and it offers negligible improvements over the tuning-free LPIPS loss, which is known for its alignment with human perception and computational efficiency, especially in pixel-space models. The sensitivity of the pseudo-Huber loss to its delta parameter requires careful tuning, and the paper does not provide sufficient justification for the specific value used. Furthermore, while the authors claim that LPIPS might introduce bias due to its training on ImageNet, this concern is somewhat overstated, as the feature extraction networks used in LPIPS are significantly smaller than the generative models being evaluated, thus the potential for feature leakage is minimal. The computational overhead of LPIPS is also not a major concern in pixel space models, as the feature extraction is relatively fast compared to the diffusion process itself.

W2: Apart from the significant change of removing EMA, the other enhancements resemble engineering optimizations rather than foundational advances. Their relevance to broader applications is questionable, especially since the empirical evaluation is limited to smaller datasets like CIFAR-10 and ImageNet-64x64. Expanding experiments to include higher-resolution images on ImageNet or more varied datasets such as COCO or LAION could substantiate the model's versatility. The improvements, such as weighted timestep selection and time-step adaptive loss weighting, while beneficial, lack a strong theoretical grounding and appear to be more heuristic in nature. The lack of experiments on more complex datasets makes it difficult to assess the generalizability of these optimizations.

W3: The training speed for the consistency model is comparatively slow, especially when compared with models like GANs. It would be insightful if the authors could address this aspect and discuss its implications for scaling to larger datasets. While consistency models offer advantages in terms of training stability, their convergence speed is still a significant bottleneck, particularly when compared to GANs, which can often achieve comparable results with fewer training iterations. This discrepancy in training speed needs to be addressed to make consistency models more practical for large-scale applications.

W4: The applicability of consistency training appears confined to training unguided models, which significantly underperform in applications such as text-to-image generation.

### Questions
I have several questions for the authors that could enrich the broader community’s understanding:

Q1: Does the current consistency training outperform consistency distillation when applying the enhancements presented in this paper to the latter?

Q2: Given the apparent benefits of scaling up the network architecture for larger datasets (e.g., ImageNet as shown in Table 3), is there a risk that one(few)-step methods will be inherently limited by network capacity? In other words, can these methods directly approximate the ODE solution with a network of the same capacity as the original diffusion model, or would alternative approaches like RectFlow [1] provide a more viable solution?

### Summary
In this work, the authors enhanced the training of consistency model, initially introduced by Song et al. [1], by implementing improved weighting functions, a refined discretization curriculum, eliminating Exponential Moving Average (EMA), introducing a new loss function, and improving the noise schedule. These advancements enable the model to achieve state-of-the-art results in both one and two-step generation processes without relying on pre-trained diffusion models or learned metrics. Overall, the paper is well-written and organized, and the improving techniques are supported by convincing discussions.

### Strengths
1. The paper presents compelling discussions on improved training schemes, which notably facilitate the development of a consistency model. This model impressively achieves state-of-the-art results in both one and two-step generation processes, uniquely independent of pre-trained diffusion models or learned metrics.

2. The empirical results on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet 64×64 datasets affirm the efficacy of these enhanced training methodologies.

3. The research sets a new benchmark, providing a robust and successful framework for training consistency models. This paradigm holds potential for broader application in various one or two-step generalization models.

### Weaknesses
1. This paper functions primarily as a technical exploration, compiling successful practices in training diffusion models. While it includes numerous ablation studies, it lacks sufficient theoretical backing to fully support these practices.

2. The paper’s improved training schemes do allow the consistency model to avoid relying on a pre-trained diffusion model. However, its theoretical basis still seems anchored in diffusion model principles. It would be beneficial if the authors explored the broader potential of the consistency training scheme. Specifically, whether this training would be effective when the generation process is not the reverse of a diffusion process but a more general corruption process, such as those described in [1] and [2].

### Questions
Could the author elaborate more on why higher discretization steps can reduce bias but increase variance?

### Summary
Recently, consistency models were proposed. They can be used to either distill diffusion models into single- or few-step samplers (consistency distillation), or they also enable direct training of single- or few-step consistency models (consistency training). Previous work showed strong results primarily for the distillation setting. In this work the authors focus on the consistency training setting and propose multiple techniques to improve the performance of consistency training. For instance, the paper avoids the questionable use of LPIPS-based consistency matching, and employs a more general Huber loss. The authors also remove the exponential moving average and point out errors in previous theoretical analyses. Moreover, a new loss weighting function is proposed, the noise level embeddings are carefully analyzed and improved, the use of dropout is studied, and the discretization step curriculum is improved. The paper thoroughly ablates and analyzes all improvements and then evaluates the model on popular benchmarks, CIFAR10 and ImageNet64. It achieves very strong performance, significantly outperforming both previous consistency models and diffusion model distillation methods. The improved consistency models perform almost as good as state-of-the-art diffusion models and GANs, while being trained directly and only requiring a single or two synthesis steps.

### Strengths
The paper has several strengths:
- The paper is well-written and easy to follow (good **clarity**).
- The paper does not present a fundamentally new method (moderate **novelty**). However, it does significantly improve consistency models, a very novel and very promising class of generative models that enables single- or few-step sampling, in contrast to, for instance, diffusion models. I expect the insights provided by the paper to be used in follow-up work and I think that consistency models will find wide usage, too. This makes this work very **significant**
- The paper presents thorough ablations and analyses of the proposed tricks and innovations. It is generally of high **quality**.
- The final experimental results obtained when combining all modifications are very strong, and thoroughly compared to many and appropriate baselines.

### Weaknesses
I think the paper has no major weaknesses. However, there would be opportunities to further improve the work:
- I am wondering how scalable consistency models are with the proposed modifications. Can one train, for instance, text-to-image consistency models? Or how about training on higher-resolution images?
- The new consistency models do not require LPIPS losses anymore and are thereby more general in that they are not limited to image synthesis anymore. It would be interesting to validate that consistency models can also be successfully trained on non-image data (e.g. audio, graphs, 3D, video, etc).


### Questions
I only have some minor questions:
- When the paper defines the ground truth consistency function in Section 3.2, is there a typo in the ground truth consistency function? Should it be $\xi$ instead of $\mu$ in the ground truth consistency function $f^{*}$ for the single data point data distribution?
- What are $s_0$ and $s_1$ in Section 3.4? They are not properly explained when first introduced above Eq. (9).
- Also in Section 3.4, the authors use an exponential discretization curriculum, which leads to the visualization in Fig. 3(a). Why is this exponential curriculum not included in the visualizations and ablations in Figs. 3(b) and 3(c)?
