# TRAM: Bridging Trust Regions and Sharpness Aware Minimization

- Decision: Accept
- Scores: 8, 8, 6, 5

## Abstract
Sharpness-aware minimization (SAM) reports improving domain generalization by
reducing the loss surface curvature in the parameter space. However,
generalization during \textit{fine-tuning} is often more dependent on the
transferability of \textit{representations} in the function space. Trust-region
methods (TR) target this goal by regularizing representation curvature to reduce
catastrophic forgetting of pre-trained task-agnostic information while adopting
task-specific skills. We consider unifying these strategies for low curvature in
both parameter space and function space to improve out-of-domain (OOD)
generalization. We propose \textbf{Trust Region Aware Minimization} (TRAM), a
SAM algorithm fine-tuning for low parameter sharpness and smooth, informative
representations preserving pre-trained structure. TRAM uses a trust region bound
to inform the SAM adversarial neighborhood, introducing an awareness of function
curvature within optimization for flatter minima. We empirically validate TRAM
in vision (cross-dataset adaptation) and text (OOD language modeling, zero-shot
cross-lingual transfer) tasks where robust domain transfer and representation
generality are critical. TRAM outperforms SAM- and TR-based optimization across
all tasks, notably surpassing competing methods for hard transfer between
\textit{anticorrelated} domains. TRAM establishes a novel standard in
fine-tuning for domain-generalizable models with minimal additional computation
over previous sharpness-aware methods.

### Summary
This paper develops a new SAM-style optimizer for better representation learning (especially for language modeling).
The key idea is simple-to-state (although the proposed algorithms are a bit more complicated than the original SAM).
The authors attempt to combine the best of both worlds between SAM and Trust-region:
1. SAM encourages the solution to be "flat" in the parameter space (assuming that the flat minima is desired)
2. Trust-region methods encourages the representation to be "smooth" or to stay close to the good "pre-trained" model initialization.
In particular, with the Trust-region feature, the authors claim that the proposed method has the benefit of not forgetting task-agnostic representations from pre-trained model and also learning "smooth" representation which is good for the transferability of representations.

Also, building on more advanced SAM algorithms like ASAM and FSAM, the authors develop other variants of TRAM which are used for the experiments and show better performance than the previous approaches.

### Strengths
- The paper did a good job summarizing the existing approaches and how the proposed method builds on top of them.
- The experimental settings are detailed, and reasonable.
- Experiments seem quite comprehensive at least for the settings considered in this work.
- It's quite remarkable that the proposed methods achieve best performance across different fine-tuning tasks.

### Weaknesses
 - As far as I understood, the original SAM paper became popular because of its extensive experiments over standard benchmark datasets. In particular, I remember SAM achieving state-of-the art for various vision tasks (CIFAR, ImageNet etc...). Given that the effectiveness of SAM was first demonstrated on these benchmark tasks, **for future research I think it is required for follow-up works to sanity check the performance of the proposed methods on the same setting as the original SAM paper**. In particular, if the new methods end up giving a worse performance than SAM for the settings considered in the SAM paper, that would be an important information for practitioners.
(As I mentioned in the strength part, the authors' quite comprehensive experiments on the language modeling tasks of choice look great; however, since this work follows up on the original SAM paper, **some experiments that benchmark the new method against the original SAM on the task that SAM did great seems required**.)

- Also, it's great that the authors built their default algorithm on ASAM. But, given that SAM has been quite popular, as a reader, I'm quite curious how the SAM version of TRAM (instead of ASAM) performs. In particular, **is ASAM type of updates really necessary?**

- Given that the main motivation of this work is to develop an optimizer for learning good-representation, I think at least one experiment is needed for pre-training from scratch. In particular, do you think having a reasonable pre-trained model is necessary for TRAM to work well? As far as I know, it's still debated in the literature **whether SAM-type of updates are required in the beginning of the training or at the end of the training**. Some theoretical works have claimed that it's only effective at the end of the training (**as did in this work**), but empirical works also have claimed that it's required from the beginning of the training.

- In Figure 1, could you clarify what the negative and positive slopes are supposed to be interpreted as? Also I can't really understand how to interpret this plot.

- In Table 5, why didn't you present the statistics for the other two variants of TRAM?

I acknowledge the novelty of this work. However, given the extensive experiments in the previous works (e.g. original SAM work), in order to make a case about the effectiveness of the proposed methods, **I think some more "sanity-check" experiments are needed. Especially, because this work is empirical in nature.** I'm voting for weak accept at the moment, but I'll make the final decision based on how the authors address my questions.

### Confidence
3: You are fairly confident in your assessment. It is possible that you did not understand some parts of the submission or that you are unfamiliar with some pieces of related work. Math/other details were not carefully checked.

### Summary
This paper proposes a new optimization algorithm called TRAM that combines sharpness-aware minimization (SAM) with trust region regularization. SAM methods like ASAM optimize for low sharpness (flat minima) in parameter space. Trust region methods constrain optimization to a local neighborhood in representation space. TRAM unifies these approaches by bounding the SAM perturbation region using the trust region distance. This encourages flat minima while retaining representation smoothness.

### Strengths
1. The proposed method is intuitive and well-motivated. The combination of SAM and Trust region methods is reasonable and interesting.
2. Extensive experiments on multiple NLP tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

### Weaknesses
1. Theoretical motivation for unifying SAM and Trust region methods is not provided. 
2. Some results have high variance across runs. More runs may better characterize the performance.

### Questions
1. How well does TRAM transfer to other modalities like images?
2. There are several hyper-parameters of the proposed method. How to select them for out-of-distribution generalization?

### Summary
In this paper, the authors aim to propose a SAM variant to contribute to the training in the area of model fine-tuning, where they propose the Trust Region Aware Minimization. In the method, specific distance measures in TRR are employed as the neighbourhood radius in SAM rather than the manually-set pre-defined radius. The authors claim that the proposed method can optimizer for informative representations without forgetting pre-trained structure. And the authors investigate the perplex on M2D2 Corpus with GPT2 to show the effectiveness of the proposed method.

### Strengths
**Strengths**

1. The paper is clearly written and easy to follow.
2. I think the paper aims to contribute to SAM from a very interesting perspective, i.e. fine-tuning techniques. Considering that fine-tuning has become a nearly necessary procedure in NLP tasks, the paper may provide some promising instructions further.
3. Combine the proposed method with Fisher-SAM can reduce extra forward-propagation count when implementing to the same count as in vanilla SAM.

### Weaknesses
 **Weakness**

1. The core of this proposed method is to adaptively change the neighbourhood radius in SAM (or ASAM) based on certain distance measure. This somehow does not follow the idea of Trust Region Regularization which adds additional constraint on top of the loss according to the measure. More accurately, they are two different things. And, I could not find a clear meaning why using such a distance as the neighbourhood radius could give the "Trust". Several questions arise: what does the "trust" indicate in the proposed method? Why we should not trust the region that is not in the proposed method but in SAM (and ASAM, Fisher-SAM)? Why the given region would not harm the pre-trained models while SAM could? Clear answers are missing in the current paper. Also, it is highly recommended that the authors use figures to illustrate this and the core of the presented method.

2. The Stochastic Weight Averaging (SWA) could also lead to a similar effect as TTR methods. The authors may need to also consider or compare SWA with the TRR and the proposed method. The following papers may be helpful.

    [2] Wortsman, Mitchell, et al. "Model soups: averaging weights of multiple fine-tuned models improves accuracy without increasing inference time." International Conference on Machine Learning. PMLR, 2022.

3. From the paper, I see nearly no discussions regarding why and how the proposed method could contribute the fine-tuning in the related section, given that the authors claim "their method could not forget the pre-trained structure". BTW, I think their abstract may be somewhat over-claimed. It is interesting to see that the authors are aiming to study the effect of SAM specifically in fine-tuning. But unfortunately, the current version could not present sufficient helpful insights.

4. It would be more impactful that the the authors present results using the proposed method on some recent popular scalable pre-trained llm such as llama.


5. It is highly recommended that the authors release their code.

### Summary
This paper considered adopted trust regions and sharpness aware minimization. Specifically, the gradient update is based on two key steps. Equation (4) illustrates the update rule by KL divergence fine-tuning. Equation (5) illustrates the update of the input by adding a gaussian random variable. Then the model is further validated in GPT2 on different dataset benchmarks.

****Post-Rebuttal****

I would appreciate the hard work and additional experiments by authors. I increased the soundness score. 
However, I still feel very confused about several core arguments and positioning within the paper. 

- If this paper is a pure empirical paper, this paper should be revised in a major form to highlight the practical contribution rather than new algorithmic contribution in **optimization**. I do not think the contribution is significant in the context of optimization theory. 
- If current paper aims to tackle an optimization problem, I do not think the entire analysis is rigorous from a theoretical perspective. I read the related works by authors and I still could not understand why this kind of optimization could have better transferability. Please take note the mentioned theoretical papers did not discuss this point, but rather on the generalization property. (They are different concepts in theory. One is IID and another is OOD). Based on the unclear fundamental points, I could not increase my score, despite numerous additional experiments.

### Strengths
- This paper considered an improved method in TRPO. Through smoothly updating the gradient, this method seems to transfer the information.
- Empirical validation in the foundation model and large scale NLP dataset are done.

### Weaknesses
 - I could not understand *Why* such as transfer could encourage a better transfer. When it does not work? I would like to see a *rigor* mathematical analysis. The sharpness aware minimization could achieve better generalization. How is this mathematically to ensure a better transfer?
I noticed the experiments illustrated 
> domain transfer in fine-tuned models by better leveraging the pre-trained structure from unseen domains within the smoother minima idealized by SAM-style training. 

However, without clear analysis. This reviewer feels quite difficult to understand why SAM could achieve this objective. Does this approach only work for the selected dataset? **When it fails?** 

- I would like to see a computational/memory complexity analysis. How it compares with other methods.

- This paper proposes a general machine learning method while it is only validated in the NLP dataset. Unless the author clearly revised the title and contributions, I would like to see the results in other modalities such as image. 

- Equation (3) is not clearly defined. What does it mean by d_{\theta, x}? It is not a rigorous expression.
- Eq(4), Eq(5) why forward KL divergence is considered? Why not reverse KL divergence? Or Other general forms such as Renyi divergence?
- In eq(5), how important is the noise variable? Does the variance of the noise matter?
- Eq(12) may not be effective to correctly estimate the similarity in high dimensional regime. I think there is a complexity issue here (this is not a sample efficient estimator). I could think this value does not make sufficient sense to me in a high-dimensional case.
- Table 4 Why only accuracy is considered a metric? Is this dataset balanced?

### Questions
I noticed the primary domain is about optimization.  While there are so many missing points in terms of rigorous analysis in the optimization. If this paper is an applied NLP paper, the paper should be revised in a major form.
