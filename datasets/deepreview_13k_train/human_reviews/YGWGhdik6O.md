# Neural Optimizer Equation, Decay Function, and Learning Rate Schedule Joint Evolution

- Decision: Reject
- Scores: 3, 3, 3, 3

## Abstract
A major contributor to the quality of a deep learning model is the selection of the optimizer. We propose a new dual-joint search space in the realm of neural optimizer search (NOS), along with an integrity check, to automate the process of finding deep learning optimizers. Our dual-joint search space simultaneously allows for the optimization of not only the update equation, but also internal decay functions and learning rate schedules for optimizers. We search the space using our proposed mutation-only, particle-based genetic algorithm able to be massively parallelized for our domain-specific problem. We evaluate our candidate optimizers on the CIFAR-10 dataset using a small ConvNet. To assess generalization, the final optimizers were then transferred to large-scale image classification on CIFAR-100 and TinyImageNet, while also being fine-tuned on Flowers102, Cars196, and Caltech101 using EfficientNetV2Small. We found multiple optimizers, learning rate schedules, and Adam variants that outperformed Adam, as well as other standard deep learning optimizers, across the image classification tasks.

### Summary
The authors investigate hyperparameter tuning in machine learning models. I think while the topic is a well-explored area, the continuous evolution of models and the increasing complexity of tasks mean that there's space for innovative approaches. The paper proposes the use of Neural Optimizer Search (NOS) in this task. The experiments ranked ten final optimizers, categorized into three main families. I do like the transferability experiments, where the algorithms are tested across various image classification tasks. The performance varies between models trained from scratch and fine-tuning scenarios, with some optimizers showing particularly strong results in one or the other. But as in many other papers in this context, I think the why the algorithms behave like that is not entirely clear.

### Strengths
I do think the authors presented an interesting approach by expanding the search space for optimizer algorithms and introducing a novel particle-based GA method. 
The authors also designed a comprehensive and extensive set of experiments, but I think increased the ablation study to help evaluate the contributions of individual components in the proposed investigation.
The paper is well-organized, I liked the approach of breaking down the problem, its causes, the solution, and the experimental validation in a logical sequence.

### Weaknesses
Besides a large number of experiments, I think the main experiments are centered on or in variations of specific datasets like TinyImageNet and CIFAR-10.

One relevant weakness of the paper is that a relevant quantity of experiments were not completed at the time of the paper's writing, as denoted by asterisks in Table 6. The lack of results leaves a gap in the comprehensive evaluation of the results and makes it hard to evaluate the global performance of the proposed approach. 

The authors focused experiments on image classification and language modeling tasks but argued that the results could be extended to other tasks.

I was waiting for a more in-depth analysis of the results, considering the whys, the sensitivity analysis, tendencies, etc. The paper shows the phenomena exist but does not explain them in detail. I know this is common in papers in this field, but we need to improve that. It has an interesting empirical contribution but lacks theoretical support for why certain optimizers perform better than others.

The fine-tuning results appear to be inconsistent with the from-scratch training results.

I do believe the authors benefit from a discussion on scenarios where the proposed method might not work well. This gives readers a more balanced view and sets expectations correctly. I suggest the authors explore more of that.

The paper identifies families of optimizers, but it doesn't explore the unique characteristics of each family and how they contribute to the model's performance.

### Questions
The paper focuses on EfficientNet and ResNet, what about the performance in different architectures such as transformers or RNNs?

Given the stochastic nature of genetic algorithms, how consistent are the results across different runs of the optimizer discovery process?

Can the authors provide details on the computational resources required for the optimizer discovery process?

How do the optimizers perform under adverse training conditions, such as noisy gradients, sparse gradients, or data with high-class imbalance?

I noted seven of the final ten optimizers contain decay functions, what is the specific contribution of these decay functions to the overall performance?

### Summary
The paper claims simultaneous optimization of the weight update equation, decay functions, and adaptation of the learning rate schedule. Certain operands are tested on standard data sets and a particle GA method for simultaneous optimization is proposed.

### Strengths
The simultaneous optimization approach is interesting.

### Weaknesses
The approach lacks clarity.
It doesn't provide an theoretical guarantees of convergence neither does it talk about algorithmic complexity. The paper lacks theoretical soundness.

### Questions
For example, how does the learning rate adapt? With the Particle-GA?
Not sure why the LRs are bumpy

### Summary
This paper proposed to evolve an optimizer for neural networks. The researched problem is necessary, while the technical contributions are limited. In addition, the experiments should be conducted on SOTA neural network models for verification.

### Strengths
Designig suitable optimizers for specific problems is necessary, while this work is just for this aspect.

### Weaknesses
There are many types of genetic algorithms in the literature, while the proposed genetic algorithm in this paper is made based on the claim that the genetic algorithm used in Real et al.'s work is not suitable for the work in this paper. In fact, many very similar evolutionary algorithms can achieve the same goals (mutation only, aging, parallelism) as the designed genetic algorithm in this paper.

This paper looks like a project implementation, instead of a research paper. To achieve the goal claimed in this paper, the authors prepare a lot of different components for the project's implementation.

The convenient way to verify if the proposed method works for the current fact is to search an optimizer on some SOTA neural networks, and then to check if the performance of the compared SOTA can be improved.

The format of references should be updated, the current form of submission is hard to read.

### Summary
This paper focuses on the automated discovery of optimization algorithms. In particular, it proposes an enlarged optimizer search space constructed using tree-based grammar using building blocks of both update equations as well as decay functions (functions of the optimization step number). To search over this space, the authors employ a mutation-only genetic algorithm that evolves optimizers by mutating and selecting the best optimizer according to its generalization performance on the Cifar-10 dataset. The authors also propose a sanity check to eliminate degenerate optimizers by first checking its performance when training on a quadratic task to save compute. The discovered optimizers are shown to outperform or match existing hand-designed optimizers on training/fine-tuning EffNetV2Small on multiple vision datasets.

### Strengths
- Automated discovery of optimization algorithms is an important topic.
- The paper provides a thorough documentation of its algorithm procedure.
- The proposed sanity check of first evaluating the optimizer on a quadratic task is reasonable and can potentially save compute.

### Weaknesses
1. __Significance in the Contribution__. To my understanding, the two types of contributions the authors can make in this paper are: __1)__ proposing a new set of algorithm procedures (including new search space, search algorithm, integrity check) to find better optimizers; __2)__ the actual optimizers found and any insights obtained from analyzing them.
    
    In terms of __1)__, despite the authors doing a generally good job of documenting their procedures for reproducibility, the actual procedures are very specialized to the ConvNet model architecture (with multiple rounds of different types of heuristics to filter the search candidates) and might still be difficult to replicate and also generalize to a new task, architecture combination. The use of a proxy task on a small ConvNet architecture is a common practice, but the authors' progressive upscaling method and the memory limitations they cite, while understandable, further specialize the procedure, making it less general. The multiple rounds of heuristic filtering, while potentially effective for this specific case, also lack clear justification from a theoretical perspective, making it unclear if the discovered optimizers are a result of the search space or the specific filtering procedure.  
    
    In terms of __2)__, it’s not clear to me how much better the discovered optimizers are compared to existing hand-designed optimizers like Adam. All of the results in Table 6 are evaluated using a single model architecture EffNetV2Small after performing some final optimizer candidate selection directly over this model architecture. Therefore, it’s unclear to what degree these optimizers can general to other models. Besides, focusing on EffNetV2Small, over the non-cifar tasks (tasks not used in the optimizer selection), there always exist hand-designed optimizers that are close if not better than the discovered ones. Finally, in terms of interpreting the analytical form of the discovered optimizers, the paragraph at the end of page 8 and beginning of page 9 are more of surface-level descriptions of the experimental results rather than a distilled summary and insights, making it difficult to parse the key message the authors wish to convey.
    
2. **Evaluating the importance of enlarging the search space**. As one of the claimed contributions of the paper is an enlarged optimizer search with more operands, operators, and decay functions, it is expected that the authors should perform an ablation study to understand the benefit of the introduced enlarged search space. The bare-minimum ablation baseline is to train on the datasets in Table 6 using several of the optimizers discovered by Bello et al (2017) and compare whether the performances of the optimizers discovered in this paper are better than those discovered in a smaller search space.

3. **Incomplete results**. Part of the results in Table 6 are unfinished as the authors claim to finish before the rebuttal period.

### Questions
- In Bello et al (2017), in addition to tables comparing optimizers’ performance, learning curves of optimizers’ generalization performance progression are also shown. For some of the cases, it helps reader to see that Bello et al's discovered optimizers can converge faster than hand-designed methods for cases where the final performances might be similar. I suggest the authors also consider showing such graphs to provide additional information of the discovered optimizers.
- The authors should formally define what a decay function is. I personally found it hard to understand the terminology until I read its definition in Bello et al (2017).
- The authors mention that the mutation operator in the paper selects the best mutated child as the next position for the particle. It’s not clear to me whether this best child is compared against its parent. Can the authors clarify if this is done? (If so, then the selection should guarantee monotonic performance improvement.)
- On page 4, the authors use the term “non-distributive function”. However, I wonder if the authors mean to say non-homogeneous function.
