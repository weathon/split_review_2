- Decision: Accept
- Scores: 6, 6, 8, 6

## Abstract
Foundational models with billions of parameters %and 
which have been trained on large corpora of data have demonstrated non-trivial skills in a variety of domains.
However, due to their monolithic structure, it is challenging and expensive to augment them or impart new skills.
On the other hand, due to their adaptation abilities, several new instances of these models are being trained towards new domains and tasks.
In this work, we study the problem of efficient and practical composition of existing foundation models with more specific models to enable newer capabilities.
To this end, we propose \name{}---\fullName{}---which introduces
cross-attention between models to compose their representations and enable new capabilities.
Salient features of \name\ are: (i) Scales up LLMs on new tasks by `re-using' existing LLMs along with a few  additional parameters and data,
(ii) Existing model weights are kept intact, and hence preserves existing capabilities, and (iii) Applies to diverse domains and settings.
We illustrate that augmenting \palms{} with a  smaller model trained on low-resource languages results in an absolute improvement of up to $13$\% on tasks like
translation into English and arithmetic reasoning for low-resource languages. 
Similarly, when  
\palms{} is augmented with a code-specific model, we see a relative improvement of $40$\% over the base 
model
for code generation and explanation tasks---on-par with fully fine-tuned counterparts.

### Summary
The paper proposes a new approach, CALM, to compose an anchor model and a domain-specific augmenting model by introducing a small number of trainable parameters over both models’ intermediate layer representations. This approach combines the capabilities of the anchor model and the augmenting model, and therefore, is able to address new challenging tasks that cannot be solved by either model alone. The authors use three tasks to demonstrate the advantages of CALM:
1. solving arithmetic expressions containing keys: the anchor model is trained to do arithmetic over integers, and the augmenting model is trained to memorize string-to-integer key-value mappings.
2. Translation and math-word problem-solving in low-resource languages: the anchor model is a pretrained PaLM-2 S model and the augmenting model is trained on low-resource languages.
3. Code completion, text-to-code generation, and code-to-text generation: the anchor model is a pretrained PaLM-2 S model and the augmenting model is pretrained on codes.

### Strengths
Strengths
1. The new approach enables new capabilities in the composed version that the original models cannot achieve.
2. CALM does not modify the parameters of the original model, avoiding the catastrophic forgetting that is prevalent in conventional approaches.
3. CALM has a flexible architecture that makes it possible to compose more than one augmenting model with an anchor model.

### Weaknesses
1. The first task, key-value arithmetic, seems rather arbitrary. A simple encoder-decoder model is expected to solve this problem, leaving the readers the question of why they bother to use the composition of two models. The task setup, where one model stores key-value pairs and the other performs arithmetic, feels contrived. It's unclear why this specific separation of concerns is necessary or beneficial, as a single model could likely learn both mappings and arithmetic operations without the need for composition. The evaluation on held-out keys, while a good practice, does not fully justify the complexity of the proposed approach for this task.
2. For the second task, machine translation in low-resource languages, when the anchor model is trained on the low-resource languages, its performance is higher than the composed approach, which again raises the question of why you need to compose two models instead of fine-tuning the anchor model. The fact that fine-tuning outperforms the composed approach in the low-resource translation setting suggests that the composition method may not be the most effective strategy in this scenario. The benefits of the proposed approach are not clearly demonstrated when compared to a standard fine-tuning approach. The reported regression on numeric arithmetic after fine-tuning is interesting, but it does not fully justify the use of the composition approach if the primary goal is to improve translation performance.
3. The paper misses the details of parameterization/hyperparameter selection. For example, the authors did not write how the layers of the anchor and the augmenting models are selected. The description of how the layers are selected for composition is vague. It is not clear how the number of layers to be used for composition is determined, and how the specific layers are chosen from each model. The lack of detail makes it difficult to reproduce the results or assess the sensitivity of the approach to different layer selections. The projection function is also not clearly defined, particularly how it maps the selected layers of the anchor model to the augmenting model.

### Questions
1. It is not clear to me how the projection function works. Does it project each selected layer of A to all selected layers of B? What is the definition of HBj? Does HA⊕Bj contain the information from all HA or only from a specific layer HAi?
2. Why does CALM on the KV-Arithmetic task have a higher score than mB on the  Numeric-Arithmetic task? Should mB trained on the Numeric-Arithmetic task be the upper bound?

### Summary
The paper introduces the CALM framework, which aims to enhance an existing LLM by incorporating a smaller, specialized one. This framework combines two pretrained LLMs while keeping their weights intact and utilizes learnable linear projections and self-attention to map intermediate representations from one model to the other. CALM demonstrates superior performance compared to both the anchor and augmenting models across three diverse tasks, including arithmetic reasoning, low-resource language translation, and code generation, which are not part of direct training but require a combination of the capabilities of both models.

### Strengths
1. Comprehensive Experiments: The authors conduct extensive experiments that span three widely used application domains. The choices of training and evaluation tasks are reasonable and effectively show the composition of two LLMs.

2. Performance Improvement: The experimental results consistently demonstrate performance improvements across all domains. Notably, the arithmetic reasoning experiment on synthetic datasets shows an impressive performance gain in comparison to both the anchor and augmenting models. The ability of CALM to tackle a novel task not previously feasible for either model is particularly intriguing.

3. Usefulness: The paper presents a concept with potential real-world applications. It enhances model reusability and eliminates the need to scale up existing models for injecting new knowledge.

4. Clarity: The paper is well-written and easy to follow.

### Weaknesses
1. Lack of Comparison to Existing Methods: The paper introduces the CALM framework, which combines two pretrained LLMs. While the concept of combining models with different skill sets is not entirely new, the paper lacks a thorough comparison with existing methods. For instance, exploring techniques like ensembling hidden representations of two models could provide valuable insights into the relative effectiveness of CALM. Providing empirical results for such comparisons would strengthen the paper's contributions. Furthermore, the statement "LoRA assumes access to the full underlying domain data during pretraining" requires clarification, especially when comparing LoRA and CALM using the same training data in Table 5.

2. Missing Information on Overhead: The paper does not provide sufficient information regarding the overhead introduced by the CALM framework. Specifically, details about the additional parameters and their ratio to the anchor and augmenting models are crucial for understanding the system's efficiency. A quantitative analysis of the computational cost, including FLOPs and memory requirements, would provide a clearer picture of the trade-offs involved. The claim that "The composed model achieves similar performance for a tiny fraction of the training cost" should be supported with concrete evidence, especially considering that the framework requires backpropagation through the initial layers of both models.

3. The paper should include detailed model configurations and training specifics to enhance reproducibility. This includes information about the architecture of the anchor and augmenting models, the number of layers used for composition, and the hyperparameters used during training.

4. Some notations are used before being formally introduced, leading to potential confusion. For instance, notation $\mathbf{C}$ is introduced in Section 3.2 after being used from the beginning of Section 3. Additionally, both $t_{\{A, B\}}$ and $C$ denote task sets, which can be confusing and should be clarified or distinguished.

### Questions
1.  Given that CALM requires the model weights access and running both forward and backward passes, keeping the weights frozen isn't necessarily required. It would be interesting to investigate whether updating an anchor, augmenting, or both models could enhance performance. 
2. It would be also interesting to explore the interactions between $m_B$ attending to $m_A$ in comparison to the current direction, to determine whether the capabilities of "generic" models can be effectively transferred to a "specialized" model, especially given that $m_A$ is more efficient to run.
3. Table 3 shows more noticeable performance gains in high-resource languages compared to low-resource ones. I wonder if this might imply that the composition strengthens the skills of pretrained models thanks to extra parameters, rather than teaching them entirely new skills.

### Summary
The paper proposes CALM, composition to augment language models. CALM is designed to compose LLMs with different capabilities. In particular, the paper focuses on composing an anchor model with a domain-specific augmenting model to enable new capabilities. CALM introduces simple linear transformations to extract features from the augmenting model and insert them into the anchor model with cross-attention modules. In the experiments, the paper introduces three different applications of CALM, in the domains of key-value arithmetic, low-resource language inclusivity, and code understanding and generation. The experimental results demonstrate the composed LLMs can perform new challenging tasks and obtain better results than the models without composition.

### Strengths
- The idea of LLM composition is interesting. A great number of LLMs are designed with diverse capabilities. Combining LLMs with different capabilities and deriving new capabilities are valuable research questions. In section 4.2, after combining the model with KV-substitution skill and the model with numeric-arithmetic skill, the combined model achieves zero-shot KV-arithmetic inference. In comparison, the underlying models fail to do KV-Arithmetic inference, demonstrating the emergence of "new skills".
- The authors conduct extensive experiments on diverse domains ranging from language inclusivity to code generation. The results show that CALM successfully combines the capabilities of the anchor and augmenting models.

### Weaknesses
 - Except for the key-value arithmetic case, the composition between low-resource languages and English, and the composition of coding and language capabilities are similar to the works of efficient cross-modal LLMs. For example, many studies have explored how to efficiently connect image encoders to LLMs, which finally achieves a "combined skill" like image-grounded language generation. I believe the relation between CALM and these related cross-modal models should be discussed. Besides, I would expect the combined models to have more non-trivial combined skills ( key-value arithmetic) beyond conditional generation (machine translation or code-to-text generation).
- Introduction mentions that directly training LLMs is computationally expensive but it seems that the experiments do not involve whether CALM is more computationally efficient than directly training the anchor model.

### Questions
Many studies have explored how to efficiently connect image encoders to LLMs, which finally achieves a "combined skill" like image-to-text generation. What is the difference between CALM and the efficient cross-modal LLM methods?

### Summary
This paper proposes CALM to compose a general LLM with specialized models with a cross-attention module. By only fine-tuning the cross-attention on a small amount of data, the composed system is able to enable new capabilities for compositional tasks that neither of the two models can handle independently. The authors conduct experiments on tasks like math reasoning on low-resource language and code understanding and generation to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method.

### Strengths
- Though similar ideas are tested to be effective for building multi-modal models (e..g. reuse image encoder outputs for an LLM to enable multi-modal capabilities), this paper extends the application to new domains and scenarios.
- The method is simple and effective.

### Weaknesses
 - Lack of important details, e.g. it is unclear how many the size of these models, the training steps, and hyperparameters. And how large is the training data $D_c$?
- It would be helpful to add a discussion on the composition with existing methods, such as routing and tool-using. If we treat the specialized models as external tools and prompt the general LLM to first call these models and then process the returned outputs, is it a kind of composition in the text space rather than representations?
