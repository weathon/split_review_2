# DeepEMD: A Transformer-based Fast Estimation of the Earth Mover’s Distance

- Decision: Reject
- Scores: 5, 3, 5, 3

## Abstract
The Earth Mover's Distance (EMD) is the measure of choice between point clouds. However the computational cost to compute it makes it prohibitive as a training loss, and the standard approach is to use a surrogate such as the Chamfer distance. 
  We propose an attention-based model to compute an accurate approximation of the EMD that can be used as a training loss for generative models. To get the necessary accurate estimation of the gradients we train our model to explicitly compute the matching between point clouds instead of EMD itself. We cast this new objective as the estimation of an attention matrix that approximates the ground truth matching matrix. 
  Experiments show that this model provides an accurate estimate of the EMD and its gradient with a wall clock speed-up of more than two orders of magnitude with respect to the exact Hungarian matching algorithm and one order of magnitude with respect to the standard approximate Sinkhorn algorithm, allowing in particular to train a point cloud VAE with the EMD itself. 
  Extensive evaluation show the remarkable behaviour of this model when operating out-of-distribution, a key requirement for a distance surrogate. Finally, the model generalizes very well to point clouds during inference several times larger than during training

### Summary
This paper presents a deep learning based approach DeepEMD for estimating EMD from two point clouds. DeepEMD is much faster then the O(N^3) EMD, and also achieves better performances compared with EMD, CD or Sinkhorn.

### Strengths
1. The proposed EMD is much more efficient than EMD or Sinkhorn. 
2. Fig. 5 shows that the estimated distance from DeepEMD do not have large errors compared with ground truth EMD.

### Weaknesses
1. The evaluation can be improved. All the experiments are conducted at object level. However, the authors do not evaluate DeepEMD under scenes or other types of point clouds. I thinks DeepEMD is limited to the 3D objects since it is only trained with 1024 points under only object-level datasets. A discussion of generality of DeepEMD is needed. Specifically, the paper lacks experiments demonstrating the performance of DeepEMD on more complex and varied point cloud data, such as those found in real-world scene reconstructions or LiDAR scans. The current evaluation is limited to relatively simple, isolated object point clouds, which may not accurately reflect the challenges of applying DeepEMD to more complex scenarios.
2. More 3D visualization can improve the representation. The paper do not contain any 3D visualization for reconstruction, generation, etc. This makes the paper lack intuitive qualitative comparison. The absence of visual results makes it difficult to assess the practical impact of DeepEMD. For instance, visualizing how DeepEMD affects the reconstruction quality of a 3D object, or how it influences the generation of new point clouds, would provide a more intuitive understanding of its performance.
3. It will be much more convincing if the authors adopt DeepEMD as a loss to previous generative models (e.g. single-view point cloud generation, point cloud completion) and report the performance compared to the baseline models. The paper only shows the performance of DeepEMD on auto-encoder and VAE, which are not the main application of EMD. The lack of experiments on more complex generative tasks, such as single-view point cloud generation or point cloud completion, makes it difficult to assess the practical value of DeepEMD as a loss function in these contexts. It would be beneficial to see how DeepEMD compares to existing loss functions in these more challenging scenarios.

### Questions
1. I think that the argmax in Eq.(10) is not differentiable, how did you solve that?
2. Will DeepEMD still be efficient with a large point number? 
3. How long dose it take to train DeepEMD, and how much GPU do you use?

### Summary
The paper deals with the problem of computing (distance-based) similarity between 3D point clouds of shapes. The distance metric considered here is the EMD distance (earth mover distance) between 3D point clouds (considered as discrete distributions). 
The authors have proposed a new approximate approach to compute EMD, which they refer to as DeepEMD. DeepEMD is significantly faster than classical methods (Hungarian algorithm) or the Sinkhorn method that allows an approximate solution to be computed. 
The authors argue that their DeepEMD computation is efficiently enough that it can be used to compute EMD-based losses during training of other deep architectures. In particular they demonstrate promising results in training a point cloud VAE, by using DeepEMD instead of existing approaches to compute EMD.

### Strengths
The paper is well written and the general approach of using transformers to compare 3D point clouds and directly predict a matching matrix or the Earth movers distance (EMD) is a sound one. The architecture used by DeepEMD (the transformer-based model) produces accurate results at a fraction of the running time of some of the well-known existing methods.

### Weaknesses
The core idea of using transformers to compare pairs of 3D point clouds representing similar or overlapping shapes is not new. See [A, B]. This has been explored in the literature in papers such as these two papers. The transformer architectures in those papers also predict a matching matrix/scores that is then used to compute correspondences to solve a registration task. The proposed architecture is different from the ones in these papers but from what I can tell, the architectures/models in [A, B] appear to be superior as they allow the ability to deal with partial matching, outliers where the work proposed here cannot deal with such scenarios.

The authors claim that their proposed approach to compute EMD approximately is significantly faster than existing techniques. They primarily consider two baselines, the well-known Hungarian method which computes EMD exactly and the well-known method that used entropic regularization to compute approximate EMD (Cuturi et al 2013) using matrix scaling / Sinkhorn Knopp algorithm. It is true that the proposed method is significantly faster than the Hungarian method and the Sinkhorn implementation tested here. However, there are a number of works in the literature which are either variants of the Sinkhorn method that have a better convergence than the original Sinkhorn method [C] or have investigated faster algorithms for computing EMD [D, E] that do not require any learning and therefore do not have the issue of overfitting/failure to generalize. A comparison with methods such as [C, D, E] is needed (perhaps there are a few other works in the literature) to make a stronger case for the proposed method.

The title/abstract is not particularly appropriate. The proposed approach is aimed at computing EMD-based distance between 3D point clouds of geometric shapes. However, the title of the paper makes it sound like a generic method to compute EMD between arbitrary distributions has been proposed. Morever, the approximation factor in the proposed method is somewhat adhoc and not well analyzed, as some of the existing methods in the literature.

### Questions
Q1. Some of the implementation details should be clarified. How are the samples from the real datasets (ShapeNet, ModelNet40) used? What does "In order to improve and assess generalization, we augment the train and test splits with synthetic perturbations." (page 6) exactly refer to?

Q2. The sentences "These quite remarkable behavior .. as shown in Table 2." should be toned down a bit. What is the reason for this behavior? Further technical insights into what is being reported would make the claim stronger.

Q3. Why can't the linear-time EMD method of Shirdhonkar and Jacobs (2008) be used in practice. The sentence "However, their approach is limited to low dimensional histograms." needs to be explained further. Couldn't the 3D point clouds have been represented as coarser histograms and compared using their method?

Q4 (comment) the discussion of the method proposed by Amos et al. 2022 is not easy to follow. The distinction / similarity with their work needs to be explained more clearly.

### Summary
The paper introduces DeepEMD, a method for approximating the Earth Mover's Distance (EMD) with a significant speed improvement over traditional EMD calculation methods. The DeepEMD model is based on a multi-head multi-layer transformer, followed by a single-head full attention layer to predict the matching matrix. DeepEMD is evaluated on synthetic and real-world datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness in EMD approximation and gradient estimation. The model shows good generalization capabilities and can be used as a loss function in point cloud autoencoders. The conclusion also discusses potential future research directions, including faster transformer variants, architectural improvements, and extensions to other optimal transport problems.

### Strengths
-	The primary strength of this work is its focus on addressing the computational complexity of calculating the Earth Mover's Distance. By introducing DeepEMD, the authors significantly speed up the computation.
-	The results demonstrate that DeepEMD effectively approximates the true EMD, providing strong correlations between predicted and true distances. It also successfully estimates gradients, which is essential for various applications. This makes it a valuable tool for point cloud data analysis and potentially for other domains where EMD is utilized.

### Weaknesses
 - While the paper compares DeepEMD with other algorithms, it fails to compare against other state of the art works that compute EMD in terms of speed and accuracy. 
- The authors fail to make a tradeoff between speed and accuracy. 
- The authors talk about several works like CD, DPDist etc. in related works section which are faster than the proposed work. However, authors fail to compare their work with these works.

### Questions
-	How does this work compare against other recent works in terms of speed and accuracy?
-	Figure 8 shows DeepEMD to be performing 100x faster than Hungarian algorithm but has almost half the accuracy against the same algorithm. How much does DeepEMD sacrifice accuracy to achieve speed? Can you provide a more detailed speed vs accuracy tradeoff?
-	Is there a specific reason to use only 100 iterations for comparison? Can a better graph be provided that compares the methods over iterations?

### Summary
This paper introduces an attention-based model designed to approximate the Earth Mover's Distance (EMD) for point clouds. Traditional EMD calculations are computationally expensive, so surrogates like the Chamfer distance are often used. To overcome this, the authors focus on computing the point cloud matchings rather than the EMD itself. Experiments show that this model can be used to estimate the EMD faster than using the Hungarian method or Sinkhorn algorithm. The paper demonstrates how the approach can be used to train a point cloud Variational Autoencoder (VAE) using the approximated EMD.

### Strengths
S1. Framing of the problem: The framing of the point-cloud matching problem as learning a cost function is quite intersting and makes me think of a number of applications for which this can be used. The empirical results provided, particularly the comparison against the Chamfer distance, the Hungarian method, and the Sinkhorn algorithm (as seen in Figure 8), is nice. This comparison gives a clear view of where the proposed model stands in terms of computational efficiency and accuracy.


S2. Clarity: The paper's structure and presentation seem to be well-organized, with the problem clearly articulated. The choice of casting the problem as an estimation of an attention matrix and its relevance is also clear. However, for a reader unfamiliar with point cloud analysis or attention mechanisms, some sections might be dense. A more thorough introduction or background on these concepts could enhance clarity.

S3. Significance: Notwithstanding missing comparisons (see Weaknesses below) I think the proposed model for approximating EMD could be quite useful in a number of scenarios (basically anywhere the Hungarian algorithm or the Chamfer distance is used at the moment). The model's performance, particularly in the out-of-distribution tests, is quite promising. The model also seems to generalize well to larger point-clouds than on which it was trained.

### Weaknesses
W1. Lack of Novelty: The problem of point-cloud registration is very well-studied, with numerous learning-based methods proposed over the years. Some of these also include attention mechanisms to do the matching. See the methods listed here: https://github.com/XuyangBai/awesome-point-cloud-registration

W2. Comparative Evaluation: The paper does not compare its method to state-of-the-art registration approaches. Given that point-cloud registration is a long-studied problem, there are likely several strong baseline methods against which the proposed model should be evaluated.

W3. Generalization may be an issue: While the paper mentions that the model generalizes well to larger point clouds during inference than those seen during training, most of the experiments are carried out on datasets consistent of synthetic 3D models. What happens when this is applied to real LiDAR scans or depth images?

W4. Scalability Issues: Attention mechanisms, particularly in the context of a large number of outputs, can be memory-intensive. Given that point clouds can be large (millions of points), it might be difficult to scale the proposed approach to such cases.

### Questions
I would suggest the following specific changes to address the weaknesses listed above:

W1. It would be helpful if the paper's contribution can be positioned more clearly within the existing landscape of point-cloud registration methods. Providing a thorough review of existing methods, especially those that leverage learning-based approaches, will help highlight the contributions of this work.
 
W2. The authors should compare their approach against leading methods in point-cloud registration, possibly ones from the above list. By doing so, they can better demonstrate the advantages of their method, be it in terms of accuracy, speed, or other criteria.

W4. The memory overhead of the attention-based method should be addressed, particularly in the context of large point clouds. Providing benchmarks for total memory usage would be beneficial.
