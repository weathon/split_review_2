# MSA Generation with Seqs2Seqs Pretraining: Advancing Protein Structure Predictions

- Decision: Reject
- Scores: 5, 6, 6

## Abstract
Deep learning, epitomized by models like AlphaFold2 \citep{jumper2021highly}, has achieved unparalleled accuracy in protein structure prediction. However, the depth of multiple sequence alignment (MSA) remains a bottleneck, especially for proteins lacking extensive homologous families. Addressing this, we present \METHODNAME{}, a self-supervised generative protein language model, pre-trained on a sequence\textbf{s}-to-sequence\textbf{s} task with an automatically constructed dataset. Equipped with protein-specific attention mechanisms, \METHODNAME{} harnesses large-scale protein databases to generate virtual, informative MSAs, enriching subpar MSAs and amplifying prediction accuracy. Our experiments with CASP14 and CASP15 benchmarks showcase marked LDDT improvements, especially for challenging sequences, enhancing both AlphaFold2 and RoseTTAFold's performance.

### Summary
The paper introduces MSAGenerator, a novel self-supervised generative protein language model aimed at advancing protein structure predictions. Drawing inspiration from the groundbreaking achievements of models such as AlphaFold2 in protein structure prediction, the paper addresses the key challenge of the paucity of deep multiple sequence alignments (MSA) for proteins that have limited homologous families. The MSAGenerator, pre-trained on a sequences-to-sequences task, employs an automatically constructed dataset and leverages protein-specific attention mechanisms. This design enables it to generate informative, virtual MSAs that enrich insufficient MSAs, thereby elevating the accuracy of predictions. The paper validates the efficacy of the MSAGenerator using the CASP14 and CASP15 benchmarks, indicating notable improvements in LDDT scores. These improvements are especially significant for sequences that are inherently challenging, and the results further emphasize the enhancement of performance for both AlphaFold2 and RoseTTAFold.

### Strengths
1. The study delivers promising results, indicating the potential of MSAGenerator to advance the field.
2. The problem of limited or poor-quality MSAs for certain proteins is well-recognized, and the paper's focus on this issue is timely and relevant.

### Weaknesses
The paper does not provide clear details on the benchmarking process, especially regarding the selection of search databases and the parameters used. I would consider raising my score if the authors address these crucial issues.

- The underlying rationale for the superiority of the MSAGenerator over traditional MSA search methods remains ambiguous, especially given that the pretraining of the model is based on the outputs from MSA searches. This warrants further elucidation.

- There is a disparity in the choice of databases: the paper mentions using the UniRef50 database for pretraining and then switches to UniRef90 for testing. The reasons for this choice are not explained, and it raises questions about the potential variation in results had UniRef50 been employed for both stages.

- The introduction of an "artificial challenging MSA" requires a more comprehensive explanation. Its significance and the rationale behind its inclusion in the study are unclear. Figure 4 a seems to depict an imbalanced comparison. If homologous sequences were present during the pretraining phase but not considered for the baseline, it would be an unfair representation. This suggests that the MSAGenerator's performance may not surpass real MSAs.
- For Figure 4c, it is crucial to also represent the "Real over Virtual" comparison to provide a comprehensive view(negative interval)
- Fig4 Queries arise regarding the consistency of the reported improvements when other protein structure prediction methods, like RoseTTAFold, are used.
- In Table 1, the specific MSA methodology employed in the benchmarking process, as well as the precise parameters and databases used for MSA searches, are not detailed. It remains unclear if these are consistent with the pretraining stage.

### Summary
The authors emphasize the significance of Multiple Sequence Alignments (MSAs) in the prediction of protein structures. Their experiments demonstrate that a decrease in the quantity of MSAs leads to a decline in prediction accuracy. Consequently, they introduce a transformer-based model designed to generate protein sequences from a specific MSA dataset. The experimental results indicate that incorporating augmented MSAs can enhance the prediction performance of AlphaFold2.

### Strengths
- The topic holds significant relevance in today's scientific landscape, as protein engineering continues to gain prominence as a cutting-edge field of research. 
- This method is straightforward to implement, making it accessible and efficient for integration.

### Weaknesses
The authors' proposed task shares a fundamental similarity with the task of modeling the distribution of a given MSA. While their approach shows promise, it is crucial to provide a more comprehensive perspective and clarify the novelty of their contribution. Unfortunately, the manuscript overlooks several pertinent references, including:
1. McGee, F., Hauri, S., Novinger, Q. et al. The generative capacity of probabilistic protein sequence models. Nat Commun 12, 6302 (2021).
2. Riesselman, A.J., Ingraham, J.B. & Marks, D.S. Deep generative models of genetic variation capture the effects of mutations. Nat Methods 15, 816–822 (2018).
3. Sinai, S., Kelsic, E., Church, G. M. & Nowak, M. A. Variational auto-encoding of protein sequences. NeurIPS 2017 MLCB Workshop

Once a distribution for a specific MSA is acquired through learning, sampling from this distribution becomes an efficient method for generating multiple protein sequences that share similarities.

Examining Figure 4a, it's not immediately clear whether the depth or quality of the MSA holds more significance. For example, if we were to introduce random protein sequences into the MSA, we are uncertain how this would impact performance. This calls for a more in-depth analysis to understand the relationship between MSA depth and quality and their potential trade-offs in achieving optimal results. As an example, if we were to introduce random protein sequences by masking certain sequences within the original MSA, can we also achieve good performance?

My primary concerns arise when I examine Figure 7. I'm curious about the methodology behind calculating the conservation and quality metric. It seems that these scores are derived solely from the provided sequences, such as the six sequences for T1093-D1. Consequently, I question the significance of these metrics. 

One could argue that it's possible to achieve high scores for conservation, quality, or other metrics by simply inspecting the original MSA, identifying the region with the highest conservation metric, and selecting it as a segment. This segment could then be augmented by inserting arbitrary amino acids at random positions occasionally. Such a process could potentially yield perfect conservation scores, quality scores, and so on.

This concern also ties into my second question: What would the pLDDT score be if I were to employ the aforementioned approach to augment the original MSA?

---

In Section 4.5, the authors make a comparison with Iterative Unmask; however, they do not provide a comparison of the pLDDT scores using this baseline method. Additionally, there is some ambiguity regarding the dataset used for the analysis. It remains unclear which sets of sequences were used by the authors to construct the Position-Specific Scoring Matrix (PSSM) and what the correlation coefficients are when employing Iterative Unmask.

### Summary
For proteins that do not possess abundant homologous families, the extent of multiple sequence alignment (MSA) continues to be a limiting factor for protein structure prediction. This paper proposes the MSA-Generator, a protein language model that is trained in a self-supervised manner. The MSA-Generator utilizes attention mechanisms that are specific to proteins, enabling it to leverage extensive protein databases for the purpose of generating virtual MSAs that are informative.  The results on CASP14 and CASP15 benchmarks demonstrate significant enhancements in the Local Distance Difference Test (LDDT) scores, particularly for difficult sequences. The generated virtual MSAs re valuable for the enhancement of performance for both AlphaFold2 and RoseTTAFold.

### Strengths
This paper formulates the MSA generation problem to be an unsupervised sequences-to-sequences (seqs2seqs) task, and proposes the MSA-Generator. Nearly half of the generated virtual MSAs even outperform the real searched MSAs. MSA-Generator can enhance the performance of RoseTTAFold and AlphaFold2 even compared with other MSA generation methods on CASP14 and CASP15.

### Weaknesses
Overall, I really appreciate the results of your experiments. The weakness/questions are listed as:
1. It seems that the method of seqs2seqs pretraining is important in MSA generation. Can it be applied in protein design?
2. From Table 1, it seems the proposed method gets marked improvements in both metrics across both RoseTTAFold and AlphaFold2 on CASP14 and CASP15. Do you have any ideas and insights for CASP16? 
3. The proposed MSA-Generator includes Tied-Row Attention, Cross-Row Attention, and Self/Cross-Column Attention, which may have appeared in previous models like AlphaFold2. However, it is promising that the proposed model can obtain remarkable improvements on CASP14 and 15. For more ablation studies, could you provide results to illustrate which part is crucial and explain why it works for the proposed Tied-Row Attention, Cross-Row Attention, and Self/Cross-Column Attention?
4. In fig. 4 (b), what is the meaning of the dashed lines? Why do they seem thin in the middle and thick on the sides? In fig.4 (c), why are there more improvements if intervals are less than 10 for virtual over baseline and virtual over real?

5.Where are the codes, do you have any plans to public code?

Typos: The challenge of protein structure prediction (PSP), a pivotal issue in structural biology, has has
experienced transformative progress due to the deep learning revolution: two has.
