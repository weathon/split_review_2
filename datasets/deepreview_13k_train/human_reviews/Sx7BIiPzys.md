# Variational Bayesian Last Layers

- Decision: Accept
- Scores: 8, 6, 1, 8

## Abstract
We introduce a deterministic variational formulation for training Bayesian last layer neural networks. This yields a sampling-free, single-pass model and loss that effectively improves uncertainty estimation. Our variational Bayesian last layer (VBLL) can be trained and evaluated with only quadratic complexity in last layer width, and is thus (nearly) computationally free to add to standard architectures. We experimentally investigate VBLLs, and show that they improve predictive accuracy, calibration, and out of distribution detection over baselines across both regression and classification. Finally, we investigate combining VBLL layers with variational Bayesian feature learning, yielding a lower variance collapsed variational inference method for Bayesian neural networks.

### Summary
The authors introduce variational Bayesian last layers as a novel approach for approximate inference in Bayesian deep learning models. The main contribution is three-fold: (i) following the current trend in Bayesian deep learning the authors propose to use a variational approximation to the last-layer posterior, (ii) the authors introduce closed-form bounds on the ELBO for different likelihood functions, (iii) the authors show that the simple approach can result in improved performance for regression and some classification tasks.

I have adjusted my score based on the author's response.

### Strengths
1. The paper is well-written and easy to follow in most parts. Moreover, the work is well-motivated and I enjoyed that the authors brought back old ideas to the BDL community, e.g., using the discriminant analysis as a likelihood model.
2. I believe the exposition of the method is well done in most places, though slightly dense here and there, and helped in understanding the general idea of the proposed method. Moreover, I believe that the method is correct and an interesting contribution to the field. I think it is important to see more work on deterministic approaches to uncertainty quantification in deep learning. 
3. The experimental section shows promising results, especially in the case of regression.

### Weaknesses
Overall: My main concern with the paper is the weak empirical evaluation and limited novelty of the work, that is, it seems it is essentially an application of known techniques to the special case of last-layer posteriors.

Comments:
1. Section 2.4 lists various related works, which I believe the author claims to optimize the log marginal via gradient descent. I have not checked every citation, but it appears to me that this statement is false for at least a subset of the cited papers. It might be good to revise the exposition.
2. Eq 12 is some weighted ELBO, weighted with T for the purpose of generality, according to the authors. However, T never seems to be used later and makes the connection to the common ELBO less transparent. I believe the paper would improve in clarity if T is dropped.
3. Section 3.4 is very dense and it could help the reader if this section is improved in its presentation.
4. For the experiments, I would have expected assessments under distributional shift, a comparison to recent deterministic approaches (e.g., Zeng et al 2023 or Dhawan et al 2023), and a large-scale application of the approach as it acts on the last-layer only and should be applicable in more realistic scenarios (e.g., ImageNet).


Minor:
- Page 3, Eq 11 cites "Harrison et al 2018", which I looked up but didn't find any relevant content that would discuss the use of the marginal in Bayesian deep learning as a standard objective. What is the reason for the citation?

### Questions
1. Eq. 14 uses a rather loose bound, is it possible that this is the reason the approach underperforms in the classification settings compared to the regression setting? If so, is there any way to obtain a tighter bound?
2. How does the method perform if it is used only as a post-hoc approach, meaning, without adaptation of the feature map? In large-scale applications, this is a particularly relevant setting and the proposed method could be a promising plug-in replacement.
3. From what I understand T is never actually used. Is this correct?

### Summary
The paper proposes a novel way to learn Bayesian last layer (BLL) networks by deriving a sampling-free approach for optimizing normal, categorical, and generative classification likelihoods,
by relying on variational inference techniques. 
The approach is then evaluated on a series of regression and classification tasks against a range of baselines.


_____
_Edit: Given the improved presentation and evaluation, I increased my score._

### Strengths
BLL networks are an interesting approach to solve the scalability problem Bayesian neural networks tend to suffer from. 
The paper introduces another variation to this family of approaches that is relatively straightforward, easy to understand, and implement.
The method is properly evaluated as the number of experimental setups is reasonably extensive both with respect to architectures and experimental tasks.

### Weaknesses
Straight-forward contributions can be seen both as a strength and as a weakness depending on the situation. 
They are a strength if they are an easy solution to a complex problem that might not improve upon current approaches in all situations, but most. 
They are a weakness if they do not provide a clear theoretical benefit above current approaches and also come without clear performance improvements.
For me, the results point to the latter case as they are rather mixed despite some strong wordings of the authors in their claims. 

The abstract promises "improve[d] predictive accuracy, calibration, and out of distribution detection over baselines.", similarly in the contributions, and conclusion 
parts of the paper. Even more, the method not only improves, but it also performs "extremely strong" and "exceptionally strong".  
These are some exceptionally strong statements given the actual performance.  

Focusing on each of the experiments in turn. The first problem is the presentation, e.g., what does a bold number mean (see question below)?

_Regression Experiments._ Of 
the six data sets (see question below on this number) the proposal improves on two, slightly on one, equally on two (although better than neural net-based baselines), and worse than most of its baselines in the final one. Calling this "strong performance" is rather misleading. Two additional, though potentially minor, problems are that all of the baselines are simply cited from prior work (Watson et al., 2021). Given the wide performance variations between different train/test splits that can be observed for various UCI data sets the results are not entirely trustworthy. (Note that the reported error intervals are most likely standard errors, as is common on UCI, instead of standard deviations. But which they are is never specified.)
Secondly, the authors acknowledge in the appendix that there might be differences in the way the training data is normalized compared to the cited results. 
(Whether these problems strongly influence the results, or bias them in favor or against VBLL is unclear.)   

_Classification._
While "Extremely strong accuracy results" are mentioned, it just performs as well or worse than competitive baselines like Laplace or Ensembles. The same for ECE, NLL, OOD detection.  where "exceptionally strong performance" is claimed.

The method is somewhat simpler than baselines, but it lacks a convincing argument for why this should matter. As the authors advertise this simplicity, there should be additional results on practical runtime improvements compared to the baselines to provide some evidence for the claim that a reader should use this approach. 



### Questions
- Why was this specific subset of six UCI data sets chosen? The original work by Hernández-Lobato and Adams (2015), who introduced this set of experiments had ten, and even Watson et al. (2021) who the authors cite as relying on for their setup used ~~seven~~ different sets. _(PostRebuttal Edit: I misread the reference, Watson et al. use the full set of experiments.)_
- Can the authors provide further results on the empirical runtime of the proposed approach, not just a theoretical one?
- What was the principle according to which average numbers are bolded? E.g., in Energy RMSE a huge range of means is bold (from 0.39 to 0.47), but 0.43 is missing;  CIFAR-100 AUC has the same pattern, huge range, some missing, etc. 
- (very minor) What is the irony in BLL methods being popular (Sec 2.4)?

### Summary
This paper derives efficient optimization objectives of the posterior distribution over the parameters of the last layer of neural networks for common machine learning applications such as classification, regression, and generative classification. Theoretically, their variational inference objective functions are derived in closed form and therefore enjoy the property of not requiring sampling - meaning the cost of enabling uncertainty quantification for a broad class of deep learning architectures is marginal (parameters other than the last layer are learned by maximum a posteriori). Experimentally, they validate these novel variational inference algorithms using standard benchmarks from UCI, a large language model used for sentiment analysis, and an image classification problem.

### Strengths
This is an excellent paper and a significant contribution - well done! The authors make clear how they build on the existing literature in Bayesian deep learning to create a novel advance that is practical and easy to implement. This is significant and should enable more work to push the frontier of the "best of both worlds", with neural networks serving as function approximators and Bayesian methods enabling sample-efficiency and quantification of uncertainty that is required for practical deployment of deep learning.

### Weaknesses
Visualizations of how tight or loose the bounds in the main text could help build more intuition; comparisons in terms of speed or efficiency to variational inference algorithms that do require sampling (such as Monte-Carlo objectives like VIMCO) could also help guide practitioners in making the correct trade-off depending on FLOPs of compute available versus the required accuracy of posterior approximation/uncertainty quantification.

### Questions
For the Resnet image recognition and sentiment analysis experiments, what was the additional compute required (or time taken per iteration, if available)? The sample-efficiency is great, and understanding the practical overhead rather than theoretical complexity would be great for larger models that are in broad use.

### Summary
This paper introduces Variational Bayesian Last layers, a technique to perform uncertainty estimation in standard neural network architectures. 
The method performs bayesian learning only for the last layer in the neural networks using Variational Inference.
This results in a scalable and simple technique that shows strong performances in standard benchmarks for regression and classification.

### Strengths
1. I found the paper very interesting and easy to read. Uncertainty estimation is an important and active research area in deep learning.

1. To the best of my knowledge, the idea is novel (although not groundbreaking)

1. The method is scalable, simple to implement in standard architectures, and achieves very competitive performances (especially considering its simplicity)

1. While being Bayesian only on the last neural network layer the method is in principle not as powerful as other techniques, as the authors rightly claim simpler methods that are easy to implement are what is being more commonly used in practice (e.g. Bayesian dropout, stochastic weight averaging)

1. The appendix is extensive and addresses all the details I felt were missing in the main paper

### Weaknesses
I did not identify any major weaknesses, only some points for improvement

1. To increase the impact of the paper you need to make sure that people that are not too familiar with VI are able to easily implement the paper. This means:
    1. Make the code publicly available, especially to show how to best implement the "mixed parameterization" discussed in appendix D 
    1. set good default hyperparameters

2. It would be useful to draw the graphical models of the models presented in Section 2, to help the reader visualize the random variables in play and their (hyper)priors/parameters

3. In case you need more space in the paper, I would move to the appendix some of the details on the generative classification model, especially considering the poorer performances.

### Questions
None, aside from the minor points presented in the weaknesses section
