- Decision: Accept
- Scores: 6, 5, 8, 5

## Abstract
Recent works have empirically analyzed in-context learning and shown that transformers trained on synthetic linear regression tasks can learn to implement ridge regression, which is the Bayes-optimal predictor, given sufficient capacity \citep{akyurek2023_icl}, while one-layer transformers with linear self-attention and no MLP layer will learn to implement one step of gradient descent (GD) on a least-squares linear regression objective \citep{vonoswald2022transformers}. However, the theory behind these observations remains poorly understood. 
We theoretically study transformers with a single layer of linear self-attention, trained on synthetic noisy linear regression data. First, we mathematically show that when the covariates are drawn from a standard Gaussian distribution, the one-layer transformer which minimizes the pre-training loss will implement a single step of GD on the least-squares linear regression objective. Then, we find that changing the distribution of the covariates and weight vector to a non-isotropic Gaussian distribution has a strong impact on the learned algorithm: the global minimizer of the pre-training loss now implements a single step of \textit{pre-conditioned} GD. However, if only the distribution of the responses is changed, then this does not have a large effect on the learned algorithm: even when the response comes from a more general family of \textit{nonlinear} functions, the global minimizer of the pre-training loss still implements a single step of GD on a least-squares linear regression objective.

### Summary
This paper theoretically analyzed the one-layer linear self-attention layer on the linear regression teacher model. The authors proved that after pertaining to this one-layer transformer under square loss, the minimizer we got is equivalent to a single-step gradient descent (GD) on the least-squares linear regression problem. This paper also considered covariate shifts for the data distribution, which correspond to preconditioned GD. Finally, the authors claimed for rotational invariant nonlinear teacher models, the global minimizer of the transformer is still equivalent to one step GD on least-squares linear regression.

### Strengths
The paper is written very clearly in a way that highlights the main analysis techniques in the main body. It also provides enough summaries for some concurrent works and literature reviews. The main message of this paper is clear. The authors theoretically analyze the in-context learning capability for the self-attention layer in the linear regime and make the connection with the Bayes-optimal predictor of the linear regression model. This result provides a number of natural directions for future theoretical study in transformers.

### Weaknesses
1. The dataset assumption is simple and the authors only considered i.i.d. data sequence with linear teacher model. This setting helps the analysis but may not be able to fully capture the properties of the self-attention layer. Besides, the proofs rely on the rotational invariance of Gaussian distribution. It would be interesting to generalize the results in non-Gaussian datasets or consider more dependent structures in the data sequence, like the Bigram language model in [1]. Specifically, the current analysis does not address the potential for the self-attention mechanism to capture long-range dependencies or complex patterns within sequences, which are key features in many real-world applications. The i.i.d. assumption significantly simplifies the analysis, but it is a strong assumption that limits the applicability of the results to more realistic scenarios where data points exhibit temporal or structural dependencies. Furthermore, the reliance on the rotational invariance of the Gaussian distribution restricts the scope of the theoretical findings, as real-world data often deviates from this assumption. 

2. This paper focuses on the global minimizer of the population square loss of the self-attention layer which simplifies the analysis. It would be natural to consider the minimizer of the empirical loss during the pre-training process and how the minimizer of the GD or stochastic GD with finite step sizes generalizes in the test point. The analysis should explore how the optimization trajectory and the convergence properties of GD impact the generalization performance, especially when the training data is finite. The paper lacks an investigation into the effects of different learning rates, batch sizes, and optimization algorithms on the generalization behavior of the self-attention layer. Considering the practical training process with finite data and stochastic gradients is critical for bridging the gap between theory and practice. 

3. Further experiments and simulations should be presented for completeness. For instance, the training dynamic of nonlinear/multi-layer transformers with nonlinear target functions that are defined in Section 5. This will help us know the limitations of the current theory and potential interesting directions for future analysis. The absence of empirical validation leaves the theoretical claims untested, and it is unclear how well the theoretical results generalize to more complex settings. The paper would benefit from experiments that explore the behavior of the self-attention layer in nonlinear settings, as well as with multi-layer architectures, to determine the limitations of the current theory and to identify potential areas for future research.

### Questions
1. You may need to briefly explain the parameter $\eta$ in Eq. (1).

2. In the second paragraph on page 4, $v_n=\\begin{bmatrix}x_i
\\\\ 0 \\end{bmatrix}$ should be $v_n=\\begin{bmatrix}x_{n+1}
\\\\ 0 \\end{bmatrix}$.

3. In Eq. (10), the number of training parameters is $d^2+d$ and we consider population squared loss for training. Does that mean this model is under-parameterized and has a unique global minimizer? And when could the constants in Lemma 1 and Eq. (13) in Lemma 2 be zero? More specifically, is the minimizer constructed in Theorem 1 unique and when will it attain zero training loss? 

4. How large the learning rate $\eta$ is? Following the remark after Theorem 1, we know the global minimizer is equivalent to a step gradient descent on the empirical loss of the least squares problem with zero initialization and learning rate $\eta$ defined in Theorem 1. How large $\eta$ is, compared with the largest eigenvalue of the Hessian matrix $H$ of this least squares problem? Is it just close to or larger than the maximal learning rate $2/\lambda_{\max}(H)$?

5. In Section 4, when we consider data covariance in $\Sigma$, why do we renormalize back by $w\sim\mathcal{N}(0,\Sigma^{-1})$? Can we consider $w$ has another different population covariance like [2]?

6. In Theorem 3, when defining $\eta$, what is $\mathcal{D}$? No definition of this distribution.

7. In the proof of Lemma 1, after Eq. (29), why is the minimizer of $g(u)$ given by $\hat{w}_{\tilde{D}}$? Here, for $g(u)$, you only have one data point. Can you explain more?

8. It may be worthy to mention or compare with some of the references among [1] and [3-7].

### Summary
This paper considers a one layer self-attention model with linear attention and shows that one step of gradient descent is the optimal in-context learner in this case. Specifically, they consider a synthetic noisy linear regression task and show that when the covariates are drawn from a standard Gaussian, the model implements one step of GD, which is also the global minimizer of the pretraining loss. If the distribution of the covariates if changed to a non-isotropic Gaussian, it now implements pre-conditioned GD. On the other hand, when using a nonlinear model to generate the data, it still implements a single step of GD.

### Strengths
This paper takes a step to improve the theoretical understanding of in-context learning in transformers, which is an important topic.

### Weaknesses
While this is an important topic, the paper does not seem to make a significant contribution. The main drawback is that it considers a one layer attention model, which has been studied extensively for the developing theoretical understanding of in-context learning.

In the first case, the only contribution seems to be that using an appropriate step size allows the resulting solution to be a global minimizer of the pretraining loss. This does not seem to add to the understanding of transformers, as it was already shown in [1] that transformers implement one step of GD. Similarly, the result in the third case is also not very informative. Given that this is a one layer model, it is not surprising that it implements one step of GD, even when the target function is nonlinear. The analysis in the second case, while showing pre-conditioned GD, is also limited by the fact that it is a one-layer model, and the pre-conditioning is a direct result of the input covariance, which is a well known phenomenon in linear models.

### Questions
Please see the weaknesses section. My main concern is that this paper does not offer new insights regarding in-context learning in transformers (that has not been discussed in one of the prior works), and also does not use any new proof techniques. It would be interesting to analyze multi-head attention or multilayer transformers, as the authors discuss in the conclusion.

### Summary
In this paper, the authors provide a theoretical analysis of transformers equipped with a single layer of linear self-attention, trained on synthetic noisy linear regression data. The primary focus of this paper lies in exploring in-context learning pretraining scenarios, where the training data consists of pairs (x_i, y_i) with associated ground truth, and the evaluation is based on the Mean Squared Error (MSE) metric for the test point (x', y').

The key findings presented in this paper can be summarized as follows: (1) Under the assumption of linear noisy ground truth, when x_i samples are drawn from an isotropic Gaussian distribution, the one-layer transformer model that minimizes the pretraining loss effectively corresponds to a single step of Gradient Descent (GD) applied to the least-squares linear regression problem. (2) When x_i samples are drawn from a non-isotropic Gaussian distribution, the optimization process becomes a preconditioned GD. The authors shed light on this aspect, showcasing the connection between the nature of the input distribution and the optimization approach. Furthermore, The paper goes beyond linear cases, demonstrating that the findings can be extended to non-linear scenarios under specific symmetric conditions.

In conclusion, I strongly recommend accepting this paper for the following reasons: (1) The paper demonstrates exceptional organization, making it highly accessible and comprehensible for the readers. (2) The topic addressed in this paper holds paramount significance within the Language Model (LLM) domain, contributing to our understanding of key theoretical aspects. (3) The paper introduces some innovative results, particularly in the sections related to preconditioning and non-linear extensions. These novel findings are likely to ignite further research and inspire intriguing follow-up studies.

### Strengths
Overall, this paper has the potential to inspire and stimulate further research in this area.
1. The organization of the paper is well-structured, making it accessible to a broad readership.
2. The paper addresses a crucial topic in the realm of Language Model (LLM) research, shedding theoretical insights on transformers under in-context learning scenarios.
3. The results presented in the paper are noteworthy, particularly the connections made in Theorem 1, including the proof of global minimization and its equivalence to a single step of gradient descent. The exploration of non-isotropic Gaussian distributions leading to preconditioned GD is an interesting and novel aspect. Additionally, the extension to non-linear cases adds depth to the research.
4. The paper is well-written and effectively communicates its findings and insights.

### Weaknesses
While the paper is commendable, there are a couple of minor questions and potential areas for further investigation:

1. The usage of the statement "(Wk, Wq, Wv, h) is a global minimizer" in Theorem 1 raises questions about the specifics of this minimization process. Further clarification or details regarding this construction might be beneficial for readers. Specifically, it's unclear what space the minimization is performed over. Are there any constraints on the weight matrices Wk, Wq, and Wv, or the bias term h? The theorem states that the minimizer corresponds to a single step of gradient descent, but without knowing the constraints, it is hard to verify this claim. It would be helpful to explicitly state the optimization problem being solved, including the domain of the variables and any constraints.

2. The reviewer suggests that, in in-context learning regimes, the downstream phase is crucial. Encouraging future research that delves into this aspect could be valuable for a more comprehensive understanding of the subject.

---------------------------------------------------------------------

After rebuttal, I tend to maintain the score of 5. The main concern is the significance to the community. 

**Practical Insight**: It is still a major concern. I am not clear on what I can learn from this paper. It makes the result less interesting and significant to me. For example, can this paper provide an explanation for any phenomenon in in-context learning in practice? How can this paper guide the training in practice?

**Experiments**: Generally, I am satisfied with the efforts of the authors. Since I only specified one experiment, I will not treat the experiment part as a big weakness, although I expect to see more experiments. 

**Fully connected neural networks and Assumption 1**: Good, I am satisfied with this result.

**Contribution compared to [Zhang, et al. 2023]**: OK. Although [Zhang et al., 2023] was posted online 3.5 months before ICLR submission deadline, I agree it can be treated as a concurrent work.

### Strengths
The significance is good since the studied problem is essential and interesting to the community. The paper is overall well-written with good clarity. This paper provides a comparison with existing works and concurrent works. The contributions include that it provides a global optimal analysis when constructing a linear-attention Transformer to implement gradient descent. Meanwhile, it shows analyses on non-standard Gaussian inputs and non-linear target functions.

### Weaknesses
1. This paper lacks empirical justification. 
2. I am not sure about the practical insight from the theoretical analysis of this work.

### Questions
1. Can you verify that the $\eta$ in Theorem 1,2 are as predicted by experiments? Specifically, can you show how $\sigma^2$ in Theorem 2 affects $\eta$ by experiments?

2. I don't know why fully-connected neural networks satisfy Assumption 1 (1). Can you provide a proof for this claim? 

3. Without section 5, the contribution compared with Zhang el at., 2023 will only be incremental. Why do you assign too much content to Section 3? I think it is better to enlarge the content of Section 5.
