- Decision: Accept
- Scores: 3, 8, 5, 6

## Abstract
During interactive segmentation, a model and a user work together to delineate objects of interest in a 3D point cloud.
In an iterative process, the model assigns each data point to an object (or the background), while the user corrects errors in the resulting segmentation and feeds them back into the model.
The current best practice formulates the problem as binary classification and segments objects one at a time. The model expects the user to provide \emph{positive clicks} to indicate regions wrongly assigned to the background and \emph{negative clicks} on regions wrongly assigned to the object.
Sequentially visiting objects is wasteful since it disregards synergies between objects:
a positive click for a given object can, by definition, serve as a negative click for nearby objects. Moreover, a direct competition between adjacent objects can speed up the identification of their common boundary.
We introduce AGILE3D, an efficient, attention-based model that
(1) supports simultaneous segmentation of multiple 3D objects,
(2) yields more accurate segmentation masks with fewer user clicks, and
(3) offers faster inference.
Our core idea is to encode user clicks as spatial-temporal queries and enable explicit interactions between click queries as well as between them and the 3D scene through a click attention module.
Every time new clicks are added, we only need to run a lightweight decoder that produces updated segmentation masks.
In experiments with four different 3D point cloud datasets,
AGILE3D sets a new state-of-the-art. Moreover, we also verify its practicality in real-world setups with real user studies. Project page: \href{https://ywyue.io/AGILE3D}{https://ywyue.io/AGILE3D}.

### Summary
The paper presents AGILE3D, the interactive 3D segmentation model that simultaneously segments multiple objects in context. The key idea is to use the attention-guided interactive 3D segmentation approach and also propose the click attention module to build the connection between different clicks, finally achieving multi-object segmentation via fast inference. The experimental results demonstrate and validate the proposed achievement of better performance on ScanNetV2 and outperform the competitive method InterObject3D.

### Strengths
1) The paper provides detailed information and resources about AGILE3D, allowing readers to gain a deeper understanding of the framework and its implementation.
2) The appendix includes additional materials such as network architecture, algorithms, and data samples, which further support the understanding and practical implementation of AGILE3D. The authors provide clear and detailed explanations of the concepts, algorithms, and techniques used in AGILE3D, ensuring that readers can follow and reproduce the framework effectively.

### Weaknesses
1) Lack of Novelty: For the proposed methods, the novel point is the multi-object segmentation, and the fast inference is also a novel point to some degree. And for efficiency, the submission does not present a technical point on how to improve efficiency. Multi-object segmentation is also achieved by the previous methods (InterObject3D) via some small improvements. Actually, the performance on the multi-object segmentation is not the best, according to Table 4.
2) Limited Evaluation: The appendix focuses more on providing information and supplementary materials than conducting extensive evaluations. A more thorough evaluation of the framework's performance and comparison with existing approaches would enhance the paper's credibility. The various datasets are also a strong evaluation, especially for the interactive tools. I suggest some results on the real captured and other challenging datasets should be presented in the paper.
3) The running time should be reported in a fair manner; for table 5, it is not clear how to perform the comparison since the manuscript claims efficiency as a contribution. Or, the user study is a good choice to compare the efficiency.
In some challenging cases, there are a lot of occlusions between the segmented object and other objects in the scene.
4) The significant difference between interobject3D and interobject3D++ should be discussed comprehensively since the published paper is very relative to the submission.
5) From Figure 1, the input only presents the XYZ + RGB, i.e., the point cloud and point color. Why does the visualization have the faces? Could you use the faces as extra information to enhance the performance of the proposed methods? From the interactive demo, there is still the face visualization.
6) The related works are very sparse, especially for the 3D instantce segmentations. I suggest the author refer to some surveys about the 3D segmentation and discuss more papers on it, especially for the pointnet and pointnet++.
7) For the comparison, it is not clear to me: Are the fewer user clicks the same for the different methods?
8) The failure cases and limitations are not discussed comprehensively in the submission; these parts are very important for the complete manuscripts, and some failure cases should be presented in the submission.

### Questions
The strengths of the paper lie in the comprehensive information provided, the inclusion of supplementary materials, and the thorough explanations. However, the lack of novelty, limited evaluation, and other weak issues Although the appendix serves its purpose as a resource for implementing AGILE3D, it does not significantly contribute to the field. Considering these strengths and weaknesses, I am negative about the submission currently, but I look forward to the response to the above questions.

### Summary
The paper introduces AGILE3D, an attention-guided interactive model for multi-object 3D segmentation. At its core, AGILE3D encodes user interactions as spatial-temporal queries, leveraging a unique click attention module to foster interplay between user-generated queries and the 3D scene. The model not only supports concurrent segmentation of multiple 3D entities but also champions efficiency, demanding fewer user inputs and providing swifter inference times. Comprehensive evaluations indicate its superiority over extant methods across both individual and multi-object interactive segmentation benchmarks.

### Strengths
- The proposed approach pioneers in the realm of interactive multi-object 3D segmentation by introducing an avant-garde attention-centric model.
- The real-world practicality of the proposed approach is convincing with achieving top-tier results on both the popular individual and multi-object interactive segmentation benchmarks, w.r.t. SOTA methods such as Mask3D. I also appreciate the detailed computational cost comparisons.
- AGILE3D's potential to discern multiple entities with diminished user interaction and expedited inference, vis-à-vis its counterparts, is empirically substantiated.
- The authors offer a cogent review of pertinent literature, spanning interactive 3D and image segmentation domains, accentuating their contribution's novelty.
- The user study with a proper interactive interface provides convincing signals for the superiority of the model.

### Weaknesses
 - Discussion of limitations/drawbacks should be put in the main body of the manuscript instead of the appendix for a fairer portrayal.
- More failure cases need to be showcased and analyzed if any, otherwise the paper seems to focus too much on the advantages of the presented method and does not always give the whole picture.

### Summary
The paper proposes a new model for interactive 3D object segmentation called AGILE3D, which firstly encodes points to features. Multiple user clicks are converted to high-dimension queries, then lightweight decoder is used to segment multiple objects concurrently in 3D scene. Experimental results partly demonstrate the effectiveness of AGILE3D compared to previous models.

### Strengths
1. The interactive approach AGLIE3D can segment multiple objects simultaneously with limited user clicks. Compared to previous single-object iterative models, the proposed approach can reduce annotation time.
2. Sufficient experiments have been conducted to show the promising results of the proposed method.

### Weaknesses
1. How does the model correct wrongly segmented object instance? For example, in Figure 6, if the initial segmentation wrongly groups two chairs into one instance, how can a later click fix this mistake?
2. In Table 9, results 2 and 7 show minor performance drops without the C2C attention and temporal encoding components. Does this indicates that modeling the relations between clicks is less important for the proposed method?
3. During training and testing, the clicks are sampled at the center of the object regions. Were there any ablation experiments done using other click sampling methods? How does the choice of click sampling influence performance?
