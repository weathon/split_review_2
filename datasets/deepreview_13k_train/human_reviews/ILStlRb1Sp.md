# Understanding the Mechanics and Dynamics of Memorisation in Large Language Models: A Case Study with Random Strings

- Decision: Reject
- Scores: 5, 6, 3, 5, 6

## Abstract
Understanding whether and to what extent large language models (LLMs) have memorised training data has important implications for the privacy of its training data and the reliability of its generated output. In this work, we focus on the more foundational question of how LLMs memorise training data. To this end, we systematically train LLMs of different sizes to memorise random token strings of different lengths and different entropies (i.e., sampled from different alphabet distributions) and study their ability to recall the strings. We observe many striking memorisation dynamics including (i) memorisation in phases with the alphabet distributions in the random strings being learnt before their relative positions in the string are memorised and (ii) memorisation in parts at the granularity of individual tokens, but not necessarily in the order in which they appear in the string. Next, we investigate memorisation mechanics by checking to what extent different parts of a token’s prefix in the string are necessary and sufficient to recollect the token. We leverage our insights to explain the dynamics of memorising strings and we conclude by discussing the implications of our findings for quantifying memorisation.

### Summary
This paper explores the dynamics and mechanics of memorization in causal LMs, where memorization is tested by finetuning pre-trained LMs on random strings. The main results are that (1) memorization occurs in two steps, first fitting to the bag-of-tokens distribution followed by fitting token position; (2) memorizing a token in a sequence doesn't depend on token position; (3) small local contexts are sufficient to greedily generate the memorized token; however, (4) long-range context needs to match the bag-of-words token distribution. Experiments span model sizes (140M -> 12B) and families (Pythia, GPT), as well as length, vocabulary size, and vocabulary entropy of the random string.

### Strengths
### Soundness
The methods proposed are technically sound and the results are interesting. The ablations on the influence of global context were well-crafted, where it is found that the token distribution in the global context is important for memorization.

### Presentation
Overall, the paper is written clearly with an easy-to-follow structure/organization, with some minor exceptions (see weaknesses).

### Significance
The methodological framework proposed, including analysis of local/global context, identifying phase transitions in learning, and analyzing order of token memorization, is interesting, easy-to-understand, and can help spark new research in this growing area. Even though the study is done on a very restricted setting, the results demonstrate the usefulness of the _methods_ at teasing apart different stages of memorization.

### Weaknesses
## Soundness
Several modeling choices could be better-motivated, and I was unclear on some conclusions. See detailed comments 2, especially 12, 13.

## Contribution
1. This paper explores memorization in a very restricted toy setting, which the authors allude to in the introduction. Despite motivating the work with applications to, e.g., privacy and factuality for __natural language__, all analysis is done on random strings, an extreme edge case. It is unclear whether the findings will generalize to structured natural language strings, as some results seem to rely on the randomness of the strings (detailed comments 3, 14, 18). Moreover, structured strings are not difficult to generate in a controlled manner using a probabilistic grammar (detailed comment 16). As the focus is on random strings over something more similar to natural language, it is unclear how useful the results are beyond the problem statement defined in the paper. This is my main reservation against acceptance.
2. Results could be better situated in past findings. For instance, Tirumala et al. (2020) also test the effect of model size and dataset size on memorization with similar results. See detailed comments 14, 18.

## Detailed Comments
1. __p1 last paragraph, end of p2:__ In Transformer interpretability literature, _mechanics/mechanistic_ often refers to "mechanistic interpretability", or analysis of how architecture internals like computational circuits lend to behavior. This work does not do that, so the naming may be confusing. Instead, the authors might want to consider diachrony/synchrony or dynamics/statics.
2. __p2 paragraph 1:__ "of different entropies (by sampling tokens at each position..." Larger vocabulary size naturally increases entropy-- to truly disentangle the effect of _entropy_, as suggested, it would be better to keep the same vocabulary size and modulate the token sampling distribution. Alternatively, remove the focus on entropy from this paragraph, replacing with, e.g. "of different vocabulary sizes, which also modulates token entropy, by sampling...".
3. __p2 paragraph 1:__ "Our choice of random strings to study memorisation is deliberate... cannot be explained by other factors such as learning rules of grammar or reasoning." Language Transformers in-the-wild are trained on natural language, which is governed by grammar. In the introduction, the paper's potential impact is framed in the context of naturalistic text (e.g., privacy, factuality, etc); however, this study is restricted to single random strings.
4. __Section 2.1:__ "To create a random string, we first choose an alphabet $A$ that consists of $|A| = l$ unique characters; we call $l$ the length of the alphabet. The alphabet we use for string generation is a subset of a much larger vocabulary of all tokens $V , A \subset V$ ." It is  confusing what a character is. This line implies the alphabet is a subset of tokens in the tokenizer vocabulary.
5. __Section 2.1 last parag:__ "This definition assumes that $\mathcal M$ predicts for position i the token with the largest $P_{\mathcal M}(s_i = t | s[1,i−1]))$." is redundant.
6. __Section 2.1 last parag:__ instead of defining a new term _plurality prediction_ (which is never used again in the article), I would suggest using _greedy prediction_ or _top prediction_ as commonly used in the literature.
7. __Section 2.2:__ "we enforce character-level tokenization... we keep the same subword vocabulary size as the original tokenizer, recognizing that it can impact memorization" This implies that all characters "a-z" are individual tokens in the vocabulary? Enforcing character-level tokenization is confusing given detailed comment 4: does the alphabet consist of individual characters like a-z or individual tokens in the tokenizer vocabulary?
8. __Paragraph Alphabets and string lengths:__ "we focus on alphabets $A$ with $l \in \{2, 4, 7, 13, 26\}$ using the first $l$ letters of the Latin lowercase alphabet, i.e. $A \subset \{a, . . . , z\}$. We generate random strings of lengths $n \in \{16, 32, 64, 128, . . . , 1024\}$." This can be moved earlier to Section 2.1 to improve clarity.
9. It would be nice to include __examples of the random strings.__
10. __Section 3.3:__ Only in the first parag of section 3.3 is it clear that the LM is only learning one string at a time. Ideally this should be made clear earlier in the paper.
11. __Figs. 3-5___ have GPT2-130M, __Figs 1,2,7__ have GPT2-140M.
12. At __position 0 in Fig. 5a__, the probability is also uniform. Is this given a `<BOS>` token? That is, the probability mass should be spread over the entire vocabulary space and should better reflect the first-token statistics of the pretraining data.
13. __Section 3.3:__ "we conclude that memorisation happens at the granularity of individual tokens and not entire strings." Is this surprising, given that training is via teacher-forcing on a token-level objective?
14. __Section 4.2:__ "at epoch 30 and later, the accuracy of short prefixes, which correspond to less than 5% and 10% of the total string length, is close 100%, which is also the performance of the full prefix when the model has converged. Thus, small local prefixes – much shorter than the entire string – are very effective at correctly recalling tokens." Is this surprising? If the string looks random, then a local prefix is sufficient, as the n-gram will have very low probability. Then, a local prefix will have high mutual information with the next token. This result may not generalize to structured strings containing highly predictable n-grams. This recalls Tirumala et al. (2022) finding that "highly informative" tokens such as numbers get memorized first.
15. __Fig. 8:__ Flesh out the caption to be standalone.
16. __Discussion:__ The discussion on generalising to non-random strings could be expanded. Virtually all applications of language Transformers apply to structured strings (natural language). E.g., rather than define the distribution over the _alphabet_, the distribution over strings can be defined using a _probabilistic grammar_.
17. __Discussion:__ "For instance, to infer whether a token string is a member of the training data, it may be sufficient to infer that some unique part of the string has been memorised." The results show that memorization happens on a token-by-token basis-- then, does token-level memorization really tell you anything about the string-level? E.g., if you prove that the word "The | `<BOS>`" has been memorized by the model, then does that prove that "The sky is blue" has been memorized?
18. The result that token positions are equally likely to be memorized first may also be a consequence of using random strings, as the n-gram probabilities are the same. As soon as you move to non-random strings, this result may break down due to the statistics of natural language. For instance, Tirumala et al. (2022) find differentiated memorization speed according to POS.

### Summary
This paper focuses on better understanding the mechanism of memorization in LLMs. Basically, the authors tested on tasks of memorizing different random token strings, and observed the dynamics and mechanics of memorization.

There are several interesting observations: 
* Memorization has two phases: (1) Guessing-Phase, and (2) Memorization-Phase. The first phase figures out which subset of the alphabet the target string contains. The second phase learns the conditional next-token probability to memorize the target string (within the subset chosen from the first phase)
* During the memorization-phase, memorisation happens at the granularity of individual tokens and not entire strings 
* The local context (small number of tokens in the target string) is sufficient to recollect a token at a given position

### Strengths
* It is focusing on a timely topic
* The empirical observation has interesting messages

### Weaknesses
 * It would be great if the authors explain how this observation can give some insight on the training strategy of LLMs. Currently, it looks like the paper has less practical impact.

### Summary
The authors propose to study the memorization of pre-trained LLMs on randomly generated strings. They propose to study the memorisation dynamic through training and the influence of the context required to elicit correct predictions. The conclusion of the study, for their very specific setting, is there's a guessing and a memorisation phase, that memorisation happens at token level in no particular order. Furthermore global context is not needed to be kept unchanged, but somehow needs to be preserved, and local context is sufficient.

### Strengths
- The paper proposes a toy setting that studies memorisation on LLMs. 
- The authors consider a good variety of toy experiments that inspect the training dynamics and the importance of the context
- The presentation is good

### Weaknesses
 - The results of the analysis may be of littler or no practical usefulness. While the definition of a toy distribution of random strings removes the issue of having to disentangle generalization and memorization, it is unclear to what extent the findings actually reflect real memorization phenomena. This is reflected in the discussions/and implications sections that actually poses the truly interesting questions the authors should have tried to address. 
- It would be good if the authors could provide at least a few experiments that correlate their findings on synthetic data with real data. 
- The fact models first go through a guessing phase and then start memorising the actual data is unsurprising 
- The fact local context is sufficient more than global context may solely depend on the fact the model is autoregressive.

### Questions
- The usage of the term dynamics is understandable, but why mechanics? The term may not be the best choice for the subject it refers to.
- Could the authors show experiments on context importance with models that are not autoregressive?
Regarding the discussion section, I would advise the authors to at least carry out some experiments they mention and would validate the usefulness of their analysis in practical settings: 
- It would be interesting to at least see some experiments performed on non-random strings or a mixture of random and non-random strings. In that case the random strings would act like canaries that can be more easily detected and cannot be generalised to.  
- It would be also more interesting to study whether the influence of global/and local prefixes in recollecting tokens actually does result in stronger reconstruction attacks as suggested. 
- On the conclusion that future measures of memorisation should focus on tokens, this may be an issue of the methodology proposed by the authors. That's also why it would be good to provide evidence that quantifying memorisation at higher granularity is not sufficient.

### Summary
The paper studies how memorization occurs in pre-trained language models. In particular, pre-trained LLMs are further trained to minimize cross-entropy on a dataset of randomly sampled strings, where each character in the string is independently sampled from some fixed alphabet. The main point is that, as these strings are random, vanishing cross-entropy loss can only be explained by memorization during this training, rather than generalizing grammar rules or having seen the string during pre-training. The main result of the paper is that memorization happens in two phases. First, the model learns the marginal distribution of characters in the random strings (i.e. learns the alphabet), and second the model memorizes the strings. The paper contains further results showing that local prefixes of smaller length than the full prefix are sufficient for reconstructing the character at a given position.

### Strengths
The paper clearly demonstrates that language models first memorize the token-wise (or in the case of this paper character-wise) marginal distribution before memorizing longer sequences. This gives a clear explanation of the mechanics and dynamics of memorization in transformers, at least for random strings.

### Weaknesses
It is quite unclear how practically relevant and/or surprising the observed phenomena are. For example, given $n$ random strings over an alphabet of size $l$, any fixed substring of length larger than $2\log_l n$ is sufficient to uniquely identify each string with good probability by the union bound over all pairs of strings. This is probably sufficient to explain the fact that short prefixes are enough for recovering memorized characters.

On the practical relevance front, the authors write "we argue that our findings call into question an implicit assumption made by existing studies: that memorisation can be reliably detected by checking if the full prefix up to some position in the string can correctly recollect the full suffix following the position (Biderman et al., 2023a)." I do not see how the results in the paper support such a claim. As far as I can tell, this claim is based on the fact that a model may do well at predicting the next token in a random string from a small alphabet by guessing based on having memorized the marginal distribution, even if it has not yet memorized the whole string. This seems unlikely to be the main source of memorization in practical circumstances, where the relevant alphabet size (i.e. number of possible tokens) is quite large. Furthermore, it doesn't even seem to correspond well with the claims in the paper itself, where it is shown that random strings from small alphabets take longer to fully memorize.

### Questions
It is possible I am misinterpreting/misunderstanding the main claims relating to the practical relevance of the results in the paper. Is there some more concrete explanation of how these results could inform measurements of memorization? Or more details on how existing measures are making unsupported or misleading assumptions about how memorization should be measured?

### Summary
This paper explores the mechanics and dynamics of memorization in large language models (LLMs) by training them to memorize random token strings of different lengths and entropies. The study reveals interesting memorization dynamics and investigates the mechanics of memorization, showing that both the local prefix and the global context play a role in token recollection and there is an interplay between them.

I enjoyed this paper. I have several questions in this paper. Overall, I think it is a good experimental design to check the memorization properties.

### Strengths
Some strengths of this study include the systematic approach to investigating the mechanics and dynamics of memorization in LLMs, the use of random strings of different lengths and entropies to test the models, and the insights gained into the role of local prefixes and global context in token recollection.

### Weaknesses
1) I'm curious if the findings of this paper are more indicative of the underlying structure of Language Models or their training dynamics. The experimental design is intriguing, but I couldn't help but notice that the dataset used doesn't seem to have the scale or correlated content typically associated with "internet-sized" datasets that are used to train Large Language Models (LLMs). Could the absence of such correlations and the relatively smaller dataset size potentially influence the study's outcomes? Specifically, the training regime of memorizing a single random string may not reflect the complex interplay of patterns and redundancies present in real-world training data. This raises questions about the generalizability of the observed memorization dynamics to scenarios involving more diverse and correlated datasets. It's possible that the isolated nature of the memorization task exaggerates certain aspects of the model's behavior, which might not be as pronounced when the model is exposed to a more realistic training distribution.

2) The paper provides valuable insights, but I wonder if the use of GPT-2, which is smaller than many current LLMs, fully captures the dynamics of "large" language models. While GPT-2 is certainly not a small model, especially when compared to older language models, it seems that the issue of memorization was not as prominent in those older models. Do you think incorporating both smaller and larger models in the study might strengthen the argument that these dynamics are specifically related to the scale of the model? In essence, if the model size does not significantly impact these dynamics within this range, should we still be referring to them in the context of "large" models? Furthermore, the paper should explore whether the observed memorization behavior scales predictably with model size or if there are critical size thresholds where these dynamics become significantly more pronounced. This could involve a more granular analysis of the relationship between model capacity and memorization efficiency.
