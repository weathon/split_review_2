## Abstract
Imitation learning (IL) enables agents to mimic expert behaviors. Most previous IL techniques focus on precisely imitating one policy through mass demonstrations. However, in many applications, what humans require is the ability to perform various tasks directly through a few demonstrations of corresponding tasks, where \textit{the agent would meet many unexpected changes when deployed}. In this scenario, the agent is expected to not only imitate the demonstration but also adapt to unforeseen environmental changes. This motivates us to propose a new topic called imitator learning (ItorL), which aims to derive an imitator module that can \textit{on-the-fly} reconstruct the imitation policies based on very \textit{limited} expert demonstrations for different unseen tasks, without any extra adjustment. In this work, we focus on imitator learning based on only one expert demonstration. To solve ItorL, we propose Demo-Attention Actor-Critic (DAAC), which integrates IL into a reinforcement-learning paradigm that can regularize policies' behaviors in unexpected situations. Besides, for autonomous imitation policy building, we design a demonstration-based attention architecture for imitator policy that can effectively output imitated actions by adaptively tracing the suitable states in demonstrations. We develop a new navigation benchmark and a robot environment for \topic and show that DAAC outperforms previous imitation methods \textit{with large margins} both on seen and unseen tasks.

### Confidence
3: You are fairly confident in your assessment. It is possible that you did not understand some parts of the submission or that you are unfamiliar with some pieces of related work. Math/other details were not carefully checked.

### Summary
This paper proposes the problem called “Imitator learning”, where agents learn from demonstration trajectory. The paper subsequently proposes “DAAC”, reweighting actions from the demonstration trajectory.

### Strengths
- The paper is well motivated

### Weaknesses
 - I am not sure whether the newly proposed “Imitator learning” is unique. It seems to me that the problem setup is within the definition of few-shot imitation learning or meta learning.
- Writing: the definitions and propositions in section 2.2 do not add value. They do not offer insights and are purely definitions. It seems to be that the entire section 2.2 can be replaced with one sentence: “we train a goal-conditioned policy”.
- The proposed method is only tested on a simple maze-like environment. I would like to see evaluations on more mainstream control benchmarks, such as DMC [1] or robosuite [2].
- More baselines from IL methods. Such as GAIL [3] or SQIL [4].

### Summary
This paper proposes a new topic named imitator learning (ItorL), requiring to on-the-fly reconstruct the imitation policies based on very limited expert demonstrations for different unseen tasks. To achieve such out-of-the-box imitation capability, the authors propose a context-based imitation learning architecture Demo-Attention Actor-Critic (DAAC), which conditions on a single expert demo. The method gets good one-short imitation performance on navigation and manipulation tasks.

### Strengths
1.	Authors study an interesting topic since one-shot and out-of-the-box imitation learning is appealing and challenging.

2.	The proposed method is well-motivated and the designed attention architecture makes sense.

3.	The experiment results look good.

### Weaknesses
1.	The setting is unclear. Because the proposed demonstration-based attention architecture fundamentally is to retrieve a nearest neighbor state in the expert demonstration $ \tau_{\omega_{test}}$ , this method is based on an assumption that the rollout states $\tau_{agent}$ are covered by the training or context trajectories. Though it is also mentioned in Appendix F, there is no corresponding assumption in the task formulation section. I think this is an essential problem and is necessary to make an accurate formulation in Section2.1. This assumption narrows the application in more complex scenarios and makes it not a real out-of-the-box imitation method.

2.	I think the setting and proposed architecture are very similar to Mandi et al.[1]. Would you please clarify the differences and the reason why you don’t compare with it?

3.	The problem setting is very similar to some Inverse RL works (e.g., GAIL[2] and ROT[3]), i.e., requiring expert demos and online interaction. Especially, in ROT experiments, it also performs well with only a single expert demo.

### Summary
This paper poses the "Imitator Learning" problem, wherein the goal is to learn a policy that can reconstruct expert policies given a small number of demonstrations on unseen tasks. The "Demo-Attention Actor-Critic" (DAAC) algorithm is proposed, which uses uses context-based meta-RL with an imitator reward. The imitator reward is based on a heuristic measure of similarity to expert state-action pairs. The proposed architecture uses an attention mechanism which computes attention scores between the current state and the states in the demonstrations, and it is argued that this provides implicit regularization of the policy behavior. Results are shown in maze environments where global map information is not known, as well as state-based robot manipulation tasks.

### Strengths
- This paper addresses an interesting problem coined "imitator learning" in which an agent is trained on an offline dataset of demonstrations for various tasks that have some shared structure. At test time, the agent receives a small number of demonstrations and the goal is for the agents to mimic the experts without fine-tuning. The problem/approach includes aspects similar to meta-RL, meta-IL, online imitation learning, and IRL but the precise problem statement seems to be original.
- The authors provide ablations of their proposed reward function and architecture and show that both components are useful for performance. The authors also include results on scaling trends.
- The paper has a thorough account of implementation and environment details in the appendix which is helpful for reproducibility.

### Weaknesses
 - The assumption that tasks must be in a tracebackable MDP set seems to be a bit limiting. It would be useful to provide examples of what types of environments this assumption holds in and what the limitations are of this assumption. For example, it seems that this assumption may not hold in a variety of robotic manipulation tasks where some subtasks may be irreversible. The requirement that a policy exists to return to states in the demonstration trajectory is a strong constraint that may not be realistic in many complex environments, especially those with irreversible actions or stochastic transitions. This limits the applicability of the proposed method to a specific subset of problems.

- The proposed imitator reward (a) relies on a distance function between states (which could be hard to scale meaningfully to high-dimensional observations) and (b) has several heuristic components and hyperparameters to tune. The reliance on a state distance function is problematic as it requires a meaningful metric in the state space, which can be difficult to define for high-dimensional observations such as images or complex robot configurations. Furthermore, the heuristic nature of the reward function, with its multiple hyperparameters, makes it difficult to analyze theoretically and may lead to brittle performance across different tasks.

- Related to the above point: One concern is that the method (including architecture and the reward mechanism) might not generalize well to other tasks, since there are multiple moving parts and hyperparameters to tune. Have the authors looked into testing on existing meta-RL benchmark suites (e.g. Meta-World)? The complexity of the proposed method, with its attention mechanism and heuristic reward function, raises concerns about its generalizability. The numerous components and hyperparameters could lead to overfitting on the training tasks and poor performance on unseen environments. Testing on established meta-RL benchmarks would provide a more rigorous evaluation of the method's robustness.

- The demonstration-based attention architecture relies on performing attention between the demonstration states and the current state. As the authors briefly mention, there are issues with this approach when the demonstration states are faraway from the current state. It does seems quite possible that faraway states may be encountered (e.g. due to compounding error, exploration, etc.) The attention mechanism, while potentially useful for aligning the current state with the demonstration trajectory, is susceptible to issues when the current state is far from any demonstration state. This could occur due to compounding errors in the policy or during exploration, leading to potentially unstable behavior.

- I think the paper could be organized a bit better overall, and a variety of important details are left to the Appendix. For example, it would be good to include more discussion of related work in the main paper, especially comparisons to online imitation, few-shot imitation, meta-RL, meta-imitation learning etc. when defining the imitator problem.

### Questions
I have included some questions above in the Weaknesses section and additional questions below.

- Could the authors please elaborate on the following claim: "we also observe that just regarding demonstrations as context vectors are inefficient in fully mining the knowledge implied in these data efficiently, e.g., the demonstration sequence not only tells the agent which task to accomplish but the way to accomplish the task" --> Could the authors elaborate on the evidence for this and what exactly the problem is? Further, could the authors provide evidence that using the attention network is an effective policy regularizer? It seems that this regularization term would also be pushing the behavior to the "way the task was accomplished" according to the expert.

- Each iteration of the algorithm requires running SAC to update the task-information extractor/context-based policy, which could be costly. Could the authors please provide details on how costly the algorithm is to run?

- As the authors mention, DAAC's performance is limited in scenarios where the ground truth state is not available. Could the authors describe where the algorithm fails in partially-observed scenarios?

### Strengths
1. The paper is generally well written and easy to follow.
2. The experiments in this paper are sufficient and convincing to reflect the advantages of the proposed method.
3. The imitator learning proposed in this paper is interesting and meets the requirements of practical applications better compared with conventional imitation learning. Especially, I believe the *out-of-box* adapting ability which no more needs further fine-tuning is exactly what we need to utilizing reinforcement learning in practice. Therefore, I think this paper can encourage more exploration works along this meaningful direction.

### Weaknesses
1. Some figures need to be improved, like Figure 4. Some texts in this figure exceed the maze boundaries and some texts overlap with the walls in the maze. I suggest using the figure legend to replace the texts in the figure.
2. It will be better if some theoretical guarantees for the imtation ability of the propose method can be provided.
3. The imitator reward design in Equ. 1 is heuristic and may lack the enough abillity to generalize to more complex or high-dimensional environments.
4. The authors are expected to elaborate more on the difference between the imitator learning and the meta reinforcement learning.

### Questions
1. The authors are encouraged to discuss more on if the handcrafted imitator reward design will limit the ability of the imitator module, though this module design itself is very creative. 
2. The authores are expected to elaborate more on the ability of the proposed method on high-dimensional input environments, like Atari Games.
3. It will be much better if the authors can bring more thoughts/ideas on how to design an unified imitator reward or an automatic imitator reward producer according to specific environments.
